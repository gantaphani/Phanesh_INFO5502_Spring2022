the plaintiffs in this action,group,llc,and ellicott square court corporation,were,respectively,the owner of and construction manager for a commercial building in buffalo,new york.they contracted with a third firm,ellicott maintenance,for the building partial interior demolition.
the construction agreement between the plaintiffs and ellicott maintenance required the latter to secure insurance to cover the former for any legal liability arising out of the demolition project.ellicott maintenance therefore purchased two primary,the other umbrella from the defendant mountain valley indemnity company.the defendant,by its agent lrmp,issued a certificate of insurance evidencing the policies and the status of the plaintiffs as additional insureds,after receipt of which ellicott maintenance began the demolition work.
the primary insurance policy required that the underlying written construction agreement between the named insured,ellicott maintenance,and the additional insureds,the plaintiffs in this action,be executed in order for any injury for which the plaintiffs sought defense and indemnification to be covered by the policy.before anyone on behalf of either ellicott maintenance or the plaintiffs signed the construction agreement,a worker on the demolition project was injured.when the worker brought suit in new york state court in an attempt to recover for his injuries,the plaintiffs sought defense and indemnification from the defendant insurance company.the defendant declined coverage,arguing that because the construction agreement was neither signed on behalf of the parties nor fully performed prior to the worker injury,it had not been executed under the primary insurance policy issued by the defendant to ellicott maintenance,and therefore the plaintiffs did not qualify as additional insureds under either of the policies.the plaintiffs then brought this action in the united states district court for the western district of new york seeking a declaratory judgment to the contrary.
the district court william skretny,chief judge agreed with the plaintiffs,concluding that the construction agreement was executed even though it had not been signed or fully performed,and that the plaintiffs therefore were entitled to coverage under both the primary and the umbrella policies.the court also decided that even if the plaintiffs were not entitled to coverage under the terms of the policies,the defendant was estopped from denying coverage because its agent had issued a certificate of insurance to ellicott maintenance that listed the plaintiffs as additional insureds.the defendant appeals.
we disagree with the district court view that under new york law,a contract has been executed despite the absence of either a signature by or on behalf of both parties or full performance.therefore,under its terms,the primary insurance policy additional insured coverage did not become effective prior to the accident in question.we conclude,however,that the plaintiffs nonetheless were covered under the terms of the umbrella policy because that policy did not require execution of an underlying written agreement to take effect.
new york intermediate appellate courts are divided as to whether,despite the fact that an insurance policy coverage is not in effect under its express terms,a certificate of insurance issued by an agent of the insurer nonetheless may estop the insurer from denying coverage to a party identified as an additional insured on the certificate,even where the certificate contains various disclaimers,such as that it is for informational purposes only.we therefore certify the following question to the new york court of appeals 
in a case brought against an insurer in which a plaintiff seeks a declaration that it is covered under an insurance policy issued by that insurer,does a certificate of insurance issued by an agent of the insurer that states that the policy is in force but also bears language that the certificate is not evidence of coverage,is for informational purposes only,or other similar disclaimers,estop the insurer from denying coverage under the policy 
background 
the defendant mountain valley indemnity company mountain valley issued a commercial general liability insurance policy,effective march,to march,the primary policy to ellicott maintenance,a general contractor in buffalo,new york as amended by an endorsement,the primary policy covered not only ellicott maintenance but also any person or organization with whom ellicott maintenance agreed,because of a written contract,to provide insurance such as is afforded under the primary policy,but only with respect to liability arising out of ellicott maintenance operations,and only when the written contract or agreement between ellicott maintenance and the additional insured ha d been executed prior to the bodily injury.mountain valley indemnity.commercial policy,issued to ellicott maintenance,liability extension endorsement,decl.of katherine fijal in supp.of mountain valley mot.for summ.fijal decl.ex,ellicott square court mountain valley indem,june.the primary policy limited mountain valley liability to one million dollars per occurrence of bodily injury,and defined occurrence to mean an accident 
in addition to the primary policy,mountain valley issued to ellicott maintenance an umbrella policy the umbrella policy bearing the same effective dates as the primary policy.the umbrella policy limited mountain valley liability per occurrence to two million dollars in excess of the coverage provided by the primary policy and stipulated that the umbrella policy general aggregate limit for each annual period was two million dollars.like the primary policy,the umbrella policy guaranteed coverage for bodily injury resulting from an occurrence,which it defined as an accident,and extended coverage to additional insureds with whom ellicott maintenance had agreed in writing prior to any injury to provide insurance such as is afforded by the umbrella policy.mountain valley indem.commercial umbrella policy no,issued to ellicott maintenance,at,fijal decl.ex.k the umbrella policy.unlike the primary policy,the umbrella policy did not provide that its coverage of additional insureds was effective only if the written agreement between ellicott maintenance and any additional insureds had been executed.
on or about august,ellicott maintenance contracted with plaintiffs group,llc,and ellicott square court corporation ellicott development company edc,to perform interior demolition work at the graystone building in buffalo,new york,owned by plaintiff group,and managed by edc.the agreement between ellicott maintenance and the plaintiffs the construction agreement obligated ellicott maintenance to procure insurance coverage protecting both itself and the plaintiffs against claims by employees or subcontractors for,inter alia,damages resulting from bodily injury.the construction agreement required that the insurance be primary,rather than concurrent with or secondary to the owner own liability insurance,that it provide coverage of no less than five million dollars and that ellicott maintenance obtain,prior to the commencement of work,certificates of insurance naming the plaintiffs as additional insureds.agreement for construction,dated,at,fijal decl.ex.no one signed the construction agreement on behalf of either the plaintiffs or ellicott maintenance until september.
some three weeks earlier,on august,mountain valley agent,lrmp,had issued a certificate of insurance the coi identifying mountain valley as the issuer of the primary policy and the umbrella policy,ellicott maintenance as the named insured,and the plaintiffs as additional insured with respect to project graystone.certificate of liability insurance,dated august,fijal decl.ex.l.the coi listed the limits of liability described million dollars per occurrence under the primary policy and two million dollars under the umbrella policy.the following language appeared in the upper quadrant of the front of the coi this certificate is issued as a matter of information only and confers no rights upon the certificate holder.this certificate does not amend,extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies below.id.capitalization in original.the coi also provided that the insurance afforded by the policies described herein is subject to all the terms,exclusions and conditions of such policies.id.capitalization in original.the reverse side of the coi bore similar language under the heading disclaimer the certificate of insurance does not constitute a contract between the issuing insurer and the certificate holder,nor does it affirmatively or negatively amend,extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies listed thereon.id.ellicott maintenance began work the day after it received the coi.
on september,three days before ellicott maintenance owner theodore dirienzo and edc owner carl paladino signed the construction agreement on behalf of the parties to it,david delprince,an employee of s a rubbish and debris subcontractor hired by ellicott injured when a roof collapsed at the graystone site.
the plaintiffs notified mountain valley agent,lrmp,of delprince injury and potential claim by letter dated october,requesting that mountain valley defend and indemnify them in any suit brought by delprince.some six months later,by letter dated april,mountain valley informed the plaintiffs that it would not defend or indemnify them because,inasmuch as the construction agreement had not been signed on behalf of the parties before delprince was injured,there was not in existence on the date of loss a written contract executed prior to the bodily injury,as required by the terms of the primary policy.letter from susan gabriele to ellicott square court,dated april,app.to pls.local statement of material facts in supp.of pls.mot.for summ.ex,ellicott square court mountain valley indem,june.the letter further stated that even if the plaintiffs qualified as additional insureds under the primary policy as of the date of the accident,mountain valley would deny coverage because the plaintiffs had failed to timely notify mountain valley of delprince injury and possible claim,as required by the primary policy.
delprince filed suit against edc,group,and ellicott maintenance in new york state supreme court,erie county,on october,alleging negligence and violations of the new york labor law,and seeking to recover damages for the injuries he sustained 
the plaintiffs filed this declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the western district of new york on january.they alleged that they were additional insureds under the primary policy and therefore were entitled to coverage by mountain valley in delprince suit.the plaintiffs further alleged that the coi bound mountain valley to provide coverage despite the absence of a signed agreement between edc and ellicott maintenance.finally,the plaintiffs alleged that mountain valley should be precluded from relying on the defense of untimely notice because mountain valley response disclaiming coverage was itself untimely.the plaintiffs later amended their complaint to add a claim alleging entitlement to indemnification and defense as additional insureds under the terms of the umbrella policy.
the district court richard arcara,referred the case to magistrate judge leslie foschio.in june,the parties brought for summary judgment before the magistrate judge.mountain valley motion principally relied on the same arguments made in its april letter to the plaintiffs disclaiming coverage.mountain valley also argued that it was not bound by the umbrella policy because the construction agreement required that the insurance provided to the plaintiffs be primary,and the umbrella policy was secondary and the umbrella policy was subject to all the limitations of the primary policy,including the execution requirement,and that because the construction agreement was not executed before delprince injury,the plaintiffs we re not insureds on the underlying insurance and we re not insureds under the umbrella policy.mem.of law in supp.of mountain valley indem.mot.for summ.at,ellicott square court mountain valley indem,june,see umbrella policy at.in support of their,the plaintiffs contended that even though the construction agreement had not been signed on behalf of the parties at the time of the accident,it nonetheless had been executed for purposes of the primary policy because of the parties partial performance and because the parties to the contract understood its signing to be ministerial.the plaintiffs further argued that even if the agreement had not been executed,the coi bound mountain valley to provide coverage under the primary policy because mountain valley authorized representative represented that such coverage was in place.mem.of law in supp.of pls.mot.for summ.at,ellicott square court mountain valley indem,june.finally,the plaintiffs argued that the umbrella policy own blanket additional insured provision entitled them to that policy coverage.
in a report and recommendation the r r,ellicott square court mountain valley indem,the magistrate judge recommended denying mountain valley motion for summary judgment and granting the plaintiffs with regard to whether the construction agreement was executed,the magistrate judge concluded that in light of common speech and the reasonable expectations of a businessperson and because mountain valley,as the drafter of the policy,could have used the term signed if it had intended to require a term executed as used in the primary policy should not be interpreted to require the parties signatures to trigger coverage under that policy.r r at.on the question of whether the plaintiffs were entitled to coverage based on the coi,the magistrate judge recommended finding that the coi incorporated the terms of the primary and umbrella policies.relying on niagara mohawk power skibeck pipeline,dep t,the magistrate judge found that mountain valley agent,acting within the scope of its authority,issued the certificate of insurance naming the plaintiffs as additional insureds,upon which the plaintiffs were entitled to rely,regardless of the absence of a signing of the construction contract at that time.r r at.the magistrate judge therefore recommended estopping mountain valley from denying coverage to the plaintiffs.finally,the magistrate judge rejected mountain valley argument that the plaintiffs had not provided timely notice of delprince injury

ii.execution of the construction agreement 
the plaintiffs argue,and the district court concluded,that although no one on behalf of them or ellicott maintenance had signed the construction agreement before delprince was injured,the contract nevertheless was executed for purposes of the primary policy.we disagree.
we must give unambiguous provisions of an insurance contract their plain and ordinary meaning.essex ins.laruccia,dep t internal quotation marks omitted.we can not disregard the plain meaning of the policy language in order to find an ambiguity where none exists.empire fire marine ins.eveready ins,dep t.
i t is common practice for the courts of this state to refer to the dictionary to determine the plain and ordinary meaning of words to a contract.mazzola cnty.of suffolk,dep t citation omitted.the new york court of appeals recently did just that in determining the meaning of new york state statutory language.giordano market,wl,lexis,at,adopting a dictionary definition of the word latent for purposes of.
black law dictionary defines executed as.of a document that has been signed.that has been done,given,or performed executed consideration.black law dictionary ed a note to the definition warns that t he term executed is a slippery word a contract is frequently said to be executed when the document has been signed,or has been signed,sealed,and delivered.further,by executed contract is frequently meant one that has been fully performed by both parties.id.quoting william anson,principles of the law of contract arthur corbin,am.ed brackets and internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis in original.
new york courts employ the standard indicated by the definition in black,requiring that a contract be either signed or fully performed before it can be considered executed for example,in burlington insurance utica first insurance,d,dep t a case with facts remarkably similar to those of the case before us,a construction manager contracted with a subcontractor to perform work at a site in manhattan.the agreement was memorialized in a purchase order that required the subcontractor to obtain insurance in specified minimum amounts,and to name the construction manager as an additional insured on the certificate of insurance.id.at,at.the policy additional insured endorsement provided,inter alia,that the written contract or agreement between the manager and subcontractor had to be c urrently in effect or becoming effective during the terms of this policy and e xecuted prior to the bodily injury or personal injury.id.at,at.
before the purchase order was signed on behalf of either party,and before work at the site was completed,a man was injured when he fell through a sidewalk cellar door at the construction site.id.the injured man filed a personal injury action against the construction manager and the subcontractor,both of whom in turn sought coverage from the defendant insurance company.id.the defendant declined coverage on the ground that the construction manager was not an additional insured pursuant to the terms of the policy additional insured endorsement because the purchase order was not signed at the time of the underlying plaintiff alleged injury and,therefore,had not been executed as of that time,as required by the endorsement.id.the plaintiffs argued that the contract had been executed by virtue of their partial performance of their duties thereunder.
the appellate division,second department,agreed with the insurer,concluding that the defendant demonstrated that the contract was not executed at the time of the alleged accident since it was both unsigned and had not been fully performed at that time.id.at,at.the court found no support for the plaintiffs contention that the condition in the additional insured endorsement that the contract be executed prior to the bodily injury or personal injury could be satisfied by partial performance.id.
in this case,the plaintiffs assert that although the construction agreement was not signed,the underlying contract requiring ellicott maintenance to procure insurance had been fully performed in that ellicott maintenance had obtained insurance in favor of group by purchasing policies with a blanket additional insured endorsement,and delivered proof of coverage in the form of the coi.appellees br.but the construction agreement was not comprised of many individual contracts,as the plaintiffs argument implies.rather,fulfilling the insurance procurement provision constituted partial performance of the construction of one of the duties required of ellicott maintenance thereunder.and as the district court correctly noted,partial performance does not constitute execution.
the plaintiffs also argue that burlington appears to be premised on a legal fallacy,appellees br,that the second department acknowledgment that the word executed can have more than one meaning can not be reconciled with its conclusion that this does not render the contract uncertain or ambiguous,burlington,at,at internal quotation marks omitted.but the burlington court concluded that the contract before it had not been executed because it had neither been signed nor fully performed.therefore,neither method of execution had been met.id.at,at.one can not conclude from the fact that a contract requirement can be satisfied in more than one way that the contract for that reason alone lack s a definite and precise meaning.sus,paul travelers,dep t.neither does it render the term ambiguous,nor create a triable issue of material fact.
because new york law unambiguously requires either the signing of a contract or its full performance for it to be executed within the meaning of an insurance policy requiring such prior execution,and because neither occurred here,the construction agreement was not executed as of the date of delprince injury.the district court finding that it was and its conclusion that for that reason the primary policy was in effect at the time of the accident,are therefore in error.
iii.estoppel under the certificate of insurance 
the plaintiffs contend that mountain valley is nonetheless estopped from denying coverage to the plaintiffs under the primary because mountain valley agent issued,and the plaintiffs relied upon,the coi.the district court agreed.new york intermediate appellate courts are divided on the question.
new york contract law instructs that,as a general matter,a certificate of insurance is merely evidence of a contract for insurance,not conclusive proof that the contract exists,and not,in and of itself,a contract to insure.horn maint.aetna cas.sur,dep t see also sevenson envtl,sirius am.ins,dep t tribeca broadway,llc mount vernon fire ins,dep t.while a certificate may be sufficient to raise an issue of fact on summary judgment,it is not sufficient,standing alone,to prove coverage as a matter of law.id.
however,the third and fourth departments have held that a certificate of insurance can estop an insurance provider from denying coverage where the parties intended to provide coverage to the party seeking it if the certificate was issued by an agent within the scope of its authority,and if the party seeking coverage reasonably relied on the certificate of insurance by,for example,beginning construction work.see niagara mohawk power skibeck pipeline,dep t concluding that insurer was bound by certificate of insurance listing the plaintiff as an additional insured,even though another certificate,under which the plaintiff sought coverage,did not list the plaintiff bucon.ass ins,dep t estopping the defendant insurer from denying coverage to the plaintiff where the plaintiff reasonably relied on a certificate of insurance in commencing construction work.but the second department has declined to conclude that an insurer was estopped from denying coverage to a party that was erroneously named on a certificate of insurance.see am.of hempstead res.recycling,dep t rejecting estoppel arising from a certificate of insurance where the certificate stated that it was a matter of information only and confer red no rights upon the plaintiff,and holding that the doctrine of estoppel may not be invoked to create coverage where none exists under the policy the first department,too,has been reluctant to find estoppel based on a certificate of insurance.see nicotra,llc am.safety indem,dep t nor did the certificate of insurance confer additional insured status.rodless,westchester fire ins,dep t we agree that since the certificate of insurance was issued as a matter of information only it is neither proof of insurance nor proof of an oral contract.moleon kreisler borg florman constr,dep t deciding,without reference to estoppel,that certificate of insurance is insufficient to establish that the plaintiff is an additional insured under a policy especially where,as here,the policy itself makes no provision for coverage.
there is reason to conclude that the primary,ellicott bear the burden of ensuring that all the conditions of providing additional insured status to those with whom it contracts to provide that status have been met.at oral argument,counsel for both sides acknowledged that it is not customary for an insurer or for the insurer agent to see the contract ostensibly requiring a contractor to procure insurance rather,a certificate of insurance naming the additional insured is issued as a matter of course upon the request of the primary insured.nor is there evidence in the record of which we are aware that the plaintiffs ever saw the policy issued to ellicott maintenance,or that a party in the plaintiffs position would typically see such a policy.the additional insureds did not have a relationship with the insurer that would have given them the right to obtain or question the accuracy of a certificate of insurance.it is,after all,the primary insured which has explicitly agreed to the execution of the underlying contract as a condition of coverage for additional insureds,which has the ability to seek to obtain that execution prior to the beginning of work pursuant to the contract,and which is otherwise best positioned to assure compliance with the conditions of its insurance.
on the other hand,there is a reasonable argument to be made that,disclaimers notwithstanding,an insurer has an obligation not to issue false or potentially misleading certificates of to permit an agent to issue it or the agent is aware the parties may rely upon the certificate despite disclaimers to the contrary.a n estoppel rests upon the word or deed of one party upon which another party rightfully relies and so relying changes his position to his injury.nassau trust montrose concrete prods,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.that formulation may well correctly describe the facts here.moreover,insurers typically have greater control over the terms of insurance contracts and certificates of insurance than their insureds,along with greater knowledge of the applicable law estoppel therefore may be appropriate for much the same reason that ambiguities in insurance contracts are construed against insurers.thomas lipton,liberty mut.ins.and such a distribution of responsibility may be particularly appropriate in cases,such as this one,where enforcement of the certificate of insurance would not expand the substantive scope of the insurance contemplated by the insurer,but would instead require the insurer to provide the coverage to which the certificate of insurance states it has agreed.see bucon,at,at.
in any event,in light of this diversity of authority among the appellate divisions,and of the underlying policy choices involved,on what we think to be a significant issue of state law,and acknowledging the absence of guidance from the court of appeals,we respectfully certify to the court the following question 
in a case brought against an insurer in which a plaintiff seeks a declaration that it is covered under an insurance policy issued by that insurer,does a certificate of insurance by an agent of the insurer that states that the policy is in force but also bears language that the certificate is not evidence of coverage,is for informational purposes only,or other similar disclaimers,estop the insurer from denying coverage under the policy 
iv.coverage under the umbrella policy 
the plaintiffs argue that even if they are not covered as additional insureds under the primary policy,they are covered under the umbrella policy mountain valley responds that the umbrella policy is limited by the same unfulfilled execution requirement as the primary policy.a finding that the plaintiffs were covered by the umbrella policy,mountain valley asserts,would constitute an expansion in coverage in contravention of new york law.we agree with the plaintiffs.
section c of the umbrella policy provides any person or organization with whom or with which you have agreed in writing prior to any loss,occurrence,or offense to provide insurance such as is afforded by this policy is an insured fijal decl.ex.k at c.pursuant to section d,each person or organization who is an insured in the underlying insurance is an insured under this insurance subject to all the limitations of such underlying insurance other than the limits of the underlying insurer liability.id.d.
we conclude that section c renders the plaintiffs insureds under the umbrella policy.the policy requires no more than an agreement in writing.the new york court of appeals ha s long held that a contract may be valid even if it is not signed by the party to be charged,provided its subject matter does not implicate a statute that imposes such a requirement.flores lower side serv.a n unsigned contract may be enforceable,provided there is objective evidence establishing that the parties intended to be bound.id.at,at.
it is undisputed that the parties intended to be bound by the construction agreement irrespective of whether and when it was signed.under new york law,it was therefore a binding agreement prior to its execution.and it is indisputable that under that agreement,the general contractor was to procure insurance for the plaintiffs.nor is there any issue as to the construction agreement requirement that ellicott maintenance obtain aggregate insurance coverage for at least five million dollars,and that the primary policy had a general aggregate limit of two million dollars.
mountain valley argues that the construction agreement did not require insurance such as is afforded by the umbrella policy because the agreement required that ellicott maintenance insurance be in the form of a primary policy.but the agreement required only that ellicott maintenance policy be primary in relation to the plaintiffs own policies rather than concurrent with them.fijal decl.ex.g at a.
mountain valley also contends that because the construction agreement did not refer explicitly to umbrella coverage,it did not require ellicott maintenance to provide such insurance as is afforded by the umbrella policy.appellant reply.br.at.we find no language in the umbrella policy to require such specificity.
notwithstanding section c,mountain valley argues that the plaintiffs do not qualify as additional insureds because,under section d,the umbrella policy is subject to all the limitations of the primary policy.we need not resolve whether the primary policy execution requirement would preclude the plaintiffs from receiving coverage under section d of the umbrella policy,because the plaintiffs are eligible for coverage pursuant to section c irrespective of the effectiveness of the primary policy.sections c and d of the umbrella policy,which define who is an insured,provide alternative grounds rather than compound requirements for qualification as an additional insured.we will not read and into the policy to conclude that the plaintiffs must qualify as insureds under both section c and section d.if they come within the terms of either,they are insureds.c ourts may not by construction add or excise terms under the guise of interpreting the writing.teddy bear madison realty,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore conclude that mountain valley is bound to provide coverage to the plaintiffs under section c of the umbrella policy.
although our conclusion rests on a ground not considered by the district court,we may affirm a decision on any grounds supported in the record,even if it is not one on which the trial court relied.thyroff nationwide mut.ins,cir.we do so here.
