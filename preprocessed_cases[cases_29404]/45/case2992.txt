introduction 
the primary issue raised on this appeal is one of insurance coverage.liberty mutual fire insurance company liberty issued two policies to michael mckenzie mckenzie.each required that the insured own the covered vehicle.neither policy defined owned.mckenzie submitted claims on each policy based upon the theft of his truck.it is undisputed that the stolen vehicle was designated as the insured vehicle and that mckenzie had paid the policies premiums.it is also undisputed that liberty subsequently learned that a month before the theft,mckenzie had filed a transfer of title document with the department of motor vehicles dmv ostensibly transferring title of the insured vehicle to his already deceased father.after filing that transfer document,mckenzie retained use and possession of the vehicle.see fn,infra.
liberty filed a declaratory relief action to determine coverage and to recapture money already paid to mckenzie.the nub of liberty position was that because mckenzie had transferred title to his deceased father,he mckenzie no longer owned the vehicle within the meaning of the policies and therefore was not entitled to coverage.mckenzie filed a for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the trial court ultimately entered summary judgment in favor of liberty on both pleadings.
mckenzie appeal primarily challenges the grant of summary judgment.we first find the trial court erred when it concluded mckenzie no longer possessed an insurable interest in the vehicle because of his purported transfer of title to his deceased father.this conclusion was error because an inter vivos transfer to a dead person can not and does not transfer title.in light of that legal conclusion and the other relevant facts neither policy defined owned,the stolen truck was the insured vehicle,mckenzie had paid the required premiums,and mckenzie retained exclusive possession of the truck and continued to use it after he transferred title to his father,we agree with mckenzie that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether he was entitled to coverage.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment.
secondarily,mckenzie appeal challenges a sanctions award imposed on him and his attorney during the pretrial litigation pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the court imposed sanctions because mckenzie,in contravention of law,had named a claims adjuster employed by liberty as a in his.mckenzie claims the award was improper because he had dismissed the claims adjuster from the pleading within the safe harbor provision of the statute.we find no merit to the claim because mckenzie failed to give timely notice of the dismissal to liberty.we therefore affirm the sanctions order.
factual and procedural background 
as gleaned from the evidence produced during the defense motions for summary adjudication of issues and summary judgment,the pertinent facts are undisputed and are the following.
for several years prior to,mckenzie worked as a distributor for mac tools,selling tools to automotive and truck mechanics within a geographic location designated by mac tools.mckenzie purchased the tools from mac tools,and resold them to his customers.
mckenzie submitted a claim based on the december,theft of his truck.the truck,which contained an inventory of tools,had been stolen from a restaurant parking lot.the police subsequently recovered the truck in damaged condition,but without any tools inside of it at issue is whether mckenzie was afforded coverage for that loss pursuant to two policies issued by liberty.
the named insured on each policy is the distributors of mac tools.one is a business auto policy that includes comprehensive coverage.coverage is expressly limited to owned autos only.the second is an inland marine cargo insurance policy which covered the loss of tools and associated inventory only while contained in a vehicle owned or leased by the insured distributors neither policy explicitly equates ownership with being the registered owner.in fact,neither policy offers any definition of ownership.
after mckenzie who was current in payment of premiums presented his claims,liberty paid him in january for property damage to the truck.
thereafter,liberty learned that mckenzie was not the record owner of the truck at the time of theft.certified copies of dmv documents established that on november,more than a month before the theft mckenzie had transferred title to the vehicle to his father,frank mckenzie.mckenzie had forged his father signature on the application for transfer by new owner because his father had long since died.mckenzie later explained due to my own fear of repercussions of me not filing income tax returns for some time,in november,i changed the registered owner of my truck to the name of my dead father,frank mckenzie.the official dmv registration issued on december,listed frank mckenzie as the registered owner,effective november.
in addition,liberty learned that several weeks before the theft,mckenzie had put the truck in the name of john mckenzie,his brother,who,like his father,was dead.mckenzie explained he had done so to protect his assets because he had been sued in a personal injury action.when mckenzie first reported the theft to the police,he told them his brother was the registered owner of the truck and gave his own address as his deceased brother address.
as noted earlier,liberty,after learning mckenzie had ostensibly transferred title to the insured vehicle before the loss had occurred,filed a declaratory relief action to determine coverage under the two policies and to recapture the money paid to mckenzie.mckenzie filed a against liberty for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in the,mckenzie also named as a michael banfield,who he described as liberty technical claims specialist.
liberty eventually moved for summary adjudication on its declaratory relief action and summary judgment on mckenzie.following lengthy litigation,the procedural details of which are not pertinent to this appeal,the trial court entered judgment in favor of liberty.
the court found 
there is no dispute that mckenzie purchased the vehicle originally held title to the vehicle and then transferred title to the vehicle to his deceased father after he renewed the policies in question.in fact,the record further discloses that as of july,seven months after the theft,mckenzie stated in a dmv sri form that the owner of the vehicle was frank mckenzie.
additionally,there is no evidence to support an indicia of ownership by mckenzie other than use of the vehicle.there is no ucc establishing a security interest,and no documents to establish 
lienholder interest 
equitable title or interest of any kind.
moreover,there have been no cases presented to this court which establish any ownership interest in an individual who first purchased a vehicle and took title attendant to that purchase and then transfers title and registered ownership status and yet somehow claims to the vehicle without any documentation whatsoever.
summary judgment is hereby granted based on the argument that mckenzie has no standing to sue liberty because he had no insurable interest in the vehicle or its contents.without an insurable interest,mckenzie can not pursue his for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
mckenzie lack of ownership in the vehicle also precludes recovery for the contents of the vehicle t he cargo policy provides that it only covers inventory while contained in the truck owned or leased by the insured distributors.
in regard to liberty action against mckenzie,the court found mckenzie had breached contractual obligations imposed by the insurance policies by misrepresenting to liberty his ownership interest in the stolen truck that liberty was entitled to rescind the policies because of mckenzie material misrepresentations and concealments and that liberty was entitled to restitution of the it had paid to mckenzie.
in regard to mckenzie against liberty,the court found mckenzie claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied coven
