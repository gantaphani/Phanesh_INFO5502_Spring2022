plaintiff lee williams was a truck driver for the sysco corporation from and a participant in the company long term disability ltd plan.on july,williams became ill,and late that year was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome cfs.williams applied for ltd benefits,but his claim was denied may,for failing to show both a diagnosable condition explaining williams subjective symptoms of fatigue,and that williams was unable to perform his job functions.williams treating physician then submitted a cfs residual functional capacity questionnaire and williams appealed his denial of benefits.on january,williams appeal was denied due to insufficient evidence as to whether williams was unable to perform his job functions.williams then brought suit in the northern district of illinois.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted defendants motions for summary judgment and denied williams motion.this appeal followed.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court rulings.
background 
the,lee williams,was born in and worked as a truck driver for the sysco corporation from november,until july.williams job required that he be able to do the following occasionally climb ladders,kneel,twist,and stoop frequently climb stairs,pull,push,reach,grasp,sit,stand,walk,and use fine and gross manipulation and continuously lift,carry,and bend.williams also had to be able to lift up to pounds continuously,up to pounds frequently,and up to pounds occasionally.
williams participated in the sysco corporation group benefit plan the plan,which included disability ltd benefits to employees.the plan is maintained by sysco,with aetna life insurance aetna serving as the underwriter and claims administrator for the ltd policy.aetna is vested with discretionary authority to determine whether and to what extent employees and beneficiaries are entitled to benefits and construe any disputed or doubtful terms of the policy.under the plan,for purposes of the claim in this case,an employee is disabled and entitled to benefits if you are not able to perform the material duties of your own occupation because of disease or injury and your work earnings are or less of your adjusted predisability earnings.
williams became sick on july,and complained of fatigue,shortness of breath,dizziness,and cough.these symptoms continued after williams was released from the hospital.williams subsequently underwent a number of different tests to determine what was causing his fatigue and weakness.in early,after ruling out other conditions that could be responsible for williams chronic fatigue,john sorin,a specialist in immunology and cfs at northwestern hospital,diagnosed williams with cfs.
williams application for ltd benefits 
in february,williams applied for ltd benefits under the plan.in march,sysco sent aetna a physical demand analysis,which detailed williams job requirements.in addition to williams application,sorin submitted an attending physician statement aps explaining that williams had been diagnosed with cfs.this aps also expressed that williams was unable to perform his regular occupation,stating that williams had a class physical impairment,meaning he was unable to perform even minimal sedentary activity and was severely limited in his functional capacity.
aetna referred williams application to brent burton,who was asked to review the file and comment on reasonable limitations and restrictions for williams.on may,burton submitted a report to aetna,which stated in part 
t he medical data in this case do not provide any documentation that williams has a diagnosable medical condition that explains his subjective symptom of fatigue.the physical examination data do not reveal evidence of significant loss of range of motion,strength,sensation,coordination,to justify discontinuation of workplace activities.there are no data to indicate that williams has sufficient impairment to render him unable to work in his usual occupation as a truck driver.
on may,aetna disability analyst kaz takashima denied williams claim for disability in a letter erroneously dated april.the letter summarized williams medical records and echoed nearly burton reasoning quoted above for denying benefits to williams.
williams appeal 
after aetna denied williams ltd benefits,sorin wrote a note to aetna on may,clarifying that williams was under his care for cfs and that,although williams was showing signs of recovery,he was still unable to resume his employment.on august,sorin completed a cfs residual functional capacity questionnaire regarding williams diagnosis and functional limitations.on this form,sorin diagnosed williams with cfs,but did not fully answer all the answers with respect to williams functional limitations.
on this questionnaire,sorin did mark boxes reflecting that williams fatigue constantly interfered with his attention and concentration that williams could occasionally twist,stoop,crouch,and climb and that williams would have both good days and bad days,leading him to miss more than four day of work each month.other parts of the questionnaire however,were not fully completed.for example,sorin marked that williams was only capable of low stress jobs,but left blank the section asking for an explanation for this conclusion.in another section,sorin wrote that williams could walk one to two city blocks without rest,marked that williams could only stand or walk less than two hours a day,and checked that williams needed a job where he could shift positions at will.in this same section however,sorin did not fill out how many hours or minutes williams could sit or stand at one time,and instead wrote in the margin that this was unknown.with respect to lifting,sorin marked that williams could occasionally lift less than ten pounds,but failed to fill out the form with respect to the higher weight amounts listed.finally,sorin marked that williams had significant limitations doing repetitive reaching,handling,or fingering,but in the section where the form asked the percentage of time during a working day that the patient can perform these activities,sorin wrote untested in the margin.
on september,williams,operating through counsel,appealed aetna denial of his claim.on january,aetna issued a letter to williams upholding its denial.the letter stated that,while aetna had reviewed the information submitted on appeal,this information failed to document that williams was physically impaired from working as a truck driver.the denial letter then specifically cited several of the items left incomplete on sorin questionnaire.the letter concluded 
although sorin diagnosed williams with chronic fatigue syndrome,the functional impairment you assert prevents williams from working in his own occupation is not apparent.there is no record that williams functional capacity was tested to accurately determine his limitations and restrictions.as sorin stated in his report williams was not tested for many of the functions he claims he is unable to perform such as lifting,sitting and standing.without such evidence,we are unable to reverse our decision and williams sic will remain closed.
following this denial,williams sent aetna a letter on july,requesting a copy of his claim file and notifying aetna that he had been deemed disabled by the social security administration.
procedural history 
williams then brought this suit against aetna and the plan under a b of erisa,claiming he was wrongfully denied disability benefits.on september,the district court ruled on four motions brought by the parties.williams only appeals two of these rulings.williams does not challenge the district court denial of williams motion to strike takashima affidavits,which verified that aetna initial denial letter was erroneously dated april,and was in fact mailed on may.he also does not contest the district court grant of summary judgment for aetna on the basis that it was not a proper party to the lawsuit williams does however,appeal the district court denial of summary judgment on his claims and grant of summary judgment for the plan.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court decision.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court decision on summary judgment de novo.davis unum life ins.of,cir citations omitted.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.tegtmeier midwest operating eng rs pension trust fund,cir quoting.c.with,our review of the record requires that we construe all inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.id.quotations and citations omitted.
with respect to this court review of the plan denial of ltd benefits to williams,the supreme court has held that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.here,because the plan administrator does have discretionary authority,the court reviews williams denial of benefits under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see hackett xerox.disab.income,cir where the plan does grant discretionary authority to the administrator,the court reviews the decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
under this highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,the administrator decision will only be overturned if it is downright unreasonable.tegtmeier,at quoting carr gates health care plan,cir.despite the deferential nature of this standard however,it is not a rubber stamp and a denial of benefits will not be upheld when there is an absence of reasoning in the record to support it.hackett,at.therefore,this court will uphold the plan determination as long as it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome,the decision is based on a reasonable explanation of relevant plan documents,or the administrator has based its decision on a consideration of the relevant factors that encompass the important aspects of the problem.sisto ameritech sickness accident disability benefit plan,cir quoting houston provident life accident ins,cir.
objective evidence of functional incapacity 
chronic fatigue syndrome,like fibromyalgia,poses unique issues for plan administrators,since for both conditions,i ts cause or causes are unknown,there is no cure,and,of greatest importance to disability law,its symptoms are entirely subjective.hawkins first union.disability plan,cir mcphaul board of commissioners of madison county,cir.the plan in this case initially denied williams application for ltd benefits on two grounds that williams fatigue had not been explained by a diagnosable medical condition,and that williams had not provided any objective evidence that he was functionally impaired from continuing to work as a truck driver.on appeal,the administrator acknowledged that williams had been diagnosed with cfs,but determined that the questionnaire completed by sorin did not reflect that williams functional capacity had been accurately tested.williams argues that because fatigue is inherently subjective,aetna acted improperly when it denied williams claim on the basis of a lack of objective support in the record.
this court has expressed concern over the distinction between subjective and objective evidence of symptoms such as pain and fatigue.see hawkins,at but the gravest problem with the medical consultant report is the weight he places on the difference between subjective and objective evidence of pain.see also diaz prudential ins.of america,cir discussing the relevance of the claimant subjective assessment of his pain.the court squarely addressed this issue with respect to fibromyalgia in hawkins.there,the court found a plan had acted arbitrarily and capriciously largely because it based its denial of benefits on its medical consultant belief that a claimant could never be found to be disabled due to fibromyalgia because the amount of pain an individual experiences is subjective in nature.hawkins,at.
therefore,under hawkins,the plan could not deny williams application for benefits solely on the basis that fatigue is subjective.as the district court correctly determined,it was thus improper for the plan to initially deny benefits to williams on the basis that his subjective symptoms of fatigue did not lend themselves to medical diagnosis.williams aetna life insurance,c,wl,at.a distinction exists however,between the amount of fatigue or pain an individual experiences,which as hawkins notes is entirely subjective,and how much an individual degree of pain or fatigue limits his functional capabilities,which can be objectively measured.other circuits have drawn this same distinction.see boardman prudential insurance of america,cir while the diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves to objective clinical findings,the physical limitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses do lend themselves to objective analysis.see also denmark liberty life assur,cir following the distinction drawn in boardman see also pralutsky metro.life ins,cir holding it was not unreasonable for a plan to request objective and clinical evidence for a claimant diagnosed with fibromyalgia beyond doctor statements repeating the claimant subjective complaints of pain and fatigue.
because williams functional limitations due to his fatigue could be objectively measured,the plan did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in denying williams initial application or appeal on the basis that the record lacked accurate documentation in this regard.the administrator clearly explained this concern in both its denial letters to williams.williams initial application included an attending physician statement where sorin remarked that williams was severely limited by fatigue,but as burton and the administrator noted,the record lacked any specific data reflecting williams functional impairment.the residual functional capacity questionnaire submitted to the plan on appeal could have provided sufficient evidence that williams functional abilities were limited by his subjective symptoms of fatigue,but this form was not accurately completed by sorin.despite the fact that the questionnaire asked for responses,sorin did not explain his conclusion that williams was only capable of low stress jobs or measure williams ability to lift anything weighing ten pounds or more.even more troubling is that the sections sorin marked unknown and untested call into question the accuracy of other assessments that he did make.for example,if it was unknown how many minutes or hours williams could stand at one time before needing to sit down,it is unclear how sorin reached the conclusion that williams could only stand or walk less than two hours total in an eight hour working day.similarly,it is uncertain how sorin determined williams was significantly limited in doing repetitive reaching,handling,or fingering,when he wrote untested next to the boxes asking for the percentage of time in an eight hour work day williams could perform each of these activities.
williams argues that regardless of the questionnaire,the plan decision was still arbitrary and capricious,since aetna guidelines require that a reviewer c onsider subjective complaints of the claimant as well as objective evidence.considering such subjective complaints however,does not mean that they are to be dispositive of a claimant entitlement to benefits.this distinguishes this case from diaz,in which the plan provided that it would pay benefits for up to months with respect to disabilities primarily based on symptoms.diaz,at.furthermore,the corresponding example provided in aetna guidelines supports the distinction drawn in this case.the example aetna provides is that a reviewer should consider the claimant subjective complaints when a disability claimant genuinely appears to be in pain,although there are no objective medical findings.this example echoes the thrust of the amount of pain or fatigue an individual experiences is inherently subjective
