introduction 
when an insurer retains counsel to defend its insured,a tripartite relationship arises among the insurer,insured,and counsel.as a consequence,confidential communications between either the insurer or the insured and counsel are protected by the privilege,and both the insurer and insured are holders of the privilege.in addition,counsel work product does not lose its protection when it is transmitted to the insurer.
in this case,we hold the same tripartite relationship arises when a title insurer retains counsel to prosecute an action on behalf of the insured pursuant to the title policy.our holding leads us to grant the petition for writ of mandate or prohibition brought by bank of america,b of a,and fidelity national title insurance company fidelity.
fidelity is the insurer and b of a is the insured under a lender title policy insuring a deed of trust.when b of a made a claim under the policy,fidelity retained the law firm of gilbert,kelly,crowley jennett llp gkcj to prosecute,on b of a behalf,the underlying lawsuit for equitable subrogation,injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and fraud.defendant pacific city bank pcb served subpoenas duces tecum on fidelity parent company and lawyers title insurance company lawyers title,requesting production of documents,including communications between gkcj and fidelity regarding the litigation.b of a moved to quash or modify the subpoenas on the ground they sought confidential communications and documents protected by the privilege or attorney work product doctrine.the respondent court denied the motions to quash or modify,and b of a and fidelity brought this petition for writ of mandate or prohibition to challenge the court order.
the respondent court erred as a matter of law.a tripartite relationship exists among fidelity,b of a,and gkcj by virtue of fidelity retention of gkcj to represent b of confidential communications between fidelity and gkcj therefore are protected from disclosure by the privilege.it does not matter that fidelity retained gkcj to prosecute rather than defend a lawsuit,as the respondent court stated and pcb contends,because the title insurer obligation to protect its insured title is the same in either case.nor does it matter that fidelity retained gkcj subject to a reservation of rights because fidelity reservation of rights did not create a conflict requiring cumis counsel,and gkcj was not acting as cumis counsel.
b of a has established it will suffer irreparable injury unless we grant extraordinary relief.we therefore grant the writ petition and order the issuance of a writ of mandate directing the respondent court to grant b of a motions to quash or modify the subpoenas duces tecum,with further directions as set forth in the disposition.
facts and procedural history 
petition allegations are deemed true.
in april,b of a and fidelity filed their petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition challenging the respondent court order denying b of a motions to quash or modify the subpoenas duces tecum.ultimately,we issued an order to show cause.when the court of appeal issues an order to show cause,the real party in interest may file a return by demurrer,verified answer,or both.cal.rules of court,rule b.in response to the order to show cause,pcb filed an unverified return brief that included neither an answer nor a demurrer to the writ petition.
in the absence of a true return,all and verified allegations of the writ petition are accepted as true.code civ,caliber bodyworks,superior court th,fn,d shaffer superior court th,fn,d coppinger superior court d.an unverified return does not constitute a demurrer to a mandate petition and therefore should be stricken for purposes of addressing the petition merit.universal city studios,superior court th,d.
in county of san bernardino superior court th,footnote,d,the real parties in interest filed a document called responsive brief that did not respond to the formal allegations of the petition.the court of appeal noted its order issuing an alternative writ requested a formal return,meaning an answer or a demurrer.ibid.by filing a responsive brief,the real parties in interest did not follow the correct procedures.ibid.
here too,pcb filed an unverified return brief that did not respond to the formal allegations of the writ petition.because pcb did not file a true return with a verified answer or demurrer to the allegations of the writ petition,we deem the and verified allegations of the petition to be true.these true allegations are set forth in parts ii.and iii.of this section.
pcb argues its failure to submit a true return is a mere technicality which we should overlook because b of a and fidelity did not include with their exhibits in support of the writ petition a copy of pcb supplemental brief in opposition to plaintiff motions to pacific city bank subpoenas to fidelity and lawyer title declaration of josh lazar pcb supplemental brief.the failure to submit a return with a verified answer or demurrer is not a technicality,but is an integral and critical step in the procedure for determining the merit of a petition for extraordinary relief.further,b of a and fidelity mistake does not excuse that of pcb each must be judged on its own and bear its own consequence determined under the relevant standard.
as to the assertion b of a and fidelity did not provide a complete record,california rules of court,rule b b requires a petition seeking review of a trial court ruling to be accompanied by a record that includes a ll documents and exhibits submitted to the trial court supporting and opposing the petitioner position.this rule required b of a and fidelity to include pcb supplemental brief in the exhibits accompanying the writ petition.the consequence for failure to submit the required record or explanations is that we may summarily deny a stay request,the petition,or both.cal.rules of court,rule b,italics added.summary denial of b of a and fidelity writ petition would be an overly harsh consequence for the failure to include a single pleading in a lengthy record,particularly so because b of a and fidelity did include in the exhibits both pcb opposition and amended opposition to the motions to quash or modify the subpoenas in addition,before issuing an order to show cause,we requested informal opposition from pcb,and,with its return,pcb submitted an appendix that included the supplemental brief and other pleadings.
while california rules of court,rule b gives us discretion in deciding whether to summarily deny a writ petition for failure to submit the required record,the failure to file a true return gives us no option but to accept the allegations of the writ petition as true.unlike a document omitted from the exhibits,a verified answer to the writ petition can not be supplied from another source,certainly not from the petitioner.b of a and fidelity should have included pcb supplemental brief in the exhibits to their writ petition,but their failure to do so does not excuse pcb failure to file a true return.
underlying facts 
in july,helena cho applied for a loan from b of a to refinance her home mortgage.at that time,the property was encumbered by a deed of trust in favor of american sterling bank,which had been recorded on november.
b of a approved the refinance loan,under the terms of which the loan proceeds would be used to pay off the american sterling bank loan.b of a loan would be secured by a first deed of trust.on october,cho executed a promissory note in favor of b of on october,the loan funded,and a deed of trust securing the loan was recorded in the orange county recorder office.b of a paid a little over to satisfy the american sterling bank loan.
in connection with the b of a loan to cho,transnation title insurance company transnation issued a title insurance policy to b of a the transnation policy insuring the priority of b of a deed of trust over any other lien or encumbrance.the transnation policy provided that transnation would defend b of a in any litigation involving a covered claim and that transnation had the right to institute and prosecute any action to establish the lien of the insured mortgage or to prevent or reduce damage or loss to b of transnation was acquired by lawyer title,which in turn was acquired by fidelity.
unbeknownst to b of a,at about the same time that cho refinanced with b of a,cho on behalf of her business dc marketing obtained a million business line of credit from pcb.the line of credit was secured not only by cho business assets,but also by a deed of trust recorded against cho home on october,five days before the recordation of b of a deed of trust.
in november,pcb recorded a notice of default under its deed of trust and sent the notice to b of a in december.in february,pcb recorded a notice of trustee sale,scheduling the sale for the following month.to protect its security interest,b of a retained the law firm of miles,bauer,bergstrom winters,llp mbbw.pcb refused mbbw request to postpone the sale and purchased the property with a full credit bid.
two days before the scheduled sale date,mbbw,on behalf of b of a,tendered to fidelity a claim under the transnation policy.fidelity accepted the claim and retained temporary counsel to commence the underlying action to subrogate b of a to the position of the american sterling bank encumbrance that b of a had satisfied.in april,temporary counsel filed the complaint for equitable subrogation and declaratory relief.in june,fidelity retained gkcj to represent b of a in the underlying action.fidelity is paying gkcj fees to represent b of 
b of a,represented by gkcj,filed a first amended complaint asserting causes of action for equitable subrogation,injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and fraud.
the writ petition alleges during gkcj representation of b of a in the underlying action,gkcj attorneys have communicated extensively with fidelity regarding the facts of the underlying action,the status of the underlying action,b of a communications,gkcj litigation strategy,gkcj assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each party case and gkcj recommendations and opinions regarding settlement and other possible resolutions of the underlying action.gkcj has also transmitted its research and other written work product to fidelity.further,the great majority of gkcj communications with fidelity have been with lindsy doucette,who is a licensed attorney,and include doucette mental thoughts and impressions as an attorney.gkcj and its attorneys have believed at all times that there was a tripartite relationship between b of a,fidelity and gkcj and gkcj communications with fidelity were protected by the privilege and the attorney work product privilege.
procedural history 
in january,pcb served deposition subpoenas duces tecum on fidelity parent company,fidelity national financial,and on lawyer title.the subpoenas were essentially the same and sought documents that included communications between gkcj and fidelity.
b of a moved to quash or modify the subpoenas duces tecum the motions to quash to exclude communications between gkcj and fidelity on the ground they were protected by the privilege were protected attorney work product.b of a argued in the motions to quash and supporting documents that gkcj had been hired by fidelity and that a tripartite relationship existed among b of a,gkcj,and fidelity.b of a moving papers included a declaration of counsel that gkcj was retained by fidelity to represent b of a under the transnation policy.
pcb filed oppositions to the motions to quash and argued,among other things,the tripartite relationship was destroyed because fidelity was providing coverage to b of a under a reservation of rights.
in march,at the hearing on the motions to quash,the respondent court requested b of a to prepare and file a declaration of fidelity claims counsel,pertaining to fidelity retention of gkcj and a privilege log of all communications between gkcj and fidelity.the hearing on the motions to quash was continued to april.
in compliance with the court request,b of a filed a declaration from lindsy doucette,claims counsel at fidelity,setting forth facts regarding its retention of gkcj.the declaration stated,fidelity retained gkcj to represent b of a and fidelity in this matter in a tripartite relationship pursuant to the terms of the transnation policy by way of referral on or about may.as to fidelity general relationship with gkcj,the declaration stated pursuant to the november,letter of engagement,it was my impression and intent that fidelity and gkcj,as retained counsel,maintained an relationship for matters fidelity referred to gkcj and that all communications between fidelity and gkcj referring to or relating to matters referred to gkcj would be confidential and subject to the privilege.b of a also filed a page privilege log of all communications between gkcj and fidelity that were sought by the subpoenas duces tecum.
at the resumption of the hearing,the respondent court denied the motions to quash.the court ruled there was no relationship between gkcj and fidelity because gkcj was retained to prosecute the underlying action as opposed to defending an existing action.the court stated,t here is a distinction between an equitable subrogation case and quiet title case,a case in which one is defending an action as opposed to one in which one is prosecuting an action according to the respondent court,fidelity did not have a favored position or sacred role in the litigation.
in its minute order,the respondent court ruled.on its own motion the court determines that the motion is properly a motion for a protective order respecting the documents identified on the privilege logs submitted and prepared by plaintiff.the court finds that none of the documents listed on the privilege log exhibit a to defendant march,amendment to opposition,is privileged and shall be produced to defense counsel as specified below.the court finds that none of the documents listed on the privilege log attached to plaintiff april,supplemental brief,is privileged and shall be produced to defense counsel as specified below.the court stays its foregoing orders of production until april.
standard of review 
the standard of review for a discovery order is abuse of discretion.costco wholesale superior court cal th,d,costco.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.shamblin brattain cal d.

discussion 
tripartite relationship exists among fidelity,b of a,and gkcj.
pcb argues the respondent court finding that no relationship existed between fidelity and gkcj was supported by substantial evidence.b of a and fidelity writ petition alleges that,in june,fidelity retained gkcj to represent b of a and gkcj took over b of a representation in the underlying action,and that fidelity is paying gkcj for its representation of b of a in the underlying action.we deem these allegations to be true because pcb did not answer them.in addition,b of a and fidelity submitted a declaration confirming that fidelity retained gkcj to represent b of a in the underlying action pursuant to the terms of the transnation policy.
fidelity retention of gkcj to represent b of a is sufficient to establish a tripartite relationship between fidelity,b of a,and gkcj.gafcon,ponsor associates th,d in california,it is settled that absent a conflict of interest,an attorney retained by an insurance company to defend its insured under the insurer contractual obligation to do so represents and owes a fiduciary duty to both the insurer and insured gulf ins.berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th,d gulf ins.counsel retained by an insurer to defend its insured has an relationship with the insurer state farm mutual automobile ins.federal ins.th,d state farm mutual between the attorney and the insurer who retained the attorney and paid for the defense,there exists a separate relationship endowed with confidentiality.the principles regarding an insurer duties to provide counsel for the insured are the same under title insurance policies as under general liability policies.lambert commonwealth land title ins.cal d,israelsky title ins.d.
in american mut.liab.ins.superior court d,the court explained the nature of the tripartite relationship in the relationship,the attorney characteristically is engaged and paid by the carrier to defend the insured.the insured and the insurer have certain obligations each to the other arising from the insurance contract.both the insured and the carrier have a common interest in defeating or settling the third party claim.if the matter reaches litigation,the attorney appears of record for the insured and at all times represents him in terms measured by the extent of his employment.in such a situation,the attorney has two clients whose primary,overlapping and common interest is the speedy and successful resolution of the claim and litigation.conceptually,each member of the trio,attorney,and has corresponding rights and obligations founded largely on contract,and as to the attorney,by the rules of professional conduct as well.the three parties may be viewed as a loose partnership,coalition or alliance directed toward a common goal,sharing a common purpose which lasts during the pendency of the claim or litigation against the insured.communications are routinely exchanged between them relating to the joint and common purpose the successful defense and resolution of the claim.insured,carrier,and attorney,together form an entity the defense team arising from the obligations to defend and to cooperate,imposed by contract and professional duty.this entity may be conceived as comprising a unitary whole with intramural relationships and reciprocal obligations and duties each to the other quite separate and apart from the extramural relations with third parties or with the world at large.together,the team occupies one side of the litigating arena.
that is the situation in this case.fidelity retained gkcj to represent b of a.as a consequence,a tripartite relationship among them arose fidelity,b of a,and gkcj formed a loose partnership,coalition or alliance that was directed to the common goal of protecting b of a security position,and communications exchanged among them are privileged.american mut.liab.ins.superior court,supra,d at.
contrary to pcb argument,it does not matter whether there is a formal retainer agreement between fidelity and gkcj.a formal contract is not required to create an relationship.gulf,supra,th at,d.retaining gkcj to represent b of a was enough in itself to establish the tripartite relationship.thus,gkcj represents two clients,the insured and the insurer.state farm mutual,supra,th at,d.
the tripartite relationship exists notwithstanding fidelity reservation of rights.
pcb argues a tripartite relationship does not exist because fidelity agreed to provide counsel for b of a under a reservation of rights.according to pcb,the tripartite relationship is limited to the situation in which an insurer,without a reservation of rights,hires an attorney to defend the insured from a liability claim.
a reservation of rights in itself does not create a disqualifying conflict requiring the appointment of cumis counsel.james truck ins.exchange th,d.if the issue on which coverage turns is independent of the issues in the underlying case,cumis counsel is not required.ibid.n ot every reservation of rights entitles an insured to select cumis counsel.there is no such entitlement,for example,where the coverage issue is independent of,or extrinsic to,the issues in the underlying action citation or where the damages are only partially covered by the policy.citations.dynamic concepts,truck ins.exchange th,d.
fidelity made its reservation of rights because b of a submitted its claim to fidelity only two days before the march foreclosure sale.whether b of a promptly notified fidelity of the claim does not appear to be related to any of the issues in the underlying lawsuit against pcb for equitable subrogation,injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and fraud.
in addition,the record does not support a finding gkcj was acting as cumis counsel,that is,independent counsel,for b of see,subd.a.fidelity retained gkcj to represent b of a,there is no evidence b of a independently retained gkcj,b of a made no demand for cumis counsel,and neither fidelity nor b of a has ever asserted gkcj has been acting as cumis counsel.
pcb relies on first pacific networks,atlantic mut.ins,to assert there is no longer any confidential relationship between an insured and the insurance company after the insurer issues its reservation of rights the magistrate judge in that case concluded that no relationship existed between the insurer and the insured cumis counsel.id.at.the magistrate judge did not conclude the insurer reservation of rights automatically created a disqualifying conflict requiring the retention of cumis counsel,and such a conclusion would be contrary to california law 
but assuming for purposes of analysis the reservation of rights in this case did create a disqualifying conflict,pcb argument fails for two fundamental reasons.first,the right to invoke the conflict would belong solely to b of the right to independent representation paid for by the insurer in the circumstances found in the cumis decision was expressly stated by the cumis court to be a right belonging to the insured citation,not the insured adversary.mcgee superior court d.pcb,as b of a adversary,can not assert b of a right to cumis counsel in order to create a waiver of the privilege and attorney work product doctrine as to communications between gkcj and the insurer,fidelity.
second,if gkcj were serving as cumis counsel,then it and b of a would have a duty to disclose to the insurer all information concerning the action except privileged materials relevant to coverage disputes,and timely to inform and consult with the insurer on all matters relating to the action,subd.d.any information disclosed by the insured or by independent counsel is not a waiver of the privilege as to any other party.ibid.
the tripartite relationship exists when the title insurer retains counsel to prosecute litigation on behalf of the insured under the policy.
at the hearing in april,the respondent court found no relationship between gkcj and fidelity existed because gkcj was retained to prosecute the underlying action as opposed to defending an existing one.the court stated,t here is a distinction between an equitable subrogation case and quiet title case,a case in which one is defending an action as opposed to one in which one is prosecuting an action the respondent court erred as a matter of law in making this artificial distinction.
we turn first to the transnation policy because that is the contract setting forth fidelity obligations to b of bank of the west superior court cal th,d,insurance policies are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.the transnation policy is an american land title association alta loan policy,form.paragraph of the conditions section of the transnation policy is entitled defense and prosecution of actions and has two components.first,paragraph a provides in relevant part that the company,at its own cost and without unreasonable delay,shall provide for the defense of an insured in litigation in which any third party asserts a claim covered by this policy adverse to the insured.second,paragraph b provides the company shall have the right,in addition to the options contained in section of these conditions,at its own cost,to institute and prosecute any action or proceeding or to do any other act that in its opinion may be necessary or desirable to establish the title or the lien of the insured mortgage,as insured,or to prevent or reduce loss or damage to the insured.italics added.
thus,the transnation policy not only obligates fidelity to defend b of a,but,as a standard alta lender policy,also gives fidelity the right to initiate and prosecute litigation,such as a lawsuit to quiet title against an adverse claim.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.t he title insurer may undertake legal action to eliminate the defect or perfect the insured title if legal action is pursued,it may take the form of,inter alia,a quiet title action,a declaratory relief action,or an action in probate court for a declaration regarding the interpretation of a trust or will.cal.title insurance practice ed.
in jarchow transamerica title ins.d.jarchow,the court examined a title insurer duty to prosecute litigation to protect an insured.in that case,a title insurer denied the insured request to initiate a lawsuit to eliminate a neighbor easement.id.at.the court of appeal concluded the insured complaint stated a claim for bad faith and emotional distress because the insurer breached its duty to take affirmative measures to eliminate the easement and provide clear title.id.at.the court examined the duty to defend provision of the title policy and explained this provision of the title policy sets forth two obligations of the insurer to defend the insured title if a third party claims,in a judicial proceeding,an interest insured against by the policy,and in the event that a third party claimant chooses not to litigate his claim,to take affirmative action by filing an action to quiet title or by offering to compromise the third party claim to provide the insured with title as stated in the policy.the obligations to defend and to take other appropriate action are kindred duties designed to achieve the same objective the integrity of the insured title.since these duties address the same fundamental concern,both must be equally accessible to insureds legal rules regarding application of the one must,likewise,apply to the other.id.at.
the jarchow court noted,t he case law regarding a title insurer bifurcated obligation to seek judicial determination of title defects deals almost exclusively with the duty to defend.jarchow,supra,d at.in jarchow,however,the third party did not sue the insured.instead,the third party persuaded the city planning commission to impose restrictions on the insured ability to develop the property protected by the policy.ibid.in such a situation when the insurer must prosecute a lawsuit to protect its insured interest the insurer duties are the same as when an insurer is called upon to provide a defense to a lawsuit brought by a third party.id.at.
although jarchow did not concern the tripartite relationship among insurer,insured,and counsel,the principle that a title insurer duties to defend and to initiate a lawsuit are kindred duties addressing the same fundamental concern jarchow,supra,d at.is equally relevant here.whether a title insurer is defending an action or prosecuting one,the object of protecting the integrity of the insured title is the same.there is no logical reason why a tripartite relationship should exist in one case but not the other.
to distinguish between defending an action and prosecuting one would deny a tripartite relationship from ever forming in many situations in which a title insurer takes action to protect its insured title.both clta and alta policies have provisions for defense and prosecution of lawsuits.see cal.insurance law practice matthew bender title insurance,appen.a,to rel.clta standard policy id.appen.b,rel.alta owner policy id.appen.c,to rel.alta loan policy.
as both jarchow and this case illustrate,it often is necessary for the title insurer to initiate a quiet title,declaratory relief,or equitable subrogation action to protect the insured title.here,a lawsuit by pcb against b of a was not forthcoming the foreclosure sale extinguished b of a lien,and,therefore,the means available to fidelity to protect its insured interest was to prosecute the underlying action for equitable subrogation and declaratory relief.if a tripartite relationship did not arise in such a situation,the title insurer would be unable to communicate with counsel retained to represent the insured without the risk of being forced to disclose confidential or privileged information.
citing in re imperial of america,pcb argues,e xisting case law limits the tripartite relationship to the narrow situation where an insurer,without a reservation of rights,hires an attorney to defend the insured from a liability claim.in re imperial of america is inapposite the issue in that case was whether,under federal law,the tripartite relationship among insurer,insured,and counsel arises in litigation under a directors and officers liability policy.id.at.the court concluded such a tripartite relationship did not arise because the directors and officers liability policy did not include a duty to defend or give the insurer the right to retain counsel for the insured.ibid.thus,the insured counsel did not have an relationship with the insurer.id.at.
it is true that california opinions dealing with the tripartite relationship have done so in the context of a liability policy,state farm mutual,supra,th,d automobile liability policy american mut.liab.ins.superior court,supra,d.attorney malpractice liability policy.but none has limited the relationship to liability policies or rejected the relationship when a title insurer initiates litigation on behalf of the insured pursuant to the terms of the title policy.in addition to the duty to defend,standard title policies,such as the transnation policy,include the insurer right to initiate litigation to protect the insured title.
pcb argues we should reject b of a and fidelity request to create a new type of protected communications and defer the matter to the legislature.the type of communications we are protecting those between attorney and client is not new rather,we are concluding that fidelity and gkcj have an relationship by virtue of fidelity retention of gkcj to represent b of 
fidelity did not waive b of a right to assert the privilege and attorney work product doctrine.
pcb argues fidelity waived any right to object to production of privileged documents and information because it did not bring its own motion to quash the subpoenas or serve objections to them.for the same reason,pcb argues fidelity is not a proper party to the writ petition.
the privilege may be claimed only by the holder of the privilege,a person who is authorized by the holder to claim the privilege,or the person who was the attorney at the time of the communication.as relevant here,the holder of the privilege is defined as the client.
we have concluded a tripartite relationship exists among fidelity,b of a,and gkcj they are a unitary whole and share a common purpose lasting during the pendency of the claim or litigation.american mut.liab.ins.superior court,supra,d at.as a consequence,b of a and fidelity are joint clients of gkcj.each of the joint clients holds the privilege protecting their confidential communications with the attorney one client may not waive the privilege without the consent of the other.roush seagate technology,llc th,d.since b of a,one joint holder of the privilege,did move to quash the subpoenas and serve objections to the requests for production,it was unnecessary that fidelity do the same to prevent disclosure of privileged communications and attorney work product.
for similar reasons,we need not decide whether fidelity is a proper party to the writ petition.there is no question b of a is a proper party,and any relief we grant of necessity would extend to fidelity even if it did not have standing to challenge the respondent court order.
b of a did not waive the privilege or the attorney work product doctrine.
earlier in the litigation,b of a asserted the privilege and the attorney work product doctrine in resp
