facts and procedural history 
nationwide employs staff attorneys to represent its insureds in lawsuits.like traditional outside counsel,nationwide staff counsel are duly licensed attorneys who conduct discovery,draft and file court documents,and physically appear in court.the key difference is that staff counsel are salaried employees of nationwide they are not independent attorneys paid on a per case basis.
before filing this lawsuit,nationwide learned that the uplc had sued allstate insurance company in a texas state court,alleging that allstate employment of staff attorneys constitutes the unauthorized practice of law by a corporation other insurance companies have intervened in the allstate litigation.nationwide,however,chose not to intervene.once it learned that the uplc was investigating its use of staff attorneys,nationwide filed this declaratory judgment action in federal court.
in its complaint,nationwide seeks a declaration that there is no disciplinary rule,ethical opinion,or caselaw in texas prohibiting an insurance company from using staff attorneys to defend its insureds.nationwide also seeks a declaration that the section of the texas state bar act,as interpreted by the uplc,violates the federal constitution.specifically,nationwide alleges that the section violates due process because it bears no rational relationship to the objective of ensuring quality,ethical representation violates due process because it is unconstitutionally vague violates the first amendment impairs nationwide contractual obligations to its insureds in violation of article i,of the constitution and is therefore actionable under.
the uplc moved to dismiss nationwide suit under rules b,and of the federal rules of civil procedure.the uplc offered several reasons for dismissal,including that there is no constitutional right to practice law,that the suit should be dismissed under the younger abstention doctrine due to the pending allstate litigation,and that texas law prohibits a corporation,other than a professional corporation,from practicing law.
the district court granted the uplc motion to dismiss after hearing arguments from both sides.rather than invoking the younger doctrine,however,the district court dismissed the suit under the pullman doctrine so that the state courts could resolve whether texas law actually prohibits an insurer from employing staff attorneys on behalf of its insureds.the court noted that the resolution of this state law issue could make it unnecessary to determine whether the state bar act violates the federal constitution.finally,the court reminded nationwide of its opportunity to intervene in the allstate litigation.nationwide appeals the district court dismissal and moves this court to certify the state law question to the supreme court of texas.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the parties disagree on the proper standard of review for this case.nationwide argues that we review abstention decisions de novo,while the uplc insists that we review abstention decisions only for abuse of discretion.there is some truth to each of these propositions.despite the confusion that once existed in this circuit it is now clear that we apply a standard of review in abstention cases.although we review a district court abstention ruling for abuse of discretion,we review de novo whether the requirements of a particular abstention doctrine are satisfied we recently articulated this standard of review in webb rogers poultry,
we review an abstention for abuse of discretion.the exercise of discretion must fit within the narrow and specific limits prescribed by the particular abstention doctrine involved.a court necessarily abuses its discretion when it abstains outside of the doctrine strictures 
thus,we review the district court decision to abstain for abuse of discretion,provided that the elements of pullman abstention are present.
pullman abstention 
the supreme court explained in hawaii housing authority midkiff that under the pullman doctrine,a federal court should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction when difficult and unsettled questions of state law must be resolved before a substantial federal constitutional question can be decided.by abstaining in such cases,federal courts will avoid both unnecessary adjudication of federal questions and needless friction with state policies in other words,for pullman abstention to be appropriate in this case,it must involve a federal constitutional challenge to state action and an unclear issue of state law that,if resolved,would make it unnecessary for us to rule on the federal constitutional question.
the first prong is clearly satisfied.the uplc is a state agency and any attempt by it to prohibit nationwide from employing staff attorneys would be state action nationwide has raised several arguments under which the uplc reading of the state bar act would violate nationwide constitutional rights.although we express no opinion on whether nationwide constitutional arguments will ultimately prevail,they appear to at least deserve consideration.the uplc has not demonstrated that all of nationwide claims clearly mandate dismissal.
to satisfy the second prong,there must be an uncertain issue of state law that is fairly susceptible to an interpretation that would render it unnecessary for us to decide the federal constitutional questions in a case thus,for abstention to be proper in this case,the state bar act must be fairly susceptible to an interpretation that would permit nationwide to employ salaried attorneys to represent its insureds in cases.we believe that it is.
subchapter g of the state bar act,published in the texas government code vernon,regulates the practice of law in texas.nothing in the act itself expressly forbids insurance companies from employing staff counsel to represent its insureds.section a provides a nonexhaustive list of activities constituting the practice of law,including drafting and filing court documents,appearing before a judge,and giving legal advice out of court.but the act does not define the unauthorized practice of law a merely states that a person may not practice law in this state unless the person is a member of the state bar.nationwide staff attorneys are duly licensed members of the state bar,just like attorneys in private practice.furthermore,the word person,as used in a,presumptively includes corporations.the texas code of construction act,which applies to the state bar act instructs courts to read the word person as including corporations,partnerships,and other legal entities 
moreover,we find no texas cases that address whether a prohibits an insurance company from employing staff attorneys to defend its insureds.the uplc argues that the supreme court of texas definitively held in hexter title abstract grievance committee that corporations may never employ attorneys to represent third parties we disagree.first,the court based its ruling in hexter title on a now repealed texas penal statute that expressly forbade corporations from practicing law on behalf of third persons the court did not examine or apply a second,hexter title is factually distinguishable from the present case.hexter title involved a title company,incorporated for the purpose of making abstracts of title to land and liens
