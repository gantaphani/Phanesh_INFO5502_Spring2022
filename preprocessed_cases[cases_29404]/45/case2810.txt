palacin brought a breach of contract,fraud,and bad faith action against allstate.allstate successfully demurred to the complaint on the basis that there was no coverage as a matter of law.palacin appeals.we conclude the court properly sustained the demurrer,but erred in failing to grant palacin leave to amend to allege the claim is not covered by the homeowners association insurance policy and therefore the property damage was her implied insurance responsibility triggering policy coverage palacin real property that was damaged constituted covered improvements within the meaning of the insurance policy.
factual and procedural background 
palacin owns a condominium unit in a condominium development known as casablanca,which is governed by a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions casablanca cc r and managed by a homeowners association homeowners association.the casablanca cc r places responsibility on each condominium unit owner to maintain and repair the interior structures and surfaces of the condominium,and the homeowners association is responsible for maintaining the common areas and common structural components roofs,exterior walls,exterior plumbing of the buildings.the casablanca cc r imposes primary responsibility on the homeowners association to obtain liability and property insurance for the entire development,and permits a condominium unit owner to separately insure his or her unit only under certain limited circumstances,which will be discussed in more detail below.
in,palacin purchased from allstate a first party condominium owners insurance policy that provided coverage for damage to real and personal property the allstate policy.with respect to the real property protection,the allstate policy states in relevant part 
coverage a 
building property protection 
property we cover under coverage a we will cover items of real property pertaining directly to your resident premises which are your insurance responsibility as expressed or implied under the governing rules of the condominium.this includes fixtures,construction materials and supplies,installations or additions comprising a part of the residence premises,only when situated within that portion of the premises used exclusively by you and made or acquired at your expense.bolding omitted,italics added.
the policy covers sudden and accidental direct physical loss to the property described in coverage property protection,except as limited or excluded in th e policy.emphasis omitted.
in approximately march,palacin made a claim to allstate under the policy building property protection provision,seeking insurance coverage for water damage to the interior of her condominium unit that resulted from a water leak from a neighboring unit.allstate denied the claim on the basis that the homeowners association was responsible for obtaining insurance for the claimed loss and therefore the allstate policy did not cover the loss under the policy terms.
palacin filed a complaint against allstate,alleging three causes of action breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.palacin complaint alleges that on two different days in february and march,she sustained a physical loss to the interior surfaces of her condominium unit resulting from a sudden and accidental discharge of water on that portion of the premises used exclusively by palacin the inner surfaces of the walls,ceilings,and floors and which was expressly or impliedly palacin maintenance insuring responsibility under the governing rules of palacin condominium association.palacin alleged that the loss was precisely the type of loss that the allstate policy is designed to and expressly covers.
allstate demurred to the complaint,arguing that palacin insurance policy did not provide coverage for real property damage inside palacin condominium because the policy covered only those real property items which are your insurance responsibility as expressed or implied under the governing rules of the condominium and the governing rules of the condominium the cc r do not place the responsibility on palacin to insure the interior structure of her condominium.in support of this argument,allstate requested the court to take judicial notice of the casablanca cc r.allstate additionally argued that its policy was an excess policy to the homeowners association insurance policy,and palacin did not allege that these insurance limits had been exhausted.
in response,palacin did not object to the request for judicial notice of the casablanca cc r,but argued that under the cc r she was responsible for obtaining insurance for the interior structure of her condominium unit and therefore her damages were covered by the allstate policy.at the hearing,palacin counsel clarified that palacin had initially made a claim for the water damage to the homeowners association insurer,but the insurer had denied the claim based on its assertion that the association policy does cover floods.counsel stated that palacin could amend the complaint to reflect these facts.
the court ultimately concluded that even assuming palacin could amend the complaint to allege that the loss was not covered by the homeowners association insurance policy,the complaint would not state a basis for recovery because the casablanca cc r unambiguously place sole responsibility on the homeowners association to obtain insurance coverage for the interior structure of the casablanca condominium units.accordingly,the court sustained the demurrer,and entered judgment in allstate favor.

review principles 
on appeal from a judgment after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,we review the trial court ruling de novo,exercising our independent judgment on whether the complaint states a cause of action.lazar hertz th,d.the issue is whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action on any available legal theory.rakestraw california physicians service th,d.we assume the truth of all properly pleaded facts,as well as facts inferred from the pleadings,and give the complaint a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and all its parts in their context.morillion royal packing cal th,d.we must also consider matters properly judicially noticed.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d.we give no credit to pleaded contentions or legal conclusions.financial of america wilburn d.
further,in determining whether the court properly refused to permit an amendment,we must reverse if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.schifando city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.the plaintiff has the burden of proving a reasonable possibility of curing a defect by amendment.ibid.
ii.insurance policy construction rules 
the interpretation of an insurance policy is governed by contract interpretation principles,zurich american ins.cal th,d.the fundamental rule is that a court must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties when they formed the contract.ibid.this intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.ibid.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.ibid.
a policy provision is ambiguous when it is susceptible of two or more reasonable constructions language in an insurance policy is interpreted as a whole and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract,supra,cal th at,d.when the relevant provisions of an insurance policy are ambiguous,extrinsic evidence may be admitted to determine the proper interpretation.kavruck blue cross of california th,d glenfed development superior court th,d.if there is no relevant extrinsic evidence or the extrinsic evidence does not resolve the ambiguity,the court must interpret the ambiguous provisions in the sense the insurer believed the insured understood them at the time of formation.citation.if application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity,ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.citation.this rule,as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy,protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured,supra,cal th at,d,brackets in original.
applying these rules at the pleading stage,an insurer moving for a demurrer based on insurance policy language must establish conclusively that this language unambiguously negates beyond reasonable controversy the construction alleged in the body of the complaint.columbia casualty northwestern nat.ins.d.to meet this burden,an insurer is required to demonstrate that the policy language supporting its position is so clear that parol evidence would be inadmissible to refute it.id.at.absent this showing,the court must overrule the demurrer and permit the parties to litigate the issue in a context that permits the development and presentation of a factual record,summary judgment or trial.
iii.governing insurance policy provisions 
the allstate policy states the policy covers items of real property pertaining directly to your residence premises which are your insurance responsibility as expressed or implied under the governing rules of the condominium.bolding omitted,italics added.the parties agree that the governing rules of the condominium are contained in the casablanca cc r and that the trial court properly took judicial notice of this document.two sections of the casablanca cc r sections and forth rules regarding real property insurance 
section states that the association shall obtain and maintain a master or blanket policy of fire insurance for the full insurable value of all of the improvements within the development this section additionally states that the policy shall name as an insured the homeowners association and each condominium owner and identifies the amount and type of coverages that this insurance must include.with respect to the type of coverages,section states the policy shall contain an extended coverage endorsement,vandalism,malicious mischief coverage,and a special form endorsement 
section limits the type of property insurance that each individual condominium owner is entitled to purchase.the section begins except as provided in this section,no owner can separately insure his unit or any part of it against loss by fire or other casualty covered by any insurance carrier under section.italics added.this paragraph then sets forth two exceptions to this rule.first,a n owner can insure his personal property against loss.second,any improvements made by an owner within his unit may be separately insured by the owner,but the insurance is to be limited to the type and nature of coverage commonly known as tenant improvements.
as both parties recognize,the primary purpose of these provisions is to avoid double coverage by allocating insurance responsibility between the homeowners association and an owner of a condominium unit.if both the master and individual policy cover the same loss,the unit owner may be compelled to pay twice for the same through homeowners association dues and then again through individual policy premiums.additionally,double coverage can lead to disputes over control of proceeds,where the association could be faced with the obligation to repair where a portion of the insurance proceeds is controlled by a member.scull wagner,insurance and damage and destruction provisions for condominiums and planned developments spring cal.real prop.double coverage can also increase the risk of subrogation disputes.see schiller community technology.
iv.analysis 
on one level,the insurance coverage issues raised on appeal are more complex than the usual coverage dispute because this court must engage in a analysis.because allstate incorporated the homeowners association rules into its policy,it is necessary to not only determine the meaning of the words contained in the four corners of the insurance policy,but also to determine the meaning of the language used in the cc r,drafted by third parties.on another level,our resolution of these issues is simplified because we are reviewing this case at the pleading stage instead of the more typical summary judgment context where we are required to determine whether the policy holder interpretation is a reasonable one or whether the policy terms are ambiguous permitting extrinsic evidence to explain the policy language.unless the relevant language in these two documents is clear and unambiguously establishes that palacin claim is not covered,the demurrer should have been overruled.
does palacin have any insurance responsibility under the cc r 
allstate argues that it met its burden of showing no coverage as a matter of law because coverage under its policy is triggered only for real property damage that palacin is responsible for insuring and the casablanca cc r does not impose any responsibility on palacin to purchase real property insurance and instead places exclusive responsibility on the homeowners association to obtain all property insurance for the development.
under section,the homeowners association is responsible for obtaining fire and extended coverage for all improvements within the development,and each owner must be named as an insured under these policies.see ante,fn.we agree with allstate that this broad language appears to initially place responsibility on the homeowners association to obtain comprehensive property insurance for the condominium development,including the external and internal structure of the condominium units.but we must read this section in conjunction with section,which expressly permits the homeowner to obtain property insurance under specified circumstances.see ante,fn.palacin argues,and we agree,that at least one reasonable interpretation of these provisions is that section identifies the items that a condominium owner is implicitly responsible for insuring,if he or she elects to do so.
first,this construction is supported by the language of the allstate policy stating that the policy covers items that are the owner expressed or implied responsibility under the governing rules.italics added.this phrase means that the homeowner rules need not state directly that the owner is responsible for obtaining a particular coverage,but that allstate policy coverage may be triggered if the condominium owner responsibility to obtain the insurance is merely suggested under the cc r and reasonably understood by the involved parties.this implied responsibility can be reasonably gleaned from the casablanca cc r.by making exceptions to the rules imposing insurance responsibility on the homeowner association,section can be reasonably construed to imply that these exceptions effectively establish the items for which the homeowner rather than the homeowners association will be responsible for insuring.this interpretation furthers the agreed purpose of the casablanca cc r by avoiding double coverage and is consistent with the objective of the limiting provision in the allstate policy insurance clause,which is to mirror the allocations of insurance responsibility set forth in the cc r.
moreover,unlike allstate proposed construction,this interpretation gives effect to the real property coverage in allstate policy.if,as allstate argues,the casablanca cc r are read to mean that a condominium owner has no responsibility to obtain any real property insurance for any property item or for any peril,the building property protections in the policy become meaningless.taken to its logical conclusion,allstate position means that it was not in fact selling palacin any real property insurance because palacin had no responsibility to obtain any of
