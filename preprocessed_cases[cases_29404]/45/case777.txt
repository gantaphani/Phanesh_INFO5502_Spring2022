delta pine land company dpl appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants nationwide agribusiness insurance company and nationwide mutual insurance company collectively,nationwide.dpl argues that the district court erred in concluding that the insurance policies purchased by dpl from nationwide do not cover the claims made in a lawsuit filed against dpl and that,accordingly,nationwide has no duty to defend or indemnify dpl.we agree with dpl and therefore vacate the summary judgment.applying mississippi law,we conclude that nationwide has a duty to defend dpl under the insurance policies but pretermit whether it also has a duty to indemnify.the district court judgment is vacated,and the case is remanded to it for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
dpl develops,markets,and sells cotton seed to farmers to be used for the purpose of raising and selling cotton.in,individual farmers farmers filed suit underlying suit against dpl,alleging that they had suffered substantial losses in crop yields because dpl sold them a mixture of old nucotn cotton seed negligently blended with new seed.dpl owned a commercial general liability policy cgl policy and a commercial umbrella liability policy umbrella policy,both of which were written and issued by nationwide.
when served with the farmers complaint in the underlying suit,dpl filed the instant declaratory judgment action against nationwide for indemnification and defense of dpl in the underlying suit after dpl and nationwide filed opposing motions for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nationwide on the ground that the claims asserted by farmers in the underlying action are not covered under either the cgl policy or the umbrella policy and,therefore,nationwide has no duty or defend or indemnify dpl.dpl timely appealed.
ii.legal standards 
we review de novo the district court ruling on a motion for summary judgment,applying the same legal standard as the district court in the first instance.wyatt hunt plywood,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.fed.civ.c see also wyatt,at.when assessing whether a dispute to any material fact exists,we consider all of the evidence in the record but refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d see also matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.instead,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.wyatt,at.however,a party can not defeat summary judgment with conclusory allegations,unsubstantiated assertions,or only a scintilla of evidence.little liquid air,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
in a diversity case such as this,we apply mississippi substantive law.see krieser hobbs,cir.our task is not to formulate new rules to govern insurance cases arising under the laws of mississippi it is merely to ascertain what the supreme court of mississippi has already declared the state law to be and apply it to this case.see batts forklift,cir.
with regard to coverage and duty to defend,under mississippi law,the ultimate outcome or merit of the claim is irrelevant with regard to the question of a duty to defend.great northern nekoosa aetna cas.sur.as long as the claim is arguably covered by the insurance policy,the duty to defend is triggered.ingalls shipbuilding fed.ins,cir we review the allegations in the complaint to see whether it states a claim that is within or arguably within the scope of the coverage provided by the insurance policy.applying mississippi law.
under mississippi law,once we identify an ambiguity in the contract and determine that dpl interpretation of the insurance contract is reasonable,we must strictly construe the contract language in favor of the insured,dpl.see provident life acc.ins.goel,cir mississippi courts strictly construe any ambiguity in an insurance policy against the insurer.emphasis added see also fid.guar.omnibank,so d.any fair doubt should be resolved in favor of the insured.bellefonte ins.griffin,so d,it is well established that ambiguity and doubt in an insurance policy must be resolved in favor of the insured.caldwell hartford acc.indem,so d.
in the following sections,we will first determine whether the policy arguably covers the farmers claims,then decide if any exclusions apply.
iii.policy coverage 
three basic requirements must be met to trigger nationwide duty to defend under the cgl and the umbrella policy a plaintiff must allege that it sustained damages because of bodily injury or property damage to trigger defense coverage under the cgl and a plaintiff must allege that it sustained a loss because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury,or advertising injury to trigger defense coverage under the umbrella policy the alleged damage must be alleged to have been caused by an occurrence and there must be no valid exclusion that applies.it is undisputed that the alleged damages were caused by an occurrence so the only issues on appeal are whether requirements and were met so as to trigger the duty to defend coverages 
coverage under the cgl 
the cgl policy provides that nationwide will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage.however,an endorsement modifies this definition.the seed merchants endorsement explicitly states that it changes the cgl policy and modifies the coverage extended by the cgl policy the endorsement then states that d amages because of property damage include loss resulting from an error in mechanical mixture of seed.
generally,the purpose of a rider to an insurance policy,such as an attached endorsement,is to make additions to a policy which are actually for the purpose of modifying the general terms of the policy,and therefore,being specific,control the more general terms of the policy.camden fire ins.ass new buena vista hotel,so d,turbo trucking,those underwriters at lloyd london,cir.an endorsement thereby controls the policy insofar as it enlarges,modifies or restricts the terms of the policy.new buena vista hotel,so d at.an endorsement also can act as a predominating influence in determining the meaning and intent of the policy.id.moreover,if there is any conflict between the rider and the policy,the rider controls in construing the contract expressly where the provisions of the rider are the more specific.id.at.
dpl argues for a reasonable reading of the seed merchants endorsement in accord with its plain language and the general purpose of endorsements.dpl reads the endorsement as redefining and enlarging the term damages because of property damage under the cgl to cover any loss resulting from an error in mechanical mixture of seed.dpl reading is reasonable because the only purpose of the endorsement is to enlarge the coverage of the policy by enlarging covered property damage to include losses resulting from an error in mechanical mixture of seed.nationwide and the dissent proposed reading that the endorsement still mandates that a claim must be for property damage as originally defined by the unamended cgl does not logically follow and would make part a of the endorsement a meaningless and ineffectual provision as dpl presents a reasonable reading of the endorsement,we must adopt that reading because it resolves ambiguity or doubt in favor of the insured in accordance with mississippi law,caldwell,so d at.therefore,since the farmers allege a loss caused by a negligent,and therefore erroneous,mixing of seed,we read the endorsement as providing coverage thereby triggering nationwide duty to defend dpl against the farmers suit.
coverage under the umbrella policy 
the umbrella policy similarly defines property damage as physical injury to or destruction of tangible property including all resulting loss of use of that property or loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed.the umbrella policy is also similarly modified by an endorsement,the seedmen limitation,which specifically changes the policy to include a million coverage for losses arising out of error in mechanical mixture of seed.the limitation intended to change the policy,because the drafter of the seedmen limitation included a disclaimer that all other conditions and provisions of the umbrella policy remain unchanged.emphasis added.
for the same reasons we noted earlier,we find this seedmen limitation modifies and enlarges the terms of coverage in the umbrella policy by extending a million coverage for loss arising out of error in mechanical mixture of seed.notwithstanding the more limited definition of property damage in the umbrella policy,the seedmen limitation specifically modifies the insurance provided by adding specific coverage for errors in mechanical mixture of seed in addition to the coverage established by the umbrella policy 
dpl provides a reasonable reading of both endorsements and we find coverage under the endorsements for loss resulting from an error in mechanical mixture of seed.as the farmers are requesting compensatory damages for dpl negligently blending old seed with new seed,they are,at the very least,arguably asserting an error in the mechanical mixture of seed,and therefore both the cgl and umbrella policy cover dpl defense against the farmers complaint.see ingalls shipbuilding,at we review the allegations in the complaint to see whether it states a claim that is within or arguably within the scope of the coverage provided by the insurance policy when in doubt,defend.emphasis added internal quotations and citations omitted.
iv.exclusions 
nationwide also asserts that three exclusions apply.we disagree.nationwide bears the burden of showing that an exclusion applies and that it is not subject to any other reasonable interpretation that would afford coverage.centennial ins.ryder truck rental,cir.
expected or intended injury exclusion 
the property damage expected or intended exclusion does not apply so as to bar coverage,because this clause only excludes coverage for property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.however,the farmers primarily assert damages resulting from the negligent and grossly negligent mixing of seed and not damages resulting from an intentional injury.in the farmers complaint,they clearly allege that dpl was negligent and their actions fell below acceptable standards of care in one or more of the following respects 
negligently blending old seed with new seed,thereby decreasing seed vigor and reducing yield produced.
this exclusion therefore does not apply 
your product exclusion 
second,nationwide contends the your product exclusion applies.the your product exclusion only applies to property damage to the insured own product.essentially,nationwide argues that a decreased crop yield is damage to dpl own product,the cotton seed,and therefore should be excluded.we disagree with nationwide construction of the exclusion.we read the exclusion as plainly not applying to the situation at hand.the farmers do not complain of damage to dpl seed,but damage to the farmers crop land use,their crop yield.damage to the use of one crop land is distinguished from damage to dpl seed itself.see paul fire marine ins.northern grain,cir by virtue of the germination process involved in the production of wheat a transformation did,in fact,occur so as to constitute the wheat crop a separate and distinct entity from the original seed wheat.while the seed is dpl product,the resulting crop and its use of the crop land are the farmers separate property.accordingly,we construe the exclusion in favor of dpl it does not apply.
c.the seedmen modified liability coverage endorsement 
the seedmen modified liability coverage endorsement has two clauses.we read the policy as a whole,considering all the relevant portions together and,whenever possible,should give operable effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result.progressive gulf ins.v.we care day care center,so d,internal quotations omitted.reading this endorsement as a whole,one reasonable reading is that clause one of the endorsement provides that all covered seed losses arising out of the failure of seed to germinate,the most nationwide will pay is per occurrence,and clause two,which begins with t his insurance,refers back to the modified insurance provided by clause one.therefore the endorsement applicability hinges on whether the claim is a covered seed loss arising out of the failure of seed to germinate.however,nationwide concedes in its brief that the farmers purchased this seed,planted it,and it germinated and emerged.appellees brief,at emphasis added.the farmers alleged harm is not the seed failure to germinate,but the reduced yield in the germinated cotton crop therefore,the seedmen modified liability coverage endorsement,which solely limits recovery to for losses resulting from the seed failure to germinate,does not apply in this case.
conclusion 
we conclude that the endorsements to the cgl and the umbrella policy afford coverage to the extent of imposing a duty to defend against the farmers claims as described in the forgoing opinion and that none of the exclusions in the policies or endorsements apply.accordingly,nationwide has a duty to defend dpl under both the cgl and umbrella policy against the farmers claims.as the proceedings are still ongoing and early in the farmers suit in state court,we will not reach the issue of the duty to indemnify.see lamar homes,mid continent cas,cir.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the majority opinion almost gets it right.i agree with the majority conclusion that the seed merchants endorsement to the cgl policy and the seedmen limitation to the umbrella policy expands the coverage of these policies.i disagree,however,that these endorsements expand or modify the policies definition of property damage.
because the farmers complaint in the underlying litigation fails to allege property damage,within the meaning of these policies,i would find that nationwide has no duty to defend or indemnify dpl and affirm the judgment of the district court 
the seed merchants endorsement to the cgl policy does not modify the definition of property damage.the plain language of the endorsement specifies with the utmost precision the only portion of the policy which it modifies 
a.the following is added to paragraph.of coverage injury and property damage liability section 
insuring agreement.
damages because of property damage include loss resulting from 
the erroneous delivery of seed,which includes 
a the failure to deliver seed 
b the delivery of wrong seed or 
c the delivery of seed at the wrong time of season or 
an error in mechanical mixture of seed.
emphasis added.the language is clear the seed merchants endorsement only modifies the coverages section of the policy.
property damage is defined in the definitions section of the policy,not the coverages section.property damage is a defined term in the cgl policy.the term appears in quotation marks throughout both the policy and the seed merchants endorsement.according to an introductory clause of the policy,words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning.emphasis added.for those meanings,the policy directs readers refer to definitions section v.the definitions section is a discrete part of the policy,separate and apart from the section on coverages.
because property damage is a defined term under the cgl policy and because the seed merchants endorsement expressly modifies only coverages and not definitions,the definition of property damage must be read as part of the endorsement,not as modified by it.the definition of property damage from the definitions section thus governs both the cgl policy and the seed merchants endorsement.that definition requires either physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.
likewise,the seedmen limitation to the umbrella policy does not modify that policy def
