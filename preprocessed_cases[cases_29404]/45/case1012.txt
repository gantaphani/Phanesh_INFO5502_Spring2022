insurance company appeals the ruling of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of its insured,larsen intermodal services,larsen and denying for summary judgment.defended larsen against the claims of several plaintiffs who were injured in an accident involving a white tractor leased to larsen and driven by one of its employees.however,determined that the tractor was not a covered vehicle under the commercial trucker insurance policy the policy that provided to larsen.nevertheless,settled and paid the injured plaintiffs claims as required by a endorsement to the policy.the endorsement gives the right to seek reimbursement from larsen for any sums paid solely by reason of the endorsement.the district court concluded,however,that had waived its right to seek reimbursement.it also denied claim for defense costs.because we hold that did not waive its rights to reimbursement of the settlement amounts,we reverse and render summary judgment for on that issue.however,we conclude that had a duty to defend larsen,and we therefore affirm the district court ruling insofar as it determined that is not entitled to recover its defense costs.
facts and proceedings 
larsen is a trucking company which operates on both interstate and intrastate routes.insured larsen under the policy for liability up to million.the policy provides that only the autos specifically described on the declarations page attached to the policy are covered autos.a driver is covered under the policy as an insured while he or she uses,with the named insured permission,a covered auto that is owned,hired or borrowed by the named insured.the policy also provides that autos acquired after the policy begins are covered if,among other things,the named insured requests coverage from within thirty days after acquiring the auto.however,the policy includes an endorsement that amends this provision to require that the insured must request coverage from within hours after acquisition.
in addition,the policy contained the endorsement for motor carrier policies of insurance for public liability under sections and of the motor carrier act of,which is the subject of this appeal.the endorsement,referred to as endorsement,must be attached to any liability policy issued to a registered motor carrier pursuant to a,b and.the states in pertinent part 
in consideration of the premium stated in the policy to which this endorsement is attached,the insurer the company agrees to pay,within the limits of liability described herein,any final judgment recovered against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence in the operation,maintenance or use of motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of sections and of the motor carrier act of regardless of whether or not each motor vehicle is specifically described in the policy it is understood and agreed that no condition,provision,stipulation,or limitation contained in the policy,this endorsement,or any other endorsement thereon,or violation thereof,shall relieve the company from liability or from the payment of any final judgment,within the limits of liability herein described,irrespective of the financial condition,insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured.
basically,the makes the insurer liable to third parties for any liability resulting from the negligent use of any motor vehicle by the insured,even if the vehicle is not covered under the insurance policy.the endorsement continues 
however,all terms,conditions,and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company.the insured agrees to reimburse the company for any payment made by the company on account of any accident,claim or suit involving a breach of the terms of the policy,and for any payment that the company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.
thus,the obligates the insured to reimburse the insurer for any payments the insurer would not have been liable to make under the policy but for the terms of the endorsement.
it is undisputed that the tractor involved in the accident underlying this appeal was never listed on the schedule of covered vehicles contained on the declarations page of the policy.larsen admits that it has no evidence that it requested coverage for the tractor within hours after its acquisition.rather,it appears that was first informed that larsen had acquired the vehicle when larsen submitted a loss notice advising of the accident,days after larsen leased the tractor.
before any of the plaintiffs injured in the accident filed suit,determined that the tractor was not a covered auto under the terms of the policy,because larsen had not requested coverage for the vehicle within hours after acquiring it.accordingly,sent a letter to larsen advising it that there was no coverage.the letter also advised larsen that could claim reimbursement for any amounts it paid to settle claims arising from the accident and invited larsen to contact with questions.
thereafter,the injured plaintiffs filed their petitions against larsen,its driver,and in state court,alleging that the driver negligent operation of the vehicle caused their injuries,and that at the time of the accident sued upon herein,larsen was insured by,in connection with the operation of a truck at all times pertinent hereto.negotiated settlements with two of the plaintiffs,and informed larsen of some of the settled amounts in a second letter in which it restated its right to claim reimbursement for the settlement amounts.the letter again invited larsen to contact with questions.despite these two letters,no representative of larsen contacted concerning its denial of coverage,its claim for reimbursement,or the defense of the suits.
not having received any objections from larsen,engaged a single attorney to defend the claims of the two remaining plaintiffs.when the plaintiffs demanded amounts in excess of million,sent a third letter to larsen stating 
the policy in effect for this loss has a limit of liability of per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage.there exists the possibility that this loss could exceed your policy limits,therefore,please accept this letter as notice that insurance company will not be liable for any award in excess of.
shortly after sent this letter,the remaining plaintiffs agreed to settle their lawsuits for an amount less than million.then filed suit in federal court,seeking a judgment that larsen is liable under the to for reimbursement of the settlement amounts,as well as the costs incurred in defending the claims.and larsen filed for summary judgment.the district court noted that both parties agreed that had no duty to defend larsen arising from the terms of the.it therefore concluded that principles of louisiana insurance law should be applied to determine whether,by assuming larsen defense,had waived its rights to reimbursement under the.because it found that had failed to obtain a nonwaiver agreement to reserve its defense of noncoverage under louisiana law,the court held that had,in fact,waived its rights.moreover,the court reasoned that voluntarily defended larsen,and consequently it was not entitled to recover its defense costs.appealed.
we review summary judgment rulings de novo,employing the same standards applicable in the district court.stults conoco,cir.summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
coverage and right to reimbursement 
applicable law 
argues that the district court erred in looking to the louisiana insurance law on reservation of rights and nonwaiver agreements,because the policy itself was never implicated.it argues that since there was never any coverage for the tractor under the policy,and because the did not create coverage,there was no coverage defense that had to be reserved.according to,the right of reimbursement is a federal right that is specifically reserved in the itself.urges us,therefore,to look only to federal law in evaluating its rights under the.
a cogent analysis of these issues requires us to explore the history and public policy underlying the.the was required under the regulations of the interstate commerce commission icc.when the icc was abolished,its authority to regulate carriers was transferred to the department of transportation,but the old regulations remain in effect until new ones are promulgated.john deere ins.nueva,cir.this court has stated that icc endorsements are governed by federal law.canal ins.first ins,cir,modified on other grounds,cir citing carter vangilder,cir.
we have also held that the policy embodied in the icc regulations was to assure that injured members of the public would be able to obtain judgments collectible against negligent authorized carriers.canal first,at.thus,the insurer obligations under the are triggered when the policy to which it is attached provides no coverage to the insured.the first circuit has aptly described the obligation placed upon the insurer by the as one of suretyship.w e consider the icc endorsement to be,in effect,suretyship by the insurance carrier to protect the safety net i t simply covers the public when other coverage is lacking.canal ins.carolina cas.ins,cir 
consistent with this line of reasoning,we have held that the endorsement accomplishes its purpose by reading out only those clauses in the policy that would limit the ability of a third party victim to recover for his loss.carolina cas.ins.underwriters ins,cir.but there is no need for or purpose to be served by this supposed automatic extinguishment of a clause insofar as it affects the insured or other insurers who clamor for part or all of the coverage.id.indeed,the states that all terms,conditions,and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company.therefore,in carolina casualty underwriters,we held that if an insurer policy contained the icc endorsement,it would not render the insurer primary as a matter of law.id.at.we also took this approach in canal first general to hold that the icc endorsement is not implicated for the purpose of resolving disputes among multiple insurers over which insurer should bear the ultimate financial burden of the loss.canal ins.first ins,cir,modified on other grounds,cir from these cases and from the terms of the itself,it follows that when the protection of injured members of the public is not at stake,the and the relevant federal regulations do not address coverage for the purpose of disputes between the insured and the insurer.carolina cas.ins.underwriters ins,cir.as the eighth circuit has framed the analysis,a lthough it is true that the endorsement and the pertinent regulations address only public liability and do not fix the liability between insured or insurance companies,we believe the regulations silence on the issue does not require preemption of doctrines that do not resolve such questions.redland ins.shelter mut.ins,cir citations omitted 
we recognize that these cases dealt with the effect of the provision rendering the insurer liable to injured third parties,but we think the principles we have identified are also applicable to the portion of the endorsement giving the insurer a right of reimbursement.therefore,on the facts of this case,we reject argument that we should look only to federal law in evaluating its rights under the.the gives the right to seek reimbursement from larsen for any payment made by the company on account of any accident,claim or suit involving a breach of the terms of the policy,and for any payment that would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in the.we think this means that under the circumstances of this case,the right of reimbursement is triggered only if there is no coverage under the policy.but the construction of insurance policies,and,therefore,the scope of coverage,are matters of state law.see canal ins.first ins,cir,modified on other grounds,cir.moreover,as we have already indicated,the does not alter the existing policy obligations between the insured and the insurer.we must determine then whether there was coverage for the tractor,either under the terms of the policy,or because expanded the scope of coverage under the louisiana law of waiver when it provided a defense to larsen.
scope of coverage and waiver 
larsen urges us to hold that waived its right to contest coverage for the tractor on several grounds.first,although there is no evidence that it requested coverage for the tractor within hours after acquisition,larsen contends that waived the hour notice requirement because it was never explained to larsen nor strictly enforced by 
this contention has no merit.it is true that w aiver occurs when there is an existing right,a knowledge of its existence and an actual intention to relinquish it or conduct so inconsistent with the intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that it has been relinquished.steptore masco constr,so d.however,an insured is presumed to know the provisions of his policy.stephens audubon ins,so d.cir.the insurance policy constitutes the law between the parties and should be enforced as written if the terms are clear and express the intent of the parties.id.the relevant endorsement makes abundantly clear that a newly acquired auto will be added to the policy only if y ou tell us within hours after you acquire it that you want us to cover it larsen has not cited any authority for its argument that was required to explain such an unambiguous provision.moreover,larsen has not pointed out any evidence that it was consistent practice to provide coverage even if the insured had not complied with the hour requirement.this is especially true where,as here,had no knowledge of the vehicle nor opportunity to adjust its premium at any time before the insured submitted a loss notice advising of the accident and making a claim under the policy 
second,larsen contends that waived its rights to contest coverage when it sent larsen its third letter stating that t he above policy in effect for this loss has a limit of liability of per occurrence it is larsen argument that statement that the policy was in effect for this loss would have induced a reasonable person to believe that was providing coverage for the accident.again,this argument lacks merit.the policy was in effect to the extent that the endorsement that was attached to it required to pay the claims of the injured plaintiffs up to the policy limit of million.thus,the letter was not inconsistent with intent to enforce its right to deny coverage.
larsen also argues,and the district court held,that failed to reserve its rights to reimbursement under the by coming forward with a defense for larsen without obtaining a nonwaiver agreement.in tate charles aguillard ins.real estate,so d,the louisiana supreme court held that waiver may apply to any provision of an insurance contract under which the insurer knowingly and voluntarily elects to relinquish his right,power or privilege to avoid liability,even though the effect may bring within coverage risks originally excluded or not covered.the burden of proving waiver is on the party asserting it.id.louisiana courts apply waiver principles stringently to uphold the prohibition against conflicts of interest between the insurer and the insured steptore,so d at.accordingly,the louisiana supreme court held in steptore that the scope of coverage under an insurance policy could be expanded by waiver when an insurer,with knowledge of facts indicating noncoverage under the insurance policy,assumes or continues the insured defense without obtaining a nonwaiver agreement to reserve its coverage defense id.
larsen has cited no authority explaining what constitutes a nonwaiver agreement under louisiana law,and we have found none.although one louisiana court found no waiver when the insurer obtained a written instrument executed by the insured,see cassey stewart,so d.cir,writ denied,so d,the court did not hold that such a document was required.therefore,we hold that adequately reserved its rights t
