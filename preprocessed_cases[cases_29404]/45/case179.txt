this is a dispute between an insurance union insurance company commercial union and one of its reinsurers,swiss reinsurance america corporation swiss re.the principal issue is whether,under several reinsurance policies,swiss re was protected by a single limit on its liability for the policy period or whether the limit applies separately for each policy year,thereby enlarging swiss re total exposure.
the background events involve three different tiers of insurance,coverage periods that do not precisely overlap between tiers,and pertinent clauses that are not even identical from one policy to its successor.accordingly,in setting the stage,some oversimplification as to the policies and some postponement of detail are both necessary.we begin at the ground floor with the insured,grace grace,a company with many different facilities at different locations,and then work up through the tiers.
as to the sites at issue in this case,grace primary insurer during the period in question roughly to was maryland casualty maryland.with a exception that is not important to our case,that company provided coverage to grace under five successive policies between june,and june,and two policies from june,to june.the policies covered personal injury and property damage up to million per occurrence but with much lower limits,later for losses from gradual pollution.
between october,and june,commercial union predecessors in interest provided excess liability coverage to is,coverage starting at the point that the maryland policies left the form of four successive umbrella policies.the first,second and fourth policies each ran for three years the third ran for about two years and eight months.the policies provided coverage in the amount of million for each occurrence,defining occurrence to include an event,or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which unexpectedly results in personal injury or property damage during the policy period,and continued 
a ll personal injury and property damage arising out of one event or continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed to be one occurrence.
the commercial union policies also included clauses,known as clauses,that are designed to make coverage under a policy here,commercial union to certain the coverage provided by the underlying policy here,maryland policies.see ostrager newman,handbook on insurance coverage disputes a,at ed.thus,in the first two policies,the language provided that the terms,conditions and limitations of this policy will not be construed any more restrictive sic than the terms,conditions and limitations of underlying insurance.the latter two provided 
s uch coverage as is afforded by this policy shall apply to occurrences covered by the terms and conditions of the underlying policy or by the terms of conditions of this policy except that the definition of property damage as contained in this policy shall apply.
the top tier of coverage in this case was provided by swiss re,which offered not insurance for grace but reinsurance to commercial union.swiss re agreed,under specified conditions,to indemnify commercial union for specified losses it might suffer under its excess insurance policies.the form of reinsurance used,called facultative,covers risks that the cedent here,commercial union bears under a specific policy or policies.ostrager newman,supra,a,at.
swiss re issued three certificates to commercial union,corresponding to each of the last three out of a total of four excess liability policies that commercial union had written for grace,roughly for the period to.each swiss re certificate was skeletal,identifying the commercial union excess liability policy in question and agreeing to share a specified portion of commercial union liability to grace.specifically,under the first certificate swiss re agreed to share percent of commercial union first million in loss for each occurrence under the second,percent of the first under the third,percent of the first.
each certificate contained on the back side several standard conditions.these included variously phrased clauses saying as otherwise specifically provided in the re liability would follow or be subject to the terms and conditions of commercial union policies.thus,through clauses,swiss re policies looked back to commercial union,and the latter policies looked back to maryland policies with grace.
in addition,the swiss re certificates contained provisions,the case involves sometimes called clauses.such provisions are designed to give the cedent reasonable latitude to settle claims against it by the primary insured and to bind the reinsurer in some measure from contesting the extent of the cedent liability to the primary insured.see ostrager vyskocil,modern reinsurance law practice travelers cas.sur.certain underwriters at lloyd of london.here,the clause in each certificate reads as follows 
all claims involving this reinsurance,when settled by commercial union,shall be binding on swiss re,which shall be bound to pay its proportion of such settlements promptly following receipt of proof of loss.
in the,grace began to notify commercial union of potential property damage losses due to hazardous waste pollution at various grace sites.in,maryland filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court in new york against grace seeking to clarify maryland obligations under its primary policies.see.cas.cont l cas,cir.commercial union and other insurers were added to the suit,and eventually the case expanded to involve over waste sites.
in october,commercial union settled with grace based on information about nine focus waste sites out of the forty for which grace claimed commercial union was liable,for a single immediate payment of million.the settlement was premised on estimates of projected liability over a substantial period due to damage at each site and on certain assumptions.two such assumptions were that the hazardous waste liability at each site should be allocated pro rata across the years of relevant insurance coverage at each site and that the million limit in each policy should be viewed as applying separately to each policy year,million for a policy.
when commercial union then sought indemnity from swiss re for million out of the million paid to grace,swiss re paid less than half that amount.it withheld part of the balance about million on the ground that its reinsurance certificates protected it from any calculation of commercial union liability to grace,or swiss re to commercial union,premised on the notion that the limit applied separately to each policy year as opposed to the entire policy period.swiss re also disputed another aspect of the demand but that issue was apparently settled.
on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that swiss re was correct on the annualization issue.the court held that swiss re liability should be based on the premise that the limit applied once to a continuing leakage at a site over the policy period and not once for each year of the period.the court deemed this to be an explicit limit in each certificate,overriding any or provision.this appeal by commercial union followed.
