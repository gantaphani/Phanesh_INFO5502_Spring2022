discussion 
the standard of review for an order granting a motion for summary judgment is de novo.a guilar atlantic richfield cal th,aguilar.the trial court stated reasons for granting summary judgment are not binding on the reviewing court,which reviews the trial court ruling,not its rationale.r amalingam thompson th.
we apply the same process as the trial court.because summary judgment is defined by the material allegations in the pleadings,we first look to the pleadings to identify the elements of the causes of action for which relief is sought we then examine the moving party motion,including the evidence offered in support of the motion.b aptist robinson th.a moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing that a cause of action lacks merit because one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.p t eselle mcloughlin th,teselle.if the fails to make this initial showing,it is unnecessary to examine the opposing evidence and the motion must be denied.code civ,subd.p t eselle,at.however,if the moving papers make a prima facie showing that justifies a judgment in the favor,the burden shifts to the to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.code civ,subd.p teselle,at.
in determining whether the parties have met their respective burdens,the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom citation,and must view such evidence citations and such inferences citations,in the light most favorable to the opposing party.a guilar,supra,cal th at.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.i at,fn.omitted.thus,a party can not avoid summary judgment by asserting facts based on mere speculation and conjecture,but instead must produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact.l achapelle toyota motor credit th.
the trial court did not err in entering summary judgment as to the breach of written contract title insurance policy and declaratory relief causes of action because no reasonable trier of fact could conclude the notice of abatement action is a lien or encumbrance or that cross complainants are insured under the policy 
contend the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to the second and ninth causes of action for breach of written contract title insurance policy and declaratory relief,respectively,because,contrary to first american assertions and the trial court ruling,the notice of abatement action constitutes a lien or encumbrance,and thus,is covered under the policy,and are insured under the title insurance policy.
to prevail on a breach of contract cause of action,must establish a contract its performance or excuse for nonperformance breach and damages.a coustics,trepte construction d,acoustics.
with respect to the breach of contract cause of action,the alleges first american entered into a written policy of title insurance agreement with smrels erroneously identified as stockton mortgage,in the policy of title insurance and its successors assigns under that policy,first american agreed to insure smrels,its successors assigns,against any loss or damage sustained by reason of,among other things,any defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title of the subject property and to pay the costs,attorneys fees,and expenses in defense of the title or the lien of the insured mortgage on the subject property first american breached the title insurance policy by refusing to provide coverage for the notice of abatement action and as a result of first american breach,smrels has suffered damages in an amount to be proved at trial.
as for the declaratory relief cause of action,the alleges that a n actual controversy has arisen and now exists between cross complainants and first american title concerning their respective rights and duties under the policy of title insurance,and seeks a judicial determination of such rights and duties.
first american summary judgment motion asserted that the policy does not provide coverage for any damages arising out of the notice of abatement,because the notice merely notifies the owners of the property of the possible future enforcement,and is not a lien,defect or encumbrance on title of the property.
in their opposition to the motion for summary judgment,argued the notice of abatement action constituted a lien or encumbrance because it accrued penalties and other assessments.
elysian investment group stewart title guaranty th elysian,cited by both parties,is instructive.there,the court summarized the issue before it as follows does the recording of a notice of buildings,structures,or premises classified as either hazardous,substandard or a nuisance comprise either a defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title or an unmarketability of the title within the meaning of those terms of coverage in a title insurance policy i at.the court began its analysis by defining two key terms an encumbrance has been defined as any right to,or interest in,land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its value,but consistent with the passing of the fee.citation.encumbrances include taxes,assessments,and all liens upon real property.a lien is a charge imposed upon specific property by which it is made security for the performance of an act.code civ.id.at.the court found that the notice did not affect the insured title to the property,and therefore is not a defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title.the notice,instead,warns that there are physical defects at the property.citations it states that the property is substandard,as defined in the municipal code,that the owner must comply with the substandard order,and that the city may remedy the deficiencies if the owner does not do so.citation.the notice thus informed the owner of the existence of a duty,created by ordinance,to comply with local building and zoning requirements.it also raised the possibility of future enforcement,if the owner did not comply.i at,fn.omitted.the court explained that e nforcement,require s further action on the part of the city.citation.had the department repaired the property and assessed the costs against the homeowner,the board of public works could ultimately have recorded the assessment as a lien.id.at,fn.omitted.title insurance does not insure against future events.id.at thus,the mere possibility of a lien did not amount to a defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title.i bid.the court also rejected the insured claim that the notice affected the marketability of its title,noting that one can hold perfect title to land that is valueless one can have marketable title to land while the land itself is unmarketable.citation.i at.the court determined that the notice provides notice of the physical condition of the property,for which there is no coverage.citation.it does not raise any doubts about title.i bid.
like the notice at issue in e lysian,the notice of abatement action at issue here is a notice that the premises is substandard.the notice of abatement action references a may,notice and order to abate housing and dangerous building violations,which lists violations of health and safety code section substandard buildings.like the notice at issue in e lysian,the notice of abatement action at issue here relates to the physical condition of the property and raises the issue of future enforcement.as in e lysian,the enforcement agency has yet to repair or demolish the property,much less assess the costs associated therewith against the owner or record such assessment as a lien.thus,like the court in e lysian,we conclude the notice of abatement action is not a defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title.
contrary to assertion,the accrual of enforcement costs does not transform the notice of abatement action into a defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title.confuse the recording of the notice of abatement action with the county enforcement efforts.as the court recognized in e lysian,the recording of the notice itself does nothing more than provide notice of the physical condition of the property,for which there is no coverage.elysian,supra,th at.while it is true that here,unlike e lysian,there is evidence that the county engaged in some limited abatement activity and sought to recoup its enforcement costs,which totaled there is no indication the county recorded a lien against the property to recover its costs,as contemplated in e lysian.i at.more importantly,it is undisputed that all outstanding enforcement costs were paid by alliance at the close of escrow.thus,even assuming the accrual of enforcement costs could be said to constitute a defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title,those costs were paid in full at escrow,and thus,any defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title as a result thereof was extinguished finally,to the extent assert that such costs continue to accrue,they have presented no evidence that such is the case.moreover,the title policy specifically excludes from coverage any defects,liens,encumbrances,adverse claims or other matters attaching or created subsequent to date of policy.for all the foregoing reasons,we conclude the trial court properly determined that the notice of abatement action is not a lien or encumbrance on the title,and properly entered summary judgment as to the second and ninth causes of action on that basis.
even assuming for argument sake that the notice of abatement action does constitute a defect in or lien or encumbrance on title,second and ninth causes of action would still fail because are not insured under the policy.
first american summary judgment asserted are not insured,and thus,lack standing to assert a claim under the policy.in support of their assertion,first american pointed to the policy itself,which defines insured as the insured named in schedule a,and the owner of any indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage and each successor in ownership of the indebtedness the policy further provides the coverage of this policy shall continue in force as of date of policy in favor of an insured only so long as the insured retains an estate or interest in the land,or holds an indebtedness secured by a purchase money mortgage given by a purchaser from the insured,or only so long as the insured shall have liability by reason of covenants of warranty made by the insured in any transfer or conveyance of the estate or interest.schedule a describes the insured mortgage as the deed of trust recorded november.the insured named in schedule a is stockton mortgage however,stockton mortgage never had an interest in the land or held an indebtedness secured by a purchase money mortgage or deed of trust.stockton management was named as the in the deed of trust recorded on november,however,it assigned all of its beneficial interest under the deed of trust to the investors on november.lacking any interest in the property and holding no indebtedness under the deed of trust,first american argued are not insured under the policy.
in their opposition to the summary judgment motion,claimed that first american argument overlooks the fact that had an insurable interest in the property both when the policy took effect and at the time of the loss according to,the claim arose prior to the assignment since the notice of abatement action on title as of the date of the title policy,and the lien had accrued assessments and penalties.relied on insurance code,section,which states a change of interest in a subject insured,after the occurrence of an injury which results in a loss,does not affect the right of the insured to indemnity for the loss.italics added,however,failed to identify any loss they suffered prior to the assignment on november,much less cite to any evidence that would support such a finding.
also asserted that coverage continued despite the assignment because they have potential liability for warranties and of covenants made in connection with its assignment of the deed of trust to the investors in support of their assertion,they relied on the policy provision that t he coverage of this policy shall continue in force as of date of policy in favor of an insured only so long as the insured shall have liability by reason of covenants of warranty made by the insured in any transfer or conveyance of the estate or interest.again failed to identify what warranties or covenants they gave the investors as part of the assignment,much less point to any evidence of such.
finally,claimed they had standing as third party beneficiaries under the title insurance policy.more particularly,they argued that the servicing agreement governs the relationship between and the investors,and the investors attempts to hold liable for issues arising out of such relationship would give standing to assert claims under the title policy this novel argument goes nowhere.
a third party may qualify as a contract beneficiary where the contracting parties must have intended to benefit that individual,an intent which must appear in the terms of the agreement.citation.citation.b rinton bankers pension services th.it is apparent from the terms of the title insurance policy that stockton mortgage and stockton management,the only that ever arguably qualified as insureds under the policy,were not intended to benefit under the policy following the assignment on november.to the contrary,as detailed above,the policy expressly provides that coverage shall continue in force as of date of policy in favor of an insured only so long as the insured retains an estate or interest in the land,or holds an indebtedness secured by a purchase money mortgage given by a purchaser from the insured italics added.accordingly,failed to raise a triable issue as to whether they are insured under the policy or otherwise had standing to pursue a claim under the policy.
the trial court did not err in entering summary judgment as to the second cause of action for breach of written contract title insurance policy and the ninth cause of action for declaratory relief,which seeks a declaration of the parties rights under the title insurance policy.
the trial court did not err in entering summary judgment as to the breach of written contract preliminary title report cause of action because a preliminary title report is not a contract as a matter of law 
do not appear to challenge the entry of summary judgment as to the third cause of action for breach of written contract preliminary title report on appeal,focusing instead on the breach of oral contract cause of action.we address the breach of oral contract cause of action below but pause to observe that summary judgment was properly entered as to the third cause of action for breach of written contract.
the alleges in pertinent part by the preliminary title report alliance title agreed in writing that prior to close of escrow alliance title will require that a full release be obtained of the notice of abatement action recorded against the subject property,and alliance title and first american title breached the agreement with smrels by failing to obtain a full release of the notice of abatement action.
first american summary judgment motion asserted the third cause of action for breach of written contract has no merit because,among other things,the preliminary title report is merely an offer and not a contract.did not specifically address this cause of action in their opposition to the motion for summary judgment,and the trial court entered summary judgment as to this cause of action on the grounds urged by first american.
a preliminary title report is furnished in connection with an application for title insurance and is an offer to issue a title insurance policy.indeed,the preliminary title report itself provides this report is issued solely for the purpose of facilitating the issuance of a policy of title insurance and no liability is assumed hereby.italics added.
because the preliminary title report is not a contract,the trial court did not err in entering summary judgment as to the third cause of action for breach of written contract.
the trial court did not err in entering summary judgment as to the breach of oral contract cause of action because there is no evidence that would support a finding of such an agreement 
contend the trial court erred in entering summary judgment as to the breach of oral contract cause of action because,contrary to first american claim and the trial court finding,there is evidence alliance verbally agreed to remove the notice of abatement action prior to the close of escrow.
the elements of a breach of oral contract claim are the same as those for a breach of written contract a contract its performance or excuse for nonperformance breach and damages.c areau security pacific business credit,d,a coustics,supra,th at.
the alleges in pertinent part.on or about september of,smrels and alliance entered preliminary negotiations regarding issuance of a policy of title insurance for the subject property.by the preliminary report alliance agreed in writing that prior to the close of escrow alliance will require that a full release be obtained of the notice of abatement action recorded against the subject property.alliance title and first american title breached the agreement with smrels by failing to obtain a full release of the notice of abatement action.as a result of alliance title and first american title beach of contract,smrels has suffered damages in an amount to be proven at trial.
first american summary judgment motion argued that the breach of oral contract cause of action has no merit because,among other things,there is no evidence of an oral contract.more particularly,first american asserted that although claim a breach of oral contract,refer to a writing in the preliminary title report,which is not a contract,and t he only oral communications alleged are preliminary negotiations regarding issuance of a policy of title insurance t here are no facts or even allegations of any oral contract 
in their opposition to the motion for summary judgment,asserted that alliance title,on behalf of first american,represented that certain liens would be removed from title.the only evidence cited in support of their assertion was the preliminary title report.likewise,in response to first american statement that it did not have an oral contract with any in connection with the subject property,the loan,or the title policy,claimed that alliance title,acting as an agent of first american,agreed to remove certain notices from title prior to the close of escrow.this agreement is reflected in the preliminary title report issued by alliance title on behalf of first american.in other words,the only evidence cited by to establish the existence of an oral contract was the preliminary title report.
in their opening brief on appeal,repeatedly assert that they asked or requested that the notice of abatement action be removed prior to the close of escrow,and that alliance verbally agreed to obtain a release.again,their sole support for their assertions is the preliminary title report.in their reply brief,claim that while there is no witness testimony regarding a separate oral agreement,the existence of such can be inferred from the preliminary title report and alliance attempts to obtain a release if there was no agreement to release the notices,why does the preliminary title report state,in bold print beneath the notice
