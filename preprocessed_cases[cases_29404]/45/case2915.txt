introduction 
this appeal involves the question of whether a jeweler block insurance policy provides coverage when an insured employee is standing behind his car when the automobile,which contains jewelry,is driven away by a thief,doing business as universal fine jewelry plaintiff,appeals from a summary judgment in favor of zurich american insurance company defendant.plaintiff salesperson,brian callahan,was outside his car inspecting a possible mechanical malfunction.the car,containing jewelry display cases,was stolen.the trial court concluded callahan was not actually in or upon the car at the time of the theft,therefore,the jeweler block insurance policy issued by defendant did not cover the loss.we agree.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
ii.background 
jeweler block insurance was conceived by lloyds of london at the turn of the century.jmp associates,paul fire marine ins,fn.d insurance,construction and effect of jeweler block policies or provisions contained therein,summary.jeweler block insurance differs from other property insurance.as the united states district court explained in star diamond,underwriters at lloyd,london,jewelers block insurance is different from most other traditional forms of property insurance which are considered insurance policies.under policies,an insurer agrees to indemnify its insured for losses resulting from certain risks of loss or damage which are specifically enumerated within the provisions of the policy.in contrast,under a jewelers block policy all risks of loss or damage to jewelry may be insured,subject to certain exceptions.see d,supra,insurance.
the policy contained an exclusion and an exception to the exclusion as follows we will not pay for loss caused by or resulting from any of the following theft from any vehicle unless you,an employee,or other person whose sole duty is to attend the vehicle are actually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft.italics added.this exclusion has long been included in jeweler block insurance policies as evidenced by repeated discussions of it in the decisional authority cited below.insurance coverage is claimed in this case under the exception to the exclusion.
plaintiff salesperson,callahan,was traveling from his home to an appointment.he had two jewelry display cases locked in the trunk of his car.he heard a rattling noise coming from the rear of his automobile.he pulled to the side of the road and got out to inspect the source of the noise.he left the car running with the keys in the ignition.callahan bent down to look at the area of his car.a man then brushed by callahan.the unidentified man got into callahan car and drove away.the car was recovered,but the jewelry display cases were missing.
defendant denied plaintiff insurance claim on the ground callahan was not actually in or upon his car at the time of the loss.plaintiff filed this action against defendant for contract breach tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unfair business practices.the trial court granted defendant summary judgment motion.judgment was entered in favor of defendant.plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
iii.discussion 
evidentiary ruling 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in sustaining defendant objections to evidence presented in the summary judgment motion opposition.plaintiff sought to introduce an expert opinion,based on industry custom and practice,that coverage existed on two independent grounds.the first aspect of the proffered opinion was that callahan was the victim of a colombian jewelry theft ring the commission of the theft began when the robbers tampered with callahan car and therefore the unattended vehicle exclusion was not triggered.the second aspect of the opinion was that callahan was attending to the car at the time of the theft hence,callahan was upon the vehicle within the meaning of the policy.plaintiff also sought to introduce deposition testimony of callahan.callahan had spoken to an unidentified chicago police lieutenant and a lead fbi agent.the unidentified lieutenant and the fbi agent expressed opinions concerning the robbery in their conversations with callahan.the trial court disallowed the proffered evidence as impermissibly speculative and nonspecific to the alleged incident.

summary judgment 
standard of review 
we apply the parties summary judgment burdens of production described by the supreme court in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,from commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.that is because of the general principle that a party who seeks a court action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon.citation.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof t he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.fns.omitted accord,kids universe th,d.

plaintiff arguments on appeal 
plaintiff contentions on appeal center on the construction of the term upon in the insurance policy.plaintiff does not specifically assert that language is ambiguous.moreover,plaintiff makes no claim as to the reasonable expectations of the insured.
principles of insurance policy interpretation 
the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,aiu ins.superior court cal d.the ordinary rules of contract interpretation apply.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,see aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at.as the supreme court explained in bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at pages,d,the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.on the other hand,i f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it,see aiu,supra,cal d at.this rule,as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy,protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.aiu,supra,at.only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer.see aiu,supra,at.a court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.in so doing,the court must interpret the language in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy.producers dairy delivery sentry ins.cal d,fn.this is because language in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.id.at,fn,italics added.p olicy terms must be read in their ordinary and popular sense see also aiu,supra,cal d at,reserve ins.pisciotta cal d,
similarly,in aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at pages,the supreme court set forth the principles of insurance policy interpretation as follows under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.see,reserve insurance pisciotta,supra,cal d at,crane state farm fire cas.cal d.if there is ambiguity,however,it is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor,the insurer believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.if application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity,ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.in the insurance context,we generally resolve ambiguities in favor of coverage.see,state farm mut.auto.ins.jacober cal d,bareno employers life ins.cal d,continental casualty phoenix constr.cal d.similarly,we generally interpret the coverage clauses of insurance policies broadly,protecting the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.see,garvey state farm fire casualty cal d,reserve insurance pisciotta,supra,cal d at.these rules stem from the fact that the insurer typically drafts policy language,leaving the insured little or no meaningful opportunity or ability to bargain for modifications.see,garcia truck ins.exchange cal d,bareno,supra,cal d at.because the insurer writes the policy,it is held responsible for ambiguous policy language,which is therefore construed in favor of coverage.
ambiguity in the context of insurance policies was discussed in waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at pages,d,as follows a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual insurance cal th,d.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.bank of the west,supra,cal th at d.courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists.reserve insurance,supra,cal d at.
as noted above,this case requires us to construe an exception to an exclusionary clause.exceptions to exclusions are broadly construed in favor of the insured.rosen state farm general ins.th,d meraz farmers ins.exchange th,d national union fire ins.lynette d.nevertheless,unambiguous policy language controls.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,rosen state farm general ins,supra,th at,d.
decisional authority 
two california cases have considered the actually in or upon insurance policy language at issue here.both are decisions of division three of the court of appeal for this appellate district.both cases involved parked,unattended cars.
in revesz excess ins,supra,d at pages,the court of appeal considered language in two salesman floater insurance policies procured by the plaintiff,a jewelry salesperson.the facts were undisputed.in order to get directions,the plaintiff stopped and parked his car in front of a service station.sample cases of jewelry were locked in the truck.the plaintiff had walked two or three feet away in search of directions when the car was stolen.one insurance policy contained a holdup and robbery endorsement which provided in consideration of the premium for which this policy is written,coverage as granted by the policy shall not apply to any loss of or damage to merchandise.whilst in or upon any automobile unless,at the time the loss or damage occurs,the assured is actually in or upon such vehicle and the merchandise is in his possession.italics added.id.at.the second policy similarly excluded theft from an unoccupied vehicle this policy does not insure loss of or damage to property in or upon any automobile unless at the time the loss or damage occurs there is actually in or upon the vehicle,the assured,or a permanent employee of the assured,or a person whose sole duty it is to attend the vehicle italics added.ibid.the court of appeal concluded that under the facts before it,the word upon did not require interpretation.id.at.the court held the controlling factors are not the time interval and the distance traveled but plaintiff intent and conduct.having parked his vehicle at the curb,locked the ignition,removed his keys,and left his vehicle for the purpose of seeking information,he had temporarily abandoned the vehicle.at the time of the loss the jewelry was not in his personal custody and he was not actually in or upon his vehicle,as required by the policies,in any sense of these words.the temporary abandonment is clearly evidenced by the fact that the thief was able to take possession of the vehicle and its contents without interference from him.our reasoning and conclusion are consistent with reported decisions construing these key words in policies insuring against loss of property from a vehicle in each the insured was clearly absent from his vehicle at the time of loss in each the court found that under the facts presented the words actually in or upon were not ambiguous and in each the court placed great emphasis on the word actually,indicating that it clearly negates constructive presence and possession.see royce furs,home insurance company d phil ruvelson,paul fire marine ins.greenberg rhode island ins.misc.revesz excess ins,supra,d at.
plaintiff relies on revesz conclusion that,the controlling factors are plaintiff intent and conduct.revesz excess ins,supra,d at.we disagree with revesz to the extent it so holds.the insurance policy says nothing about the insured intent.that callahan did not intend to abandon his vehicle is not relevant.we agree with revesz ultimate no coverage finding because the insured was clearly not actually in or upon the vehicle at the time of the theft.
in nissel certain underwriters at lloyd of london,supra,th at page,d,a traveling sales representative parked his car in front of a restaurant.two men stole a bag containing diamonds and other precious stones from the parked car.ibid.the jeweler block policy excluded thefts from an automobile unless,at the time of the loss,there is actually in or upon such vehicle,the assured,or a permanent employee of the assured,or a person whose sole duty it is to attend the vehicle.id.at,d,italics added.the insured made no claim that the provision was in any way unclear or ambiguous.id.at,d.our division three colleagues in an opinion authored by associate just
