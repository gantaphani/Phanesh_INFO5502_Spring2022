appeal from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york casey,dismissing their declaratory judgment action against tig insurance company tig to establish excess insurance coverage,the district court having found as a matter of law that the notice of claim provided to tig was not timely.according to the undisputed facts presented to the district court plaintiffs provided tig with notice of the claim giving rise to excess coverage approximately one month after the underlying tort action was filed but approximately three years after the arson giving rise to that tort action occurred and plaintiffs provided a claim notice to the producer of the tig policy three days after the fire was set.because we conclude that there are material issues of fact concerning whether the producer of the tig policy was tig agent for the purpose of accepting notices of claims from tig insureds,we vacate the summary judgment and remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
i.the fire and the relevant insurance policies 
this insurance coverage dispute arises out of a catastrophic fire that was intentionally set on the evening of saturday,march,at a apartment building the building located at audobon avenue in new york city.the building was owned and operated by green door realty corporation green door.in addition to the property damage caused by the fire,several tenants,including four children,and several fire fighters were either critically injured or killed.the fire and its consequences were the subject of contemporaneous news coverage in the local printed press.
at the time of the fire,the building was insured for property damage by travelers insurance company travelers for up to million,for primary personal liability by frontier insurance company frontier for up to million,for excess liability by tig for up to million,and for additional excess liability by ina insurance company for million in excess of the other policies.the tig policy was issued to sir,which did business first under the name rsa purchasing group and later under the name apartment property owners purchasing group apopg.apopg is a risk purchasing group for owners of apartment buildings in new york city.green door,through its insurance broker igm brokerage igm,had applied for and was granted insurance under the tig policy through apopg.
the effective dates of the tig excess policy were from december,until december.of particular relevance to this appeal was the notice provision of the tig policy,which required the insured to provide tig with prompt notice of an occurrence which may result in a claim.in particular,the notice of claim was required to include h ow,when and where the occurrence took place and t he names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses.
ii.actions taken by green door with respect to its insurers after the fire 
on the evening of the fire,bysie siew,the president and sole shareholder of green door,visited the building to see if there was anything he could do.according to siew,he had heard rumors from the tenants that a child or children had been injured,but he denied having been told that anyone had been killed.on the monday morning following the fire,siew telephoned igm and spoke with ramona deleon,his contact person at igm and the individual who had placed green door excess insurance policy with tig through apopg.he related to her the rumor he had heard that children might have been injured in the fire,expressed concern about his insurance coverage in light of the rumor,and asked her to inform his insurance companies immediately.according to siew,deleon told him not to worry because the building was insured under a million tig umbrella policy and advised him that she would notify his insurance carriers,including tig,and do the necessary things that needed to be done to address these issues.
according to deleon,igm practice when it receives a call like the one she received from siew was to get the information from the insured in writing,prepare an acord report and forward it to apopg.what steps deleon took with respect to the fire at green door building is the subject of some dispute.according to deleon,after speaking with siew,she called an individual named robert king in the apopg claims department and related to him the facts she had been given by siew about the fire,although she was unsure about whether she told king that people may have been injured in the fire.deleon also stated that,about two weeks after the fire,she received a telephone call from an underwriter at apopg named john goetz,who according to deleon told her do you know you gave me a line and there are three people dead according to king,however,he did not begin working at apopg until may,and thus he was not working there when deleon claimed to have spoken to him.indeed,to the best of king recollection,he never had any discussion s with her regarding the fire after he joined apopg.and,while goetz admitted to having dealings with deleon during his tenure as an underwriter at apopg,he flatly denied having any conversation with her about any fatalities or personal injuries arising out of a march,fire in a building owned by green door.
after calling igm,siew retained frank jacobellis of ben gruber,an insurance adjuster,to assess the fire damage to the building and present green door property damage claim to travelers.on or about april,jacobellis faxed to apopg an acord property loss notice.the notice described the loss and damage as a alarm fire caus ing extensive damage to building and serious injuries to tenants and firefighters.the cover sheet of the fax stated please forward insurance company info sic to us and have company adjuster contact us.no insurance company information was included on the form.that same day,apopg forwarded the notice to travelers.on or about may,apopg received from deleon notice of a property damage claim brought by one of green door tenants in the new york city civil court.the next day,apopg forwarded notice of the tenant claim to frontier on an acord form.on or about october,apopg sent deleon a loss run,which listed a personal property damage claim of as a liability claim and a fire loss claim of as a property claim.
iii.underlying tort action and denial of coverage by tig 
approximately three years after the fire,on march,a verified complaint was filed in new york supreme court,bronx county,by various individuals against green door,siew,and joan sonnylal,who was employed by green door as the managing agent of the building.the complaint alleged various causes of action sounding in tort and claimed damages in excess of million arising from one death and injuries to eleven persons caused by the fire.on april,tig first received notice of the fire when it received an april,letter from apopg enclosing an acord general liability notice from igm dated april.the box indicating that the claim had previously been reported was not checked.the insured was identified as green door.the occurrence was described as personal injuries.also enclosed was a copy of the summons and verified complaint from the underlying tort action.
on may,tig sent apopg,green door,and siew a letter in which it quoted the notice provision of the policy and indicated that it appeared that the failure to provide tig with notice for over three years constituted late notice and might preclude coverage.the letter requested that the recipients advise tig within business days the reason why this incident was not reported to us in a timely fashion.receiving no response to its may letter,on july,tig sent a letter to green door disclaiming coverage as a result of the breach of the notice condition in the policy.
iv.proceedings in the district court 
plaintiffs initiated the action giving rise to this appeal in august,by impleading tig as a defendant in the underlying tort action.in their complaint,plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that tig was obligated to defend and indemnify them in the underlying action.tig subsequently caused the action to be severed,removed it to the district court based on diversity
