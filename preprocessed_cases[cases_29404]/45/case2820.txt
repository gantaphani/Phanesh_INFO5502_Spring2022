f h construction f h appeals from the judgment in favor of itt hartford insurance group hartford on the parties for summary judgment.
f h brought suit against hartford under a commercial general liability insurance cgli policy issued to hartford insured,son,after declared bankruptcy.
f h had contracted with contra costa water district to build a water facility pumping plant.f h entered into a subcontract with for the manufacture and delivery of grade steel pile caps with a load capacity of pounds per square inch.after delivered the pile caps and f h welded the majority of them to driven piles,f h discovered the caps were made with grade steel rather than the agreed upon grade steel.f h now seeks damages from hartford under cgli policy for property damage.
the issue tendered by the parties is whether welding inadequate pile caps onto driven piles constitutes property damage under the cgli policy when there is no physical injury to the piles or to other property,and the defective pile caps are ultimately used as modified to meet design specifications.we hold that under these circumstances,there is no property damage.we shall therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
a.the construction project 
in september,f h contracted with contra costa water district ccwd to build the los vaqueros water conveyance facility pumping plants los vaqueros.in furtherance of that contract,f h entered into a subcontract with to supply pile cap extensions to be welded into place on steel composite piles,which are driven into the ground.the specifications for the pile caps required that they be fabricated with grade steel,which has a load capacity of pounds per square inch,referred to as ksi.
contrary to the project specifications and unbeknownst to f h,manufactured and delivered grade steel caps instead of grade caps.grade steel is comprised of steel of varying strengths and potentially includes some steel that lacks the tensile strength of the ksi steel required by the subcontract.
f h became aware that provided the lesser grade steel caps after it received the results of a mill certification indicating the pile caps did not meet the ksi strength requirement.at that time,all piles had been driven into place and of the pile caps made of grade steel had been welded onto of the piles.caps had not yet been welded into place.the use of the lesser grade steel caps produced structural units which were not damaged but were inadequate for the intended purpose of supporting the pumping facility 
in order to avoid the prohibitive cost of removing piles at a cost of to each,eliminate delay,and not damage the piles by cutting off the pile caps already welded into place,f h decided to modify the existing grade pile caps to meet design requirements.stiffener ribs or fins made of grade steel were designed and welded onto the grade pile caps and used with the original piles.the stiffener ribs provided the needed strength to avoid potential deforming,ripping,tearing,moving or failure of the caps in case of earthquake or other ground movement.
the modifications were carried out in two phases.the first phase consisted of modifying the pile caps which had already been welded onto the piles.these caps were referred to as phase i or field caps.the second phase consisted of modifying the unwelded caps and then welding them as modified to the remaining piles.these were referred to as phase ii or shop caps.by so modifying the pile caps,f h was able to complete the project using the original piles and pile caps without damaging or weakening the piles in any way.the los vaqueros project was completed on time and no liquidated damages were assessed against f 
procedural history 
on february,f h filed suit against seeking recovery of damages in excess of.in march of that same year,filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy,which stayed f h civil suit against.the bankruptcy court granted f h petition to lift the stay for the limited purpose of pursuing the civil action to obtain insurance assets.did not respond to f h complaint and on june,the superior court entered a default judgment against in the amount of.
f h then filed the present suit against hartford for damages and breach of contract seeking.the suit was brought under a cgli policy issued by hartford to covering property damage.
the parties filed for summary judgment.by written opinion,the trial court granted hartford motion,denied f h motion,and entered summary judgment in favor of hartford.f h filed a timely appeal from the judgment 
discussion 
f h contends welding the grade pile caps to the driven piles constitutes property damage within the meaning of the cgli policy issued by hartford to.hartford contends f h has failed to establish property damage as defined under the policy because there was no physical injury to the piles or to other property.we agree with hartford.

c.the comprehensive general liability insurance policy 
the cgli policy issued by hartford states in pertinent part we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage if t he property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and occurs during the policy period.the policy defines property damage in two ways physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
the parties do not dispute that an occurrence took place within the coverage territory and during the policy period.f h contends that welding the defective pile caps to the driven piles caused property damage under both definitions.we shall discuss each of these contentions separately.
physical injury to tangible property 
the policy defines property damage as p hysical injury to tangible property.this definition is the standard definition currently used by the insurance industry nationwide.esicorp,liberty mutual insurance cir,esicorp see also traveler ins.company eljer manufacturing.applying that definition,the prevailing view is that the incorporation of a defective component or product into a larger structure does not constitute property damage unless and until the defective component causes physical injury to tangible property in at least some other part of the system.paul fire marine ins.coss d.defective materials and workmanship in construction of home not physical injury new hampshire ins.vieira cir faulty installation of drywall into building not physical injury federated mutual ins.concrete units,defective concrete used in construction of grain elevator not physical injury esicorp,supra,at defective steel pipe sections welded into pipe system not physical injury traveler,supra,at,at defective pipe system used in construction of houses not physical injury aetna casualty and surety mcibs.improperly sized concrete blocks used in building construction not property damage.
some courts have even applied this rule to reject property damage claims under policies that define property damage to mean injury to tangible property.fresno economy import used cars,united states fidelity guaranty d.presence of broken head gasket in automobile not injury to tangible property hamilton die cast,united states fidelity guaranty cir,defective frames used to manufacture tennis racket not injury to tangible property.
under these cases,property damage is not established by the mere failure of a defective product to perform as intended.traveler,supra aetna casualty surety,supra.nor is it established by economic losses such as the diminution in value of the structure new hampshire ins.vieira,supra,at federated mutual,supra,or the cost to repair a defective product or structure.fresno economy import used cars,supra,d at.new hampshire ins.vieira,supra,at chatton union fire ins.th,d.
these cases are consistent with the basic purpose of liability policies,which,as explained by the court in maryland casualty reeder d,are not designed to provide contractors and developers with coverage against claims their work is inferior or defective.citation.the risk of replacing and repairing defective materials or poor workmanship has generally been considered a commercial risk which is not passed on to the liability insurer.citations.rather liability coverage comes into play when the insured defective materials or work cause injury to property other than the insured own work or products.as one commentator explained this distinction is significant.replacement and repair costs are to some degree within the control of the insured.they can be minimized by careful purchasing,inspection of material,quality control and hiring policies.if replacement and repair costs were covered,the incentive to exercise care or to make repairs at the least possible cost would be lessened since the insurance company would be footing the bill for all scrap.replacement and repair losses tend to be more frequent than losses through injury to other property,but replacement and repair losses are limited in amount since the greatest loss can not exceed the cost of total replacement.if the insured will stand these losses,insurance can be provided more cheaply since the company will be freed from administering many small claims for repairs,and it can set a rate for the more unusual risk of injury to property other than the contractor work or product.this risk can be the hazardous one since there are no natural limitations on the damage the contractor might do to a homeowner or a neighbor property.macaulay justice traynor and the law of contracts.at.maryland casualty reeder,supra,d at.
in short,a liability insurance policy is not designed to serve as a performance bond western employers ins.arciero sons,d.or warranty of a contractor product.paul fire marine,supra,d at.hamilton die cast,supra,at.
applying these principles,we find this case like those cited.the only damages alleged by f h are the costs of modifying the pile caps and the lost bonus for early completion of the project.these are not recoverable as property damage because they are intangible economic damages rather than damages to tangible property.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,fresno economy import used cars,supra,d at.chatton national union fire ins,supra,th at,d nichols great american insurance companies d.giddings industrial indem.d.new hampshire ins.vieira,supra,at.
it is undisputed the grade pile caps were an inferior product and not in compliance with the contract design specifications.however,welding the caps to the driven piles did not damage the piles or any other property it merely rendered the piles inadequate for their intended purpose,and as noted,commercial risk is not covered by liability insurance.macaulay,justice traynor and the law of contracts,supra.at maryland casualty reeder,supra,d at.moreover,f h was able to modify the grade caps and use them along with the original piles to create an adequate structural unit that met the contractual requirements.once modified,the caps served their intended purpose,further supporting the inference that the caps did not damage the piles or any other component of the piles.
although f h argues that removal of the welded caps would have damaged the piles,that fact has no bearing on the question whether there was physical injury.the undisputed evidence establishes that the piles were not removed and did not have to be removed to be adequately modified.
the cases relied on by f h armstrong world industries,aetna casualty surety th,d armstrong shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,d shade eljer manufacturing,liberty mutual ins.cir eljer are not controlling.armstrong and shade are inapposite because they involved contamination by hazardous materials,while eljer has been soundly rejected because it failed to give the full and ordinary meaning to the policy definitional words physical injury.to place these cases in the proper perspective,we first provide some historical background.
prior to,the standard cgli policies defined property damage as injury to or destruction of tangible property.see esicorp,supra,at traveler,supra,at,at.applying that definition,a number of courts held that coverage for property damage includes the diminution in the value of the building resulting from the incorporation of a defective component.ibid see geddes smith,paul mercury indemnity cal d,geddes hauenstein indem,hauenstein western cas.sur.polar panel cir.beginning in,the definition of property damage in the standard cgli policy was changed to physical injury to or destruction of tangible property.giving this new definition its plain and ordinary meaning,the majority of courts hold that it does not cover economic damages.paul fire marine,supra,d at.esicorp,supra,at federated mutual,supra,at wyoming sawmills,transportation ins.or,traveler,supra,at,at.
turning to the cases cited by f h,in armstrong world industries,supra,th,d,the court held that installation of asbestos in a building constitutes compensable property damage to the building under a cgli policy defining property damage as physical injury to tangible property.the court relied on the trial court finding that upon release of asbestos fibers into the building air supply and onto the building surfaces t he area becomes hazardous and certain measures must be taken to restore the surface to its prior condition.the court therefore applied the cases which hold that contamination of buildings and their contents from released fibers constitutes a physical injury id.at,d see cases cited therein.in so doing,the court distinguished the incorporation of defective product cases cited ante,reasoning that the rule in those cases is designed to limit the liability coverage of contractors against claim
