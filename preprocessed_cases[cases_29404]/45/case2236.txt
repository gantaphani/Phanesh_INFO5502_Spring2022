defendants gillian and uwe are two among the hundreds of names whom the society of lloyd has sued for nonpayment of reinsurance premiums.the english high court of justice,queen bench division,entered money judgments in favor of lloyd against the.lloyd then sued to enforce those judgments in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lloyd,and we now affirm.
eight circuit courts have set forth the background information that is relevant to this appeal seeing no need to reinvent the wheel,we take our description of the context of this litigation from the fifth circuit clear explications in society of lloyd turner,cir,and haynsworth v.the corporation,cir.see also society of lloyd reinhart,cir numerous courts have summarized the basic facts applicable to the underlying litigation,and these facts are not in dispute.
the parliament of the united kingdom authorized the society of lloyd to regulate a london insurance market through a series of parliamentary acts,known as the lloyd acts,passed between and.in haynsworth,the fifth circuit explained the structure of the lloyd market as follows 
lloyd is a market in which individual and corporate underwriters known as names underwrite insurance.the corporation of lloyd,which is also known as the society of lloyd,provides the building and personnel necessary to the market administrative operations.the corporation is run by the council of lloyd,which promulgates byelaws,regulates the market,and generally controls lloyd administrative functions.
lloyd does not underwrite insurance the names do so by forming groups known as syndicates.within each syndicate,participating names underwrite for their own accounts and at their own risk each syndicate is managed and operated by a managing agent,who owes the names a contractual duty to conduct the syndicate affairs with reasonable care 
names must become members of lloyd in order to participate in the market.prospective members are solicited and assisted in the process of joining by member agents,whose duties to the names are fiduciary in nature.names must pass a means test to ensure their ability to meet their underwriting obligations,post security typically,a letter of credit,and personally appear in london before a representative of the council of lloyd to acknowledge their awareness of the various risks and requirements of membership,and in particular the fact that underwriting in the lloyd market subjects them to unlimited personal liability.
participation in the market also requires the execution of a number of contracts and agreements,the most important of which is the general undertaking,the standardized contract between lloyd and the individual names.names additionally must enter into a member agent agreement,the contract that defines the relationship between the name and his chosen member agent,and one or more managing agent agreements,which define the relationships between the name and the managing agents of the syndicates he wishes to join.under the present version of lloyd byelaws,each of these agreements must contain clauses designating england as the forum in which disputes are to be resolved and choosing english law as the law governing such disputes.
haynsworth,at.
the turner court described the insurance crisis that led to lawsuits like the one now before us 
in the late and early,lloyd underwriters incurred billions of dollars of losses,due in large part to toxic tort cases.because of the enormity of the outstanding liabilities and because of the names inability to satisfy their underwriting obligations,the very existence of lloyd was threatened.to ensure both the survival of the market and the payment of policyholders claims,as well as to protect the names,lloyd devised the reconstruction and renewal r r plan,which provided reinsurance for all the names liabilities from an independent company,equitas reinsurance equitas.equitas was funded,in part,by the reinsurance premiums paid by the names.
according to lloyd,of the names accepted the offer and paid the reinsurance premium the remaining refused to accept the offer and refused to pay.as lloyd was contractually authorized to do,lloyd appointed a substitute agent for the names.the substitute agent signed and accepted the equitas reinsurance contract on behalf of the resistant names.
the turner court further explained the genesis of the referenced contractual authoriz ation that permitted lloyd to appoint a substitute agent for the recalcitrant names 
all names signed a general undertaking in which they agreed to comply with the provisions of lloyd acts,any subordinate legislation made thereunder,and any requirement made or imposed by the council of lloyd.pursuant to lloyd acts,schedule,b,lloyd obtained the power to appoint substitute agents when the council deemed it necessary.through a series of bylaws and resolutions under this act,the council was authorized to appoint a substitute agent on behalf of names specifically to execute the reinsurance contract for itself and on behalf of the members in such form as the council may direct lloyd byelaw of byelaw of resolution of.
finally,the fifth circuit described the english litigation against the recalcitrant names,upon which the english judgments in this case are ultimately founded 
lloyd paid the equitas premiums for those names,and equitas assigned its right to collect the premiums to lloyd.in late,lloyd brought collection proceedings in england against the recalcitrant names 
the lengthy litigation that followed in england took place in a series of test cases.first,the english courts tried the leighs case,society of lloyd leighs,to determine whether lloyd was entitled to appoint substitute agents to bind the names to the r r plan,to enforce the equitas contact,and to collect the premiums.the court found for lloyd,but allowed the plaintiffs to pursue their claims of fraudulent inducement against lloyd in a separate action.the english court of appeal upheld the trial court decision,see society of lloyd leighs,ewca civ,and leave to appeal was denied by the judicial committee of the house of lords,the english equivalent of the united states supreme court.
the names claims for fraud were brought all together in the jaffray action,society of lloyd jaffray,ewhc comm,in which the english courts found in favor of lloyd 
lloyd sought summary judgment against the names for the equitas premium amount in the fraser litigation.in this litigation,the names challenged lloyd calculation of the reinsurance premium after lengthy review,the trial court ruled against the names on this claim,and the english court of appeal denied leave to appeal.see society of lloyd fraser,ewca civ.
this brings us to the present litigation.gillian and uwe were among the names who neither accepted their settlement offers nor paid the reinsurance premium for their outstanding underwriting liabilities.nor did they take the opportunity afforded by the english courts to pursue separate fraud claims against lloyd.see society of lloyd,mem.op.at.
on march,lloyd sued the in england for breach of their contractual obligations to pay the reinsurance premiums.the counsel entered an appearance on their behalf.the english courts granted summary judgment against the in the fraser case,see society of lloyd fraser,ewca civ,and on december,entered individual money judgments against gillian for and against uwe for,see society of lloyd gillian mary,judgment society of lloyd uwe,judgment.
on july,lloyd filed suit against the in the united states district court for the district of columbia,seeking recognition and enforcement of the english judgments under the district uniform foreign money judgments recognition act of recognition act,et.venue was based on the status as district residents and jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship.see compl.the answered lloyd complaint and asserted a number of affirmative defenses and counterclaims.lloyd filed motions to strike the affirmative defenses under federal rule of civil procedure f and to dismiss the counterclaims pursuant to rule b.
the district court granted lloyd motions to strike and to dismiss.see society of lloyd,order at.lloyd then moved for summary judgment on its claims for recognition and enforcement of the english judgments,which the district court granted.see society of lloyd,order at.the noted a timely appeal.
we consider the affirmative defenses in part ii and their counterclaims in part iii.because the district court struck the former and dismissed the latter solely on grounds of legal insufficiency,we review those decisions de novo.see singletary district of columbia,fund for animals,norton.the defendants concede that without their affirmative defenses and counterclaims there would be no genuine issues of material fact,and that in such event summary judgment would be appropriate.appellants br.
section of the recognition act provides,in pertinent part,that e xcept as provided in section,a judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister jurisdiction which is entitled to full faith and credit.section contains a list of specific exceptions,only one of which the claim here 
a judgment need not be recognized if t he cause of action on which the judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of the district of columbia.
b.concluding that none of the four affirmative defenses came within that exception,the district court struck them all as legally insufficient to bar enforcement of the english judgments.we consider the first defense in subpart a,and the remaining defenses in subpart 
as their first affirmative defense,the contend that the judgment s obtained by lloyd in the courts of the united kingdom are repugnant to the public policy of the district of columbia and should not be recognized because the cause of action on which they were based conflicts with the public policy of the district of columbia.am.answer.the defendants list three grounds for finding repugnancy a contract can not be enforced against the party who did not knowingly assent to its terms the legislation on which the foreign cause of action was based lloyd act and the reconstruction and renewal byelaw were unenforceable and voidable as a result of lloyd failure to satisfy the conditions imposed on it by the parliament in exchange for the legislation and the lloyd act constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative and governmental power to lloyd,a private business entity.id.
as their first ground,the defendants contend that the english judgments are repugnant to district public policy because they enforce a contract to which they did not assent.the contract at issue,they argue,is the equitas reinsurance contract.that contract was not signed by them,but rather by the substitute agent appointed by lloyd to negotiate and sign for all names who rejected the reconstruction and renewal r r plan.recognition of such a contract,they insist,is repugnant to the general contract law principle that a contract requires mutual assent.
section b of the recognition act permits nonrecognition of a foreign judgment only if the cause of action on which it is based is repugnant to public policy.b emphasis added.a cause of action is the legal authority here,english contract law that permits a court to provide redress for a particular kind of claim here,lloyd contention that the defendants breached their obligations to pay the reinsurance premiums.see trudeau ftc.july.accordingly,the dispositive question is whether the core principles of english contract law are repugnant to the public policy of the district of columbia,not whether any particular application of that cause of action is repugnant 
that question is easily answered.as the district court noted,the have not suggested that english contract law principles differ substantively from those in the district of columbia.mem.op.at.indeed,district of columbia contract law,like american contract law in general,is historically derived from and similar to the english common law of contract that being the case,it would be hard to regard the latter as repugnant to the former,and no federal court has done so.see reinhart,at holding that an english breach of contract action is not repugnant to new mexico public policy turner,at holding the same with respect to texas public policy.
the defendants do not suggest,for example,that english contract law principles permit parties to be bound to a contract without their consent.rather,they contend only that this is the practical effect of the english judgments holding them responsible for a reinsurance contract they refused to sign.appellant br.but even if we were to consider repugnancy on such an as applied basis,we still could not find the judgments repugnant to public policy,because the english court did not bind the to a contract to which they did not assent.to the contrary,it held them to a contract to which they did assent the general undertaking.
when the became names,they not their agents personally signed a standardized contract between lloyd and the individual names known as the general undertaking.haynsworth,at see showing the signature of gillian on a copy of the general undertaking dated,showing the signature of uwe on a copy of the general undertaking dated.under the general undertaking,the agreed to be bound by the lloyd acts,as well as by current and future lloyd byelaws.see general undertaking oral arg.tr.at.the lloyd act specifically authorized lloyd to make byelaws for the purpose of appointing substitute agents to bind names,see lloyd act,sched,b,and such a substitute agents byelaw was in existence when the defendants signed the general undertaking,see.thereafter,lloyd issued another series of byelaws that authorized the appointment of substitute agent s on behalf of names specifically to execute the reinsurance contract for itself and on behalf of the members.turner,at citing lloyd byelaw of byelaw of resolution of.
it was no doubt risky for the defendants to agree to be bound by future byelaws in this way.but the general undertaking was no contract of adhesion.the were investors who qualified for status as lloyd names under a set of stringent criteria,and who presumably thought the upside potential was worth the downside risk including the express risk of unlimited personal liability.regardless of whether we would reach the same disposition under district of columbia contract law,we can not say that the english courts decision to bind the defendants under these circumstances is repugnant to the public policy of this jurisdiction 
the defendants press upon us the case of matusevitch telnikoff,aff,wl.may,in which a district court declined to recognize an english libel judgment on the ground that enforcement would be repugnant to the public policy of the state of maryland and of the united states.at.but in matusevitch,unlike this case,the district court noted substantial differences between a cause of action for libel in england and in the united states,including differences in both substantive law and burdens of proof.id.at.indeed,the subsequent history of that case,which neither the nor lloyd mention,only sharpens the point.on appeal,this court certified to the maryland court of appeals the question of whether enforcement of the english judgment would be repugnant to the public policy of maryland.see matusevitch,wl,at.we then affirmed the district court judgment after receiving the following answer 
a comparison of english and present maryland defamation law does not simply disclose a difference in one or two legal principles.instead,present maryland defamation law is totally different from english defamation law in virtually every significant respect.moreover,the differences are rooted in historic and fundamental public policy differences concerning freedom of the press and speech.
telnikoff matusevitch,internal citations omitted see matusevitch,wl,at.the defendants have noted no similarly substantial differences between england and the district of columbia with respect to the law of contract 
the defendants second ground for claiming that the english judgments are repugnant to district policy begins with their contention that the legislation the lloyd act that permitted lloyd to promulgate the byelaws that authorized ll
