introduction 
under insurance code section when an insurer cancels an automobile liability policy for nonpayment of premium,it must give the insured at least days notice prior to the effective date of cancellation.appellant curtis mackey mackey,on behalf of himself and the class he seeks to represent,filed this action against his insurance carrier,coast national insurance company,coast and his insurance broker,bristol west insurance services of california,bristol west claiming coast improperly denied coverage by its failure to give proper notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium.
coast sent mackey a cancellation notice days before the premium he failed to pay was due,thereby setting the effective date of cancellation on the day following the premium due date.the principal question we must address is whether insurers,such as coast,may mail a notice of cancellation in advance of the premium due date or whether it is necessary to wait until a default has actually occurred before mailing the statutory notice of cancellation.
we conclude that the cancellation notice coast issued to mackey for nonpayment of premium prior to the date on which the premium was due was in violation of section,and thus was ineffective to cancel his policy.consequently,the court improperly sustained coast demurrer to those causes of action in mackey first amended complaint fac grounded on the improper notice of cancellation of his policy.the trial court erred in determining that,as a matter of law,no coverage was owed.
however,we hold that the court properly sustained the demurrer to the remaining causes of action alleged in mackey fac.these causes of action are based on the disclosure requirements of the retail installment sales act the unruh act,the cancellation notice given to the payee under the terms of mackey insurance policy and the cancellation rights of other coast policyholders holding a different type of policy.
discussiona.statement of facts 
because this appeal follows the sustaining of a demurrer,we accept as true all properly pleaded material facts in the complaint.kotlar hartford fire ins.th,d kotlar ramirez usaa casualty ins.d.the facts,as alleged in the fac,are as follows on december,coast issued a automobile insurance policy to mackey.the policy period was to run from december,until december.the total premium for this period was.
at the time the policy was issued,coast mailed to mackey a premium billing notice and notice of cancellation if not paid the december notice.the december notice was a document outlining the series of monthly payments and their due dates necessary to maintain the policy in force for the full year.the december notice warned mackey that he should send his payment on time to avoid cancellation of his policy for of the premium.the december notice also stated,we urge you to send your payment in a timely manner,as there is no grace period for your payment.mackey made the january payment,although it was late.
on january,coast mailed a premium billing notice and notice of cancellation if not paid the january notice.the january notice stated that mackey next payment in the amount of is due by.the january notice further indicated that there was no grace period and that the policy would be canceled on february,if payment was not received by that date.prominently displayed in the january notice is the following language please send your payment on time to avoid cancellation of your policy for of the premium.we value your business and urge you to send your payment in a timely manner,as there is no grace period for your payment.if unpaid,cancellation will be effective at pacific time or sooner for other valid reasons.this is the only notice you will receive.
the january notice further instructed mackey to p ay the exact amount of your payment on or before your due date to keep your policy in full force with no lapse in coverage.the january notice showed that no premium was past due when it was sent on january,days before the february payment was due.
mackey admits that he received the january notice.he also admits that he did not pay his premium by february,the day it was due.on february,coast canceled the policy for nonpayment of the premium.no additional notice of cancellation was mailed to,or received by,mackey.mackey was involved in an automobile accident on february.on february,mackey paid his premium.coast denied coverage for claims arising out mackey february accident because,at the time of the accident,his policy had been cancelled.
mackey fac was brought as a class action,although a class has never been certified he alleged that coast improperly canceled his policy in violation of the policy and governing statutes and that coast improperly failed to provide coverage for the february accident.the fac alleged plaintiff policy was cancelled effective february,sic for nonpayment of premium based upon the notice dated january,when the payment was not actually due until february,among other things,mackey fac sought a declaration that coast was required to furnish coverage to mackey under the terms of his automobile insurance policy with respect to the february accident.based on these allegations,he asserted causes of action for breach of contract,declaratory relief,unfair business practices,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
mackey also alleged that he had entered into a premium financing agreement with respondent bristol west to purchase the coast automobile policy.he claimed bristol west failed to disclose and improperly collected finance charges and installment fees on retail installment contracts in violation of the unruh act.mackey alleged that he was entitled to recover these charges and fees and that statutory penalties should be imposed.in addition to the alleged violation of the unruh act,mackey incorporated these factual allegations into causes of action for money had and received,unjust enrichment,and unfair business practices.
additionally,mackey fac advanced theories of liability based upon notices of cancellation delivered by coast to third lienholder on his vehicle and persons who purchased prima policies from coast.in this regard,mackey alleged that on february,mackey policy had been terminated for nonpayment of mailed tech credit union,the lienholder on his vehicle,a notice of cancellation or notice.mackey alleged that coast had an obligation under the language of the policy to cancel the lienholder interest at the same time it canceled his interest.instead,coast cancelled his policy for of premium prior to the time he was involved in an accident on february,although the lien holder of his policy had until february,to make such payment.based on these allegations,mackey sought declaratory relief,and alleged causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and unfair business practices.
lastly,mackey alleged that coast provided some of its policyholders,those holding prima policies,with a grace period if they failed to make a timely payment of their insurance premium.mackey alleged that providing a grace period for prima plan insureds but not for other insureds,like himself,constituted a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he also relied on this theory of liability to support his causes of action for unfair business practices,money had and received,and unjust enrichment.
coast demurred to the fac,contending that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute the causes of action pled.coast argued that none of mackey causes of action based on the alleged improper cancellation of his insurance policy had merit because the policy was properly terminated or canceled before the date of the accident involving mackey.coast argued that both the policy and the insurance code authorized cancellation for nonpayment of premium so long as at least days notice was provided.coast emphasized that mackey admitted that he received the january notice days before the cancellation was effective.although he received the notice,mackey admitted that he paid the premium days after it was due and day after he was involved in an accident.under these facts,coast argued the cancellation was authorized under both the policy and the insurance code.
coast further argued that mackey causes of action based on the claimed violation of the unruh act were equally without legal support.in this regard,coast contended that mackey could not establish the existence of any retail installment sale,and therefore,the credit disclosure requirements of the unruh act did not apply.in addressing mackey alternative theories of liability,coast contended there was nothing in the automobile insurance policy or the insurance code that would require mackey and the lienholder to receive the notice of cancellation at the same time.moreover,coast argued that mackey could not claim the rights of coast policyholders holding prima policies and that nothing prohibited coast from giving prima policyholders rights over and above the statutory minimums stated in the insurance code.
on september,the court granted coast demurrer to mackey fac without leave to amend,and on december,the action was dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.
our review also requires us to interpret the meaning of the relevant provisions of the california insurance code.in doing so,we apply a fundamental rule of statutory construction a statute must be given a reasonable and common sense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers,practical rather than technical in nature,which upon application will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.citations.wise pacific gas electric th,d.
general overview of the law governing cancellation of mackey automobile insurance policy 
the principal question presented by this case is whether an insurer attempted cancellation of an automobile insurance policy was ineffective because the notice provided was procedurally defective,regardless of whether the insurer acted upon a valid ground for canceling the policy.as we discuss below,such a claim is made possible by the rule in california that notices of cancellation must strictly comply with statutory directives and the insurance policy termination provisions.
in california,there is no such thing as substantial compliance in furnishing notice that an insurance policy has been cancelled.see generally lee industrial indemnity d.lee.termination of coverage can only be accomplished by strict compliance with the terms of any statutory provisions applicable to cancellation.kotlar,supra,th at,d lee,supra,d at.likewise,the insurer must adhere closely to all policy provisions setting forth requirements as to the time and manner of giving notice of cancellation to the insured.naify pacific indemnity cal d,lee,supra,d at.if a cancellation is defective,the policy remains in effect even if the premiums are not paid.citation.kotlar,supra,th at,d italics added national auto.casualty ins.california casualty ins.d.
statutes governing automobile insurance invariably contain provisions requiring that notice of cancellation by the insurer be given to the insured in advance of the effective date of the termination of coverage.these provisions are usually quite specific as to the amount of time an insurer must allow between the giving of notice and the effective date of cancellation,and it is not uncommon for different time periods to be prescribed depending on such factors as the reason for the cancellation 
section,subdivision a,provides that an insurer may issue a notice of cancellation of an automobile insurance policy because of the insured nonpayment of premium.nonpayment of premium is defined in section,subdivision f,as the failure of the named insured to discharge when due any of his obligations in connection with the payment of premiums on a policy,or any installment of such premium,whether the premium is payable directly to the insurer or its agent or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit.italics added.section,which contains the legislative mandate concerning the amount of advance notice that must be furnished by the insurer in order for a cancellation for nonpayment of premium to be effective,states as follows no notice of cancellation of a policy to which section applies shall be effective unless mailed or delivered by the insurer to the named insured,lienholder,or additional interest at least days prior to the effective date of cancellation provided,however,that where cancellation is for nonpayment of premium,at least days notice of cancellation accompanied by the reason therefor this section shall not apply to nonrenewal.italics added.
legislative least days notice of cancellation 
the pivotal question is whether an insurer can fulfill the notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium requirement of section by sending notice to its insured prior to the date on which the premium,or any installment thereof,is due.although this question appears to be one of first impression in california,there is a substantial body of cases deciding exactly this question under comparable statutes 
mackey argues that the correct result in this case can be reached by simply applying the principle that ambiguities in insurance policies are resolved against the drafter,usually the insurer,and generally in accordance with the insured reasonable expectations.see,safeco ins.robert cal th,d,aiu ins.superior court cal d.he argues that a reasonable insured would interpret the policy cancellation provision to mean that if a premium was not paid when due,a cancellation notice could be based on than sic nonpayment,but not upon the anticipation of nonpayment.however,the aforementioned principles do not govern here because the question arises not under an insurance policy drawn by an insurer,but under a statute,composed by the legislature.
our supreme court in com.insurance superior court cal d,directed that where an insurance policy provision is authorized by statute it should not be construed strictly against the insurer,but instead is to be deemed consistent with public policy and must be construed to implement legislative intent.id.at,accord,jacobs fire ins.exchange d.in other words,language required by statute in an insurance policy must be construed to effect not the intent of the parties but the intent of the legislature.see com.insurance superior court,supra,at.therefore,to reach the proper result in this case,the rules of statutory construction apply.see,state farm mut.auto.ins.messinger d.interinsurance exchange marquez d.
familiar rules of statutory interpretation guide our task.words used in a statute should be given the meaning they bear in ordinary use.citations.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature citation.if the language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,however,the court looks to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.after considering these extrinsic aids,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d.
in analyzing the words used in section,coast argues that the insurer selection of an effective date for the termination of coverage is limited only by the requirement that at least days advance notice of cancellation be given.coast insists that nothing in the express language of section mandates that the period commence after the insured fails to pay the premium.coast also claims its interpretation of section finds support in an automobile insurance consumer information guide published by the california department of insurance.finally,coast argues it can not be against public policy for an insurer to issue a notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium before the point in time the payments actually become delinquent.any other construction,it warns,would afford a defaulting insured days of free insurance for the period between the default and the effective date of cancellation,which could not have been the intent of the legislature when it passed section.
we agree with coast that on the key issue before the timing of the transmittal of the notice of cancellation to the language of section,when considered alone,is silent.however we believe the statutory context of section yields an expression of legislative intent and guides us in its proper interpretation.the phrase nonpayment of premium as used in section is statutorily defined at section,subdivision f as the failure of the named insured to discharge when due any of his obligations in connection with the payment of premiums on a policy,or any installment of such premium,whether the premium is payable directly to the insurer or its agent or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit.italics added.
therefore,under california law,an insurance policy may be cancelled by the insurer for failure of the named insured to discharge when due any of his or her obligations in connection with the payment of premiums for the policy,subd.f.where cancellation of the policy is for failure of the named insured to pay a premium when due,no less than days written notice of cancellation to the insured is required by section.however,in the instant case,the notice of cancellation was not given to mackey upon his failure to pay the premium when due.instead,the notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium was sent days before the premium was due,and purported to cancel the policy day after the due date.
the obvious purpose of providing strict time limits for advance notice as a prerequisite to cancellation of an automobile insurance policy is to protect the insured against unintended termination of coverage caused by the inadvertent delay of a premium payment,and thus,to give the defaulting policyholder at least a period to cure the default or secure other insurance.see generally kotlar,supra,th at,d national auto.casualty ins.california casualty ins,supra,d.public policy certainly favors a system under which motorists will not be operating their vehicles without the benefit of public liability coverage.
coast construction of the statute ignores this purpose.it suggests that insurers have the unilateral right to select when notices of cancellation are sent,subject only to the requirement that at least days advance notice be given.any notice sent more than days prior to the premium due date would meet the requirements of the statute.but under this view,the statutory notice could be given weeks or even months before the premiums are due.in fact,coast would argue that an insurance company could fulfill its obligation under section by sending one notice,such as coast december notice,indicating the date that separate future premium payments will become due,and warning that the policy will be cancelled if any future payment is not received by its due date.
this can not have been what the legislature had in mind when it passed section.receipt of a notice of cancellation of automobile insurance should be an unanticipated event something that spurs the insured into action to protect against the potentially catastrophic consequences associated with being an uninsured something that is received routinely with each month bill as pointed out by the dissenting judge in munoz,a premature notice of cancellation for would not serve its intended function of informing an insured that his or her coverage was in danger of lapsing when the insured had no intention of defaulting,but,because of a bounced check or some other unexpected,event,fails to pay on time.munoz,supra,at.
furthermore we are not persuaded by coast reference to an informal interpretation of section contained in the automobile insurance consumer information guide published by the california department of insurance.in pertinent part,it explains the california insurance code requires days notice before an insurance company can cancel an automobile policy for of premium.however,the notice need only be a previous statement with the cancellation date on it.for example,if you are on a premium installment plan,the insurance company can satisfy their notice requirement by mailing the premium payment bill days before it is due with the cancellation date clearly stated.it is important to know that the california insurance code does not give a grace period for of premium.original italics and underlining.
first,while statutory interpretations offered by the department of insurance are to be respected,in the final analysis,the interpretation of the provision at issue here remains a question of law solely within the province of this court.cd investment california ins.guarantee th,d.moreover,the level of deference due an agency construction of a statute turns on a legally informed,assessment of such factors as the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade citation.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,italics omitted hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d.
in applying the foregoing factors,we note that the single paragraph in question contained in the informational booklet was not adopted with the formalities of an administrative regulation which might be subject to the notice and hearing requirements of proper administrative procedure.citation.jones tracy school dist.cal d.nor does it evince any consideration of the statutory language,the context of other statutory provisions dealing with notices of cancellation,or the legislative intent behind section.as such,the usual deference given to a formal agency interpretation of a statute is inappropriate,and we therefore conclude the department of insurance interpretation of section contained in the automobile insurance consumer information guide is entitled to minimal deference.
finally,coast argues that it would be financially unfair to require notices of cancellation to payment defaults.this argument implicitly assumes a grace period of free insurance would be given to insureds who fail to make their premium payments on time.however,this same argument was made and rejected in munoz.as the majority of that court conceded,the problem of free insurance where a notice default can be minimized by proper scheduling on the part of insurance companies.munoz,supra,at.it then offered the following solution to the free insurance problem,using the notice period required in new jersey if a policyholder initial premium payment,pro rated on a per diem basis,provides coverage through may,for instance,an insurer can choose to set the second premium due date at may.in such a situation,the policyholder has already paid for the fifteen days that comprise the statutory notice period in the event that he or she defaults.if during the course of the policy the insured carry date moves forward to may due to a change in coverage,we see no reason why the insurer can not at that point adjust the premium due date to may or require an additional premium payment at the time of the change in coverage that will carry the policyholder to the same date as under the previous policy.the proposed solution remedies the free insurance problem.ibid.not only do we agree with this analysis,but point out additionally the fact that coast offers a prima policy,which provides for a grace period after default,shows that insurance premiums can be adjusted to allow for california notice period.
coast also attempts to blur the important distinction between cancellation and expiration.for example,coast points to section,which provides that at least days prior to policy expiration,an insurer must deliver or mail to the named insured an offer of renewal of the policy contingent upon payment of premium as stated in the offer.under this statute,the failure of an insured to pay the premium on or before the date specified in the renewal offer will result in an automatic termination of the policy and no further notice of cancellation under section is required.kates workmen auto ins.th,d kates.
thus,coast attempts to bring this case within the purview of the aforementioned rule by arguing that mackey policy expired,as opposed to being cancelled,when mackey failed to pay his premium on february.coast claims that its december notice,which was mailed over days prior to mackey coverage being terminated,was actually a renewal offer in accordance with section,even though it does not include the terms renew or expire.therefore,since mackey failed to pay the february premium by the due date as provided in the december notice,the policy simply expired,and no further notice of cancellation was required.
cancellation is the termination of coverage,with or without cause,by unilateral action of the insurer before its expiration date.calfarm,supra,cal d at,fn,see,subd.g.expiration is the cessation of coverage by reason of passage of the policy period or the occurrence of some event anticipated by the terms of the contract.see,subd.i.here,as numerous documents attest,mackey automobile insurance policy was issued on december,and it covered mackey for a policy period expiring on december.this case involves cancellation on february,months into the policy period and months before the policy expiration date by the unilateral action of the insurer for failure of the insured to pay his premium when due.this is not a case where the policy expired by its own terms because the insured failed to pay the renewal premium at the end of the policy period.consequently,for coast to discontinue coverage at this point in time,it was required to comply strictly with the procedures set forth in section governing policy cancellation for nonpayment of premium.
nothing in kates,supra,th,d changes our analysis.while kates provides clarity concerning the relationship between nonpayment of premiums and expiration of policies,we find that it sheds no light on the question before us,which involves policy cancellation.in a nutshell,kates held that an insurer,having given notice of willingness to renew upon payment of the premium,is under no obligation to issue a notice of cancellation under section when the payment is not made and the policy expires according to its fixed expiration date.in kates,the policy was not canceled by anyone prior to the simply lapsed because of the insured failure to accept the offer to renew by making the payment within the time allowed.as we have already emphasized,in our case,mackey policy was canceled before the end of the policy term for nonpayment of premium.we do not think the kates court intended to obliterate the distinctions between cancellation and expiration.in fact,the contrast between these terms is brought into sharp focus by the following passage from kates it is evident that sections grounds for valid notice of cancellation and requirements for transmittal of notice of cancellation to insured do not apply to expiration of a policy for nonpayment of premiums.id.at,fn,d.therefore,any broad language in kates regarding nonpayment of premium and continuation of coverage was written in the context of policy expiration and renewal and therefore is,at best,tangential to the outcome of this case.
in conclusion,when section is read together with the statutory definition of nonpayment of premium and the matter is considered in light of the legislative intent,there is but one obvious,reasonable interpretation of section.it is apparent that the legislature intended to provide policyholders with a period after default before the insurer can effectively cancel the policy.this additional notice was intended to provide policyholders who default in payment of their premium an opportunity during the period to pay the past due premium and keep the policy in force or to secure other insurance.accordingly,the notice of cancellation for nonpayment of premium issued at a point in time when mackey had not failed to discharge his premium payment obligation was invalid and unenforceable and violated section as construed above.therefore,we find the trial court erred in sustaining coast demurrer to the causes of action in mackey fac based on the improper notice of cancellation of his automobile insurance policy.
cancellation notice given to lienholder 
in his fac,mackey alleges that coast acted unreasonably and arbitrarily by canceling policies of plaintiff and the class when lienholders were given a cancellation date of at least ten days later than the cancellation date provided to plaintiff mackey points out that the premium billing notice he received stated that a payment had to be made by february,or the policy would be canceled effective february.by contrast,the lienholder cancellation notice sent to tech credit union,the lienholder on his vehicle,was dated february,after the policy had already been canceled as to mackey.and while mackey was given until february,to make the payment,the lienholder was given until february,to make the payment.consequently,t he lienholder was given a grace period while the insured was not and the insurance policy was in effect for the lienholder on the date of the accident.
by way of background,the agreement between the lienholder and the property owner usually requires the property owner to obtain insurance protecting the lienholder interest so long as the secured debt remains outstanding.this is usually done through an endorsement to the property owner insurance making the lienholder the loss payee to the extent of its interest in the property.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.that way,i n the event the vehicle is totaled or stolen,the policy usually requires payment to lienholders to the extent of their liens before any payment to owners.id.at,original italics.
as we understand it,mackey argument is that the policy could not be terminated as to him because it remained in effect for the lienholder,who was sent the cancellation notice at a later time.in savarese state farm.ins.d,this division dealt with a substantially similar issue as follows cancellation of the policy as to named was specified to be effective at,june,whereas the notice to the lienholder merely stated the date,and not the hour,of cancellation.the result is that the policy remained in effect as to the lienholder after its cancellation as to the owner appellant contends that the policy can not be cancelled as to the owner so long as it remains in effect as to the lienholder.but the courts have treated the rights of the owner and the loss payee as independent citations.savarese expresses the prevailing rule that the protected interests and notice requirements of the named insured and lienholder are separate and a policy can be canceled as to one but remain in effect as to the other.see pacific ins.kent d,home savings of america continental ins.th,d.we see no reason to depart from this rule.
both the insurance code and the terms of mackey automobile liability policy confirm the unique and independent nature of the obligation coast assumed to the loss payee and to its named insured.sections and set out the general principle that a policy of insurance can be canceled for nonpayment of premium by
