in this appeal,plaintiffs seek reversal of an order dismissing their complaint which had sought damages for the alleged negligent acts and omissions of the defendant associated international insurance company hereafter,aiic.plaintiffs alleged that aiic negligently failed to timely perform its indemnity obligations under a policy of property insurance issued to a third party.concluding that plaintiffs,who were not insured parties under the policy,had no standing to complain about aiic performance,the trial court sustained aiic demurrer without leave to amend.
we have concluded that the trial court reached the correct result.plaintiffs claimed that aiic had a special relationship with them and thus owed them a duty of care.this claim rested upon the principles articulated by the supreme court in biakanja irving cal d,and its progeny.to recognize such a duty under the facts presented here,however,would ignore the later limitations imposed upon the biakanja duty analysis by the court decision in bily arthur young cal th,d.in addition,to recognize that a party could have standing to prosecute a tort claim against an insurer for its negligent investigation and adjustment of a claim filed by an insured party would give to the former greater rights than those to which the latter is entitled.an insured can recover in tort against an insurer for the improper handling of a claim only upon a showing that the insurer acted in bad faith as we explain,such a showing requires something more than simple negligence.we can not endorse such an anomalous result.
we therefore will affirm the order of dismissal.
factual and procedural 
plaintiffs are the individual owners of condominium units within the chateau chamberay condominium project project which is located on roscomare road in los angeles.the project is a common interest development within the meaning of the common interest development act,et.it is managed by the chateau chamberay homeowner association hereafter,hoa.
prior to january,aiic had issued to the hoa a homeowner policy of property insurance which provided coverage for losses from various perils,including earthquake damage.such policy covered the common areas of the project but did not extend coverage to the individual units owned by the plaintiffs.the policy was in effect on january,when the northridge earthquake occurred.the project suffered substantial damage,including damage to the structure such damage as occurred to the project,including its common areas was covered under aiic policy.the nature and extent of such damage was at all times known to aiic,whose agents and adjusters visited and inspected the project on multiple occasions after january.
the hoa timely made a proper and documented claim under the policy seeking the repair of the damage caused to the common areas of the project.aiic failed to make such repairs or provide the funds required under the policy which were necessary to complete the repairs.as a result of aiic failure to perform under the policy,the necessary repairs to the structure of the project were not made.such structural repair had to be made before plaintiffs could commence or complete the repairs to their individual units.indeed,the repair of the damage to the common areas was so necessarily intertwined with the repair of the individual units that the latter could not be accomplished without completion of the former.
as a result,plaintiffs were forced to incur the expense of finding other living quarters,or to live amidst disrepair,and suffered significant diminution in the value of their units.such additional expenses would not have been incurred had aiic timely and fully performed its obligations under the policy.
the hoa filed an action against aiic seeking damages for both breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the latter claim for bad faith was disposed of by the trial court when it granted aiic motion for summary adjudication of that claim after certain technical coverage issues were resolved by the trial court,the hoa breach of contract claim was submitted to binding arbitration and resulted in a judgment in favor of the hoa,which awarded it the sum of that judgment is now final 
in view of these circumstances,plaintiffs claim to have a personal economic interest in the prompt performance by aiic of its obligations under the policy they allege that such interest,and their risk of injury and harm if aiic did not make a timely and proper performance of its indemnity obligations,were reasonably foreseeable at the time aiic issued its policy to the hoa.indeed,they argue,the entire aim and purpose of that policy,although describing only the hoa as the named insured,was the protection of the interests of the plaintiffs who were not only the owners of the insured premises and the persons who would directly benefit from aiic performance,they were the parties who would be directly and immediately harmed by the failure of aiic to render a timely and proper performance.
plaintiffs allege that as a direct and proximate result of aiic negligent failure to discharge its indemnity obligations under the policy,and the resulting delay in the repair of the common areas,they have suffered damages consisting of a delay and inability to make repairs to their individual units,relocation costs,rental and storage expenses,and the diminution of the value of their units,all of which was reasonably foreseeable to aiic at the time it issued its policy to the hoa.
aiic responded to the plaintiffs complaint by filing a demurrer aiic argued that plaintiffs were effectively attempting to recover under the policy and they had no standing as to seek such a recovery.as individual unit owners they had no standing to prosecute a claim which belonged solely to the hoa.moreover,the damage to the plaintiffs individual interests in their units was not covered under the policy and aiic had no liability therefor as it had not agreed to assume such a burden under the policy.the trial court agreed and,on january,sustained aiic demurrer without leave to amend.an order of dismissal was entered on january.plaintiffs have prosecuted this timely appeal.
issue presented 
plaintiffs raise a novel issue.in the factual context presented here,may an insurer be subject to liability to a third party for the negligent performance of its indemnity obligations to the named insured based upon allegations that there is a special relationship between the insurer and the third party,as that term has been defined and applied in biakanja irving,supra,cal d,biakanja and its progeny 
discussion 
our review is limited to a determination as to whether a legal basis for imposition of an independent duty in negligence has been pled 
as already noted,we are reviewing an order of the trial court sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend.in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.blank kirwan cal d.irrespective of the labels attached by the pleader to any alleged cause of action,we examine the factual allegations of the complaint,to determine whether they state a cause of action on any available legal theory.ellenberger espinosa th,d,italics added accord saunders cariss d.if they do,then the trial court order of dismissal must be reversed.platt coldwell banker residential real estate services d.if they do not,then the order will be affirmed.
the principal authorities relied upon by aiic and the trial court do not really address the issue that has been presented by this appeal.for example,in gantman united pacific ins.d,the court rejected the complaint of the owners of individual units in a planned development project who had sued the insurer that had issued a policy of insurance to the homeowner association.unlike our case,however,the plaintiff owners in gantman had attempted to recover on the association policy in which they were not named as insureds.they sought to recover damages for defects in the roof of the project building.the court held that they had no standing to bring the action only the homeowner association could sue on the policy.the duty to repair and maintain the roof was the association responsibility and whatever benefits available under the insurance policy also belonged to the association,not the individual homeowners.id.at.the plaintiff homeowners did not attempt to sue the insurer on the claim that an independent duty owed directly to them had been breached.thus,the issue raised in the matter before us was not asserted in gantman.
in c h foods hartford ins.d,the controlling shareholders of the plaintiff corporation joined as plaintiffs in an action against the corporation insurer for failure to timely pay a claim.the individual plaintiffs claimed a right to join the suit based on their close and controlling interest in the corporation.they were dismissed from the action on the grounds that the only insured was the corporation and they had no standing to assert a claim which belonged to the corporation.thus,they could not assert claims for bad faith or negligent infliction of emotional distress based on the defendant insurer failure to pay a claim submitted by the corporation.id.at.again,however,the plaintiffs had attempted to recover on a claim available only to an insured party therefore,c h foods had no occasion to address the issue before us.
finally,in hatchwell blue shield of california d,a wife sought to join her husband in suing their medical insurer on the claim that the insurer had wrongfully denied benefits to her husband.the court held that she had no standing to sue the insurer.the benefits that were the subject of the claim belonged to her husband,not her.this result flowed even though wife was a under the policy,entitled to dependent benefits however,on this particular claim,she was not the claimant and that was enough to deprive her of standing.
none of these cases had occasion to consider the issue that we address and thus they do nothing to assist plaintiffs argument.if aiic owed plaintiffs a duty of care,then they are entitled to sue for its breach.if no such duty is owed,then plaintiffs negligence claim necessarily fails.it is therefore necessary for us to address plaintiffs contention,in tort,that a duty was owed to them despite the absence of contractual privity.
our review of the issue raised by plaintiffs allegations must begin with the restatement of a fundamental principle.the threshold element of a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care toward an interest of another that enjoys legal protection against unintentional invasion.rest d torts,subd.a witkin,summary of cal.law ed,torts.whether this essential prerequisite to a negligence cause of action has been satisfied in a particular case is a question of law to be resolved by the court.witkin,supra,at.bily arthur young,supra,cal th at,d,bily.it therefore may be resolved upon demurrer.
principles applicable to imposition of a duty of care to another in the absence of privity of contract 
as plaintiffs repeatedly emphasize in their briefs,their claim against aiic is founded upon the latter alleged negligent acts.plaintiffs do not claim to be parties to the policy issued by aiic to the hoa,nor do they seek recovery for its breach or for any alleged act of bad faith in respect of the discharge of duties owed under that policy.rather,plaintiffs seek to recover for damages allegedly sustained by them as a direct and proximate result of aiic breach of a duty of reasonable care,which plaintiffs assert aiic owed to them.
n egligence is conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others.rest d torts.every one is responsible,not only for the result of his willful acts,but also for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his property or person,except so far as the latter has,willfully or by want of ordinary care,brought the injury upon himself,subd.a.a judicial conclusion that a duty is present or absent is merely a shorthand statement rather than an aid to analysis d uty,is not sacrosanct in itself,but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.citations.courts,however,have invoked the concept of duty to limit generally the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow from every negligent act citations.bily,supra,cal th at,d.
over forty years ago,our supreme court employed a checklist of factors to consider in assessing the existence of a legal duty of one party to another in the absence of a privity of contract between them.in biakanja,supra,cal d,the defendant notary public had prepared the will of plaintiff brother,which left the entire estate to plaintiff.due to defendant negligence,the will was improperly attested and could not be admitted to probate.as a result,plaintiff received only his intestate succession share of the estate rather than its entirety as he would have under the will.the court concluded that defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to plaintiff,which he had clearly breached.in reaching this conclusion,the court was careful not to declare an unlimited scope of liability in favor of any person who might have received a benefit under a contract but for its negligent performance.the court emphasized that the end and aim of the transaction was to benefit plaintiff and the injury to plaintiff from defendant negligent actions was clearly foreseeable.id.at.but this would not always be true.the court said the determination whether in a specific case the defendant will be held liable to a third person not in privity is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of various factors,among which are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,and the policy of preventing future harm.ibid.
this test has been applied,in cases following biakanja,to impose a duty of care,and liability in negligence for its breach,in a variety of factual contexts.in both lucas hamm cal d,and heyer flaig cal d,disapproved on another point in laird blacker cal th,d,the court concluded that an attorney who undertakes to draft or prepare a will owes a duty not only to the testator but also to the testator intended beneficiary to complete that task in a manner which will achieve the testator purpose.when an attorney undertakes to fulfill the testamentary instructions of his client,he realistically and in fact assumes a relationship not only with the client but also with the client intended beneficiaries.heyer flaig,supra,cal d at.if the attorney task is negligently performed and the intended transfer to the designated beneficiary is thereby frustrated,that beneficiary should be allowed to recover for the attorney negligence,otherwise,no one would be able to do so and the policy of preventing future harm would be impaired.lucas hamm,supra,cal d at.
in connor great western sav.loan cal d,the supreme court again applied the biakanja factors to find that a construction lender owed a duty to third party home buyers to discover and prevent major defects in homes the construction of which were financed by the lender.because of this unique and essential position in the development process it effectively exercised control over the quality of the construction.similarly,in roberts ball,hunt,hart,brown baerwitz d,the court found that an attorney,in giving a written opinion to a client which the attorney knew would be transmitted to and relied upon by a third party in dealing with the client,owed a duty of care to such third party in providing the advice contained in the opinion.this was so because the third party anticipated reliance upon such opinion was the end and aim of the transaction.
in gregory cal d,the court had before it the claim of a plaintiff lessee who had no contractual relationship with the defendant contractor hired by the lessor but whose injury from the defendant negligence was reasonably foreseeable.the plaintiff sued the defendant for damages resulting from the delay in completion of a construction remodel of the leased premises at the sonoma county airport where plaintiff operated its restaurant.plaintiff lessor,the county of sonoma,had entered into a construction contract with the defendant to make certain improvements to the restaurant premises.the contract did not specify a completion date and thus the defendant contractor was required to complete it within a reasonable time.he negligently failed to do so and,as a result,plaintiff suffered a loss of business and profits.plaintiff filed suit alleging that defendant was liable to plaintiff for the negligent performance of his contract with the lessor.applying the biakanja factors,the court held that these circumstances established a special relationship between plaintiff and the defendant and,even though they were not in contractual privity,defendant did owe plaintiff a duty of care.id.at.
each of these cases reflect the principle that,as the biakanja case itself demonstrated,where the end and aim of the contractual transaction between a defendant and the contracting party is the achievement or delivery of a benefit to a known third party or the protection of that party interests,then liability will be imposed on the defendant for his or her negligent failure to carry out the obligations undertaken in the contract even though the third party is not a party thereto.
subsequent cases have limited the application of the biakanja principles 
as the supreme court has noted,in the context of a claim for negligently caused emotional distress,f oreseeability is endless because it,like light,travels indefinitely in a vacuum.thing lachusa cal d.it proves too much although it may set tolerable limits for most types of physical harm,it provides virtually no limit on liability for harm.citations.it is apparent that reliance on foreseeability of injury alone in finding a duty,and thus a right to recover,is not adequate when the damages sought are for an intangible injury.in order to avoid limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree of a defendant negligence,and against which it is impossible to insure without imposing unacceptable costs on those among whom the risk is spread,the right to recover for negligently caused emotional distress must be limited.id.at.these same concerns have been expressed with respect to losses that were purely economic.recognition of a duty to manage business affairs so as to prevent purely economic loss to third parties in their financial transactions is the exception,not the rule,in negligence law.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.
moreover,foreseeability is but one of the biakanja factors,although it is a very important one.bily,supra,cal th at,d.in and of itself,however,foreseeability is not sufficient.even where foreseeability is present the supreme court has,for policy reasons,declined to allow recovery on a negligence theory.in bily,the court emphasized that there were three policy concerns that had to be considered before a duty could be found under the biakanja factors liability may in particular cases be out of proportion to fault,parties should be encouraged to rely on their own ability to protect themselves through their own prudence,diligence and contracting power,and the potential adverse impact on the class of defendants upon whom the duty is imposed.bily,at,d,see also thing lachusa,supra,cal d at,nally grace community church cal d,mere foreseeability of the harm or knowledge of the danger,is insufficient to create a legally cognizable special relationship giving rise to a legal duty to prevent harm.elden sheldon cal d,p olicy considerations may dictate a cause of action should not be sanctioned no matter how foreseeable the risk for the sound reason that the consequences of a negligent act must be limited in order to avoid an intolerable burden on society.
in goodman kennedy cal d,the supreme court refused to impose liability to the plaintiffs on the defendant attorney for negligent confidential advice given to his client who thereafter entered into a transaction with the plaintiffs parties with whom the client dealt at arms length in reliance upon that advice.to impose liability in such a circumstance would inject undesirable reservations into the attorney counseling role.the attorney preoccupation or concern with the possibility of claims based on mere negligence as distinct from fraud or malice by any with whom his client might deal would prevent him from devoting his entire energies to his client interests citation.id.at.
in bily,supra,cal th,d,the court rejected a claim against an accountant that had conducted audits of a company manufacturing personal computers.even though the plaintiffs had allegedly made investments in reliance on the audit reports,the court held that an auditor can be held liable in general negligence only to the person or entity contracting for the auditing services 
in light of the relationships between auditor,client,and third party,and the relative sophistication of third parties who lend and invest based on audit reports,it might also be doubted whether auditors are the most efficient absorbers of the losses from inaccuracies in financial information.investors and creditors can limit the impact of losses by diversifying investments and loan portfolios.they effectively constitute a broad social base upon which the costs of accounting errors can be spread.citation.in the audit liability context,no reason appears to favor the alleged tortfeasor over the alleged victim as an effective distributor of loss.citations.in applying the biakanja factors,we are necessarily required to make pragmatic assessments of the consequences of recognizing and enforcing particular legal duties.in our judgment,a foreseeability rule applied in this context inevitably produces large numbers of expensive and complex lawsuits of questionable merit as scores of investors and lenders seek to recoup business losses.in view of the prospects of vast if not limitless liability for the thoughtless slip or blunder,the availability of other efficient means of for a generally sophisticated class of plaintiffs,and the dubious benefits of a broad rule of liability,we opt for a more circumscribed approach.in so doing,we seek to deter careless audit reporting while avoiding the specter of a level of liability that is morally and economically excessive.bily,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted see also quelimane stewart title guaranty,supra,cal th at,d.
as these cases,which have refused to find a special relationship sufficient to impose a duty applying the biakanja factors,make clear,it is only in a limited number of cases where such a duty will be found.we believe that this is not such a case.
the circumstances of this case do not establish a basis for imposition of a duty of care on aiic under biakanja and its progeny 
in applying the principles discussed above to the facts of this case,we recognize the unique relationship between the owners of the individual condominium units and the homeowners association that they themselves have formed under applicable statutory provisions to manage the common project.we also recognize the tenant in common ownership of the common areas by the individual unit owners.all of this,we assume,aiic necessarily had to know when it issued its policy to the hoa providing earthquake coverage for the project common areas.given the fact that such common areas included the entire structure of the project see fn,ante,we also assume that aiic necessarily knew the owners of the individual units could not use or repair their own units until the structural damage had been repaired.
with those facts as background,we fi
