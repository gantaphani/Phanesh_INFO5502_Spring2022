relator branch consultants appeals the district court dismissal of its false claims act fca complaint under the fca jurisdictional bar.see b.the district court found the bar applicable because branch complaint alleges the same general conduct and theory of insurance fraud as the fca action in united states ex rel.rigsby state farm insurance rigsby despite the fact that branch focuses on different details,geographic locations,and other insurer defendants.
we agree with the district court that branch can not avoid b jurisdictional bar by merely adding details and geographic locations to the material allegations contained in rigsby.thus,we affirm the district court dismissal as to defendant state farm fire and casualty company and allstate insurance only branch defendants that rigsby names.but,under the facts of this case,we can not hold that suit as to one is suit as to all.thus,we disagree with the district court that rigsby state farm and allstate allegations and generic naming of two other insurers,by itself,triggers the bar as to branch specific allegations against other insurers that rigsby did not name.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal as to state farm and allstate and reverse the dismissal as to all other defendants.because factual findings may be appropriate with respect to the public disclosure ground urged by the remaining defendants in the alternative,we remand the cause so the district court can consider that ground in the first instance.we also remand so the district court can consider in the first instance the remaining defendants argument that branch pleading is deficient under.b.
relator branch brought this action against eight insurance companies and six adjusting firms on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the fca the insurer defendants are participants in fema flood insurance program the wyo program.this program allows private insurance companies to write and service,in their own names,the federally backed standard flood insurance policy sfip.participants in the wyo program are responsible for determining the extent of an insured flood damage,which in turn determines the amount of benefit ultimately paid out by the federal treasury.see wright allstate ins,cir noting that payments on sfip claims are a direct charge on the united states treasury.while the program has rules applicable to all insurers in the program,the program does not involve coordinated efforts by or joint cooperation among the participating insurers.
to ensure accurate estimates of flood damage,wyo insurers are generally required to comply with certain conditions,such as submitting a proof of loss.following hurricane katrina,however,fema was forced to waive certain of these requirements in order to expedite payments to insureds.according to branch,this created a perverse incentive for wyo insurers to understate losses due to wind which an insurer would be required to pay under the insured homeowner policy and overstate losses due to flood,thereby shifting the loss from the wyo insurers to the federal government.
a.the rigsby complaint 
on april,prior to the filing of branch,cori and kerri rigsby,employees of a company that provides disaster claims management services for several wyo insurers,filed an fca claim alleging that four insurance companies defrauded the federal government by mischaracterizing wind damage as flood damage in the wake of hurricane katrina specifically,the rigsbys alleged that,while adjusting claims for certain wyo insurers,they learned that the insurers made a corporate decision to misdirect and misallocate claims from those of hurricane coverage to flood claims payable by the federal government.while the rigsbys lodged these general allegations of fraud against four wyo insurers the only specific instances of fraud alleged in their complaint concerned defendant state farm.the rigsbys alleged that state farm directed its employee adjusters and independent contractor adjusters to show flood damage whenever and wherever there was any amount of water damage,and to adjust the claim as flood insurance rather than hurricane insurance even though the primary mechanism for damage was wind,not flood waters.a djusters were told that if they initially analyzed a claim and found that the insured had less damage under flood coverage than policy limits allowed,the adjuster was told to go back through the claim a second time to ensure that the flood claim hit limits.the rigsby complaint alleged two specific instances where state farm put this fraudulent policy into practice,both dealing with katrina damage to homes in mississippi,and also alleged that they provided adjusting services for allstate.
branch complaint 
with rigsby under seal,branch filed this fca action on august,and amended its complaint on june,like rigsby,branch alleges that the wyo insurer defendants defrauded nfip by misattributing wind damage and other losses to the flood policies subsidized or underwritten by the government rather than correctly attributing such losses to causes that are covered by homeowners policies largely underwritten by themselves.but unlike rigsby,branch goes beyond these general allegations of fraud by detailing specific instances where defendants allegedly overestimated flood damage on louisiana properties.branch contends that it discovered these specific instances of fraud when various insureds hired branch to the adjustments conducted by defendants.during the course of this employment,branch alleges it discovered 
numerous examples of minimal if any flood damage and obvious wind damage,with a wyo adjustment of flood damage,
buildings with substantial roof and other damage obviously caused by wind,and a mark only inches off the floor,with all damage nonetheless attributed only to flood,and 
buildings with a substantial amount of flood damage but even more wind damage adjusted at or near flood policy limits with a relatively small portion of the loss attributed to wind.
for each of the claimed instances of fraud,branch lists the homeowner address,his or her insurance company and policy number,the amount of flood damage paid by the federal government,and a dollar amount and explanation of the true flood damage to the properties.while branch,like rigsby,names state farm and allstate,it also names a host of wyo insurers that the rigsbys did not sue branch lodges specific factual allegations against each of the wyo insurers it sued.
district court proceedings 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss branch complaint,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because a branch allegations were based on publicly disclosed information,b branch was not an original source,and c branch failed to file its first amended complaint in camera under seal at least sixty days before service.defendants also argued that branch complaint did not meet the pleading requirements of.b.subsequently,the southern district of mississippi unsealed the complaint in rigsby and,in response,defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss,arguing that rigsby barred branch complaint under b bar.
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,ruling only on the issues raised in the supplemental motion.the district court concluded that the fca bar deprived it of jurisdiction over branch complaint because the complaint alleged the same general conduct and theory of fraud as rigsby,regardless of whether branch alleged different details,different geographic locations,or other participants in the alleged scheme.branch claims are now before this court.
ii.discussion 
branch contends that the district court construction of b is inconsistent with the fca text and purpose and deviates from the interpretations of other courts.branch also asserts that rigsby can not constitute a action under b because it fails to satisfy rule b pleading requirements.defendants argue that if we accept branch arguments regarding the bar,we should nonetheless affirm on the alternative grounds of the fca public disclosure bar,e a,or branch failure to comply with the pleading requirements of rule b.
when addressing a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we review application of law de novo and disputed factual findings for clear error.krim,cir.a district court factual findings are clearly erroneous only if,after reviewing the record,this court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.baldwin stalder,cir.
fca background 
we have discussed the procedural underpinnings of the fca qui tam provisions on prior occasions and thus do not repeat them here.see riley luke episcopal,cir en banc searcy philips elecs.am,cir.it is sufficient to say that under certain circumstances,the fca permits suits by private parties on behalf of the united states against anyone submitting a false claim to the government.united states ex rel.laird lockheed martin eng g sci.serv,cir.
the history of the fca qui tam provisions demonstrates repeated attempts by congress to balance two competing policy goals.on the one hand,the provisions seek to encourage whistleblowers with genuinely valuable information to act as private attorneys general in bringing suits for the common good.id.on the other hand,the provisions seek to discourage opportunistic plaintiffs from filing parasitic lawsuits that merely feed off previous disclosures of fraud.id.to promote the latter goal,congress has placed a number of jurisdictional limits on the fca qui tam provisions,including b bar under this provision,if branch claim had already been filed by another,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and was required to dismiss the action.similar in purpose,the public disclosure bar prevents a private party from bringing a qui tam action regarding matters already the subject of public knowledge,unless that party is an original source of the information while the two concepts have a similar of parasitic have different requirements.here,the district court ruled only on the bar and did not reach the public disclosure bar.thus,we begin with the bar.
b.the fca bar 
section b bars a plaintiff from bringing a related action based on the facts underlying a pending action.although this circuit has yet to articulate a test to determine when this provision applies,those circuits to do so have uniformly asked whether the action alleges the same material or essential elements of fraud described in the pending action.in united states ex rel.lacorte smithkline beecham clinical,cir,for example,the third circuit rejected an argument that b bars only qui tam actions arising from facts identical to those underlying a pending action,noting that the text of the statute applies to related action s based on the facts underlying the pending action.id.at quoting b emphasis added.according to the third circuit,if a later allegation states all the essential facts of a claim,the two are related and b bars the later claim,even if that claim incorporates somewhat different details.id.at.
although lacorte focused primarily on the text of b,the third circuit also found support for its construction in the history of the fca.the amendment to the fca,which introduced the current version of b,attempted to achieve the golden mean between adequate incentives for insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to contribute of their own.id.at citation omitted.according to the third circuit,an overly narrow interpretation of b would disrupt this delicate balance because dozens of relators could expect to share a recovery for the same conduct,decreasing their incentive to bring a qui tam action in the first place.id.in contrast,a broader bar furthers the purpose of the fca qui tam provisions by ensuring a race to the courthouse among eligible relators,which may spur the prompt reporting of fraud.id.internal quotations and alternations omitted.
in walburn lockheed martin,cir,the sixth circuit explicitly adopted the reasoning of lacorte,holding that b applies if both complaints allege all the essential facts of the underlying fraud,even if the complaint incorporates somewhat different details.id.at quoting lacorte,at.the ninth circuit did the same in united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft,cir,although it adopted slightly different language b bars actions alleging the same material elements of fraud described in an earlier suit,regardless of whether the allegations incorporate somewhat different details.id.at see also united states ex rel.hampton healthcare,adopting the ninth circuit material elements of fraud test from lujan likewise,the tenth circuit,relying again on lacorte,has found b applicable where the action does no more than assert the same material elements of fraud described in a pending action.united states ex rel.grynberg koch gateway pipeline,cir.
we agree with these circuits that the applicability of b should be determined under an essential facts or material elements standard.accordingly,as long as the complaint alleges the same material or essential elements of fraud described in a pending qui tam action,b jurisdictional bar applies.the question then becomes whether the district court properly applied this standard,whether branch complaint avoids the potential preclusive effect of rigsby because it alleges different details,different geographic locations,and different wrongdoers.
details and geographic locations 
we agree with the district court that a relator can not avoid b bar by simply adding factual details or geographic locations to the essential or material elements of a fraud claim against the same defendant described in a prior compliant.as the third circuit explained,a relator who merely adds details to a previously exposed fraud does not help reduce fraud or return funds to the federal fisc,because once the government knows the essential facts of a fraudulent scheme,it has enough information to discover related frauds.lacorte,at see also grynberg,at the pendency of an initial qui tam action blocks other private relators from filing copycat suits that do no more than assert the same material elements of fraud,regardless of whether those later complaints are able to marshal additional factual support for the claim.any construction of b that focused on the details of the action would allow an infinite number of copycat qui tam actions to proceed so long as the relator in each case alleged one additional instance of the previously exposed fraud.this result can not be reconciled with b goal of preventing parasitic qui tam lawsuits.see laird,at.
under this framework,the district court properly dismissed branch allegations against state farm.rigsby specifically alleged that state farm,in its capacity as a wyo insurer,reallocated claims on two mississippi properties from wind damage to flood damage in a pernicious attempt to shift its costs to the federal fisc.branch brought identical allegations against state farm,except it also alleged facts concerning ten properties in neighboring louisiana.because branch can not avoid the preclusive effect of rigsby by focusing on additional instances of fraud occurring in other geographic locations,b applies to bar its allegations against state farm 
for this same reason,we affirm the dismissal of allstate,named in the rigsby complaint.we recognize that only skeletal allegations are raised against allstate in that case.we express no opinion on the question of whether a dismissal for lack of any factual basis or on rule b grounds in the rigsby case would then permit a suit by branch or any other person with knowledge of facts from suing allstate without facing the bar.in other words,if the case is essentially a sham,does it continue to be first after the court in that case dismisses it the answer to that question should await a case in which it is squarely presented.
unnamed defendants 
the district court also dismissed branch allegations against a host of defendants not named in rigsby,presumably on the theory that rigsby broad allegations preempted the entire field of wyo fraud.no circuit has directly addressed the issue of whether allegations in a action can bar related allegations against wholly unrelated defendants brought in a subsequent action.the closest cases are those holding that allegations of fr
