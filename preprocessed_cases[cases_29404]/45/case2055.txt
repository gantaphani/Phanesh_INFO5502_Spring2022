brenda roberts,a judgment creditor,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to shelter mutual insurance company,garnishee.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to,affirm in part,reverse in part and remand.
facts and procedural history 
on april,roberts obtained insurance from shelter for a vehicle that was titled and registered to both her and patrick printup,her old son.the insurance policy provided up to in liability coverage per person for both property damage and bodily injury.the policy also included in personal injury protection pip.roberts was listed as the insured with printup listed as an insured driver.
on april,printup was driving the vehicle and roberts was a passenger when the brakes apparently failed.printup drove approximately two blocks,then turned onto a downward sloped alley.he then lost control of the vehicle and struck a utility pole,chain link fence,and park bench.roberts sustained bodily injuries,and city property was damaged.roberts medical bills exceeded.the city property damage was valued at.
on april,printup roberts contacted shelter number.one or both of them reported roberts was hurt in an accident and that printup brakes had failed.shelter coded the accident as a,which means a collision with the insured at fault.app.at.shelter assigned lezlie siebolt to work on the case.siebolt supervisor reviewed the file on may,noting roberts might have a bodily injury claim,that pip benefits would apply,and that medical information should be collected.supervisor gary dauer indicated he was alerting siebolt that she needed to consider a potential claim by roberts against printup.dauer noted that siebolt need ed to look at the total for bi exposure.id.at.bi appears to refer to the policy liability bodily injury coverage.id.at.
on may,siebolt took roberts statement.roberts confirmed she was a passenger in a car driven by printup,the brakes failed,and she was injured.concerning printup actions,roberts said there was nothing really he could do though he did everything i thought he should have.id.at.based upon this conversation with roberts,shelter did not at that time have reason to believe a liability claim against printup was imminent or inevitable.
after this conversation with roberts,shelter notified its pip unit of the incident.shelter also paid the property damage claim resulting from the accident.on june,roberts submitted a pip application to shelter,and on august,roberts signed medical authorizations related to her pip claim.shelter subsequently paid the first medical bills roberts submitted,which immediately exhausted the pip limits.shelter then closed roberts pip claim.
a factual dispute exists between shelter and roberts as to whether roberts contacted shelter prior to april,inquiring as to whether she had a right to assert a claim under the liability portion of the insurance policy.roberts indicates a friend informed her that she might be entitled to additional money.upon learning this,roberts contacted shelter.roberts asked about the money bodily injury claim and she told me i was not entitled to it and that was the end of the conversation.id.at.shelter denies this conversation occurred.
on april,roberts consulted with an attorney,which is when she learned the statute of limitations would soon bar filing a liability claim.therefore,that same day,roberts mailed a letter to shelter topeka claims office offering to settle all claims for the policy limits.roberts letter stated i am running out of time and need your answer within ten days.id.at.
on april,roberts filed a petition in state court.because she did not want to pursue a lawsuit against her son and anticipated a prompt settlement,she directed the clerk to withhold issuance and service of a summons on printup.however,when the time for accepting the offer expired without a response from shelter regarding her offer,roberts directed the clerk to proceed.shelter hired a law firm to defend printup.printup sought and obtained removal of the action to federal district court.
roberts demand letter was marked received on april at shelter claims office.the claims office mail handler erroneously concluded the letter related to a pip claim,which meant that it would be handled by shelter pip department in columbia,missouri.on april,the letter was mailed to the pip department,which in turn mailed roberts letter to the kansas city claims department,where it was received on may.
on may,a shelter supervisor contacted a shelter litigation attorney regarding roberts demand.the two concluded that upon confirmation of the medical bills,shelter would pay the limits of its liability coverage.that same day,siebolt advised roberts of shelter position and requested copies of her medical bills.shortly thereafter,shelter offered the liability policy limits.roberts declined the offer.
the district court subsequently approved a settlement and entered judgment in favor of roberts and against printup for.printup assigned his rights to an action against shelter for breach of contract to roberts.id.at.in return,printup received a covenant from roberts not to execute on printup personal assets.shelter paid the policy limits to roberts,and the parties agreed that the acceptance of these monies did not constitute a waiver or estoppel of roberts right to pursue collection from shelter of the balance due on the judgment.id.at.similarly,the parties agreed that shelter payment of these monies did not constitute an admission that it breached its contract with printup or acted negligently or in bad faith in the handling,investigation,negotiation,and resolution of the claim and lawsuit which roberts has made and filed against printup.id.at.roberts then filed a garnishment proceeding against shelter to collect the balance of the judgment.
roberts alleged that shelter acted negligently or in bad faith in handling the claim against printup in the following respects failure to comply with generally accepted standards of care in investigating the liability claim against printup failure to properly evaluate the claim failure to properly document claim activity in the liability claim file failure to properly train and supervise claims personnel failure to give equal consideration to the interests of its insured failure to initiate negotiations for settlement when it was apparent that liability was reasonably clear and damages were in excess of policy limits and failure to accept,or even respond to,a policy limits offer of settlement allowing it to expire.the district court granted summary judgment to shelter on all claims.roberts appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.simms ex rel.of mental health and substance abuse,cir.summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.simms,at.
citing land roper,cir,shelter asserts greater weight should be given to the district court conclusions because a district court sitting in diversity is entitled to deference as to determinations regarding the law of the state in which it sits.we note,contrary to shelter argument,that the united states supreme court has held that no form of appellate deference is acceptable,when we are asked to review a district court determination of state law.salve regina college russell,d.accordingly,a federal district court determinations are entitled to no deference and are reviewed de novo.woolard jlg industries,cir.
iii.faith of insurer in handling claim against insured 
roberts contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to her claims for negligence and bad faith in shelter handling of her claims against printup.
prior to april,
roberts argues shelter obligation to negotiate a settlement in good faith and without negligence was triggered when the covered loss was reported on april,when she presented a claim before april.the district court concluded that under kansas law shelter was under no duty to initiate settlement negotiations prior to a claim being presented.roberts printup,d.because the court concluded that t here wa s nothing in the record evidencing that plaintiff made a bodily injury claim under the liability portion of the insurance policy prior to april,it determined shelter was entitled to summary judgment on roberts claims insofar as they related to conduct preceding roberts april letter.id.at.
whether duty to settle arises through reporting an accident 
roberts contends a duty to settle arises before a claim is made through reporting a covered loss.kansas imposes,under certain circumstances,a duty upon an insurer to initiate settlement negotiations even without an offer to settle being made by the claimant.coleman holecek,cir.rather than this duty hinging on the existence of a claimant settlement offer,a kansas insurer duty to settle arises if the carrier would initiate settlement negotiations on its own behalf were its potential liability equal to that of its insured.id.
t he duty to consider the insured interest arises because of a claim for damages in excess of the policy limits,not because a settlement offer had been made.city of hobbs hartford fire ins,cir.the existence of a claim for damages in excess of the policy limits creates a conflict of interest between the insured and the carrier that requires the carrier to give equal consideration to the interests of the insured.coleman,at.further,under kansas law,t he insurer is obligated to initiate settlement negotiations regardless of the actions of the injured party.smith blackwell,d.this obligation results from t he fiduciary relationship of the insurer and the insured,which imposes a duty upon the insurer to make reasonable efforts to negotiate a settlement of a claim against the insured.id.however,the kansas supreme court rejected the argument that any time an insurance agent acquires knowledge of some injury to a policyholder it becomes the company duty to initiate an investigation and offer a settlement without any claim being made sloan employers cas.ins,dallas,texas.instead,the court found that the insured has some duty to give notice to his company of his loss,and of the fact that he is making a claim under his policy,before the company is obligated to move.id.emphasis added.as noted by shelter,it seems odd to think that an insurer as part of its duty to the insured should beat the bushes to advise potential claimants to sue or make claims against their insured,especially if there is a possibility of an excess claim.aplee.br.at.the district court properly determined that an insurance company does not have a duty to the insured to initiate negotiations prior to a claim being made.
whether roberts presented a claim before april,
roberts contends that she presented a claim to shelter on two occasions prior to april.first,she contends the initial report of the accident effectively included a claim.second,she contends she effectively presented a claim when she contacted shelter prior to april,to inquire about making a claim.the issue is whether either of these actions prior to april,constituted the presentment of a claim.
whether the initial reporting included a claim 
roberts contends the initial reporting included a claim.roberts is correct that shelter was treating the loss,and acting,as if a claim had been made.aplt.br.at.roberts is also correct that a claim was made.in fact,two claims were actually made.however,roberts asserted a pip claim,not a liability claim,against printup,and the other claim related to the property damage suffered by the city where the accident occurred.shelter response indicated its belief that these claims were made,but that a liability claim had not been made against printup 
on april,roberts printup contacted shelter to report an accident through shelter reporting line.by may,shelter supervisor dauer was aware that roberts had a potential claim against printup and wanted seibolt to acquire all information possible about any bodily injury that roberts may have suffered.
it is not necessary that a party initiate litigation by the filing of a complaint before the insurer duty arises to act in good faith and without negligence in the handling of a claim against an insured.smith blackwell,d.the court in smith concluded that the insurer receipt of a policy limits demand imposed upon the insurer a duty of good faith and to act without negligence in handling such a claim against the insured even though a suit had not been filed.id.however,knowledge that a party may pursue a claim is not the equivalent of the smith policy limit demand,nor does this knowledge create tension between the interests of the insurer and the insured,for at this point there is only the potential of a claim,not an actual claim to be settled.it is the insurer control over approving a settlement and the tension between the interests of the insurer and the insured that necessitates the imposition of a duty upon the insurer to consider the interests of the insured.bennett conrady.
applying those principles to the case at hand,we conclude that at the point when the accident was initially reported,and later when the accompanying pip and city property damage claims were made,the interests of the insured and the insurer were not yet in conflict.
ii.whether the,liability inquiry constituted a claim 
roberts contends that she made a claim by calling shelter before april,to inquire into making a bodily injury liability claim for the policy limit.shelter describes roberts call as a phantom claim and denies that roberts had such a conversation with its representative.for purposes of summary judgment,however,we must accept roberts version of the facts and assume the call roberts describes did in fact occur.
the district court concluded the call was not significant because roberts did not rely upon the information shelter gave her.specifically,the court held 
there is a factual dispute as to whether roberts contacted shelter agent hackerott to inquire whether she m ight have a claim.roberts claims that the agent told her she had no claim,while hackerott expressly denies such a conversation occurred.in any event,the court considers this factual dispute immaterial,because roberts testified that she did not rely on hackerott information 
roberts,d at.
the district court conclusion,which rested upon whether roberts relied on shelter response,is flawed.shelter owed its duty to act in good faith and without negligence to printup,not roberts.see stewart mitchell transport,d.roberts lack of reliance upon shelter assertion that she was not entitled to the liability limit for her bodily injuries is immaterial to whether shelter fulfilled its duty to printup.see id.shelter can not avoid its potential responsibility to printup to initiate settlement negotiations by falsely informing roberts that she was not entitled to pursue such a claim.
when roberts was informed by a friend that she might be entitled to additional money beyond the pip benefits,roberts contacted shelter to inquire into this matter.roberts was aware that she had a possible claim or might be entitled to recover on the basis of a liability claim involving her son.roberts described her conversation with hackerott in this way i asked her about the money the bodily injury claim and she told me i was not entitled to it and that was the end of the conversation.app.at.again,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to roberts,she endeavored to make a liability claim and was prevented from doing so by shelter.the district court erred in determining as a matter of law no claim was presented prior to the april letter.in turn,the district court erred in determining the insurer was under no duty to initiate settlement negotiations before receipt of roberts letter.
the april,letter 
roberts contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment to shelter on her claims that,as regards printup,shelter acted negligently or in bad faith in its handling of her policy
