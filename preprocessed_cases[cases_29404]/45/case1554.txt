hartford life and accident insurance company hartford appeals the district court determination claud sloan qualifies for disability benefits under a plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.we affirm.
in,claud sloan began working for the ang coal gasification company,which subsequently provided him with disability benefits under an erisa plan issued by confederation life insurance company confederation.on december,a hydraulic door came down on the back of his head and neck and fractured his vertebrae.after rehabilitation,he tried returning to work.on february,unable to continue working because of his accident,he applied for disability benefits.
the plan provided for months of disability benefits if sloan was unable to perform the duties of his own occupation.after months,he could receive benefits only if he was unable to perform the essential duties of any occupation.he received months of benefits under the own occupation standard.confederation initially denied benefits under the any occupation standard,but reversed its decision following sloan administrative appeal.the letter informing him of his right to disability benefits stated 
you have made a strong case for total disability which could translate well into a social security pursuit.our definition of total disability after months is very similar to the definition used by social security.since we are admitting sloan as totally disabled from all occupations,he should reapply for social security disability benefits and pursue it to all levels if necessary.
sloan applied for social security disability benefits in,and.each time he was denied.
sloan continued receiving disability benefits for several years while the plan was administered by confederation.in,the administration and liability of the plan transferred from confederation to hartford.after the transfer,hartford decided to review sloan claim,which included asking him to undergo an independent functional capacity evaluation,reviewing his medical records,interviewing him and his treating physicians,and performing surveillance on him.on november,following its review,hartford terminated his disability benefits.he filed an administrative appeal.on may,hartford upheld the decision to terminate sloan benefits.
after being terminated from disability benefits,sloan tried to work as a courtesy driver beginning in august.he worked until march,but quit due to continued pain and fatigue,telling his treating physician he just could not keep doing what he was doing and could not live like that.after a full examination,his treating physician notes state,i do see that sloan needs to focus on getting work right now as this would be very difficult for him.he is easily overwhelmed in fact,i do see him as ever working as gainfully employed.
on january,sloan filed his fourth application for social security disability benefits.he also commenced an action against hartford in state court seeking reinstatement of his disability benefits.hartford removed the action to federal district court.sloan and hartford agreed to dismiss the federal action,however,to allow him to pursue his social security appeal because hartford was entitled to offset social security benefits he might receive from any disability benefits that may be owed under the plan.following the stipulation,the district court dismissed the action without prejudice.
sloan fourth application for social security benefits was initially denied,but after multiple appeals,was ultimately reopened.at an administrative hearing,he introduced a letter from roger kennedy dated march.the letter was generated in response to a questionnaire sent to the doctor by sloan attorney.kennedy letter states in relevant part 
i was claud treating physician from through.
i did understand that claud work was sedentary but was scheduled in shifts with his being able to sit and stand at will.i couched other work restrictions in some specifics to exclude anything other than sedentary work.i also understood that he could only work for very short periods of time without making his pain intolerable.he was able to work approximately of the expected work shift.
at no time since,has claud been able to perform even sedentary work on a regular daily basis for because of his disabling pain.
his complaints of pain,though unusually severe,seem credible and quite reasonable when related to the unusually severe neck injury which he sustained.some injuries simply cause persistent,disabling pain which may not be amenable to treatment.the mechanism of his injury would seem quite consistent with injury to his neck skeletal structures and swallowing of which show relatively little structural changes on exams,and scans.
prescription narcotic medications certainly can dull people thought processes,memory and judgment which in turn can endanger themselves and others.i really ca speak specifically about this in claud case.
yes.even frequent position changes at will did not seem to effectively alleviate his pain.
lifting any significant amount of weight,if it increases his pain and interferes with his work ability is considered contraindicated,simply as another means of making his pain manageable enough that he could continue to work.
the need for rest and frequent change of position seems credible and reasonable.
sloan also testified before the administrative law judge alj at the hearing,describing how his injuries and resulting pain affected his ability to work.following the hearing,the alj issued a decision finding him disabled as of february,giving great weight to kennedy letter and finding sloan testimonial allegations of pain credible and persuasive.the favorable award entitled him to social security disability benefits retroactive to january,or months prior to his last application for social security benefits.see indicating a successful claimant may receive benefits for up to months immediately before the month in which your application is filed b same.
on january,armed in part with the favorable social security decision,sloan refiled suit against hartford in federal district court seeking reinstatement of his disability benefits retroactive to november,the effective date of hartford termination.both parties filed motions for summary judgment,which the district court denied.the district court set the case for a bench trial,but the parties agreed to forego a bench trial in favor of proceedings on the briefs and a stipulated fact record.
sloan filed a motion for introduction of additional evidence outside the administrative record,the favorable social security decision and the medical records contained in the social security administrative record.the district court granted his motion,finding good cause existed under the circumstances present in this case.sloan hartford life accident ins,d.
because the plan did not grant hartford discretion to interpret plan language or determine eligibility for benefits,the district court applied de novo review to determine whether sloan qualified for disability benefits.id.at.under that standard,the district court determined he was entitled to disability benefits.the district court based its decision,in part,on a conclusion the plan was ambiguous with respect to whether disability benefits were owed only to a claimant who could not engage in any or whether a claimant who could work was still entitled to benefits.the district court construed the ambiguity against hartford and concluded the plan provided benefits to a claimant who could work.in the alternative,the district court found as a matter of fact that sloan could not engage in even work,basing its finding upon the medical evidence in the record,the favorable social security decision,and sloan failed attempt to work part time in late and early.id.at.
because hartford was allowed to offset the social security disability benefits sloan was entitled to receive as of january,the district court calculated the amount of past due disability benefits hartford owed after offsetting social security benefits,as follows
