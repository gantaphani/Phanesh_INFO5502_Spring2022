this case deals with whether disability benefits should be provided to rufus caldwell by life insurance company of north america lina.lina denied caldwell claim for both own occupation and any occupation total disability benefits on review,the district court upheld lina determination as to any occupation benefits,but held that caldwell is entitled to own occupation benefits for disability resulting from injuries suffered while working for western atlas international western atlas it also awarded prejudgment interest to caldwell.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
from november,until april,rufus caldwell was employed by western atlas international western atlas,an oil drilling services company.caldwell held a number of positions during his tenure at western atlas,including rig hand,completion engineer,senior completion engineer,and customer service representative.in the last of these jobs,which he held at the time of his accident,he was required to perform the relatively sedentary duties of a normal customer service representative,as well as a variety of more tasks.western atlas listed caldwell duties as involving sitting,walking,standing,bending,reaching,and stooping.app.vol.ii at.the company also stated that caldwell was occasionally required to carry,push,pull and lift objects weighing between and pounds for distances of to feet.id.
caldwell described his job as follows in his deposition 
q.at the time you suffered that injury in january of,what was your title,the title of your position 
customer service representative.
was there a job description that you are aware of for that position 
a.it was work.
q.what do you mean by that 
a.if they had trouble on a location,i was supposed to go out and please the company we were working for and see what we had to do to make the job right.
q.that was your job title and the duties that you understood that you were to do is that correct 
yes,sir.that,and i did a little bit of selling,but not much.
q.in actuality,did you have other duties that were required of you,other than those you have just described 
i ran a relief truck,if they did have enough engineers if they did have enough rig hands,i had to rig.
q.what do you mean you ran a relief truck 
a.they used me as a relief engineer,logging and perforating.
tell me what kinds of physical activities you would be involved in 
rigging was lifting anything from a gun to a gun.
q.what other physical activities would you have to do 
help rig up and help rig down,all the work that goes with the job.
id.vol.v at emphasis added.caldwell also testified 
q.what would happen if you did do those things that you have described to act as a rig hand or run a relief truck 
i would have been relieved of my job.
was that made clear to you 
id.at.most significantly for present purposes,the company required caldwell to lift and move heavy objects with some regularity,including anything from a logging tool to his share of a perforating gun.id.at see also id.at.it is undisputed that western atlas expected caldwell to fulfill the duties of other positions,especially that of rig hand,as needed by the company.
oil drilling is a physically demanding job that results in a great number of injuries.caldwell medical history demonstrates the toll the work took on his body.he suffered repeated injuries throughout his decade and a half with western atlas that caused him chronic neck,back,knee,and elbow pain.on january,caldwell was injured while fulfilling rig hand duties at a drilling site.id.at i was going to help my hand rig down we were shorthanded.he was descending from a truck when he caught the toe of his boot on a step and fell to the ground.as a result of the fall caldwell suffered a chip fracture and severe sprain in his ankle.he went to fleske,who placed his ankle in a cast.caldwell was on crutches during the time he wore the cast.fleske removed the cast on february and by march allowed caldwell to discontinue use of the crutches.nevertheless,pain and swelling in his ankle did not subside.
in seeming contradiction to the claim that he was disabled,caldwell did not miss any work in the months after he was injured.however,he testified that western atlas had him come to work to perform only the sedentary duties of his job.thus,caldwell testified in his deposition that w hile i was in the cast,i did customer service work and after the cast was off,i did what little i could do around the shop.if they would tell me to do what i could do,i did do it.id.at.he also testified that,at the time he was laid off,he was not able to do the part of his job that required lifting.id.at.this evidence is not disputed.
on april,western atlas terminated caldwell.his ankle pain persisted in july when fleske saw him for the last time and recommended that he continue physiotherapy and see a bone specialist in oklahoma city,closer to his home.on july,caldwell saw larry white in oklahoma city.white noted that caldwell continued to suffer a great deal of ankle pain and was suffering constant low back pain that worsened with activity.id.vol.iii at.the ankle swelling and pain still persisted in november,at which time glenn smith concluded that caldwell had a permanent disability due to the loss of range of motion and chronic pain in his ankle.id.at.the doctor advised caldwell that he would not be able to return to the type of employment that he had prior to the injury.id.
caldwell subsequently spent a year working as a truck driver,delivering materials to drilling sites after western atlas terminated him.the job required no heavy lifting,and he discontinued this business when his doctors ordered him to do so,because even driving aggravated his back problems.
lina,a division of cigna corporation,provided life insurance and disability coverage to employees of western atlas.lina was both the administrator and insurer of the plan.in march,after learning about the disability policy,caldwell filed a claim with lina for disability benefits and also added lina to the present federal court action that he had pending against western atlas for wrongful discharge under the policy held by western atlas,lina was required to pay own occupation disability benefits to an employee for the first months after sickness or injury if the employee was unable to perform all the essential duties of his occupation.id.vol.ii at.lina denied caldwell claim in july on grounds that he had failed to establish he was totally disabled within the meaning of the own occupation provision of lina policy.this determination accordingly precluded caldwell claim for any occupation disability benefits as well caldwell appealed the denial to the district court,which held that lina had not conducted a full and fair review of the claim and remanded it for further administrative proceedings.caldwell life ins.of,caldwell i.
lina conducted a second review of the claim and,in a letter dated october,it again denied caldwell both own and any occupation disability benefits.on review of this second denial,the district court held the lina administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious as to own occupation benefits.the court determined caldwell was,in fact,disabled from performing all the essential duties of his own occupation at the time he was fired by western atlas,and that this disability continued through january.caldwell life ins.of,d,caldwell ii.the court affirmed the administrator decision denying any occupation benefits for the period thereafter.id.at.
on appeal,lina raises two issues.first,it claims the district court erred in reversing the lina administrative decision as arbitrary and capricious because,lina maintains,the district court misapplied the sliding scale standard of deference applicable to administrative decisions.second,lina claims the district court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest to caldwell.caldwell the district court decision to affirm lina denial of any occupation benefits.
lina first challenges the district court reversal of its administrator decision to deny caldwell own occupation disability claim.specifically,lina maintains the court failed to properly analyze the nature and effect of lina conflict of interest as the administrator.
the district court used an arbitrary and capricious standard in analyzing lina denial of benefits.caldwell ii,d at.caldwell does not challenge this determination on appeal.the district court determination of whether an erisa benefits decision is arbitrary and capricious is a legal conclusion subject to de novo review.sandoval aetna life cas.ins,cir.
indicia of arbitrary and capricious decisions include lack of substantial evidence,mistake of law,bad faith,and conflict of interest by the fiduciary.id.at charter canyon,at.substantial evidence is such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached by the decisionmaker.sandoval,at quoting flint sullivan,cir alteration in original.substantiality of the evidence is based upon the record as a whole.in determining whether the evidence in support of the administrator decision is substantial,we must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.washington shalala,cir quoting nieto heckler,cir see also casias sec y of health human,cir citing universal camera nlrb.we give less deference if a plan administrator fails to gather or examine relevant evidence.kimber thiokol,cir.moreover,if a conflict of interest exists,the reviewing court must decrease the level of deference given to the conflicted administrator decision in proportion to the seriousness of the conflict.chambers family health plan,cir see also pitman blue cross blue shield of oklahoma,cir.
the district court held that the lina administrator decision was entitled to some deference,but that deference would be lessened to the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict it found.caldwell ii,d at.lina is both the administrator and insurer of the western atlas disability plan.as such,an inherent conflict exists.pitman,at.lina does not deny that under our case law it was operating under a conflict.rather,relying on our decision in kimber,it contends the district court failed to make the required analysis of the nature or severity of that conflict.see at.we need not address this issue because we conclude that the lina administrator decision is arbitrary and capricious without regard to the conflict.
under lina policy,own occupation disability occurs when an employee is unable to perform all the essential duties of his occupation.app.vol.ii at.payments begin only when lina receives due proof that the employee became totally disabled while insured for this long term disability insurance and his total disability has continued for a period longer than the benefit waiting period shown in the schedule.caldwell ii,d at quoting lina policy.lina decision to deny caldwell disability claim rested on three main sources the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge in caldwell worker compensation case the findings and conclusions stemming from his social security disability claim and caldwell medical records.we analyze each of these sources separately.
the administrative law judge,in denying caldwell worker compensation claim under the applicable kansas scheme,determined caldwell was never temporarily totally disabled.the judge pointed to the fact that caldwell returned to work with an ankle cast in february and continued working until he was fired on april.the lina administrator decision letter quoted the alj determination that claimant testified that he was capable of performing the duties of a customer service representative,that he worked up until the time of his departure,and that his condition substantially worsened following his departure from western atlas.app.vol.iv at.lina also relied on the social security administrative decision finding that caldwell became totally unable to work on august,which was more than a year after he left western atlas.
the district court held the findings and conclusions of the two administrative proceedings irrelevant to caldwell ability to perform his own job duties when employed by western atlas.we agree.significantly,the kansas workers compensation act stated during the relevant time period that t emporary total disability exists when the employee,on account of the injury,has been rendered completely and temporarily incapable of engaging in any type of substantial and gainful occupation.stat.ann.b supp.emphasis added.as we have pointed out,the relevant lina standard for own occupation disability is whether caldwell was capable of performing his own job at western atlas on april.the lina administrator admitted that she based her decision in part on the determination of the workers compensation judge,app.vol.i at,despite not knowing what the standard was in kansas in for qualifying for temporary total disability benefits,id.at.
the social security hearing on which the lina administrator relied in denying own occupation benefits to caldwell was also aimed at determining caldwell ability to perform any job for which he was qualified.the lina administrator reliance on the workers compensation and social security decisions to deny own occupation benefits was thus arbitrary and capricious given that each such determination relied on irrelevant standards that conflicted with the lina policy definition of own occupation disability.
the lina administrator also ignored evidence that was relevant to her decision.a key determination in the inquiry before the administrator was whether caldwell could perform all the essential duties of his job at the time he left western atlas.caldwell does not deny that he could perform the normal duties of a customer service representative on april.as we have noted,however,it is undisputed that western atlas required caldwell to perform more than just those sedentary duties.caldwell presented unrefuted evidence of his heavy lifting duties.western atlas itself described the customer service representative job on a form as requiring occasionally more than seldom the carrying,pulling,pushing,and lifting of to pounds and as working dangerous machinery,oilfield service rigs.id.vol.ii at.
the lina administrator testified that she was aware caldwell customer service job occasionally required lifting and carrying to pounds.id.at.she further testified that she assumed he could fulfill the lifting and carrying requirements of his job,having relied on the workers compensation judge determination that caldwell was not disabled during the relevant time period.in making this determination,the lina administrator failed to assess all of the relevant evidence.in her determination letter,the administrator said that she had reviewed,among other things,t ranscripts of the worker compensation deposition of caldwell taken on and.id.vol.iv at.however,those records include caldwell testimony that western atlas required him to perform the duties of a rig hand when they were shorthanded,that he was performing those very duties when he injured his ankle in january,and that the rig hand duties required heavy lifting he could not do after his ankle injury.despite having this unrefuted evidence before her,the lina administrator concluded caldwell has not established that he was unable to perform all the essential duties of his occupation as a customer service representative either as of or.id.vol.iv at.
the lina administrator also based her decision on a skewed reading of caldwell medical records.her decision relied almost exclusively on the medical records of fleske,who treated caldwell at the time of his injury.specifically,the administrator stated that fleske medical records do not support the conclusion that caldwell was unable to return to his job as a customer service representative.she noted that fleske placed no restrictions on caldwell activities as a customer service representative,and that years after he stopped treating caldwell,fleske wrote lina from treating that type of problem caldwell would be off work for a brief period of time but should not be totally or permanently disabled.id.at.
a closer review of the record reveals the questionable worth of fleske records and opinions with regard to the issue before us.nowhere in the record does it indicate that fleske was aware of the full range of duties western atlas required of caldwell.a release to work without clear knowledge that caldwell had to engage in heavy lifting does not provide substantial evidence that caldwell could perform all the essential duties of his job.
further undermining lina reliance on fleske records and testimony is the fact that fleske care of caldwell was brief.caldwell saw fleske regarding his ankle for the first time on february.significantly,on july,fleske recommended that caldwell seek help from a doctor in oklahoma city for his continuing ankle problems.doctor and patient never saw each other again as a series of other doctors took over caldwell treatment.white and smith,the doctors who treated caldwell immediately following fleske,noted that caldwell suffered chronic ankle pain.app.vol.iii at.smith concluded that caldwell continuing pain prevented him from engaging in the type of work he was doing at western atlas prior to his surgery.id.at.in other words,contrary to the finding of the lina administrator,the medical evidence clearly shows that the problem for which fleske treated caldwell did not resolve itself in march but rather continued long after caldwell dismissal from western atlas in april.the lina administrator did not mention either smith,to whom caldwell was referred by fleske,or white in the final decision denying own occupation disability benefits.we have recognized that deference is decreased when a plan administrator fails to gather or examine relevant evidence.kimber,at.
the lina administrator also misconstrued caldwell testimony.the decision correctly states caldwell testified that fleske released him to work in march and that caldwell understood the release to be for light duty.app.vol.iv at.the decision also quotes caldwell as stating that he could do the customer service work,and,in response to a question from an attorney for the insurance company,agreed that he could do the work that went along with his job title.id.quotation omitted.taken out of context,of course,caldwell own statements seem to undermine his contention that his disability prevented him from performing his job on april.when viewed in light of the entire record,however,his statements are wholly consistent with the assertion that he could not perform all the essential duties western atlas expected him to perform.he could perform the sedentary duties of a customer service representative,but not those of a rig hand,the very duties he was performing on the day he was injured.
our de novo review of the record supports the conclusion that caldwell was unable to meet the rigors of the rig hand position after his injury on january.caldwell visited one doctor after another who confirmed what fleske observed at the time of the accident serious ankle pain.that the disabling pain continued,and even grew worse,in the months following western atlas firing of caldwell tends to support the view that caldwell could not perform all the essential duties of his job at western atlas after his injury in january.the lina administrator conclusion to the contrary is not supported by substantial evidence.in short,we agree with the district court,especially in light of the lina administrator inappropriate reliance on the workers compensation and social security decisions and her failure to consider all the evidence in the record,that the decision denying caldwell own occupation disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious.
lina also challenges the district court award of prejudgment interest to caldwell.we review prejudgment interest awards for an abuse of discretion.malloy monahan,cir eastman kodak westway motor freight,cir.an abuse of discretion is an arbitrary,capricious,whimsical,or manifestly unreasonable judgment.coletti cudd pressure control,cir quoting fdic oldenburg,cir.a analysis governs the determination of such an award.the district court must first determine whether the award of prejudgment interest will serve to compensate the injured party.second,even if the award of prejudgment interest is compensatory in nature,the district court must still determine whether the equities would preclude the award of prejudgment interest.eastman kodak,at quoting,touche ross,cir.
the district court held here that the loss to caldwell began when he failed to receive each of the monthly benefits to which he was entitled.the court then concluded that the award of prejudgment interest serves a compensatory function,in that it compensates plaintiff for the loss of the use of the money involved in the award of benefits.the court also concludes that the award is eminently fair because it is an essential component of full compensation for plaintiff.app.vol.i at.on this basis,the court awarded prejudgment interest to begin as of august.
lina challenges this determination in two ways.it contends the district court abused its discretion by awarding any prejudgment interest because it failed to consider that damages in the case were difficult to ascertain and that caldwell contributed to the delay by filing his claim five years after his accident and then failing to provide medical documentation in a timely fashion.in the alternative,lina argues that prejudgment interest should only be awarded from the date of the final benefits determination,october.
as to the first claim,this type of erisa case inevitably involves complex determinations.if we were to find for that reason that equitable considerations favor insurance companies,no plaintiff would ever receive prejudgment interest.in addition,while caldwell did not file his claim with lina until april,almost five years after he was fired by western atlas,his former employer did not inform him of the availability of the lina disability benefits until march.in other words,caldwell diligently filed a claim once he knew he could do so.while the delays lina alleges may be a factor in the appropriate starting time for prejudgment interest,as we discuss below,the fact that the court did not find those delays to warrant a total denial of prejudgment interest does not amount to an abuse of discretion.
as to lina alternate argument that interest should be awarded from october,rather than august,the rule in this circuit is that prejudgment interest is generally available to compensate the wronged party for being deprived of the monetary value of his loss from the time of the loss to the payment of the judgment.anixter prod,cir quoting,at.the question in a case such as this is what constitutes the time of loss.the district court found that the time of loss began in august when caldwell failed to receive the first monthly benefits to which he was entitled.the court held that p rejudgment interest,therefore,should run on each monthly award of benefits from the time such benefit became due until the judgment as modified by this order entered.app.vol.i at.
the first circuit,ruling on this very point,held under erisa that a cause of action and prejudgment interest both accrue when the fiduciary first denies a claim.cottrill sparrow,johnson ursillo,cir.the eighth circuit,in a similar case,held that prejudgment interest compensates assignees as if the plan had paid benefits when the employee first filed his or her claim.lutheran med.ctr.of omaha contractors,laborers,teamsters eng rs.health welfare plan,cir.it was this latter case to which the district court cited in holding as it did.
caldwell did not file a claim with lina until five years after his injury.this delay was due to western atlas failure to inform him of the availability of disability benefits through the lina plan,rather than any delay caused directly by lina.to award prejudgment interest as far back as,therefore,would penalize a party not responsible for the delay.consequently,we are persuaded the district court abused its discretion in ruling as it did.under the circumstances of this case,the equities preclude the award of prejudgment interest for five years prior to the time the insurance company was notified of the claim.
lina maintains that caldwell should receive prejudgment interest only back to the time his claim was denied,in accordance with the first
