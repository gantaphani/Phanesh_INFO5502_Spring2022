opinion of the court 
appellant state auto property casualty insurance company brought a declaratory judgment action in which it sought a determination of the amount of underinsured motorist uim coverage owed to appellee pro design.at the inception of a single vehicle policy,appellee signed a form indicating that it waived stacked uim benefits in exchange for a lower premium.additional vehicles were later added to the policy.appellant contended that the initial waiver remained valid because pennsylvania motor vehicle financial responsibility law mvfrl.ann,does not require the execution of additional stacking waivers when new vehicles are added to a policy.to resolve this action,the district court had to interpret caselaw from the supreme court of pennsylvania and,ruling in favor of pro design,predicted that that court would have required the execution of a new waiver upon the addition of the second vehicle.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment to appellee,as we predict that the supreme court of pennsylvania would,in keeping with its most recent decision addressing stacking waivers,follow the recommendation of pennsylvania insurance commissioner and hold that appellee initial waiver of stacked uim benefits remained valid despite the addition of vehicles to the policy.
on october,ronald and christine dillman were involved in an automobile accident while riding in a vehicle insured under a business auto policy issued by appellant.at its inception,on june,the policy covered only one vehicle and provided for in underinsured motorist uim coverage.ronald dillman,on behalf of appellee,signed a written waiver of stacked uim coverage at this time the policy was renewed on an annual basis in,and.on august,during the june,to june,policy period,appellee added a second vehicle to the policy.the policy was renewed for june,to june,and,on november,a third vehicle was added.appellant did not provide appellee with an opportunity to sign additional stacking waivers upon adding the second and third vehicles to the policy.on june,the policy was renewed for another year,until june,it was during this policy period that the accident occurred.the policy at all relevant times had the following clause 
owned autos you acquire after the policy begins 
if symbols,or are entered next to a coverage in item two of the declarations,then you have coverage for autos that you acquire of the type described for the remainder of the policy period.
but,if symbol is entered next to a coverage in item two of the declarations,an auto you acquire will be a covered auto for that coverage only if 
a.we already cover all autos that you own for that coverage or it replaces an auto you previously owned that had that coverage and 
b.you tell us within days after you acquire it that you want us to cover it for that coverage.
the parties agree that symbol was entered in the relevant part of the policy.
appellant,in response to appellee claim for uim benefits,filed a declaratory judgment action to determine its obligation under the insurance policy,ultimately taking the position that stacking of uim benefits was waived,that the liability limit is.appellee,on the other hand,argues that stacking does apply and that the liability limit is for each of the three vehicles covered by the policy.the district court concluded that the june,stacking waiver was invalid because of the addition of new vehicles to the policy and thus granted summary judgment in favor of appellee.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.this court has jurisdiction under.the substantive law of pennsylvania applies to this case.see erie railroad tompkins.our review of the district court decision is plenary,and we apply the same standard as the district court to determine whether summary judgment was appropriate.norfolk southern railway basell usa,cir.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the underlying facts of this case are not in dispute.
stacking of uim benefits refers to the multiplication of the limits of uim coverage under a single automobile insurance policy by the number of vehicles insured by that policy the mvfrl provides for stacking 
when more than one vehicle is insured under one polic y providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage,the stated limit for uninsured or underinsured coverage shall apply separately to each vehicle so insured.the limits of coverages available under this subchapter for an insured shall be the sum of the limits for each motor vehicle as to which the injured person is an insured.
ann.a.section b,however,provides that,notwithstanding a,a named insured may waive coverage providing stacking of uninsured or underinsured coverages in which case the limits of coverage available under the policy for an insured shall be the stated limits for the motor vehicle as to which the injured person is an insured.the statute further requires that 
e ach named insured purchasing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for more than one vehicle under a policy shall be provided the opportunity to waive the stacked limits of coverage and instead purchase coverage as described in subsection b.the premiums for an insured who exercises such waiver shall be reduced to reflect the different cost of such coverage.
ann.c.pennsylvania law thus presumes that stacking applies unless an insured waives it by executing a stacking waiver containing the language provided in d 
appellee alleges that stacking applies to its policy because,while it waived stacking upon initially purchasing a policy,required the execution of an additional waiver upon the addition of vehicles to the policy.appellant,on the other hand,argues that the stacking waiver that appellee executed upon purchasing the policy remained valid as to the policy.as discussed below,the resolution of this case requires us to interpret two potentially conflicting decisions of the supreme court of pennsylvania the court.
in sackett nationwide mutual insurance sackett i,the court decided whether the mvfrl require s automobile insurers to provide first named insureds the opportunity to waive the stacked limits of coverage for each instance an insured purchases coverage by adding a vehicle to an existing policy.sackett i,at.the court answered that question in the affirmative,holding that interpretation of as a whole leads to one section can only be read to require that when a new car is added to an existing policy and coverage is purchased insurers must provide new section d stacking waivers in order to permit the insured to waive the increased amount of available stacked coverage.id.at.the case addressed a situation in which the insureds initially insured two vehicles on a single policy for which they executed a d stacking waiver.id.at.the insureds added a third vehicle to the policy,but did not sign another d waiver.the insureds subsequently sought in uim coverage,for each of the three vehicles insured under the policy.id.
the sackett i court considered the narrow question of whether the insureds purchase of the subject uim coverage occurred when the policy incepted,or whether another purchase occur red when they acquired the third vehicle and added it to their policy 
the insureds could not have purchased uim coverage for the third vehicle prior to its acquisition,because they would have had no insurable interest related to it,they could not purchase uim coverage for an automobile they had not yet acquired section c,read as a whole,makes it clear that an insurer must provide a stacking waiver each time a new vehicle is added to the policy because the amount of coverage that may be stacked increases.
id.at.while the court noted that there will be some cost attendant to compliance with its holding,it maintained that the cost containment objectives addressed in prior mvfrl case law are not at odds or inconsistent with the instant decision w e simply can not look past the plain
