certification from the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to the supreme court of florida,pursuant to.app.a.to the supreme court of florida and its honorable justices 
these consolidated appeals require us to determine whether florida law recognizes a claim for breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing by an insured against its insurer based on the insurer failure to investigate and assess the insured claim within a reasonable period of time.in addition,we must decide whether florida law recognizes a private right of action under.stat.a and whether an insurer failure to comply with a renders a hurricane deductible void and unenforceable.we must also decide whether,as a matter of florida law,defendant qbe insurance corporation qbe contractually waived its procedural right to stay execution of the amended final judgment entered in favor of plaintiff chalfonte condominium association,chalfonte by posting a supersedeas bond.because the florida courts have not definitively answered these questions,we certify them to the supreme court of florida.

ii.discussion 
issues raised in qbe appeals 
qbe appeals the district court denial of its motion for a new trial and its motion for judgment as a matter of law qbe asserts that florida law does not recognize a claim for breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing based on an insurer failure to investigate and assess its insured claim within a reasonable period of time.because the district court allowed chalfonte to try such a claim,qbe contends that it is entitled to either a new trial or judgment as a matter of law.
in the alternative,qbe argues that this court should view chalfonte good faith and fair dealing claim as the equivalent of a statutory bad faith claim under.stat.under florida law,an insured claim does not accrue until the insured prevails against its insurer on a claim for benefits under an insurance policy.blanchard state farm mut.auto.ins,so d.qbe contends that this bifurcation requirement applies to chalfonte claims and that the district court erred by allowing chalfonte to try its good faith and fair dealing claim simultaneously with its claim for benefits under the policy.qbe asserts that this alleged error entitles qbe to either a new trial or judgment as a matter of law.

the supreme court of florida has repeatedly observed that florida does not recognize a common law action for bad faith failure to settle a claim under an insurance contract.see,allstate indem.ruiz,so d,traditionally and historically,the courts in this state did not,however,recognize a corresponding common law action that would protect insured individuals and enable them to seek redress of harm against their insurers for the wrongful processing or denial of their own claims or failure to deal fairly in claims processing.talat,aetna cas.sur,so d,although the florida common law recognized claims,it did not recognize claims made by an insured against its own insurer for failing to act in good faith when settling a claim.citation omitted.
florida law does,however,provide a statutory action for bad faith failure to settle a claim under an insurance contract.the florida legislature enacted.stat.to provide a civil remedy for any person damaged by an insurer conduct,including n ot attempting in good faith to settle claims when,under all the circumstances,it could and should have done so,had it acted fairly and honestly toward its insured and with due regard for her or his interests.ruiz,so d at quoting.stat.b.qbe contends that provides chalfonte exclusive remedy for qbe alleged failure to investigate and assess chalfonte claim within a reasonable time.
in addition to the statutory action for bad faith recognized by florida law,florida contract law recognizes the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract.ins.concepts design,healthplan,so d,accord county of brevard miorelli eng g,so d,e very contract includes an implied covenant that the parties will perform in good faith.chalfonte contends that a claim for breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing is distinct from a statutory bad faith claim,even where the good faith and fair dealing claim contains allegations of an insurer failure to investigate and assess its insured claim within a reasonable period of time.according to chalfonte,if courts do not read the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing into all insurance contracts,insurers will be able to defer perpetually settlement of the claims of their insureds under the guise of adjusting the claims.
several of the federal district courts in florida have held that common law good faith and fair dealing claims are distinct from statutory bad faith claims in the context of a action on an insurance contract.see,townhouses of highland beach condo.ass n,qbe ins
