appellants seek review of the district court determination of insurance coverage for bodily injuries and death resulting from a car accident in.we must determine whether paul holloway qualifies as an insured under the policy issued by progressive gulf insurance company progressive and whether jennifer morris,courtney lutz,and craig portis are insureds under the terms of the policy issued by nationwide insurance company and the provisions of the mississippi uninsured motorist statute.see ann.
early in the morning of november,virginia dunning,paul holloway,courtney lutz,jennifer morris,and craig portis were involved in an automobile accident,which killed virginia dunning and paul holloway and seriously injured the other passengers.while on their way to jennifer morris house,holloway lost control of the mitsubishi eclipse and struck a light pole near the border.unbeknownst to the children parents,the group had driven to a dance club in downtown memphis where,despite their age,they were admitted and served alcohol.alcohol was the primary cause of the accident.
the eclipse belonged to joe dunning,virginia father.dunning helped finance the car for his daughter so that she would have transportation to and from school,cheerleading practice,and work.virginia had a set of keys to the car and personally paid the car note.virginia was the primary driver of the car and usually paid for fuel,but dunning took responsibility for maintenance and repairs.
dunning generally allowed virginia to use the car for social purposes.however,he specifically instructed virginia that she should not let others drive the car and that she should not drive around with groups of other teenagers.in addition to these specific instructions pertaining to the car,dunning,like any responsible parent,required virginia to seek his permission before going out in the evening.and dunning would usually require virginia to remain close to their mississippi home on the outskirts of memphis.they had never given her permission to drive to the downtown memphis area while out with her friends.virginia had a curfew between and 
on the evening before the accident,virginia asked her parents if she could spend the night at jennifer morris home.she told her parents that she and jennifer planned to rent a movie.her parents agreed.virginia,jennifer morris,and courtney lutz met paul holloway and craig portis later that evening.virginia allowed holloway,her boyfriend,to drive the group to memphis.dunning did not give either his daughter or paul holloway express permission to take the car to memphis the evening of the accident.
joe dunning had an automobile insurance policy with nationwide that covered the eclipse and three other automobiles.the policy included liability and uninsured motorist coverage limits of for each person and for each accident.nationwide filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of the rights of the claimants to the proceeds of the policy.paul holloway insurance provider,progressive,filed a.progressive policy provided liability coverage with limits of per person and per accident.both insurance companies argued that holloway,morris,lutz,and portis did not qualify as insureds as that term is defined in each policy and under mississippi law.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment denying coverage under the progressive policy and denied summary judgment in favor of coverage under the nationwide policy.the court concluded that holloway was not insured under the progressive policy because he did not have implied permission to drive the car.as to coverage under nationwide policy,the court concluded that virginia dunning had broad and unfettered domination over the vehicle and that paul holloway therefore had joe dunning implied permission to drive the car.on october,the district court set aside its order granting summary judgment in favor of progressive and scheduled a nonjury trial.
at trial,the parties stated that they did not intend to offer any more evidence than they included in their motions for summary judgment.the parties also indicated that the remaining issues concerning the apportionment of the policy limits to the injured parties would be resolved in mediation.having already reviewed the summary judgment evidence,the district court entered a final judgment holding that holloway was insured under the progressive policy and that holloway,morris,lutz,and portis were insureds for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage under the nationwide policy.the district court adopted the policy limits to which the parties agreed at trial.the policy limits are not contested on appeal 
ii.standard of review 
the parties contest whether we should review the evidence as if the district court granted summary judgment or whether we should review the record as an appeal from a nonjury civil trial.at the beginning of the scheduled nonjury trial,nationwide and progressive stated that they would not present any additional evidence than that already submitted in their summary judgment motions.the district court declined to hear the same evidence a second time and instead adopted its reasoning in its august,summary judgment memorandum opinion.
the district court was free to make any factual and credibility determinations from the documentary and testimonial evidence already in the record.it was not necessary for the parties to resubmit evidence that was already in the record at the nonjury trial.we therefore employ the standard of review applicable to any other nonjury civil case.we review conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.see switzer stores,cir.when reviewing mixed questions of law and fact,we reverse only if the findings are based on a misunderstanding of the law or a clearly erroneous view of the facts.tokio marine fire ins.flora mv,cir.
iii.the progressive policy 
progressive contends that the injuries caused by paul holloway negligence are not covered under its policy because holloway was not a permissive user of dunning car.the progressive policy provides coverage for bodily injury for which an insured person becomes legally responsible because of an accident arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of a vehicle.the policy omnibus clause defines an insured person as 
you with respect to an accident arising out of the maintenance or use of any vehicle with the express or implied permission of the owner of the vehicle.
owner of the vehicle means a person who holds legal title to the vehicle.therefore,if paul holloway had the express or implied permission of joe dunning,the vehicle owner,then the progressive policy will cover bodily injuries arising from the accident.since dunning did not expressly permit holloway to use the car on the night of the accident,we address only whether dunning permission should be implied.
mississippi law governing permissive use 
permissive use of automobiles is divided into two categories under mississippi law.see vaughn state farm mutual auto.ins,so d,overruled on other grounds,state farm mutual auto.ins.mettetal,so d.first,permission may arise if a vehicle owner gives restricted permission to a permittee,and the use of the vehicle is within the boundaries of the owner restrictions.an insured policy will cover injuries resulting from the use of a vehicle so long as the use is within the time,geographic and purpose limitations of the permission granted,and constitutes only a minor deviation from the permission granted.id.at citing travelers indemnity watkins,so d.
the second category pertains to a permittee unrestricted use of an insured automobile.see id.if a permittee has unrestricted use,then injuries arising from the operation of the vehicle by a third party will be covered as long as the third party uses the vehicle to serve some purpose of the permittee.see id.citing international serv.ins.ballard,so d.even if an owner places restrictions on the vehicle use,courts may nonetheless find that the owner permission is unrestricted when a permittee has broad and unfettered domination over the insured automobile.united states fidelity guaranty stafford,so d,overruled on other grounds,state far
