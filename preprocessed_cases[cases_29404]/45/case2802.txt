the issue we consider in this appeal is whether,in the context of a malicious prosecution action,code of civil procedure section,subdivision f permits summary adjudication on the ground that some but not all claims in a single underlying action were supported by probable cause because such a determination does not completely dispose of the entire malicious prosecution cause of action,we conclude that this statute does not permit summary adjudication under these circumstances.therefore,in this case,the trial court grant of summary adjudication on this ground as well as its subsequent piecemeal grant of summary judgment as to the other claim in the underlying action was improper and we reverse.
factual and procedural synopsis 
this case has already been before us several times.at the time of the last appeal,we summarized the case and proceedings to date as follows 
all appellants appeal from a summary judgment in favor of all respondents and from a denial of appellants motion for summary adjudication.

in november,individual appellants received an uninsured motorist arbitration award against state farm in the amount of.
in december,state farm filed a superior court petition to vacate the arbitration award.state farm voluntarily dismissed this petition with prejudice in and paid the award in full.
individual appellants filed a superior court civil suit against state farm alleging religious and national origin discrimination by state farm in the handling of their uninsured motorist claim bad.after four years of litigation and into the fourth month of jury trial,in,this case was settled by mutual agreement,including an agreement by attorneys supplemental to settlement attorneys agreement,for the sum of million.the settlement amount was paid by state farm.
in mid,appellants and state farm sought judicial clarification of the attorneys agreement with respect to the use and publication of certain internal documents produced by state farm during the bad litigation.the documents and information were produced through discovery and subpoena,not pursuant to the settlement agreement.the los angeles superior court ordered that appellants were not precluded by the attorneys agreement from copying,publishing and disseminating to third persons any document or information procured from state farm at or prior to the trial.state farm did not take further action regarding this order and it became final.
approximately one year after settlement and payment of the million,state farm obtained information indicating that the individual appellants insurance claims were,in part,fraudulent.state farm retained a law firm,which in turn employed investigators,to pursue this information.the investigation produced seven sworn statements from three witnesses,which indicated that the uninsured motorist claims were based on fraud and that appellants had withheld information during the discovery and litigation phases of those claims.
the investigation was turned over to the fbi and the los angeles district attorney.the fbi obtained a body wire recording of a witness statement,which corroborated the sworn statements.the fbi agent in charge and the district attorney investigator both told state farm representatives that the fraud case appeared well founded and worth prosecuting.
in january,in the arizona superior court,state farm sought to suppress the same documents claiming that attorney appellants had illegally provided copies to arizona plaintiff counsel in violation of the attorneys agreement and a los angeles superior court confidentiality order.a copy of the los angeles superior court order was presented in response.two days thereafter,state farm withdrew its motion to suppress.the arizona superior court issued sanctions against state farm for having submitted a motion which was eminently deniable from the onset the arizona superior court found that state farm claim of confidentiality was without merit.
three weeks following the imposition of sanctions by the arizona superior court,on february,state farm filed a federal court action seeking to recover the million payment and return of the internal state farm documents.
appellants filed motions to dismiss state farm restitution action on the grounds that a state farm claims were barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel b that state farm claims were precluded under the litigation privilege,subd.b c that said claims were time barred and d that the superior court order was controlling with respect to the documents.
counsel for state farm in the federal court case acknowledged the existence of the los angeles superior court order and on april,amended its complaint by striking the document claims.in total,days elapsed between the filing of state farm federal action and its abandonment of the document claim.
state farm argues that through a bureaucratic,the previous los angeles superior court order was not brought effectively to the attention of the lawyers drafting the complaint.state farm argues that malicious prosecution liability should not be predicated on a pleading blunder which was promptly withdrawn.however,state farm has not referred this court to any evidence in support of its bureaucratic blunder argument.
the federal district court granted appellants motions to dismiss on the litigation privilege ground.the ninth circuit court of appeal affirmed the order of dismissal.the individual and attorney appellants filed separate malicious prosecution actions against state farm.these cases were consolidated in the superior court and on this appeal.
state farm filed a motion for summary judgment,which was granted.state farm did not file a motion for summary adjudication.appellants motion for summary adjudication was denied.this appeal followed.hindin rust,nonpub.
after a discussion of legal principles applicable to summary judgment and to the issue of probable cause in malicious prosecution cases,we said from this point forward,we discuss separately the issues as to the individual appellants and attorney appellants.the issues relating to the documents apply only to the attorney appellants.hindin rust,supra.
as to the individual appellants,we find that there was legal and factual probable cause to bring the underlying federal restitution action and,therefore,affirm the summary judgment on the individual appellants complaint for malicious prosecution.with respect to the individual appellants,the conclusions reached in our independent review coincide with those of the trial court,james dunn,presiding.this opinion will not be published in the official reports.therefore,we incorporate by reference,as though set forth in full,judge dunn oral ruling from the bench as it relates to the individual appellants hindin rust,supra.
under the heading attorney appellants,we said it can not in reason be argued that there was probable cause to seek return of the disputed documents.the los angeles superior court ruled unequivocally that attorney appellants had the right to retain,copy and disseminate said documents to third persons.in fact,these same documents had been used in litigation outside california and were virtually in the public much for confidentiality.three weeks before filing its federal action,state farm was sanctioned by the arizona superior court for falsely claiming said documents were confidential.
as to the bureaucratic in not effectively bringing the los angeles superior court order to the attention of the lawyers drafting the complaint,the bureaucracy and ineffective communication are internal problems for state farm.they may be reasons,but they are not excuses.state farm has ignored the attorneys agreement,the los angeles superior court order specifically determining that attorney appellants are at liberty to retain,copy and disseminate the disputed documents and,finally,the juxtaposition of the arizona superior court sanctions to the filing of its federal case in california.
all of the aforementioned facts militate against any claim of probable cause in the filing of the federal court equitable restitution claim for return of the disputed documents.each of these events and facts was within the institutional knowledge of state farm.claims of bureaucratic,ineffective communication and pleading blunder are not persuasive.
we find that state farm federal court claim for equitable restitution to recover the disputed documents was not objectively tenable.considering the facts known before filing that claim,no reasonable attorney would believe that it was legally or factually tenable.all reasonable attorneys would believe that said claim was totally and completely without merit.
state farm argues that it dismissed its federal claim for equitable restitution promptly upon learning that it was without merit,to wit days after filing the federal case.therefore,the public policy encouraging the early dismissal of unmeritorious lawsuits should immunize state farm from exposure to malicious prosecution liability.sangster paetkau th,d leonardini shell oil d.this argument misses the point.under the facts existent and institutionally known to state farm,the equitable restitution action for return of the disputed documents should not have been filed in the first instance.
furthermore,we can not hold as a matter of law that the period between filing and dismissal constitutes prompt and early dismissal of an unmeritorious cause,considering the facts of this case.
as indicated above,state farm made only a motion for summary judgment,not a motion for summary adjudication.compare code civ,subd.a with,subd.f.we find that as to the disputed documents,there is a triable issue of material fact,to wit was the state farm federal action to recover the disputed documents initiated with malice therefore,the order granting summary judgment with respect to the attorney appellants is reversed.
some clarification may be required.this opinion is not intended in any manner to determine the issue of the existence or absence of malice in filing the federal claim for return of the documents.nor does it address the probable cause issues the attorney appellants attendant to claims other than that for return of the disputed documents.those issues are open for determination upon remand.hindin rust,supra.
as to the appellants motion for summary adjudication,we said appellants motion for summary adjudication,in effect,sought a judicial determination that state farm did not have probable cause for instituting its federal court action.our conclusions regarding probable cause,discussed above,render moot the issue raised by appellants in their appeal from the order denying motion for summary adjudication.hindin rust,supra.
the appeal from the order denying appellants motion for summary adjudication was dismissed,the summary judgment as to the individual appellants was affirmed and the summary judgment as to the attorney appellants was reversed,with the case remanded for further proceedings.
on remand,the attorney appellants filed an affidavit to disqualify judge dunn and the matter was reassigned to the honorable frances rothschild.state farm then moved for summary adjudication of the restitution claim on the ground that there was probable cause for that claim only.when this motion was granted,the attorney appellants filed a writ petition,contending that the trial court had improperly relied upon the law of the case doctrine in finding probable cause for state farm pursuit of its restitution claim against the attorney appellants simply because,in our prior opinion,we had upheld the trial court finding of probable cause as to the individual claimants among other issues we notified the parties that we intended to issue an order requiring the trial court to vacate its prior order and enter a new and different order denying state farm motion for summary adjudication because our prior decision had not resolved the probable cause issues relative to the attorney appellants.palma industrial fasteners,cal d.
the trial court declined to vacate its order granting summary adjudication,and state farm filed opposition to the writ petition,arguing that the attorney appellants had mischaracterized the basis for the trial court order.according to state farm,its argument was that its underlying claim depended in part upon showing an objectively tenable basis for seeking to rescind its settlement agreement with the individual claimants and then,in turn,that it had the right to impose a constructive trust on the funds the claimants had paid to their attorneys in any event,it argued,a de novo review of the evidence supported the trial court ruling.
while the writ petition was still pending,state farm moved for summary judgment on the ground that the malicious prosecution action,to the extent it was based on the document claim,was barred by the statute of limitations.it argued that the restitution claim and the document claim were severable because state farm withdrew its allegations in support of the document claim in the district court,the federal appeal did not toll the statute of limitations with respect to that claim.the attorney appellants requested and we issued a stay order.we ultimately dissolved the stay and dismissed the writ petition without opinion.over the attorney appellants opposition,the trial court determined that the remainder of the attorney appellants malicious prosecution action was.judgment was entered and this appeal followed.
discussion 
because the determination that state farm had probable cause to bring one of its two claims in federal court did not completely dispose of the attorney appellants malicious prosecution cause of action,the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication.
appellant attorneys filed a lawsuit for malicious prosecution following state farm unsuccessful prosecution of its lawsuit in federal court seeking a restitution of million paid in settlement of a bad faith action,based on the allegedly fraudulent conduct of the attorney appellants clients and b return of internal state farm documents produced during the bad faith litigation,as well as related equitable relief,based on the attorney appellants alleged violation of one of the settlement agreements signed in connection with resolution of the bad faith case.the attorney appellants argue,whether state farm claims in the underlying federal action are properly characterized as distinct or interrelated,their malicious prosecution action contains but a single cause of action within the meaning of section,subdivision f and,therefore,the trial court impermissibly granted state farm motion for summary adjudication directed only to the restitution claim.we agree.
section,subdivision f provides a party may move for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action,one or more affirmative defenses,one or more claims for damages as specified in civil code section,or one or more issues of duty a motion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action,an affirmative defense,a claim for damages,or an issue of duty.italics added.
prior to the amendments to the summary judgment law,a party could move for summary adjudication of issues either by itself or as an alternative to summary judgment.former,subd.f,stats,ch.if the evidence supported a finding that there were no triable issues of fact as to some but not all of the issues involved in the action,the trial court was required to specify that those is
