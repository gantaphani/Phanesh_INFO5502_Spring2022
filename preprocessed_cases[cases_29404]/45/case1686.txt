reliastar life insurance company sued ioa re,and swiss re life canada collectively,the retrocessionaires for breach of contract arising out of an alleged failure to pay under reinsurance contracts.ioa re and swiss re counterclaimed,alleging that they were entitled to rescind the reinsurance contracts,and that in any case reliastar committed a breach of contract by failing to remit premiums to the retrocessionaires.the parties filed for summary judgment in the district court and the court denied the retrocessionaires motion for partial summary judgment and granted reliastar motion for summary judgment.the retrocessionaires appeal.we affirm,but remand for clarification of one issue related to the district court award of damages to reliastar.
reliastar is a reinsurance company based in minnesota.for the to policy year,reliastar reinsured the risk of canada life assurance company on a product commonly called snowbird insurance.this type of insurance provides medical insurance for individual canadians traveling out of their home provinces including out of country,where canadian provincial medical coverage did not extend.br.of at.canada life ceded to reliastar its risk for percent of the first canadian of each claim under the program in exchange,reliastar was to receive percent of the net premium collected this variety of risk sharing is known as a arrangement.
reliastar then sought to spread the risk ceded to it by canada life through reinsurance from ioa re,a delaware corporation,and swiss re,a canadian company.reinsurers of a reinsurer,such as ioa re and swiss re in this case,are known in the industry as retrocessionaires,and the coverage they provide is known as retrocessional coverage.swiss re participation was arranged through a company called reinsurance management associates rma,a managing general underwriter which accepted risk and performed various administrative and management functions for insurance carrier clients.br.of at.swiss re issued a retrocessional placement slip for this coverage sometime in december,and reliastar ceded of its exposure under the canada life reinsurance policy amounting to percent of the total insurance liability of canada life to swiss re.in return,swiss re was to receive percent of the net premium collected by canada life.
ioa re is also a managing general underwriter,and it accepted the retrocessional coverage from reliastar on behalf of the pool of other companies for which ioa re provided services.answer and counterclaim of defendants at.ioa re signed a retrocessional placement slip for this coverage in early,also assuming of reliastar liability in exchange for percent of the net premium collected.
the snowbird insurance program for the to policy period paid out more than expected on claims and ended in a loss position.before the end of the policy period,canada life began to bill losses to reliastar that exceeded the net premiums paid to reliastar.on october,reliastar submitted the first bills to the retrocessionaires for their portion of the losses.reliastar submitted these losses for payment despite the fact that it had not forwarded any premium payments to either retrocessionaire.reliastar maintains that it deducted the net premium payments to which the retrocessionaires were entitled from the amount of losses billed to them.
in november,ioa re notified reliastar that it was canceling the certificate of reinsurance and rescinding the retrocessional coverage therein,for reasons that included of premium and failure to provide requested documentation of claims.letter from walter dorosz,chief officer,ioa re,to stephen dvorak,director of reinsurance,reliastar reinsurance group.swiss re,although it had reconfirmed its intention to pay in a may fax to reliastar,similarly refused to make any payments to reliastar,and eventually claimed that they owed no payment to reliastar.br.of at.
reliastar filed this diversity action in december,bringing breach of contract claims under minnesota law against the retrocessionaires for failure to pay under the retrocessional contracts.the district court,on for summary judgment,held that reliastar was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its breach of retrocession contract claims.the district court awarded reliastar canadian from each defendant for the amounts reliastar paid to canada life,and awarded reliastar from each defendant based on reliastar evidence of lost investment income attributable to the retrocessionaires refusal to pay.the court ordered the retrocessionaires to pay the judgment in dollars at the currency exchange rate as of the date the retrocessionaires first refused to pay the losses billed to them on october.
reinsurance relationships are governed by the traditional principle of utmost good faith.unigard sec.ins.river ins,cir.the duty of good faith is essential to the industry,inasmuch as r einsurers depend on ceding insurers to provide information concerning potential liability on the underlying policies.travelers indem.scor reinsurance,cir.reinsurers must rely on this principle because they generally do not duplicate the functions of the ceding insurers,such as evaluating risks and processing claims.unigard,at.to arrange their business otherwise would result in greatly increased costs for both reinsurance and the underlying policies themselves.
flowing from this duty of good faith is a doctrine,widely recognized in the insurance industry,known as the doctrine.essentially,this doctrine posits that if the cedent has acted in good faith in handling the claims presented to it and in providing coverage of the claims,the reinsurer may not second guess the coverage decisions of the cedent.br.of appellants at see also,am.bankers ins.northwestern ins,cir 
the district court,applying the doctrine to the contracts at issue,held that reliastar had fulfilled its obligations under the contracts because it had not acted in bad faith,with gross negligence,or recklessly in paying the losses billed to it by canada life and in subsequently billing an appropriate portion of those losses to the retrocessionaires.the retrocessionaires take issue with the district court conclusion.they argue that their retrocessional contracts with reliastar expressly denied the application of the doctrine.moreover,they claim that the factual record contains substantial material evidence of reliastar gross negligence and recklessness in its claims handling processes,as well as significant evidence that reliastar had misrepresented the nature of the underlying insurance program.br.of appellants at i.in addition,they argue that the district court erred in converting the damages award to dollars and in failing to clearly identify the applicable exchange rate for such a conversion.
we review a district court grant or denial of a summary judgment motion de novo,applying the same standards that governed the district court decision.jaurequi carter,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
ioa re and swiss re first find error in the district court rejection of their claim that they were entitled to rescind the retrocessional coverage they provided to reliastar because reliastar induced ioa re and swiss re to enter the arrangements through misrepresentation.the district court held that reliastar had not misrepresented any material fact and that ioa re and swiss re therefore were not entitled to rescind their retrocessional coverage.
the usual rules of contract law apply to our examination of reinsurance contracts.under minnesota law o ne who has been induced to enter a contract by fraudulent misrepresentations may elect to rescind the contract.anders dakota land dev.ioa re and swiss re argue that reliastar failed to disclose or misrepresented to them various facts and thus they are permitted to rescind the retrocessional coverage they agreed to provide.they argue that the record contains substantial evidence supporting their right to rescind the contract.br.of appellants at.
upon careful examination of the record,we must disagree.the alleged substantial evidence cited by the retrocessionaires fails to adequately support their rescission claim.for example,ioa and swiss argue that reliastar knew the snowbird program would be a losing proposition but failed to disclose this to either retrocessionaire.the portions of the record they cite to do not,however,support this assertion.in fact,in deposition testimony the retrocessionaires claim supports their argument,the witness admits that to his knowledge reliastar did not know the insurance was going to be in a loss position at the time that statements about the program profitability were made to ioa re and swiss re personnel.joint app.vol.iv at.the evidence cited in support of the other supposed misrepresentations,taken in the light most favorable to ioa re and swiss re,also does not sustain the retrocessionaires position.their citations to the record do not point to any specific instances where reliastar,at the time it solicited reinsurance coverage from ioa re and swiss re,misrepresented material facts regarding the snowbird insurance program.see sur.fid.cas,cir holding that promise of insured as to what would happen in the future was not a representation of a present fact or condition and therefore could not form the basis of a claim of false or fraudulent representations.we can not see how this evidence could be construed,even in the most generous light,as constituting misrepresentations made by reliastar to either of the retrocessionaires.sec.mut.cas.affiliated fm ins,cir holding that substantial evidence of material misrepresentations supported jury verdict where defendant,at the time defendant sought reinsurance from plaintiff,hid from reinsurer the dangerous nature of the insured business,affirmatively misstated the insured previous loss history,and did not reveal the nature of the underlying insurance.the district court rightly concluded that the retrocessionaires failed,as a matter of law,to put forth sufficient evidence in support of their claims to survive summary judgment on the question of whether the retrocessionaires had the right to rescind their contracts with reliastar on the basis of material misrepresentations.
ioa and swiss re next argue that the district court erroneously applied the doctrine to the facts of this case.the district court held that the doctrine requires a reinsurer to sic of the ceding company and pay all reinsurance obligations.joint app.vol.v at citing am.bankers,at am.ins.certain underwriters at lloyd london,cir aetna cas.sur.home ins.ioa and swiss re contend that the terms of their reinsurance contracts with reliastar required strict proof of the claims paid by reliastar and therefore the contracts did not incorporate the customary doctrine.br.of appellants at.they contend that their reinsurance contracts incorporated the terms and conditions of the underlying reinsurance contract which required strict proof of coverage and thus that under the terms of their contracts the doctrine does not apply to their retrocessional coverage of reliastar risk.id.at.
the district court rejected the argument that the retrocessional agreements incorporate any limiting language that might be found in the canada reinsurance agreement.the court concluded that ioa re and swiss re failed to introduce any evidence indicating that reliastar consented to adopting the limitations included in the reinsurance contract between canada life and reliastar.joint app.vol.v at.the court explained that the retrocessional placement slips merely identify the pertinent insurance contract.id.
under minnesota law,construction of a contract,including deciding whether it is ambiguous,is a legal determination.kauffman stewart,weinbrenner shoe.if after examining the entire contract it is not subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,then there is no ambiguity.columbia heights motors,allstate ins,in re info tel communications,llc west communications.we give the policy terms their plain,ordinary,and popular meaning,ostendorf arrow ins,without resort to parol evidence,icc leasing midwestern machinery.see generally lasociete generale immobiliere minneapolis cmty.dev.agency,cir,cert.denied,d.
ioa re and swiss re rely on affidavits from their employees that state they understood that the underlying canada agreement would form a part of the retrocessional agreement.joint app.vol.iii at.this understanding is not sufficient as a matter of law to create ambiguity in the contract and thus create a material issue of fact precluding summary judgment on this issue.looking to the plain language of the reinsurance agreements,we fail to see any ambiguity in the contract terms.the retrocessionaires seize upon language in the retrocessional placement slips that states,conditions see attached etfs travel health medical reinsurance agreement,to argue that the retrocession contracts incorporated the loss notice and settlement procedures agreed to between canada life and reliastar.id.at,br.of appellants at.we disagree.the plain purpose of these slips is to set out the parties to the retrocession agreement,the period of coverage,and the coverage that the retrocessionaire is to provide,among other details.these other details include identifying the portion of the insured risk that is being ceded to the retrocessionaire.taken as a whole,the language of these slips,and in particular the conditions clause,can not reasonably be interpreted as sweeping under its scope a set of specific procedures agreed to between canada life and reliastar in a separate agreement to which neither of the retrocessionaires were a party.see short van dyke,holding that under minnesota law,if the reference to another contract or writing in the contract at issue is made for a particular purpose,expressed in the contract,it becomes part of it only for that purpose.the language in question certainly does not make explicit that the retrocessional contract incorporates those specific terms.progressive cas.ins.reaseguradora nacional de venezuela,cir holding that language subject to facultative reinsurance agreement fra is sufficient to incorporate fra arbitration clause into reinsurance policy.we conclude that the loss settlement procedures of the underlying insurance policy did not form part of the operative terms of the retrocessional contracts at issue.thus,we reject the argument that the parties entered into any express contractual undertakings,as between the retrocessionaires and reliastar,to preempt application of the customary doctrine.
the retrocessionaires further challenge the district court application of the doctrine to this case because they claim that the existence of an industry custom is a question of fact that should be left to a jury.we note that the record does not reflect any dispute between the two sides as to the existence of this custom.to the contrary,the retrocessionaires expert admits that a reinsurer has the duty to follow the fortunes of the cedent or retrocedent as long as the losses paid are covered under the underlying contract or policy and fall within the terms and conditions of the reinsurance treaty.expert report of james schacht at.he further agrees that the obligation is customary with reinsurance contracts.id.at.he explains that this custom applies unless the reinsured has not dealt with the reinsurer or retrocessionaire in the utmost good faith or the reinsured fails to prove reinsured losses.id.at.reliastar expert agrees that is a key principle of the reinsurance business,and means when the ceding company has paid claims in good faith,the reinsurer may not second guess such payment but must fulfill its own payment obligations.expert report of ronald wobbeking at.thus,there does not appear to be a dispute between the parties as to the nature of the doctrine and as to its customary application in the reinsurance business.the real dispute appears to be whether the language of the parties contracts rendered this industry custom inapplicable to their insurance arrangement.having concluded that the contracts did not contain provisions,the district court,we believe,was correct to apply the customary doctrine to the dispute at hand.
the retrocessionaires next argue that if the doctrine a
