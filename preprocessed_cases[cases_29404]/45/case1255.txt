this action represents the third case in a series of lawsuits stemming from the marketing of synthroid,a synthetic thyroid drug.see in re synthroid mktg,cir knoll pharm.auto.ins,d.the first numerous class actions filed by consumers and health insurers that sought damages for the alleged monopolization,racketeering,fraud,and deceptive business practices of synthroid producers.see synthroid,at.after the litigation settled,the synthroid defendants filed the second case that suit sought damages from the synthroid defendants providers for the insurers alleged failure to defend them in,and indemnify them for,the settlement of the litigation.see knoll pharm,d at.while it was pending on appeal,the second case also settled.
german corporation basf ag basf then filed this third suit,seeking to recover damages from its umbrella insurers for their failure to defend and indemnify basf,and its related corporate entities,in the initial synthroid litigation.the district court in this case decided that the policies required the insurers to defend basf in the synthroid litigation,and granted summary judgment to basf on the insurers liability for breach of contract.we disagree.the terms of the umbrella policies,as a matter of law,did not obligate the insurers to defend or indemnify basf.we therefore reverse,and remand to the district court for the entry of summary judgment in favor of the insurers.
between and,basf predecessor in interest,boots pharmaceuticals,boots,purchased two layers of liability insurance primary insurance and umbrella insurance the policies all contained similar provisions,which stated that the insurers would indemnify boots for lawsuits seeking damages arising out of claims for a personal injury or an advertising injury.the primary policies uniformly defined an advertising injury as,among other things,an injury arising out of oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products,or services.moreover,the primary policies each outlined the insurer duty to defend each primary policy required the insurer to pay all costs that boots incurred in defense of any suit for which the insurer would be obligated to indemnify boots.
the policies provided two additional types of insurance coverage to boots excess coverage and coverage.all of the umbrella policies contained provisions,which required the umbrella insurers to indemnify boots for sums boots became liable for that exceeded the coverage limits of its policies.some of the umbrella policies also included provisions,which obligated the umbrella insurers to defend boots for any loss covered by the terms and conditions of the umbrella policy,and not covered as warranted by the primary insurers.other umbrella policies described this coverage as the obligation to defend any suit or any claim potentially covered by the umbrella policies to which the primary policies did not apply.
the defendants in this american assurance company great american,federal insurance company federal,and westchester fire insurance company westchester hold six of these policies like the policies,the umbrella policies covered only lawsuits that sought damages arising out of or because of a personal injury or an advertising injury.the umbrella policies all defined personal injury and advertising injury in a manner that was substantively identical to the primary policies definitions of those terms.put another way,exclusions aside,the primary policies and umbrella policies coverage of personal injury and advertising injury was coextensive,and a suit or claim that did not arise out of,or because of,a personal injury or an advertising injury would not be covered under either the primary or the umbrella policies.
in,boots began to manufacture,market,and sell synthroid,a synthetic thyroid medication used to treat various thyroid diseases.in an attempt to prove that synthroid was superior to competing synthetic thyroid hormones on the market,in the late boots commissioned a study by betty dong of the university of francisco ucsf.boots hoped the study would prove that synthroid and its competitors among them,cheaper generic hormones were not bioequivalents drugs that have the same effect on a patient in terms of potency and absorption rate when equal doses are administered.see synthroid,at.however,in,dong discovered that synthroid and its competitors were,in fact,bioequivalents,and that all of the compared synthetic hormones,including the cheaper generics,were as effective as synthroid at treating thyroid diseases.
when provided with these results,boots immediately sought to discredit dong and her findings.boots scientists sent letters to dong that questioned her methods and conclusions,and boots asked ucsf to terminate the study.ucsf did not comply and in,dong provided her final report to boots,which stated that synthroid and its competitors were bioequivalents.even after boots learned of dong results,boots continued to publicly maintain that synthroid had no known bioequivalents,and boots continued to advertise and market the drug as such.in early,boots exercised its rights under its contract with dong to block the publication of her study.
in,the wall street journal learned of dong study and boots response,and it published an expos√© on boots and synthroid.the article revealed to the public that there were cheaper alternatives to synthroid,and that boots had prevented the publication of dong study,which had confirmed that the cheaper alternatives were equally effective.dong study was eventually published in.see synthroid,at.on the heels of the wall street journal article and the publication of dong study,over lawsuits mostly class actions were filed against basf and its employees.these suits,filed by consumers and health insurers,alleged a potpourri of antitrust,racketeering,fraud,misrepresentation,and claims all based on the fact that boots had deceived consumers into purchasing synthroid,which occupied of the million market for thyroid drugs at the time.in,the lawsuits were consolidated into a litigation in the northern district of illinois,under.see in re synthroid mktg,certifying synthroid consumer class certifying synthroid payor class.
the gravamen of the consolidated complaints was that boots,basf,and their employees had wrongfully asserted monopoly control over the market for thyroid medication,which resulted in consumers and health insurers paying higher prices for synthroid rather than purchasing,equally effective alternatives.both complaints claimed that the defendants had exercised monopoly control by suppressing dong study and criticizing her methodology and results,by concealing known facts about synthroid,and by marketing synthroid as a uniquely superior drug despite knowledge to the contrary.both complaints sought economic damages for the class members consumers and health insurers who overpaid for synthroid.neither complaint sought damages on behalf of dong or on behalf of the competing thyroid manufacturers,and neither complaint alleged defamation,libel,disparagement,or slander.
in april,basf tendered the synthroid complaints to its primary insurers.the primary insurers each separately refused to defend basf,claiming that they had no obligation to do so under the policies definitions of personal injury and advertising injury.in late june,basf notified its umbrella insurers about the synthroid litigation,shortly before beginning formal settlement negotiations with the plaintiffs.on august,before any of the umbrella insurers had responded with coverage determinations,basf entered into a settlement agreement with the synthroid plaintiffs.in,the synthroid court approved a settlement that required basf to pay approximately million to the consumers and million to the payors in exchange for a release of all claims.see in re synthroid mktg,d,aff in part,rev in part.basf spent approximately million in defending and negotiating a settlement to the synthroid litigation.see in re synthroid mktg,cir adjusting attorneys fee award after remand.
after settling with the plaintiffs,basf filed an suit against its primary insurers seeking to recover damages for the insurers failure to defend and indemnify basf in the synthroid litigation.see knoll pharm,d at.the district court in knoll agreed that the primary insurers should have defended basf because the consolidated complaints had alleged an advertising injury.id.at.consequently,the knoll court ordered the primary insurers to indemnify basf up to their respective policy limits a total of million and to pay the million in defense costs that basf incurred from the synthroid litigation the court also added prejudgment interest to both awards.knoll pharm.auto.ins,d.the primary insurers appealed the knoll decision,which was briefed and argued before our court,but the parties settled before we could reach a disposition,for over of the knoll court total judgment.
after settling the knoll case with its primary insurers,basf filed this diversity lawsuit,see,against the umbrella insurers.the complaint alleged that the umbrella insurers owed basf over million for basf unrecovered costs from the synthroid litigation.the complaint sought million for basf settlement costs and million in defense arrived at these amounts by deducting the sums it received in its settlement of knoll with the primary insurers from its total expenditure on the settlement and defense of synthroid.
the parties completed discovery and then filed for summary judgment.the district court evaluated the voluminous summary judgment record and held that federal,westchester,and great american had breached their respective contractual duties to defend basf during the synthroid litigation.the district court relied heavily on the knoll decision,and adopted its reasoning that the synthroid class plaintiffs claims may have had their origin in slander,libel,or disparagement,which fell under the umbrella policies definitions of advertising injury.the district court explained that while the synthroid complaints did not allege libel,slander,or disparagement,the synthroid litigation grew out of various disparaging,defamatory,and libelous statements,such as boots claims that synthroid was superior to other thyroid drugs and boots criticism of dong study.
after granting summary judgment to basf on its claims,the district court held that the breach estopped the umbrella insurers from contesting coverage the court then allowed the case to proceed to trial on the amount of damages.after a trial,a jury set damages at million for basf unrecovered costs of the synthroid settlement it allocated million of the damages to federal,million to westchester,and million to great american.the jury also held the umbrella insurers jointly and severally liable for the remaining million of defense costs.the district court then added over million in prejudgment interest to the amounts awarded by the jury.the umbrella insurers timely filed this appeal.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,great american,federal,and westchester claim that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to basf on its claims.specifically,the umbrella insurers argue that the complaints in the consolidated synthroid litigation advanced claims that did not fall under the policies definitions of personal injury or advertising injury.the umbrella insurers maintain that,as a result,their duties to defend and indemnify basf were never triggered by the synthroid litigation,and that the district court should have entered summary judgment in their favor.the umbrella insurers raise numerous additional challenges to the district court decisions to limit discovery,exclude certain evidence at the damages trial,assess prejudgment interest,and deny the insurers motions.

an insurer duty to defend is much broader than its duty to indemnify its insured.agents ins.of,midwest sporting goods,see also crum forster,at.in order to determine whether the umbrella insurers had a duty to defend basf under illinois law,we must compare the facts alleged in the consolidated synthroid complaints to the relevant provisions of the policies.see valley forge ins,at.in making this comparison,we construe the allegations liberally in favor of the insured.employers ins.of wausau ehlco liquidating trust.if the facts alleged in the synthroid complaints fell within,or potentially within,the umbrella policies coverage,then the umbrella insurers were obligated to defend basf.see valley forge ins,at agents,at.this is true even if the synthroid complaints contained groundless,false,or fraudulent allegations,and even if only one of several theories of recovery fell within the potential coverage of the umbrella policies.see valley forge ins,at agents ins,at.the umbrella insurers refusal to defend basf was only justified if it was clear from the face of the synthroid complaints that the allegations failed to state facts that brought the case within,or potentially within,the coverage of the umbrella policies.see valley forge ins,at agents ins,at.
the parties all agree that the only policy definitions that basf claims could fall or potentially fall within are the policies coverage of injury arising out of the offenses of o ral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products,or services.the parties also all concede that the synthroid class plaintiffs did not plead slander,libel,or disparagement as causes of action in the consolidated complaints.if illinois law required that the plaintiff specifically plead a covered cause of action to trigger an insurer duty to defend,we could end our analysis here.however,it does not.see,cincinnati ins.atl.ins,cir t he insured is covered against particular conduct alleged against it regardless of the label placed on that conduct by the pleader.cas.surety adams county,d,t he question of coverage should not hinge exclusively on the draftsmanship skills or whims of the plaintiff in the underlying action.therefore,we must determine whether the factual allegations of the complaint could tacitly sketch a claim that is within the scope of the policy.states ins.wholesale tire,cir see also valley forge ins,at.so,in this case,we must ask whether the synthroid complaints sketched a claim for the offenses of slander,libel,or disparagement,which are covered by the umbrella policies.
we believe that the facts in the synthroid complaints are simply insufficient to sketch a claim for the offenses of libel,slander,or disparagement,which in illinois all require that a false statement be made about the plaintiff.see solaia,llc specialty pub,to state a defamation claim,a plaintiff must present facts showing that the defendant made a false statement about the plaintiff imperial apparel,cosmo designer direct,d,a n action for commercial disparagement lies when the quality of a business goods is demeaned,rev on other grounds,thomas fuerst,d,to establish either slander or libel,plaintiff must show that defendant made a false statement concerning plaintiff see also ptasznik joseph hospital,cir.neither the consumer complaint nor the payor complaint claimed that boots or its related entities made defamatory,libelous,slanderous,or disparaging statements about the class members or their products.and the synthroid complaints omission of a claim for libel,slander,or disparagement makes sense because the only allegedly actionable statements did not disparage thyroid patients or targeted dong study as unreliable,and other thyroid drugs as unsuitable bioequivalents of synthroid.
in addition to the requirements of the illinois common law,the synthroid class plaintiffs would have faced a further obstacle to sketching a claim for libel,slander,or disparagement based on the statements about dong and synthroid class plaintiffs would not have had standing to do so.see elk grove unified school dist.newdow,d in every federal case,the party bringing the suit must establish standing to prosecute the action.part of the article iii standing inquiry is whether the plaintiff has asserted an that is particularized to him.see,id.at.lujan defenders of wildlife,d first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and particularized warth seldin,d the art.iii judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party emphasis added.but the parties injured by the allegedly disparaging.dong,her research affiliates,and the producers of competing thyroid not part of the synthroid plaintiff classes.
despite the synthroid complaints failure to sketch a claim for libel,slander,or disparagement,basf argues that the umbrella insurers still had a duty to defend it in the synthroid litigation because the consumer plaintiff class implicitly advanced a disparagement claim by pleading that boots violated the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act cfa,ilcs,et.to advance this contention,basf relies on the illinois supreme court recent decision,valley forge insurance swiderski electronics,which interpreted an insurance policy that defined an advertising injury as oral,written,televised or videotaped publication of material that violates a person right of privacy.see,at.the underlying complaint in valley forge did not assert a tort for violation of privacy it only asserted a claim under the federal telephone consumer protection act tcpa.see valley forge,at.notwithstanding the plaintiffs failure to assert a privacy tort in the complaint,the illinois supreme court required the insurer to defend the tcpa suit under the policy definition of advertising injury because the statutory claim under the tcpa vindicated the same injuries as a common law action for violation of privacy t he receipt of an unsolicited fax advertisement implicates a person right of privacy insofar as it violates a person seclusion,and such a violation is one of the injuries that a tcpa claim is intended to vindicate.id.the illinois supreme court stated that though the complaint made no mention of the right of privacy,it was unproblematic,as a violation of privacy in the sense of a violation of seclusion is implicit in a tcpa claim.id.at.
basf argues that similarly,coverage is warranted under the policies at issue here because a claim for disparagement is implicit in the synthroid plaintiffs statutory claim under the cfa.but we do not believe that this case is analogous to valley forge.the cfa seeks to vindicate the rights of consumers by creating a cause of action that protects consumers from deceptive trade practices,fraud,and other abusive acts by businesses that market products to the public.see,pappas pella,d,the act was intended to protect consumers against fraud,unfair methods of competition,and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce.quoting elson state farm fire cas,d.in other words,the cfa allows consumers to recover damages for the economic injuries they suffer.it does not directly advance the interest another business has in preserving the reputation of its products that a disparagement action protects.thus,the cfa does not expand a disparagement plaintiff avenues for legal relief in the manner that the tcpa bolsters the right to privacy.instead,the cfa fortifies the economic interests of consumers,who would not have standing to pursue relief for the libel,slander,or disparagement injury of a third party.
nevertheless,basf urges us to adopt the expansive position of the district the synthroid complaints did not need to assert every element of an offense delineated by the policies in order to trigger the umbrella insurers duty to defend,because the language in the umbrella policies required the umbrella insurers to cover claims that may have had their origin in the offenses of libel,slander,or disparagement.however,following this approach would unmoor coverage determinations from the factual allegations of the that illinois law will not permit us to do.see,agents ins,at william templeman liberty mut.ins,d,i t must be demonstrated that the facts alleged were sufficient to permit recovery for the potentially covered cause of action in the same proceeding emphasis added see also del monte fresh produce transp.ins,cir in conducting this analysis under illinois law,it is the actual complaint,not some hypothetical version,that must be considered.quoting.indem,at eng rs commercial union ins,cir the court must focus on the allegedly tortious conduct on which the lawsuit is based.
abandoning focus on the complaint would mean that the breadth of insurance coverage could be extended indefinitely.see great am.ins.riso,cir.the consumer and payor class complaints pursued only economic damages for the injuries they suffered from the artificially high prices for synthroid,which stemmed from the monopolization and fraudulent concealment of boots and is a paradigmatic antitrust injury.see serfecz jewel food stores,cir see also brunswick pueblo,d.if we allow basf to shoehorn these collateral claims into the umbrella policies coverage of slander,libel,or disparagement,then an insured could easily transform a antitrust or securities action into a suit seeking redress of libel,slander,or disparagement.as our sister circuit has noted in a factually similar case it would not be to i magine a securities fraud action in which the false boosting of the seller stock involved or implied disparagement of a competing stock that the buyer was considering.riso,at.reading an insurance policy coverage provisions as expansively as basf desires would be a precarious proposition it might sweep within the breadth of the policy risks that the insurer did not and would not contract to that were not considered when setting the premiums for the policy.see nicor,at.this,in turn,would make insurance contracts less predictable and more costly for insurers,who would rationally pass the additional cost onto their insureds,making insurance more expensive for everyone.
insurance is a creature of contract,and as such,illinois law is sensitive to the parties intentions.valley forge ins,at cent.light,at crum forster,at.it seems extremely unlikely to us that the parties intended antitrust and racketeering claims to be even potentially a policy definition that sounds in libel,slander,and disparagement.see riso,at.basf interpretation of the policies could not have been reasonably contemplated by the parties when they entered into these insurance contracts.see crum forster,at in our judgment,to construe these policies to cover the claims made in the complaint,as
