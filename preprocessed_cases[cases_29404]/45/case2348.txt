in this case,we conclude an addendum to a storage unit rental agreement,which modified the agreement allocation of liability for damage or loss to stored property,was not insurance subject to regulation under article of the insurance code concerning storage agents.rather,the addendum was dependent on the rental agreement whose principal object was the rental of storage space.thus,the storage facility that offered the addendum did not engage in the unlicensed sale of insurance.
samuel heckart brought this action against a self storage,a,caster properties,caster family enterprises,caster group lp caster group,and deans homer together,defendants for violations of the unfair competition law bus,et the ucl,violations of the consumers legal remedies act,et the clra,negligent misrepresentation,and civil conspiracy.heckart alleged a sale of a customer goods protection plan the protection plan in connection with its rental of storage space constituted unlicensed sale of insurance.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to heckart first amended complaint without leave to amend,concluding the protection plan was not insurance.heckart appeals,contending his allegations are sufficient to state the asserted causes of action because the protection plan is insurance that must comply with the insurance code.we find his arguments unavailing and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a operates storage facilities in california.caster properties,caster family enterprises,and caster group have ownership,operation or management interests in a.
in june,heckart rented a storage unit from a.he signed a standard rental agreement the rental agreement,which set out the basic terms of the rental.the rental agreement provided 
indemnity tenant s does hereby indemnify and hold harmless landlord from any loss by reason of injury or damage to person or property,from whatever cause,all or in part connected with the condition or use of the premises 
insurance tenant,at tenant expense,shall maintain a policy of fire,extended coverage endorsement,burglary,vandalism and malicious mischief insurance for the actual cash value of stored property.insurance on tenant property is a material condition of this agreement and is for the benefit of both tenant and landlord.failure to carry the required insurance is a breach of this agreement and tenant assumes all risk of loss to store property that would be covered by such insurance.
customer goods protection plan if tenant s elects to participate in the protection plan,those provisions in this rental agreement concerning landlord liability which are modified by the protection plan are considered never to have been in effect.
the protection plan reiterated terms of the rental agreement,including that the tenant assumed the sole risk of loss or damage to stored property,a was not liable for loss or damage to stored property,and the tenant must insure his or her stored property.the protection plan stated,however,that for an additional payment of per month,a would retain liability for loss of or damage to the tenant stored property up to for losses caused by fire,explosion,smoke,theft,vandalism,malicious mischief,roof leaf,water damage,vandalism,or collapse of the building where the property was stored.the protection plan went on to state that,if elected,t his limited acceptance of liability is a modification to the waiver of liability in paragraph eleven of the rental agreement that it forms a part of.it satisfies the insurance requirement stated in paragraph twelve.
the form protection plan required the tenant to either initial to accept or decline participation in the plan.heckart declined participation by initialing that option,which provided no,i decline participation in the protection plan.i am currently covered by an insurance plan that covers my belongings in the storage facility.i understand that i need to provide the policy information in writing to the facility owner within days or i will automatically be enrolled in the protection plan until i do provide such information to the owner.heckart inadvertently purchased the protection plan and was enrolled in it,presumably because he failed to provide proof of insurance within days.
deans homer is an insurance underwriter,agent and broker licensed to sell insurance by the california department of insurance doi.deans homer provided a with the template for the protection plan agreement and forms,policies,and procedures needed to implement the protection plan.it also sold a a storage operator contract liability policy storage liability policy that covered a protection plan losses.for a premium of per month for each protection plan participant,deans homer assumed liability for all of a protection plan losses over per year.deans homer also retained the right to adjust protection plan claims directly with plan participants.
in april,heckart,on behalf of himself and other similarly situated california residents,sued a and caster group for violations of the ucl and clra.he alleged a and caster group engaged in unfair,unlawful and deceptive sale of unlicensed insurance in conjunction with the rental of storage units.a and caster group demurred to the complaint.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
heckart amended his complaint,adding deans homer and the other caster entities as defendants.he alleged causes of action for violations of the ucl and clra,negligent misrepresentation,and civil conspiracy.heckart allegations were premised on the notion that a protection plan was an unlicensed and illegal insurance policy.heckart alleged the protection plan automatic enrollment after days if the tenant did not provide proof of insurance was deceptive to a reasonable consumer,causing class members to be enrolled in an illegal insurance plan that is not properly disclosed as such,is sold in an illegal and misleading manner,and costs more but provides less coverage than other insurance,including a policy offered by deans homer.
defendants demurred to heckart amended complaint,arguing it failed because the protection plan did not transform the rental agreement into insurance.rather,the protection plan was tangential to the principal object of the transaction between heckart and a,which was rental of storage space.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,concluding the principal object of the transaction between heckart and a was rental of a storage unit,not the sale of insurance.thus,each cause of action failed because the protection plan was not a contract of insurance.
in conjunction with the order sustaining defendants demurrer to the amended complaint,the trial court granted defendants request for judicial notice of multiple documents,including a letter from deans homer to the doi and two letters from the doi to deans homer.deans homer letter to the doi requested an opinion on whether a program structured like the protection plan would be subject to regulation as insurance.the doi response letter opined that the doi did not believe that such contracts between landlords and tenants are insurance contracts for purposes of statutory regulation.the primary purpose of the contract is rental of the premises.the parties appear to be allocating the risk by contractual agreement.for an additional amount of rent,the risk of damage for a particular risk shifts from the lessee to the lessor.in a letter,the doi confirmed the opinion it expressed in its letter.
