current action demurrer ruling 
flat rock filed the current complaint against royal,seeking declaratory relief on coverage issues on the theory that it has a legitimate interest in making coverage arguments that may affect its possibilities of recovering damages and environmental cleanup costs from united.
in response,royal demurred to the complaint for failure to state a cause of action,contending that no actual controversy is presented,and flat rock does not have standing to sue royal,since it does not fit within any of the applicable exceptions to the no direct action rule,subd.b all further statutory references are to this code unless noted.
in opposition,flat rock acknowledged that an injured third party is generally prohibited from suing a tortfeasor insurer for failing to defend or indemnify the tortfeasor against the claim.shaolian safeco insurance th,d.however,flat rock argued its complaint should fall under a new exception to this rule,said to be allowed in thompson,supra,th,d and haynes,supra,cal th,d.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,identifying the issue presented as whether flat rock has standing to request declaratory relief as to royal duty to defend and indemnify united from and against all claims by plaintiffs.the court relied on royal surplus lines,ranger ins.th,d for the proposition that california law generally prohibits third parties from suing an insurer when they are not in contractual privity,and noted that these parties are not in such privity.also,flat rock was not claiming to fall within three exceptions to that rule,where the third party plaintiff has a judgment against the insured,subd.b where the insurer has sued the third party in its own declaratory relief action or where the insured has assigned its rights under the policy to the third party.moreover,the court found distinguishable the two cases relied on by flat rock thompson,supra,th,d and haynes,supra,cal th,d,to create a purported further exception that would allow a third party to sue the insured liability insurer for declaratory relief on coverage issues.
accordingly,the trial court dismissed the complaint,finding that flat rock had failed to establish standing to sue for declaratory relief about any obligations owed by the insurer to the policyholder,and there was not yet any existing actual controversy,subd.b.
flat rock appeals the judgment of dismissal after demurrer.it has sought judicial notice of the record it prepared in the appeal resulting in our prior opinion,and royal has likewise sought judicial notice of the portion of the record that it prepared in that matter.both requests were deferred to the merits panel,and are now granted.previously,we denied royal motion to strike flat rock reply brief,in which royal unmeritoriously argued that the reply brief raised new issues on declaratory relief that were not subsumed in the issues covered in the opening brief.
