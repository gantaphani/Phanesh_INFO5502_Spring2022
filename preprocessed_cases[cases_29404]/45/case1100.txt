citizens insurance company of america citizens appeals the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment,and the declaration that citizens is first in priority for the payment of medical expenses incurred as a result of an automobile accident.for the reasons that follow,the holding of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this ruling.
factual and procedural history 
the facts in this case are undisputed.on december,jacqueline bradshaw bradshaw was injured in a motor vehicle accident and required extensive medical treatment at the time of the accident,bradshaw was covered under a citizens excess auto policy,and midmichigan health connectcare network plan midmichigan,a health benefit plan offered through her employer.midmichigan is a employee health and welfare benefit plan,established pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.the plan provides health insurance benefits to the employees of midmichigan medical center.as a result of bradshaw injuries,citizens alleges it paid in medical expenses out of priority.citizens brought this action to recover payment for these expenses.
citizens filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to,seeking a declaration that citizens coverage was secondary to the midmichigan plan,and accordingly,citizens was entitled to reimbursement for the payment of bradshaw claims.the parties agree that a priority dispute arising between an erisa plan and a policy is resolved pursuant to federal common law.see auto owners ins.thorn apple valley,cir.according to thorn apple valley,when an erisa health benefit plan and a policy of insurance have conflicting coordination of benefits clauses,the erisa plan language prevails.id.however,the district court found that the holding of thorn apple valley was inapplicable here,because the coordination of benefits clauses were not in direct conflict.see citizens insurance company of america midmichigan health connectcare network plan,filed,hereinafter slip op.in so finding,the court determined that midmichigan plan language did not expressly disavow payment of injuries otherwise covered by a policy of insurance,nor did it effectively subordinate its own coverage to citizens id.at.therefore,the midmichigan erisa plan was in full effect at the time of bradshaw accident however,the court found that the language of the citizens excess policy did not exclude payment of benefits for bradshaw,even though she was simultaneously covered under the midmichigan plan.id.at.the court declared citizens the primary payer.id.
the parties agree that there is no conflict in the coordination of benefits clauses between the plan and the policy.the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in deciding that the policy language did not exclude payment for bradshaw injuries when she was covered under the midmichigan employee health benefit plan.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
subject matter jurisdiction is proper under et seq,and.because citizens claim against midmichigan,an employee benefit plan,requires a determination under federal common law,subject matter jurisdiction is appropriate under.see thorn apple valley,at 
we review de novo a denial of summary judgment decided on purely legal grounds.see mcmullen meijer,cir district court denial of summary judgment based on legal grounds is reviewed de novo.the district court opinion was based on the interpretation of the citizens policy language,a purely legal question requiring de novo review.see boyer components,cir question of contract interpretation is subject to de novo review.
iii.analysis 
the resolution of this case depends on the interpretation of the citizens excess policy personal injury protection exclusions provision.the provision states,in relevant part 
we do not provide personal injury protection coverage for 
medical expenses for you or any family member 
a to the extent that similar benefits are paid,payable,or required to be paid,under any individual,blanket or group accident or disability insurance,service,benefit,reimbursement or salary continuance plan.excluding medicare benefits provided by the federal government 
citizens insurance policy,exclusions b a,ja at.
the district court held that the language of paragraph b a did not exclude medical expenses covered by a medical or health benefits plan,such as the midmichigan plan.
plaintiff does not actually exclude medical expenses covered by a medical or health benefits plan such as defendant plan.it specifically references accident or disability insurance.this is in stark contrast to the language in the limit of liability provisions of plaintiff policy which limit the benefits payable for an accident involving a motorcycle when amounts are also payable under any individual,blanket or group accident,hospitalization,medical or surgical insurance or reimbursement plan in addition plaintiff did not cite,and the court review of plaintiff policy did not reveal,any alternative coordination of benefits provision which might be relevant to this matter.
citizens,at.
citizens asserts that the district court erred,and argues that the policy language excludes payment of benefits in this instance,because midmichigan provides similar benefits for medical expenses,and is a group benefit plan listed in the exclusions clause.further,citizens states that accident or disability insurance is just one type of plan that falls within the exclusions,and a serial listing of other types of plans are included.
in response to citizens claim that accident or disability insurance is just one in a series of plans excluded from coverage under the citizens policy,midmichigan asserts two incompatible arguments.first,midmichigan argues that accident and disability insurance is the only type of plan excluded 
that exclusion is clearly limited to benefits payable under an accident or disability insurance plan.citizens argues that this language expressly covers group benefit plans but that argument ignores the fact that it only covers group accident or disability insurance,not all group plans.
appellee br.emphasis in original.second,when pressed to explain the remainder of the exclusions clause,midmichigan argues that the phrase accident or disability is a qualifier for each of the terms that follow.under this theory,the exclusions clause would be read as follows 
to the extent that similar benefits are paid,payable,or required to be paid,under any individual,blanket or group accident or disability insurance,accident or disability service,accident or disability benefit,accident or disability reimbursement or accident or disability salary continuance plan excluding medicare benefits provided by the federal government.

in order to decide which interpretation is correct,we must consider both the policy language and the intent underlying the provision.see firestone tire and rubber bruch,d wulf quantum chemical,cir when interpreting a contract,courts look not only at the language,but also for additional evidence that reflects the intent of the contracting parties.the rules of contract interpretation that have evolved under the federal common law in erisa priority disputes mirror those applied in the michigan courts.see regents of university of michigan employees of agency,cir.id.a technical construction of a policy language which would defeat a reasonable expectation of coverage is not favored accordingly,an insurer has a duty to express clearly the limitations in its policy any ambiguity will be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer id.when interpreting erisa plan provisions,courts have gone beyond the actual language of the plan,even if clumsily drafted,to ascertain the underlying intent.yet,the court paramount responsibility in construing plan language is to ascertain and effectuate the underlying intent.travelers ins.ins,accord allstate ins.knape vogt,supp.
policy language 
the exclusions clause excludes payment of benefits for medical expenses payable by any individual,blanket or group accident or disability insurance,service,benefit,reimbursement,or salary continuance plan excluding medicare benefits provided by the federal government.citizens insurance policy,exclusions b a,ja at.looking at the plain language of the exclusions clause,we find that midmichigan first argument that the clause is limited to accident or disability insurance ignores the remainder of the clause.if the policy was intended to exclude only payment for medical benefits otherwise payable under accident or disability insurance,the exclusions clause would have ended at the phrase so stating.presumably,midmichigan takes this stance in order to track the language of the district court opinion,wherein the court noted that the clause specifically references accident or disability insurance.citizens,slip op.at.the district court did not however,indicate that accident or disability insurance plans were the only plans excluded.
the district court relied on the motorcycle limit of liability provision in order to interpret the meaning of the clause here.in so doing,the court pointed out that the policy language in the motorcycle provision specifically referred to hospitalization,medical or surgical insurance or reimbursement plans,while the language in this provision did not.while this is true,the district court erred when it failed to interpret the remainder of the exclusions provision here.the exclusions clause also excludes payment for medical expenses otherwise payable under service,benefit,reimbursement,or salary continuance plan s.midmichigan first argument fails because the policy expressly excludes plans other than accident or disability insurance plans,even though the district court failed to determine the type of plans the remainder of the exclusions clause intended to exclude.
midmichigan second argument contends that the phrase accident or disability is meant to qualify each of the terms that follow.in contrast,citizens argues that the reminder of the clause is a serial listing of the types of plans excluded.in an attempt to unravel this linguistic knot,we begin with a grammatical analysis.according to a dictionary of modern legal usage,each adjective that qualifies a noun in the same way should be separated by a comma.for example,a cautious,reserved person.bryan garner,a dictionary of modern legal usage oxford university press,ed.the application of this rule yields the interpretation urged by citizens.under this interpretation,the exclusions provision is a listing of plans that are qualified by the preceding adjectives.these adjectives include accident or disability insurance,service,benefit,reimbursement,and salary continuance.this interpretation would properly exclude a benefit plan,as citizens argues.
however,when one adjective is intended to qualify a noun phrase containing another adjective,as midmichigan argues is the case here,no comma is used to separate the two adjectives.id.in the provision,the phrase accident or disability precedes insurance,service,benefit,reimbursement,or salary continuance plan with no comma separating terms.under this rule,accident or disability would be considered a qualifier for the other adjectives,all qualifying the noun plan.thus,the policy would exclude an accident or disability insurance plan,an accident or disability service plan,an accident or disability benefit plan,an accident or disability reimbursement plan,or an accident or disability salary continuance plan,as midmichigan argues.
hence,a pure grammatical analysis results in two plausible readings.contract language is ambiguous if it is subject to two reasonable interpretations.boyer douglas components,cir citing smith abs,cir.having found that the language of the provision is subject to two grammatical interpretations,we turn to traditional methods of contract interpretation to resolve the ambiguity,including drawing inferences and presumptions and introducing extrinsic evidence.boyer,at.
intent underlying the policy 
citizens claims that the policy issued to bradshaw was expressly identified as excess for purposes of medical benefits and thus,does not apply to the extent that other available coverage exists.br.of appellant at.the record contains a certification of policy coverage signed by pamela martin of citizens,which certifies that the policy issued to bradshaw provided medical excess personal injury protection.ja at.citizens claims that the exclusions provision in the policy was intended to effectuate bradshaw choice of acquiring a coordinated policy,with premiums appropriately reduced to reflect secondary medical coverage.br.of appellant at.to bolster its position,citizens refers to the statute that requires michigan insurers to offer their policy holders the option of electing a reduced premium coordinated policy,when they have other health and accident coverage.comp.laws a states an insurer providing personal protection insurance benefits shall offer,at appropriately reduced premium rates,deductibles and exclusions reasonably related to other health and accident coverage on the insured.citizens states that it issued bradshaw reduced rate policy in compliance with this statute,evidencing its intent to coordinate benefits with bradshaw other available health coverage,namely midmichigan.further,citizens quotes transamerica ins.group american community mutual ins.in support of its assertion that the clause was meant to subordinate its coverage to other health insurance carriers 
by mandating that insurers offer coordination of benefit clauses at appropriately reduced rates,the legislature expressed a clear intent that the insurer not have primary liability under any circumstances when the insured elects to coordinate benefits.although a health insurance carrier that coordinates benefits may become secondary to a carrier other than a carrier,the carrier can not under any circumstances be primary.
br.of appellant at.
citizens argues that the district court erred when it rendered a restrictive reading to its exclusions clause,because the policy was issued as a reduced rate excess policy,in compliance with michigan law,as interpreted by the transamerica court.citizens states that the district court unnecessarily required that the provision include the terms medical or health in order to reach defendant plan when 
the exclusions clause manifestly envisions that medical benefits or similar benefits will be payable by a variety of plan s,any one of which might be an individual,blanket or group plan.several plans are listed and while accident or disability insurance is one,the clause also includes a service plan,a reimbursement plan,a salary continuation plan,and most notably,a benefit plan.
br.of appellant at.
citizens asserts that the midmichigan plan is encompassed by the exclusions clause,because the midmichigan plan is,by its own definition,a group benefit plan.
further,citizens argues that if the policy intended to only exclude payment of medical expenses that were otherwise payable under various accident and disability insurance plans,and medical and health benefit plans were not intended to be excluded,there would be no reason for citizens to include the medicare qualifying language.medicare is defined as a health insurance program for the elderly and certain disabled individuals if health insurance plans were not intended to be encompassed by the exclusions clause in the first instance,it would be unnecessary to exempt medicare benefits from its reach.
in response to citizens assertions,midmichigan claims that the policy fails to exclude payment for benefits otherwise payable under a medical or surgical insurance plan,unlike the motorcycle limit of liability provision in its policy.citizens argument is further undermined by the fact that it demonstrated in the very same policy that it knew what language to use if it intended to exclude coverage for benefits payable under a group medical plan.br.of appellee at.midmichigan further argues that citizens interpretation requires the court to redraft the exclusions provision,omitting the accident and disability qualifying language.
midmichigan does not address citizens contention that midmichigan is a benefit plan by its
