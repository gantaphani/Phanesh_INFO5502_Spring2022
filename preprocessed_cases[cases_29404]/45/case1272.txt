plaintiffs,six different del monte companies to which we refer collectively as del monte,brought a declaratory judgment action against their insurance carrier,transportation insurance company.del monte general liability policy with transportation includes coverage for claims of personal injury or advertising injury.del monte took the position that this coverage was triggered by a series of class actions filed against it in.in those cases,the plaintiffs claimed that they were injured by del monte alleged monopoly in the pineapple market.transportation took the position that the claims against del monte fell within an exception from coverage found in the policy.after examining the policy,the district court concluded that the policy did exclude del monte claims,and it therefore granted summary judgment for transportation.we affirm.
this is a diversity action,and so we begin by noting that transportation is an illinois corporation with its principal place of business in illinois,while the states of incorporation of the six plaintiffs are california,the cayman islands,delaware,and florida all six have their principal places of business in florida.the amount in controversy is substantially in excess of the required by.
transportation issued a general liability policy to a del monte affiliate covering advertising injury and personal injury occurring between december,and december.the pertinent language from the policy stated 
coverage personal and advertising injury liability

emphasis added.
in,a series of consumer class actions was filed against del monte claiming fraud and violations of the antitrust laws arising out of del monte marketing of its fresh del monte gold pineapples.according to the complaints,del monte applied for and received a patent on a genetic sibling to the gold pineapple the patent and misrepresented in its application that the new pineapple variety was extra sweet and therefore differed from other varieties.the complaints further allege that del monte disseminated its misrepresentations through industry publications and sued two competitors for patent infringement,even though it knew that its claims about the of its new pineapple were false.eventually,del monte withdrew the patent and settled the infringement lawsuits.del monte customers alleged injuries that accrued during the period of time when,thanks to its patent,del monte had a monopoly in an alleged market for pineapples.each complaint is based on allegations that del monte knowingly submitted fraudulent patent applications,knowingly sent false letters to competitors regarding its patent rights,and knowingly engaged in fraudulent patent litigation.
del monte tendered these complaints to transportation,seeking coverage under its policy.transportation rejected the tender on two bases the class actions did not arise from advertising injury or personal injury under the policy and the class actions were excluded from coverage because they alleged fraud.del monte then filed this action for a declaratory judgment establishing transportation duty to defend and indemnify it under the policy.all parties agreed that the issue could be adjudicated as a matter of law with only minimal discovery.following discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted transportation motion.
del monte urges us to find that its policy with transportation covered its alleged disparagement of its competitors pineapples,its alleged defamation of those companies,and its alleged misuse of advertising ideas.furthermore,it continues,the knowledge of falsity exclusion does not apply here.the policy,in its view,does not exclude coverage for intentional acts but only for the narrower set of acts that are done with knowledge of falsity.transportation responds with,in essence,a moral hazard argument the policy can not be used as a get out of jail free card for del monte.if del monte knows that something is wrong and does it anyway,it should not,and does not,have the right to demand that transportation pick up the pieces.in granting summary judgment for del monte,the district court concluded that the class actions are del monte mess to clean up.del monte wants to hand the broom back to transportation.we review the court decision de novo,connecticut indemnity der travel service,cir,applying illinois law to this diversity action.
in a action,we begin with the deck stacked in favor of the insured.a llegations of the underlying complaint must be construed liberally,and any doubt as to coverage must be resolved in favor of the insured.state med.ins,cichon,d.the court must look to the allegations in the underlying complaint and compare these allegations to the relevant coverage provisions of the insurance policy.crum forster managers resolution trust.therefore,i f the facts alleged in the underlying complaint fall within,or potentially within,the policy coverage provisions,then the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in the underlying action.id.
our task is to evaluate the allegations in the class action cases to see whether the district court correctly concluded that the policy does not cover them.in conducting this analysis,it is the actual complaint,not some hypothetical version,that must be considered,at.a complaint that is barren of any mention of negligence,inadvertence,error,or mistake,or anything even implying such conduct and says only that the insured deceived,schemed,and defrauded consumers,would not escape an exclusion clause like the one transportation issued here.id.at see also united fire cas.jim maloof realty,d,the inclusion of a few isolated words does not transform what is in essence a specific intent to deceive into an aggravated form of negligence.the complaint must be read as a whole in order to assess its true nature.we have previously noted that p hrases such as mislead and conceal,scheme or device,and intentionally and willfully are the paradigm of intentional conduct and the antithesis of negligent actions,
