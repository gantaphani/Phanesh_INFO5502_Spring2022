this appeal involves the interpretation of two insurance policies after a fatal airplane crash.although we initially determined that we did not have proper appellate jurisdiction over the matters presented,that infirmity has since been cured by an agreement of the parties to dismiss with prejudice any claims outstanding in the district court.on the merits,we now affirm the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the.
this case arose from an airplane crash on october,in which the pilot,morten borcher borcher,and both passengers,colt ross and jon dirk ross collectively decedents,were killed.durango air service durango owned the aircraft and employed the pilot.as a result of the accident,the wives and children of the decedents brought a wrongful death suit in state court against durango,donley watkins watkins,the president of,and a substantial shareholder in,durango,and ellen roberts roberts,as the personal representative of borcher estate.app.durango,watkins,and borcher hereinafter the insureds were insured by old republic insurance old republic under two policies,commonly referred to as the aviation policy and the cgl policy,the airport liability policy.
in a colorado state court proceeding,the insureds confessed judgment in favor of the decedents families in the amount of million.app.old republic had rejected a settlement of.the colorado state court entered judgment upon the insureds confession of judgment on january.in response to the state court judgment,old republic paid the insureds pursuant to the aviation policy per passenger liability limit.it paid them nothing under the cgl policy.
old republic then filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the district of colorado on october,claiming that the it had already paid the insureds was the limit of its liability under the aviation policy,and that old republic had no obligations to the insureds under the cgl policy.it sought a declaratory judgment that it had discharged the full extent of its obligation to indemnify the insureds.
the insureds filed counterclaims alleging causes of action against old republic for breach of contract,willful and wanton breach of contract,negligence,breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and breach of fiduciary duty.among other things triple damages,interest,the counterclaims sought indemnification from old republic for the million judgment minus the old republic already had paid resulting from the state court wrongful death action.both the insureds and old republic filed for summary judgment on may.
the district court denied old republic for summary judgment on november.it held in favor of the insureds,concluding that the full extent of old republic duty of indemnification under its two policies was million aviation policy cgl policy million.it then dismissed the case with prejudice but without deciding the insureds counterclaims the judgment reflecting the district court decision of november,was entered on december,all provisions of the november,order were incorporated into the december,order.
on december,old republic filed a motion for entry of judgment pursuant to.b the insureds filed a motion for clarification and reinstatement of their counterclaims on december.both motions were granted by the district court on january,when the district court certified the december,order as final with no just reason for delay.this appeal followed.
our initial concern after oral argument was that the december order entered by the district court did not constitute a valid rule b certification because the insureds counterclaims and old republic claim were not separate but were rather inextricably related.
rule b finality requirement is only satisfied if the claims resolved are distinct and separable from the claims left unresolved.oklahoma turnpike auth.bruner,cir see also mckibben chubb,cir holding that order was final for purposes of rule b certification because claims were separable james moore et,moore federal practice ed.
in its declaratory judgment action,old republic sought an interpretation of its policies which would limit its exposure and its indemnification duties to.the insureds,on the other hand,through their counterclaims,sought an interpretation of the very same policies and clauses that would provide increased coverage,but that would also indemnify them for their wrongful death state judgment.the parties respective claims were based on identical facts and on the same,on the same clauses of the same policies.rather than being independent and separable,the record disclosed that the claims of both the insureds and old republic all stemmed from the same occurrence and were inextricably intertwined and related.on appeal,we therefore were prepared to hold that the district court certification of its december order under rule b was improper,as it was not a final order 
accordingly,having determined that the b certification had been rendered in error,we were compelled to conclude that we had no appellate jurisdiction and therefore could not address the merits of old republic claim.on january,however,and while our initial opinion was circulating and therefore was not yet filed,the insureds dismissed their counterclaims,thereby making final that which was.as a result,we now exercise appellate jurisdiction over the district court order pursuant to,and review the merits of old republic claim.

a.the aviation policy 
the insureds purchased an aviation policy from old republic.although both parties agree that the insureds are entitled to coverage under the policy regarding the crash on october,they disagree as to the precise amount.the insureds contend that the aviation policy entitles them to in coverage.old republic asserts that the policy limits the insureds recovery to.the district court ruled in favor of the insureds.
the aviation policy general liability provision represents an agreement by old republic 
to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury sustained by any person excluding any passenger unless the words including passengers appear in item of the declarations and property damage,caused by an occurrence and arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of the aircraft.
app.emphasis added.
item of the declarations contains the phrase including passengers.app.pursuant to the policy definitions,bodily injury is defined as bodily injury,sickness,disease or mental anguish sustained by any person which occurs during the policy period,including death at any time resulting therefrom.app.emphasis added.
old republic exposure is limited under the aviation policy,however,by a liability limitation provision which reads,in pertinent part 
the total liability of the company for all damages shall not exceed the limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to each occurrence.
and further provided that if the declarations are completed to show passenger liability sic limited to,the total liability of the company for all damages,including damages for care and loss of service because of bodily injury to passengers shall not exceed 
a as respect any one passenger,the amount stated in the declarations as applicable to each person.
b as respect two or more passengers,subject to the above provisions respecting any one passenger,the amount stated in the declarations as applicable to each person multiplied by the number of passengers on board the aircraft but in no event shall the company liability for all bodily injury exceed the limits stated in the declarations as applicable to each occurrence.
app.the declarations limit the amount applicable to each occurrence to million,and to each person to.app.
old republic argues,and the insureds do not contest,that the aviation policy limits recovery for bodily injury for each passenger to.old republic then goes on,however,to argue that this limit pertains to all claims made in connection with the october,crash.more specifically,old republic maintains that the decedents families claims for mental anguish are included within the liability limit for each passenger because these claims derive from the actions for bodily injury to each passenger,they could not have been made but for the injury to the particular passenger.
we are not persuaded by old republic derivative argument.in this case,the policy clearly provides coverage for claims of emotional distress as well as passengers.as we have recited,the policy definition of bodily injury specifically includes mental anguish sustained by any person,app,and its general liability provision expressly states that coverage is available to any person who suffers from mental anguish that is caused by an occurrence and arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of the aircraft.app.the decedents families mental anguish claims clearly arose from the use of the crashed aircraft,and are therefore covered by the policy general liability provision.
old republic argues,however,that under its policy the total liability of the company for all damages,including damages for care and loss of service because of bodily injury to passengers shall not exceed b as respect two or more passengers the amount stated in the declarations as applicable to each person multiplied by the number of passengers on board the aircraft app.according to old republic,the phrase for all damages limits the insureds coverage to per passenger,regardless of any injury that may have experienced as a result of the crash.
we can not agree.the policy provision relied upon by old republic explicitly refers to passenger liability.app.that provision makes no mention of limiting liability for bodily injury.app.this makes it clear that the policy limitation was intended to apply to bodily injury sustained by passengers,but not to injuries sustained by.
in short,if old republic had meant to limit its coverage for mental anguish and other noneconomic injuries to by including such claims within the scope of coverage for injury to passengers,it could have done so explicitly.the language of the policy clearly explains that claims for mental anguish are covered and are independent of the limitation for passenger injury 
finally,the cases relied on by old republic are distinguishable from the one at hand.in in the matter of the estate of daigle,en banc,the policy in that case did not include mental anguish within the definition of bodily injury,as it does in the old republic policy.hence,the claimants in daigle were limited to a per passenger recovery because they were not covered for mental anguish by the daigle policies.moreover,since the decision in daigle,the colorado wrongful death act.ann.et,has now been amended to include noneconomic damages similar to those found in the old republic policy.because it involved different policy language and was decided under different colorado law,the daigle case is inapposite.
spaur allstate insurance,is similarly inapposite.admittedly,spaur was decided after the amendment to the wrongful death act and did find that the liability provision at issue plainly restricts coverage to those who have sustained bodily injury and includes within that coverage any derivative claims of other persons.id.at.what distinguishes spaur from this case,however,are the differences in the two policies.unlike the aviation policy in this case,the policy in spaur defined bodily injury only as bodily injury,sickness,disease or death,and did not include mental anguish as an element of damages.id.at.by contrast,the aviation policy here explicitly includes all in its coverage provision and defines mental anguish as a compensable bodily injury.
because the aviation policy clearly provides coverage for all persons suffering from mental anguish as a result of aircraft operation,the decedents families mental anguish claims are not limited by the each person limitation.they are limited,however,by,which prohibits recovery for noneconomic loss or injury in wrongful death cases in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars.this limit is applied collectively for each decedent,see mitson ag eng g dev,and is not contested by the insureds.as a result,the insureds are entitled under the aviation policy to a total recovery of for mental anguish to each of the decedents families x,and for the injuries to the decedents themselves x.
b.the cgl policy the airport liability policy 
old republic entered into another policy with the insureds,the cgl policy.under that policy,old republic agreed that it will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury the insurance afforded applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought,except with respect to the limits of the company liability.app.italics added.the amount of coverage available for each occurrence is limited to million.app.
thus,watkins,who by reason of the state court wrongful death judgment is legally responsible to the decedents families under the colorado wrongful death act,would be entitled to up to million in coverage under the cgl policy if he is not excluded from coverage by the policy.
the exclusionary provision of the policy eliminates coverage for 
b bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership,maintenance,operation,use,loading or unloading of 
any aircraft owned or operated by the named insured,or 
any aircraft operated by any person in the course of his employment by the named insured.
app.the parties agree this exclusion precludes coverage with respect to durango and borcher,as the owner and operator of the airplane,respectively.they disagree,however,with respect to watkins coverage.
however,the cgl policy contains special airport provisions,one of which states that the exclusion cited above also applies only to aircraft in flight by or for the account of the insured.app.italics added.the parties dispute as respects the cgl policy therefore focuses on whether the flight that crashed on october,was a flight by or for the account of watkins,a corporate officer of durango and one of two durango shareholders if it was for the account of watkins,the policy would not cover watkins liability.if it was not for his account,as we hold here,watkins is covered for up to million.
both parties note the silence of colorado law interpreting the special airport provision and therefore rely,inter alia,on boeing airplane firemen fund indem.see also state farm fire cas.keenan,d,applying boeing.
boeing had contracted with the government to modify a b aircraft.in connection with that contract,boeing had taken out insurance policies.after the aircraft crashed during a test flight,boeing became responsible to pay some in damages to other parties.boeing sought to recoup those monies from the fireman fund insurance.for boeing to be covered under its policy with the fireman fund,any accident would have to occur after boeing had relinquished possession of the aircraft if boeing had maintained possession,it was not covered.the policy also provided that it would not apply to the use of any aircraft and its coverage was not available where the aircraft was in flight by or for the account of the insured boeing.the washington supreme court summarized these conditions by stating 
under the specific provisions of the policies,there can be no coverage and the judgment in favor of the insurance company must be affirmed if the accident occurred before boeing had relinquished possession of the plane to others,or if the plane was in flight by or for the account of boeing.
the washington supreme court affirmed the trial court finding that boeing had not relinquished possession of the plane at the time of the crash,and therefore there was no coverage for boeing.addi
