in this appeal,we determine whether,under maryland law,a title insurance company must indemnify its insured for expenses incurred by the insured to resolve a defect in title to land when the expenses were incurred after the insured conveyed the land away and the cost of defending an action for trespass filed after the policy period,based on damage sustained during the policy period.the district court entered summary judgment,holding that the insurance company was responsible for both the expenses incurred in resolving the defect in title and the costs of defending the trespass action.
for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court ruling that the expenses incurred by the insured in resolving the title defect were covered,and we affirm its ruling requiring a defense of the trespass action.
in,investment limited partnership investment assembled a tract of land in howard county,maryland,which it intended to develop for residential homes.as part of the assemblage,investment purchased a tract from frances miller and mildred miller,receiving from them a special warranty deed dated october.in connection with the assemblage,investment purchased title insurance from safeco title insurance corporation,paying a premium of more than million.the effective date of that title policy was december.
in furtherance of its development efforts,investment subdivided the tract and subjected it to a declaration of covenants,easements,charges and liens.it also deeded common areas to the lyndwood association,a homeowners association.the miller tract itself became part of a conveyance that investment made to a homebuilder,nvr homes.the deed to nvr homes,dated july,included only a special warranty grantor covenants that it will warrant specially the property hereby granted and conveyed.nvr homes ultimately conveyed the miller tract,now subdivided,to three separate homeowners.
as it turned out,some four years before investment purchased the miller tract,the millers had conveyed the same property to the ahsan khan,profit sharing plan khan profit sharing plan,and in,khan conveyed the miller tract to meadowridge properties.meadowridge properties,in turn,conveyed the property to courtyards at timbers,llc,a developer that was also assembling property.when investment learned in july of this competing conveyance,it repurchased the miller tract from courtyards at timbers for,enabling investment then to clean up title to the tract that it had conveyed to nvr homes.
also,in march,khan commenced an action against investment for trespassing on the miller tract during the period,when investment purportedly owned the tract.
investment notified chicago title insurance company,the successor to safeco title insurance corporation,of the double conveyance and requested that chicago title indemnify investment for the that it paid to repurchase the miller tract,plus the costs of reacquisition.in addition,shortly after khan commenced the trespass action,investment requested that chicago title defend it in that litigation.chicago title denied both requests,stating that when investment conveyed the miller tract to nvr homes in july,its coverage with respect to that property ended.
chicago title then commenced this action for a declaratory judgment that its coverage determinations were correct.investment filed a counterclaim for a determination that it was covered and for damages,with respect to both the reacquisition of the miller tract and the defense of the khan litigation.the parties stipulated to the operative facts,and the district court decided the case on for summary judgment.in entering judgment in favor of investment,the district court concluded that chicago title was obligated both to indemnify investment for the expenses of reacquiring the miller tract and to provide investment with a defense in the khan litigation.the court entered a money judgment in favor of investment in the amount of for the cost of acquiring the miller tract and for attorneys fees incurred in defending the khan litigation,plus any additional expenses that investment might incur in that litigation.
from the district court judgment,chicago title filed this appeal.
chicago title argues that because investment completely disposed of any purported interest investment had in the disputed tract,investment was no longer covered under the general statement of coverage contained in the title insurance policy.chicago title also argues that because the deed by which investment conveyed the disputed trust to nvr homes did not contain a warranty of title,coverage terminated in when the tract was conveyed.
investment contends that under the terms of the title insurance policy,so long as investment owned any interest in the land,defined by the policy to comprise the assemblage,coverage continued after investment conveyance of the miller tract to nvr homes.investment continued to own acres of the tract,so in its view,it was still covered under the policy.alternatively,investment contends that coverage continued after the miller tract conveyance because investment continued to have warranty obligations in connection with the miller tract.these obligations arose,according to investment,when it subdivided the property and certified the plat it imposed the declaration of covenants on the assemblage,stating that investment was the owner of all the land and it represented to the homeowners association in its conveyance of common areas that it had effectively subdivided the property and imposed restrictions on all of the real property in the assemblage.the representations made in those documents were,it argues,covenants of warranty that imposed on investment continuing obligations after its conveyance to nvr for which it was covered by the policy.
our resolution of these coverage issues is governed by the contractual terms contained in the insurance policy.under maryland law,which applies in this case based on diversity jurisdiction,insurance policies are to be construed as are any other contracts.see catalina enterprises.pension trust hartford fire ins,cir.accordingly,courts applying maryland law to insurance contracts must,as with any other contract,ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties at the time of contracting.id.
by its terms,the title insurance policy in this case insured investment against loss or damage sustained or incurred by the insured by reason of t itle to the estate or interest described in schedule a a fee simple interest in the assemblage being invested otherwise then as stated therein.the policy states that coverage is subject to the exclusions,exceptions,conditions,and stipulations contained in it.one of the conditions and stipulations in the policy provided that coverage would continue as long as the insured retains an estate or interest in the land or so long as such insured shall have liability by reason of covenants of warranty made by such insured in any transfer or conveyance of such estate or interest.in short,the policy provided coverage for as long as the insured retain ed an estate or interest in the land,and the coverage extended for as long as the insured had liability by reason of covenants of warranty given in the transfer of the land.
a natural reading of this policy language evinces the intent of the parties to limit the scope of title protection to the period running from the effective date of the policy until the insured conveys away its interest in the land,unless,in the conveyance,the insured gives warranties to the grantee.if the insured does give a warranty to the grantee,coverage extends to protect the insured obligation under that warranty.but if it does not,then title insurance for that land ends,and any risk of loss for defective title becomes the problem of the new owner.
the allocation of risk by this agreement gives title insurance coverage to the insured during the period when the insured purportedly owns the property,when most of the adverse consequences due to a defective title would occur.if a preexisting defect in title were to remain after the insured conveyed the land,the risk inherent in that defect would pass to the purchaser and the insure
