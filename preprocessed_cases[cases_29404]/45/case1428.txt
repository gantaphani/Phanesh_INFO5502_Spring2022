susan wintermute,a former director of the sinclair national bank snb,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the kansas bankers surety kbs in this insurance policy dispute concerning whether a directors and officers d o liability insurance policy obligated kbs to defend wintermute in a criminal action brought against her as a director of snb.wintermute also appeals the district court denial of her motion to amend the tort claim in her complaint against kbs.we affirm the denial of the motion to amend the complaint,but we reverse and remand the district court grant of summary judgment on the insurance contract claim,as genuine issues of material fact exist concerning whether two policy exclusions apply.
this dispute returns to us following our previous opinion remanding the case to the district court,in which we affirmed the district court dismissal of wintermute tort claim but reversed the district court grant of summary judgment on the insurance contract claim.see mcaninch wintermute,cir.a detailed recitation of the underlying facts of the case can be found in our prior opinion,and we summarize the facts here as they relate to the instant appeal.
kbs provided a d o liability policy to snb for the relevant period of time.susan wintermute and her former husband,damian sinclair,were indicted on criminal charges for filing false statements in connection with their purchase of snb in and for various bank fraud charges related to loans snb subsequently purchased from two companies in which wintermute and sinclair held financial interests.sinclair filed a civil action in state court against kbs on june,which kbs removed to the united states district court for the western district of missouri on august,alleging that kbs had wrongfully refused to defend sinclair against the criminal charges filed against him.sinclair died prior to the criminal trial,and his estate was substituted as the plaintiff in this removed civil action on july.wintermute joined the case as a plaintiff at the same time.wintermute was convicted on august,of the two counts of the criminal indictment related to the false filings made by wintermute and sinclair associated with their purchase of snb.wintermute was acquitted of the four criminal counts related to fraudulent banking activities engaged in after the bank was purchased and while wintermute was acting as a director.
following the criminal trial and wintermute conviction on two of the six counts,wintermute filed a second amended complaint in this action on october.the second amended complaint included a tort claim for malicious interference with wintermute criminal defense,alleging that kbs withheld exculpatory documents that her counsel had subpoenaed and that would have assisted in her defense of the four counts on which she was acquitted.these to in the complaint as the covered counts under the to activity wintermute allegedly engaged in as a director after the bank was purchased.the second amended complaint recognized that kbs d o coverage did not extend to the two criminal counts related to the preacquisition activity,as kbs only provided coverage to wintermute as a director,a position she did not hold until after the acquisition of the bank.
in march,the district court ordered kbs to produce over pages from its crime bond file related to snb.the file contained copies of assignments of loans purportedly signed by wintermute.five of the loans predated acquisition of snb,and twelve were dated after the change in ownership and while wintermute served as a director.according to wintermute,the documents contained clear forgeries of her signature.the crime bond file also contained a proof of loss filed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as receiver of snb,naming only sinclair as involved in criminal conduct.wintermute believed the forged documents would have been crucial to her defense of the preacquisition counts on which she was convicted.
after receiving the documents,wintermute filed a motion for leave to serve additional expedited discovery on march,arguing that the crime bond file would have exculpated her from criminal liability on all counts.the district court denied the motion.wintermute also argued in her pretrial brief,filed on may,that she intended to prove at the trial of this case that she would have been acquitted on all counts if kbs had not wrongfully and intentionally withheld the crime bond file.the district court granted summary judgment to kbs on may,obviating the need for a trial.wintermute filed a motion for reconsideration,again arguing that she was prepared to amend her pleadings at trial to conform to the evidence of the crime bond file and to include a tort claim concerning both the covered counts and the noncovered counts,but she never actually moved to amend the complaint.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration the same day.
wintermute appealed to this court on june,and we affirmed in part and reversed in part.see mcaninch,at.we held that the policy did not limit its coverage to claims relying solely on a director status,and we reversed the summary judgment that had been granted on this basis,remanding the insurance contract claim.id.at.we affirmed the district court conclusion that exclusion,related to claims brought by regulatory agencies,did not preclude coverage for criminal charges brought by the united states.id.at.we also affirmed the dismissal of the malicious interference tort claim and the district court denial of wintermute motion for reconsideration.id.at.
after the case was remanded,wintermute filed a motion in the district court to amend her complaint to add an allegation to her malicious interference tort claim that the withheld crime bond file would have aided in the defense of the noncovered counts,for which she suffered an.the district court denied the motion to amend based on the doctrines of res judicata and the law of the case.the district court again granted summary judgment in favor of kbs,concluding that wintermute could not establish that she suffered a loss for purposes of coverage.it held in the alternative that two exclusions precluded coverage in any event.wintermute appeals the denial of her motion to amend and the grant of summary judgment.
we normally review the district court denial of leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion.to the extent the district court denial was based on the legal doctrines of res judicata and the law of the case,we review the application of those doctrines de novo.see zutz nelson,cir.we review the grant of summary judgment on the insurance claim de novo,applying the same standard applied by the district court and utilizing state law to determine the insurance coverage issues.see country life ins.marks,cir.
motion to amend tort claim 
in the first appeal of this case,we reverse d the district court grant of summary judgment to kbs as to wintermute demand for coverage,but w e affirm ed in all other respects,mcaninch,at,including the dismissal of the tort claim.following remand,the district court rejected wintermute motion to amend the dismissed tort claim based on the doctrines of res judicata and the law of the case.
under res judicata,a judgment on the merits in an earlier lawsuit bars a second suit involving the same parties based on the same cause of action.prof l mgmt,kpmg llp,cir.the requirements for application of res judicata are a final judgment on the merits,based on proper jurisdiction,between the same parties,and based on the same claims or causes of action.yankton sioux tribe dep t of health human,cir.the first requirement is met because res judicata applies to all final claims,even if other claims within a case remain alive.see lair oglesby,cir r es judicata can apply to prevent reassertion of dismissed claims,even though there remain live claims in the same litigation restatement second of judgments,comment e judgment may be final as to part of an action or claim,with action continuing as to rest.there is no dispute that the district court reached the merits of the tort claim and this court affirmed the merits of that disposition,making the dismissal of the tort claim final.neither do the parties dispute jurisdiction or that the prior judgment involved the same parties.as for the last requirement that the prior judgment involve the same causes of action,a prior judgment binds a party not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand,but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.yankton sioux tribe,at quoting comm r sunnen.wintermute received the crime bond file on march,over two months before the district court granted summary judgment to kbs on the tort claim.wintermute did not formally attempt to amend her malicious interference claim to allege that kbs interfered with her defense of the noncovered counts until over two years later,after our opinion in the appeal of that judgment the district court judgment therefore covers a tort claim related to the noncovered counts,as those could have been included in the original claim but were not.
because the doctrine of res judicata would have foreclosed the claims wintermute sought to add to her complaint,any amendment would have been futile the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying wintermute leave to amend her complaint.see popoalii corr.med,cir motion to amend complaint properly denied if amendment would be futile.
contract claim 
the parties agree that interpretation of the insurance policy in this diversity case is governed by arkansas substantive law.see murray greenwich ins,cir.under arkansas law,the meaning of an insurance policy is a legal issue for the court.see mcgrew farm bureau mut.ins.of.in construing insurance contracts,arkansas courts read the whole document together and determine whether all parts are in harmony.if possible arkansas law give s effect to the overall meaning of the contract.it is error to give effect to one clause over another on the same subject if the two clauses are reconcilable.travelers indem.olive sporting goods.a basic tenet of contract law is that each word in the agreement should be interpreted to have a meaning,rather than to be redundant and superfluous.jones sun carriers,cir applying arkansas law.
the district court granted summary judgment to kbs on the insurance contract claim based on its determination that wintermute had not had a claim for loss made against her as a director,and therefore coverage had not triggered.the coverage provision of the policy at issue provides the underwriter kbs agrees a to indemnify each and every person who was,or now is a director for personal loss which the director is legally obligated to pay by reason of any wrongful act solely in their capacities of director which is first discovered during the policy period.add.tab at.the term loss is defined in the policy.loss a shall mean any amount which the directors are legally obligated to pay for a claim made against the directors for wrongful acts and shall include but not be limited to damages,judgments,and defense of legal claims id.at.using that definition in the coverage provision,the policy provides coverage for any amount a director is legally obligated to pay for a claim made against the director for a wrongful act.
kbs argues that there is no coverage because a condition precedent to coverage is a claim for loss,and a criminal charge is not a claim for an amount wintermute is legally obligated to pay.the district court also focused its discussion of the coverage issue on a claim for loss.it reasoned that a claim,which was not defined in the policy,is a demand for money or something owed.because a criminal indictment,absent a count for restitution,is not a demand for money,the district court determined that wintermute did not have a claim for loss made against her to trigger kbs obligation to defend or indemnify her under the policy 
the problem with the district court and kbs reasoning is that the plain language of the policy provides coverage for loss a director is obligated to pay for a claim made against a director for a wrongful act.the coverage language does not preface coverage on a claim for loss,only a claim for a wrongful act.the parties do not dispute that the criminal actions alleged in wintermute criminal case are claims against wintermute for a wrongful act,nor do they dispute that the attorney fees she expended in defending herself are an amount she is legally obligated to pay stemming from that claim for a wrongful act.therefore,for coverage purposes,the covered counts of the criminal indictment are claims for a wrongful act against wintermute,and kbs must indemnify wintermute for any loss she is obligated to pay by reason of the criminal indictment.see polychron crum forster ins,cir construing a materially indistinguishable d o policy under arkansas law and holding that the grand jury investigation and the questioning by the assistant united states attorney amounted,as a practical matter,to an allegation of wrongdoing against the insured bank officer.
having found coverage,we must turn to the exclusion provisions to see if any one of them precludes coverage for the legal expenses incurred with respect to the acquitted counts.the policy includes a prefatory statement to the exclusion provisions that provides kbs shall not be liable to make any payment or provide any defense in connection with any claim for loss made against the bank or directors add.tab at.it then goes on to list several types of excluded claims.wintermute argues that none of the exclusions can apply because there is not a claim for loss made against her,only criminal misconduct charges of which she was acquitted.wintermute argument is the inverse of kbs previous argument on the coverage kbs argued that there is no coverage absent a claim for loss,wintermute argues that none of the exclusions apply because there must first be a claim for loss as stated in the prefatory language before any one of the exclusions is triggered.
in contrast to kbs argument on the coverage issue,wintermute argument is based on a phrase that does exist in the exclusion section prefatory language claim for loss.wintermute argues that the exclusion provisions apply only to claims for loss made against a director,and a criminal indictment is not a claim for loss because the claim the criminal indictment does not seek an amount owed by the director.however,if we substitute the policy definition of loss into the exclusion provision language,it would read kbs shall not be liable to make any payment or provide any defense in connection with any claim for any amount which the directors are legally obligated to pay for a claim made against the directors for wrongful acts and shall include defense of legal claims made against the directors.in other words,coverage is excluded for a claim for any amount a director is legally obligated to pay for a claim against the director for a wrongful act made against the director that falls within one of the enumerated types of exclusions.the claim for loss is different than the claim for a wrongful act.the attorney fees associated with wintermute criminal defense of the acquitted counts the covered counts are a claim for an amount she is legally obligated to pay related to a claim against her for a wrongful act.see polychron,at holding that attorney fees incurred in aid of a criminal defense fell within the definition of loss contained in the policy under a similar definition as the definition of loss used here.
although the prefatory exclusion provision uses the term claim for loss and the coverage provision does not,substitution of the contract definition of loss into the prefatory exclusion provision makes clear that the exclusion provision prefatory language is meant to mirror the coverage provision,so that the prefatory language does nothing more than state there is no coverage under the policy if one of the enumerated exclusions applies.this interpretation give s effect to the overall meaning of the contract,reconciling the two clauses,see travelers indem,at,and is consistent with the prior panel opinion,see mcaninch,at the district court construction of this contract fails to for that matter language which
