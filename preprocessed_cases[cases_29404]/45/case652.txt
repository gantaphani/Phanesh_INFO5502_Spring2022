appellant,studio frames,somerhill gallery,is a fine art gallery located in the eastgate shopping center in chapel hill,north carolina.studio frames leases its gallery location from the owner of the shopping center,but has made improvements to the space,known as leasehold improvements,to make it suitable for use as an art gallery.
in october,as a condition of an emergency loan from the small business administration,studio frames was required to purchase federal flood insurance under the national flood insurance program nfip,et,to provide coverage both for the leasehold improvements it had made to its rental space and for the contents of its gallery.it did so a month later through appellee standard fire insurance company standard fire,an authorized carrier of federal flood insurance under the federal emergency management agency fema write your own or wyo program.see a.like all flood insurance purchased through the nfip,see b,the terms of studio frames policy were set forth in the standard flood insurance policy sfip,codified in fema official regulations at,app.a.the policy purchased by studio frames provided coverage of up to for flood damage to the portion of the shopping center occupied by studio frames or building coverage,identified in the sfip as coverage a,and for flood damage to the contents of the gallery or contents coverage,identified in the sfip as coverage b.over the next four years,studio frames paid a premium for the policy that reflected the combined cost of both coverage limits.see.
on july,studio frames suffered severe flood damage to its gallery,including to its leasehold improvements,and to the gallery contents.it contacted standard fire almost immediately thereafter to report the damage.standard fire,in turn,arranged for an adjuster,leo soucy,to visit the premises,which he did three days later on july.in the course of his visit,soucy learned that studio frames leased,rather than owned,the portion of the shopping center that housed its gallery,and that federal realty trust investments,the owner of the shopping center,maintained a federal flood insurance policy that covered the entire building,including the studio frames gallery.on the basis of these discoveries,soucy informed studio frames that the building coverage,for which studio frames had paid premiums for four years,was invalid under the sfip because studio frames did not own the building.soucy explained further that,in his view,of the sfip,coverage b e,limited a tenant recovery for damages to its leasehold improvements to of the total amount of the tenant content coverage,in this case.consistent with soucy representation,standard fire attempted to refund to studio frames the premium it had paid for building coverage in the past year on august,and,on september,standard fire informed studio frames by letter that,u nder the standard flood insurance policy and sic can not purchase building coverage on a building he does not own.
as required by o of the sfip,studio frames next filed a proof of loss with standard fire on september,itemizing and valuing its losses due to the flood,and ultimately claiming total losses in excess of the policy limit of for contents coverage.the proof of loss,comprehensive in all other respects,did not include damage that would have been covered under the sfip building coverage instead,it provided only that studio frames reserved the right to file an additional proof of loss for leasehold improvements coverage.studio frames did not subsequently file an additional proof of loss,however,a decision that its counsel now asserts was made consciously and intentionally because standard fire had already breached the contract of insurance.
on september,standard fire accepted studio frames proof of loss as complying with the policy conditions and provisions of the sfip,but rejected the values that studio frames attached to its losses.after several months of negotiations,standard fire eventually determined that studio frames suffered flood damage compensable under the sfip contents coverage coverage b in the amount of and,on january,issued a check to studio frames for less that standard fire had released to studio frames at an earlier date.as is relevant to this appeal,this final determination of coverage included in recompense for leasehold improvements,as required by section e of the sfip contents coverage coverage b,but provided no compensation under its building coverage coverage a.the calculation also excluded,as not covered by the sfip,the value of certain promotional materials art cards,slides,and transparencies that were damaged in the flood.
within a year of being notified that its claim was partially denied,studio frames brought suit in federal district court to challenge standard fire denial of coverage for flood damage to both its leasehold improvements and promotional materials.the district court dismissed studio frames claim at summary judgment.as to the leasehold improvements,the court ruled that studio frames was barred by the terms of the sfip from sustaining a challenge to standard fire denial of coverage because it failed to file a proof of loss detailing the damage to this property.see also sfip,t.and,concerning the promotional materials,the court agreed with standard fire that the materials were properly characterized as valuable papers and,for that reason,beyond the coverage of the sfip.studio frames appealed the district court judgment in both respects.
although the parties have not briefed the issue and the district court did not consider it,we must establish in the first instance that we have subject matter jurisdiction over this case.see american canoe ass murphy farms,cir explaining that subject matter jurisdiction is the basis for the very legitimacy of a court adjudicatory authority.studio frames,alone among the parties,provided a jurisdictional statement in its brief,but we have specifically reserved the question of whether its asserted basis for jurisdiction,is sound.battle seibels bruce ins,cir declining to tackle the difficult statutory construction question of whether provides the federal courts with original,exclusive jurisdiction over nfip claims against a wyo carrier.and,indeed,there is substantial disagreement among the circuits as to whether section establishes original exclusive jurisdiction over claims,such as this one,brought by an insured against the wyo carrier through whom it acquired flood insurance,as opposed to an action institute d against the director of fema.see conferring original and exclusive jurisdiction upon the federal courts to hear and determine claims instituted by claimants under section against the director 
we once again decline to decide this question because,in this case,even more clearly than in battle,we possess subject matter jurisdiction over studio frames breach of contract claims pursuant to.see battle,at.federal common law controls the interpretation of insurance policies issued pursuant to the national flood insurance program.leland fed.ins,cir.therefore,studio frames right to relief on its claims for breach of contract,both of which hinge on the court interpretation of a standard form insurance policy issued pursuant to the nfip and codified in federal regulations,necessarily depends on the resolution of a substantial question of federal law,franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.accord downey,at newton capital assur,cir van holt,at.
having concluded that we have federal question jurisdiction over this cause of action under,we turn to the substance of studio frames appeal.
studio frames first argues that the district court erred by refusing to consider its challenge to the denial of coverage for its leasehold improvements because it had failed to file a corresponding proof of loss.studio frames acknowledges,as it must,both that the sfip requires that a proof of loss be filed within sixty days with respect to all damages suffered by an insured,sfip o,and that it never filed a proof of loss for damages to its leasehold improvements.it nevertheless urges that it was excused from this contractual requirement because standard fire repudiated the building coverage portion of the sfip coverage a prior to the date on which it was required to have filed a proof of loss.
the district court rejected this argument,believing it to be foreclosed by our recent decision in dawkins witt,cir.this was error.studio frames does not contend that standard fire effectively waived the requirement that it file a proof of loss,or that standard fire is estopped by its previous conduct from relying on the proof of loss requirement as a defense rather,it asserts that,by its statements and actions,standard fire repudiated coverage a of the sfip altogether and that,as a direct result of this repudiation,it was relieved of the otherwise incumbent obligation to file a proof of loss before bringing a suit for breach of contract.this argument is separate and distinct from the arguments of waiver and estoppel that we addressed and rejected in dawkins.see dawkins,at.whereas the equitable concepts of waiver and estoppel prevent a party from asserting a legal right that is otherwise valid and would be binding on the parties,see zipes trans world airlines,d holding that waiver is to be invoked when equity so requires office of management richmond,d,the legal doctrine of repudiation sometimes called anticipatory breach provides that,when one party repudiates its obligations under a contract,the unperformed contractual rights and duties of the contract cease to be binding on the party altogether.restatement second of contracts cmt.b explaining that one party repudiation discharges any remaining duties of performance of the other party with respect to the expected exchange emphasis added.as a leading treatise on the law of contracts makes clear,after one party to a contract repudiates its contractual rights and obligations,the right of the party to recover on the contract without first performing conditions precedent is given to the party by the law,irrespective of the repudiating party wishes.williston on contracts richard lord,ed emphasis added.
thus,this case presents a more than we considered in dawkins.here,we must consider,not whether equity forbids standard fire from relying on the sfip requirement that studio frames file a proof of loss under dawkins,it may not,but instead whether the otherwise binding requirement that studio frames file a proof of loss could be legally excused by a repudiation of the sfip by standard fire.we conclude that it could be and,therefore,that the district court erred by dismissing studio frames claim for failing to file a proof of loss for damage to its leasehold improvements without determining first whether standard fire repudiated the policy.
to begin,the law is well settled that federal common law alone governs the interpretation of insurance policies like the sfip at issue here issued pursuant to the nfip.battle,at leland,at.article of the part of fema this clear.entitled what law governs,it provides that the sfip is governed by the flood insurance regulations issued by fema,the national flood insurance act of as amended and federal common law.emphasis added.thus,it is absolutely clear that our construction of the sfip is to be controlled by federal common law.
equally clearly,the federal courts,applying federal common law to contractual disputes,have long recognized the doctrine of repudiation.see roehm horst.rederiaktiebolaget atlanten aktieselskabet foderstof kompagniet.city of fairfax washington metropolitan area transit authority,cir.in fact,the supreme court has affirmed repeatedly,including twice in the past four years,the doctrine applicability to contracts between the government and private parties.see franconia united states,d mobil oil exploration and producing southeast,united states,d lynch united states.the united states are as much bound by their contracts as are individuals.if they repudiate their obligations,it is as much repudiation,with all the wrong and reproach that term implies,as it would be if the repudiator had been a state or a municipality or a citizen.quoting the sinking fund cases.furthermore,to the extent that the development of these governing federal common law principles is informed by standard insurance law principles,see battle,at providing that such principles offer federal courts a valuable repository of settled law on which to base federal common law,courts have consistently recognized that the repudiation of coverage under an insurance policy relieves the insured of the obligation of performing conditions precedent prior to bringing suit for breach of contract.see knickerbocker life ins.pendleton.conrad john deere ins,iowa aetna ins.indiana nat.life ins,pino union bankers ins,so d.on the basis of these authorities,we believe it obvious that the flood insurance policy at issue in this case was,on its own terms,subject to repudiation see lynch,at.holding that war insurance policies between the government and citizens although not entered into for gain,are legal obligations of the same dignity as other contracts of the united states and possess the same legal incidents.we therefore agree with studio frames that,if standard fire refusal to provide building coverage under the sfip amounted to a repudiation of its policy for flood insurance,studio frames failure to file a proof of loss was not dispositive of its claim.
standard fire objects that,pursuant to t of the sfip,an insured failure to observe the policy proof of loss requirement,sfip o,serves as an absolute bar to recovery in federal court,regardless of whether its actions may be construed as a repudiation of the policy building coverage.article t of the sfip provides,in relevant part,as follows no suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with 
in standard fire view,the requirement that a proof of loss be filed within sixty days is a requirement under the policy,and,consequently,studio frames failure to comply is fatal to its claim.it maintains that any other interpretation of the sfip could mandate a payment from the federal treasury on terms other than those devised by congress and thereby violate the appropriations clause of the constitution,const.art.i,cl.see office of personnel management richmond,d providing that not a dollar of the money in the federal treasury can be used in the payment of any thing not thus previously sanctioned.
though this argument has some initial appeal,it ultimately fails on its own terms.article t of the sfip directs that,in order to sustain a claim based on its coverage,the insured must have complied with the requirements of the policy.see sfip standard fire is correct that,in the ordinary course,this means that the failure of an insured to file a proof of loss forecloses an insured from recovery on a policy issued pursuant the nfip.see dawkins,at.but the same does not hold when an insurer repudiates an nfip policy before the insured was obligated to file a proof of loss with the insurer,because the consequence of a repudiation is that the insured is no longer required under the policy to file a proof of loss before bringing suit on the policy.restatement second of contracts cmt.thus,if standard fire actually repudiated the policy in this case,t of the sfip would not bar studio frames from proceeding with its claim due to its failure to file a proof of loss because,in contrast to those cases where the policy has not been repudiated,the filing of a proof of loss has ceased to be a requirement of the policy.
having concluded that the policy at issue here may be repudiated,it is left to be determined,of course,whether standard fire statements and actions regarding the sfip building coverage actually did amount to repudiation.the district court did not consider this question because it incorrectly regarded the failure to file a proof of loss as an absolute bar to recovery under the policy,and we decline to take it up for the first time on appeal.
we do offer some guidance upon remand,however.first,in determining whether standard fire repudiated a term of the contract,the district court should bear in mind that a refused performance need not be expr
