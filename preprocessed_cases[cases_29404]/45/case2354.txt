like most of us,donald sequeira sequeira did not work on january,because it was a paid holiday.tragically,he was hospitalized the next day with a sudden illness and died on january without ever returning to work.
sequeira widow sought benefits under a supplemental life insurance policy that was issued to sequeira employer on january.the trial court ruled that she was not entitled to benefits because the policy required her husband to be on the job,at his employer place of employment,performing his customary duties between january and his death.
we disagree with the trial court and reverse its judgment.the policy is ambiguous regarding whether sequeira needed to perform his work responsibilities on new year day or anytime after that in order for his wife to receive benefits.we therefore interpret the policy in favor of sequeira reasonable expectations,which are that he should not have to work on new year day or when he is sick in order to receive coverage that he has paid for.
factual and procedural background 
donald sequeira employment and purchase of life insurance 
sequeira had been employed with the city of vacaville the city since approximately.in the fall of,the city changed its life insurance carrier to defendant lincoln national life insurance company lincoln.the city provided basic life insurance coverage to employees from lincoln,and also offered employees the option of purchasing supplemental coverage from lincoln.
on october,sequeira completed an enrollment form for basic coverage as well as an additional in supplemental coverage.sequeira designated plaintiff michelle sequeira as the primary beneficiary of both the basic and supplemental coverage.sequeira made two premium payments for the supplemental coverage before the end of the year via paycheck deductions.
the supplemental life insurance policy 
lincoln issued the basic and supplemental policies to the city on january,for participating employees,including sequeira.the parties agree that the basic policy was effective on january,and that plaintiff was entitled to benefits under that policy.their disagreement centers on whether plaintiff was entitled to benefits under the supplemental policy.
the supplemental policy contained the following eligibility provision 
eligibility 
if you are a full time employee and a member of an employee class shown in the schedule of insurance then you will become eligible for the coverage provided by the policy on the later of 
the policy date of issue or 
the day you complete the waiting period.
the supplemental policy defined a full time employee as an employee 
whose employment with the employer is the employee principal occupation 
who is not a temporary or seasonal employee and 
who is regularly scheduled to work at such occupation at least the number of hours as shown in the schedule of insurance.
on the same page as the eligibility provision,the supplemental policy contained the following provision regarding effectiveness 
effective dates of coverages 
your insurance is effective on the latest of 
the first day of the insurance month coinciding with or next following the day you become eligible for the coverage 
the day you resume active work,if you are not actively at work on the day you become eligible 
the day you make written application for coverage and sign 
a a payroll deduction order or 
b an order to pay premiums from your flexible benefit plan account,if employer contributions are paid through a flexible benefit plan or 
the first day of the insurance month following the date the company approves your coverage,if evidence of insurability is required.emphasis added.
the parties agree that sequeira was eligible for coverage under the supplemental policy,but disagree whether the supplemental policy ever became effective as to sequeira.their specific dispute centers on whether the active work requirement in paragraph of the effective dates of coverages provision required sequeira to perform his job duties between january and his death on january in order for the supplemental policy to become effective.
the terms active work and actively at work found in paragraph are defined in the supplemental policy as follows 
active work or actively at work means the performance of all customary duties of an employee occupation at the employer place of business or other business location to which the employer requires the employee to travel.
the terms active work and actively at work are used in other parts of the supplemental policy.one such place is the waiting period provision,which states 
waiting period days of continuous active work.
the term active work also appears in the termination of coverage provision,which states 
ceasing active work terminates your eligibility.however,you may continue coverage as follows 
if you cease active work due to a temporary lay off,an approved leave of absence,or a military leave then coverage may be continued 
a for three insurance months after the lay off or leave begins 
b provided premium payments are made on your behalf.
sequeira death and appellant claim for benefits 
sequeira did not work on january,the day the supplemental policy was issued because it was a paid holiday.he was hospitalized suddenly on saturday,january and died on wednesday,january.his cause of death was related to a viral infection in his heart.he did not report to work between january and his death on january.
after sequeira death on january,plaintiff submitted a claim to lincoln for benefits under both the basic and supplemental policies.lincoln paid benefits to plaintiff under the basic policy but denied her benefits under the supplemental policy.lincoln informed her that as to the supplemental policy,sequeira never returned to work from prior to the effective date until his date of death.therefore,sequeira was never actively at work on or after the effective date of this policy,so his coverage under this policy never became effective.
trial court proceedings 
plaintiff filed a complaint against lincoln on august,and an amended complaint on june.the amended complaint alleged causes of action for breach of contract and bad faith against lincoln on the ground that lincoln was obligated to pay under the supplemental policy but refused to do so 
plaintiff moved for summary adjudication against lincoln,arguing that lincoln owed her a duty under the supplemental policy to pay her.lincoln then filed its own motion for summary adjudication on the ground that it did not breach the supplemental policy by denying plaintiff benefits.the trial court heard argument on plaintiff motion on february,and took it under submission.although the trial court initially issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff motion for summary adjudication prior to the february hearing,the court issued a written order on may,denying it.
the trial court heard argument on lincoln motion for summary adjudication on may,and took it under submission.the trial court granted lincoln motion on june,in a written order that was similar to its may,written order denying plaintiff motion.the trial court june order states,in pertinent part 
sequeira had been and remained a full time employee as of january.however,on january,he was not actively at work because he was not on the job,at his employer place of employment,performing his customary duties he was on paid holiday.sequeira was hospitalized on january,and passed away on january.he did not resume active work on or after january.as a result,although he met the eligibility requirements,the policy did not become effective as to him.citations.
the definition of active work or actively at work in sequeira policy does not pertain to the employees status the effective date provision in sequeira policy pertained to the employee location,he was required to be in performance of his customary duties at the employer place of business on january.
although sympathetic to plaintiff,the court can not redraft this insurance contract.citation.
the parties filed a joint stipulation on august,requesting that judgment be entered in favor of lincoln,which the trial court did on august.plaintiff timely filed this appeal.
