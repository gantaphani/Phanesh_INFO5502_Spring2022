damages adamo suffered as a result of the san diego wildfires 
the october wildfires in san diego county damaged adamo landscaping,retaining wall,two woodsheds plus their contents,a tree avocado grove and property associated with his avocado grove,including an irrigation system,culverts and a detached gallon water tank.adamo residence incurred some minor smoke damage,but it did burn.
the principal fire damage was to adamo landscaping,woodsheds and the water system associated with the avocado grove.the water system,the water tank,irrigation system,and culverts was separated from adamo dwelling by clear space and was completely detached from the dwelling,except an underground water pipe connecting the dwelling and water tank.
fie investigation and payment to adamo 
adamo filed a claim under his policy seeking payment for his damaged property.adamo admitted to fie adjuster that he had sold avocados grown on his property.after completing her initial investigation and damages inventory,fie adjuster notified adamo that damage to the avocado trees was not covered under his policy because he indicated that they were being used for a commercial purpose,and such use is excluded under coverage b exclusion.fie did,however,pay adamo for all the items that the adjuster initially found adamo policy did cover the smoke damage to the house,landscaping,and the two woodsheds plus their contents.
after the first payment,fie conducted a further investigation of adamo claim for additional available coverage,including hiring an expert to evaluate the damages adamo sustained to his culvert system.fie reimbursed adamo under coverage b for damage to the culverts,which exhausted coverage b policy limit.
when it made the second payment,fie informed adamo that the applicable coverages in his policy had been exhausted and that it did not owe more than the it had already paid.
adamo then sought payment under coverage a the dwelling coverage for his water tank and irrigation system as well as additional coverage for damage to his culverts.fie denied this claim,asserting the water tank was not attached to his dwelling for purposes of coverage a limits,and the property was used for commercial purposes and thus excluded under coverage 
d.the instant action 
adamo sued fie for breach of contract,bad faith,promissory estoppel,declaratory relief and reformation.the complaint alleged that fie refused,and continues to refuse to reimburse adamo for the cost of repair,replacement cost or the actual cash value of his irrigation system,or water tank as required by the terms and conditions of his policy.
the parties stipulated to try the coverage issue as a threshold matter based on stipulated facts.the court conducted a bench trial to decide the following coverage issue whether available coverage remained for the damaged water tank,irrigation system and culverts.
adamo theory at trial was that coverage a provided additional coverage for any structure or equipment that is physically attached to the dwelling and absolutely necessary for its use even though coverage b expressly covers other structures separated from the dwelling by clear space and connected by a utility line or similar connection,nothing in the policy precluded concurrent or additional coverage for the same property under coverage a even after coverage b limits have been exhausted,an additional,of the limits available in coverage a was also available to cover other structures defined in coverage b fie could not enforce the exclusion in coverage b and the exclusion is inconspicuous,unclear and ambiguous.
fie in turn argued adamo water tank,irrigation system and culverts were not attached to the dwelling so there was no coverage available under coverage a coverage for the water tank would only be available under coverage b for other structures because it expressly covered circumstances where,as here,there was clear space between the dwelling and other structure,and they were only connected by a utility line because it was undisputed that coverage b limit was fully exhausted,no additional benefits were available to adamo even if coverage b policy limit had not been exhausted,the water tank and other property associated with the avocado grove were not covered because they were used for a commercial purpose and the exclusion was clear,conspicuous and unambiguous.
following the trial,the court issued a statement of decision,finding in favor of fie.specifically,the court found none of the applicable policy language was ambiguous coverage for damage to the water tank,the irrigation system and culverts fell under coverage b and not coverage
