in this class action,the representative plaintiffs allege that the defendant insurers conspired together to require their customers,who sought liability coverage on multiple vehicles,to either purchase uninsured motorist coverage for each vehicle or waive it as to all vehicles.plaintiffs alleged that the defendant insurers claimed that this result was compelled by applicable law.the defendant insurers repeatedly demurred to the plaintiffs complaint.finally,the trial court concluded that the third amended complaint failed sufficiently to allege a conspiracy by or among the defendant insurers to engage in any unlawful or unfair conduct with respect to their insureds,including the plaintiffs.concluding that the defendant insurers had done nothing that was not compelled by the relevant uninsured motorist provisions of the insurance code,the trial court sustained the demurrer to the third amended complaint without leave to amend.
after a careful review of the allegation of plaintiffs complaint and the applicable law,we are persuaded that the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to certain of the insurer defendants,but as to others it should have been sustained with leave to amend.the defendant insurers are correct in their contentions with respect to those insurers marketing a single liability policy covering two or more vehicles.the relevant statute requires the very action about which the plaintiffs complain.thus,they can be liable under neither the unfair competition law ucl bus,et nor the cartwright act.bus,et however,as to those insurers marketing individual policies for each vehicle,a different conclusion is warranted.the trial court did not address the argument raised by some of the defendant insurers that plaintiffs were required,and failed,to exhaust their administrative remedies.that issue,and the related issue of the possible application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine,will have to be addressed upon remand.we therefore will affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual and procedural 
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that,during the four years immediately preceding february,the date the plaintiffs filed their original complaint,the defendant insurers were responsible for providing approximately percent of the automobile liability insurance sold in california.during that period,there were approximately insured automobile owners who owned and operated two or more vehicles in the same household.included in this group were the plaintiffs,and others,who desired to purchase uninsured motorist coverage for only one,or at least less than all,of their multiple vehicles.the defendant insurers,however,required that the plaintiffs and other insureds either purchase uninsured motorist coverage for all of their vehicles or have no uninsured motorist coverage on any vehicle.
according to plaintiffs allegations,this business position was enforced by each and everyone of the defendant insurers,whether the insurer sold separate policies for each one of an insured multiple vehicles this was the practice followed by state farm,farmers and allstate or sold a single policy covering all of an insured vehicles this was the practice of all the remaining defendant fn,ante.plaintiffs allege that the defendant insurers,and each of them,agreed together to enforce such an all or nothing policy in order to require insureds who owned multiple vehicles to purchase more uninsured motorist insurance than they needed or desired plaintiffs allege that this unlawful agreement forced some insureds to pay more than they otherwise would have paid for necessary uninsured motorist coverage or,in the case of those who could not afford to purchase such coverage for all vehicles,to go without any uninsured motorist insurance the defendant insurers allegedly justified this business practice by stating that they were compelled by law to provide uninsured motorist coverage in this manner since their marketing practice was compelled by the relevant statutes,there could be no violation of law or an unlawful conspiracy.
insurance code,section the code section that gives insureds a right to obtain uninsured motorist insurance establishes very specific requirements concerning the manner in which such coverage is to be offered to automobile policyholders and the forms of coverage waiver that may be used.to ensure that uninsured motorist coverage is widely written,the legislature requires that it be offered to all california policyholders.the mandatory offer provision is contained in the first sentence of section,subdivision a,which states no policy of bodily injury liability insurance covering liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of any motor vehicle,shall be issued or delivered in this state,unless the policy contains,or has added to it by endorsement,a provision with coverage limits at least equal to the limits specified in subdivision m and in no case less than the financial responsibility requirements specified in section of the vehicle code insuring the insured,the insured heirs or legal representative for all sums within the limits which he,she,or they,as the case may be,shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or wrongful death from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.
the next sentence of section,subdivision a,identifies the three circumstances by which the coverage can be waived or modified through the agreement of the insurer and policyholder.it provides the insurer and any named insured,prior to or subsequent to the issuance or renewal of a policy,may,by agreement in writing,in the form specified in paragraph or paragraph,delete the provision covering damage caused by an uninsured motor vehicle completely,or delete the coverage when a motor vehicle is operated by a natural person or persons designated by name,or agree to provide the coverage in an amount less than that required by subdivision m but not less than the financial responsibility requirements specified in section of the vehicle code.
section,subdivision a,thus authorizes only by which uninsured motorist coverage can be entirely waived,deleted,or modified and mandates the specific language that is to be used in any written agreement providing for such waiver or modification,subd.a,a.in sum,the statute permits deletion of all coverage under the policy deletion of coverage for individuals and an agreement to provide coverage in an amount less than the bodily injury liability limits in the underlying policy.
according to plaintiffs,since at least february,the defendant insurers have participated in a civil conspiracy or combination to sell uninsured motorist insurance pursuant to an alleged business policy that decrees that any particular automobile owner seeking such insurance must purchase additional coverage at an additional price.plaintiffs further allege that in some cases,this additional price is equal to approximately percent of the initial policy price applied to each vehicle that the owner seeks to insure for liability coverage under the financial responsibility requirements of vehicle code section.
plaintiffs allege that additional uninsured motorist insurance covering more than one vehicle is both unnecessary and wasteful.because of that,and because there can be no stacking of the insurance limits of multiple policies see,subd.d,plaintiffs claim that they should have the right to purchase coverage on less than all of their vehicles.but,due to the aforesaid business practice of the defendant insurers,plaintiffs were coerced into purchasing coverage on all owned vehicles,under threat of otherwise having no uninsured motorist coverage at all.
plaintiffs alleged that this business practice was an unfair business practice under the uca bus,et,and resulted in class members being charged coerced rates for unwanted coverage.they also alleged that this business practice resulted in restraint of trade,price fixing,tying agreements and other illegal trade practices,all in violation of the cartwright act bus,et,as well as provisions of the federal clayton act,all to the class damage.the defendant insurers demurred to the complaint.despite multiple opportunities to amend,plaintiffs were unable to allege facts sufficient to satisfy the trial court.it held that section required defendants to offer uninsured motorist coverage on an all or nothing basis to persons who owned multiple vehicles.accordingly,the trial court concluded that the defendant insurers could not be liable for agreeing to do what the law required them to do in the first place.their demurrer was sustained without leave to amend and a judgment of dismissal was entered plaintiffs have prosecuted this timely appeal.
contentions 
plaintiffs argue that the trial court conclusion that the insurance code required the defendant insurers to provide uninsured motorist coverage for all vehicles owned by an insured,or none of them,is wrong.they contend that nothing contained in the insurance code compels such a result.plaintiffs also contend that the allegations of their third amended complaint sufficiently plead the existence of an unlawful conspiracy to violate the uca bus,et and the cartwright act.bus,et the allegations,however general they may be,allege concerted action,undertaken by agreement,to require insured owners of multiple vehicles to purchase uninsured motorist coverage on all of their vehicles or none of them whether a single policy covering multiple vehicles is used or the insurer utilizes separate policies for each vehicle owned by the insured.moreover,if insurers issuing a separate policy for each vehicle are free to agree to a waiver of uninsured motorist coverage as to any or all of the vehicles covered as the defendant insurers apparently concede,the result should be no different just because an insurer chooses to cover an insured multiple vehicles with a single policy.
the defendant insurers advance several arguments in support of the trial court order of dismissal.first,and primarily,they contend that section mandates that uninsured motorist coverage be provided in specified minimum amounts in every policy of bodily injury liability insurance issued or delivered in california.there are three,and only three,circumstances in which such requirement may be waived or modified one of which is a written agreement to waive all uninsured motorist coverage under the policy the statute makes no provision for a right to waive such coverage on a per vehicle basis.thus,in the case of a single policy covering multiple vehicles,uninsured motorist coverage must be purchased for all vehicles or waived as to all.with respect to those defendant insurers that issue separate policies for each vehicle owned by an insured state farm,farmers and allstate,they argue that they permit their insureds to waive uninsured motorist coverage for any of those policies.this contention,however,is contrary to the allegations of the complaint the defendant insurers also argue that plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient specific facts of an unlawful conspiracy,but have only made inadequate general conclusionary allegations.indeed,the defendant insurers argue that,given the general and conclusionary nature of the plaintiffs allegations,the most that they have alleged is parallel conduct by a number of automobile liability insurers.this,they contend,is not sufficient to demonstrate an actionable conspiracy to violate the laws.finally,one of the defendant insurers csaa argues that the plaintiffs are making an objection to an underwriting rule,an issue that is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner and the plaintiffs have not alleged the exhaustion of that administrative remedy.

the relevant law applicable to the purchase and waiver of uninsured motorist coverage 
uninsured motorist coverage provided in a single policy covering multiple vehicles may not be waived on a per vehicle basis 
section,subdivision a is very clear and unambiguous no policy of bodily injury liability insurance covering liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of any motor vehicle,shall be issued or delivered in this state,unless the policy contains,a provision for specified limits of uninsured motorist coverage italics added.
the legislature enacted section in in an attempt to minimize losses to the people of california who are involved in accidents with uninsured or financially irresponsible motorists,mission ins.brown cal d.the committee that drafted section and recommended its passage determined that increasing the number of motorists with uninsured motorist coverage will inevitably lessen personal losses resulting from accidents involving uninsured motorists.assem.com.on judiciary,traffic accident consequences,final.it also found that many motorists did not realize that most auto insurance policies at that time did not contain such coverage.ibid.many other motorists were not even aware that such coverage was available.ibid.the legislature therefore purposefully made the decision to require uninsured motorist coverage to be included in every policy of automobile liability insurance issued or delivered in california,subd.a.
from the outset,it was clear that this coverage was required for every policy.however,it was not deemed to be compulsory the insurer and insured were permitted to delete the provision entirely.the original legislation provided that the insurer and the insured may by supplemental agreement waive application of the provision covering damage caused by an uninsured motor vehicle,as originally enacted by stats,ch.this was the only way that the coverage could be deleted.by subsequent enactments,the legislature ultimately added two new subparagraphs to subdivision a of section,which provided that not only did such supplemental agreement have to be in writing,but it had to be in a particular form,subd.a,a and a.in addition,in and,the legislature added provisions that permitted the deletion of coverage when the vehicle was being operated by a named natural person,and the reduction in the amount of coverage but not to an amount less than the financial responsibility minimum specified in vehicle code section.stats,ch,eff,stats,ch.
the basic and first rule that guides our interpretation and construction of a statute is well established.the fundamental task of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in order to determine this intent,we begin by examining the language of the statute.citation.people cruz cal th,d,italics added.when the statutory language is plain and clear and unambiguously expresses the legislative intent and the single meaning of the language is apparent on its face,we must give it effect.kimmel goland cal d,people hinks th,d.the plaintiffs,in asking us to judicially recognize an insured right to delete one or more but less than all vehicles from a policy uninsured motorist coverage,seek to have us read into this statute something that simply is not there.this we can not do.in the construction of a statute or instrument,the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted,or to omit what has been inserted and where there are several provisions or particulars,such a construction is,if possible,to be adopted as will give effect to all.code civ.
from the statutory language adopted by the legislature and this legislative history,we conclude that there was and is a strong and clearly expressed legislative mandate that uninsured motorist coverage be included in every policy and that it may only be deleted or modified in very specific and limited ways.there is no provision for deleting the coverage on a per vehicle basis so as to allow insured owners of multiple vehicles covered under a single liability policy to delete uninsured motorist coverage as to one or more but less than all of said vehicles.the plain language of the statute makes it clear that it must be applied to the entire policy and this necessarily includes all of the vehicles insured thereunder.in such circumstances,if an insured desires to have multiple vehicles covered by liability insurance provided in a single policy,then each such vehicle must also carry uninsured motorist coverage modifiable only as expressly authorized by the statute.such a construction of the statute is necessary in order to give effect to what we perceive as the clearly expressed legislative intent.
plaintiffs argue,however,that such a legislative analysis and conclusion ignores the language of another part of section.they rely on subdivision c,which provides that uninsured motorist coverage otherwise available under the insured liability policy does not apply to bodily injury of the insured while occupying a motor vehicle owned by an insured or leased to an insured unless the occupied vehicle is an insured motor vehicle italics added.plaintiffs seem to be arguing that by its enactment of subdivision c in,the legislature effectively recognized a per vehicle deletion of uninsured motorist coverage.otherwise,they argue,the statutory language would make no sense.we disagree.
subdivision c also appears to be clear and straightforward.it precludes the insured from claiming the benefits of uninsured motorist coverage if he or she suffers a bodily injury arising from the negligence of an uninsured motorist while the insured is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a person who is an insured under the insured liability policy.for example,the insured son is a resident in the insured household and is therefore an insured under the insured policy but if he happens to own his own motor vehicle,which is not covered by a policy of liability insurance,then the insured own uninsured motorist coverage will not apply if the insured is injured while riding with his son and there is an accident resulting from the negligence of some uninsured motorist in such event,neither the insured father nor his son,although an insured under the insured father policy,could recover the uninsured motorist benefits that otherwise might have been payable under the father policy had the son car been an insured motor vehicle.see interinsurance exchange velji d,subd.c prevents the coverage of one policy from extending to accidents involving other owned but uninsured vehicles,and reflects the theory that each motor vehicle should carry its own liability insurance and uninsured motorist coverage.citation.
in hartford casualty ins.cancilla th,d,the insured was riding his motorcycle when he was struck and killed by an uninsured motorist.the insurance policy for his motorcycle included uninsured motorist coverage for only per insured,but he also had a policy covering a van which provided such coverage in the amount of million.when the insurer refused to tender million to the policyholder surviving spouse,she brought suit.the court held that the wife was limited to receiving the limits for the uninsured motorist coverage on the motorcycle.as the court put it,the wife argument strains credulity when one considers the specific problem subdivision c was meant to resolve,the purpose of the statute and the language of the statute read as a whole.the wife argues that section simply insures people,not vehicles.she is only half right.the section allows only certain people to claim uninsured motorist whose uninsured motorist insurance covers the vehicle they are driving at the time of an accident with an uninsured motorist,at,d italics added see also harrison california state auto.bureau d.
we find no support whatever in the language of section,subdivision c for plaintiffs argument.it reflects,in our view,no intent or purpose of the legislature to recognize a new or an additional means or manner of waiving uninsured motorist coverage.it was enacted for an entirely different purpose.as one court put it,the subdivision was added to rectify a specific by those who do not maintain insurance to use another coverage to make a claim.it was intended to make sure people carry their own insurance for their own claims.hartford casualty ins.cancilla,supra,th at,d.the language of subdivision c adds nothing to the argument before us it has nothing to do with a legislative attempt to amend the waivers provision of subdivision a of section.as our previous discussion demonstrates,when the legislature wanted to amend those provisions so as to prescribe the limited bases for the waiver of uninsured motorist coverage,it knew precisely how to do it and did so explicitly.
while it is true that we should construe liberally the uninsured motorist statutory provisions,a liberal interpretation does not mean enlarging the plain provisions of law.as we have already emphasized,the function of judicial interpretation is to declare what is contained in a statute,not to insert what has been omitted.code civ,california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.here,the legislature specifically provided for waivers by policy and by person,but not by vehicle.we may not now provide what the legislature has not.
insureds purchasing separate policies for each of multiple vehicles may waive uninsured motorist coverage for any or all of said vehicles by waiving such coverage as to one or more of said policies 
from the above discussion,it is clear that a waiver of uninsured motorist coverage must be as to all vehicles covered under a single policy.in other words,the waiver is as to the coverage provided by the policy it may not be accomplished as to some but less than all of the covered vehicles.where,however,an insured purchases a separate policy for each of several vehicles,that same principle would obviously permit the insured to waive uninsured motorist coverage as to one,all or less than all of those vehicles.the defendant insurers do not quarrel with this.as we have pointed out,three of the defendant insurers state farm,farmers and allstate,in fact,sell separate individual policies for each vehicle owned by an insured 
as to such separate policies,the insurance code not only does not preclude waiver on a per car basis but it necessarily authorizes it.to the extent that any of the defendant insurers have wrongfully refused to permit their insureds whose multiple vehicles are covered by separate policies to waive uninsured motorist coverage except upon an all or none basis,as is alleged in plaintiffs complaint,they can not justify their action by reliance on the insurance code 
c.an insurer may not be required to issue separate policies to an insured seeking coverage for multiple vehicles 
as this record reflects,some of the defendant insurers follow the practice of issuing a single policy that covers all of the vehicles an insured desires to insure.others are willing to sell separate policies covering each vehicle owned by an insured.in our view,this is simply a business or marketing decision best left to the judgment of each insurer.see,barnes state farm mut.auto.ins.th,d.similarly,an insured desiring to have a separate policy for each one of his or her multiple vehicles and thus the ability to waive uninsured motorist coverage on some,but less than all of said multiple vehicles can chose to do business with an insurer which follows such practice.
there is nothing in the insurance code which specifies or requires an insurer to adopt either marketing policy.it is simply silent on the issue.in addition,it is clear that the legislature has been long aware that single liability policies are commonly marketed to owners of multiple vehicles this is confirmed by the legislative history of section.under the original form of automobile insurance sold in california,all vehicles in a household were insured on a single policy for a premium which did not depend on the number of vehicles insured.when insurers begin basing the premium charged on the number of vehicles that coverage was only provided on vehicles for which a premium had been legislature did not mandate that each vehicle be insured under a separate policy.in,when the legislature first required that insurers offer uninsured motorist coverage,by enacting section,it did not include any provision requiring that all vehicles be insured on separate policies in that section.nor has it since ever elected to do so.we will not now impose such a burden by judicial fiat.
insurer is not liable under uca for engaging in conduct mandated or authorized by insurance code.
the ucl bus,provides that any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice is deemed to be unfair competition.state farm fire casualty superior court allegro th,d state farm.injunctive relief restitution are the remedies authorized.bus.an unlawful business activity includes anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citation.barquis merchants collection cal d,italics added.virtually any law federal,state or local can serve as a predicate for an action under business and professions code,section.state farm,supra,th at,d.thus,it is fairly said that section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices independently actionable under the unfair competition law.id.at,d.clearly,and as we have exhaustively demonstrated,the defendant insurers selling multiple vehicle policies have not,by their actions,violated the provisions of section.indeed,as we have said,their refusal to recognize the piecemeal by vehicle waivers of uninsured motorist coverage in multiple vehicle policies is mandated by that statute.thus,allegations that they have engaged in such conduct does not reflect an unlawful business activity and is therefore not actionable on that ground under business and professions code,section.
on the other hand,some defendant insurers selling separate policies for each vehicle are alleged to have adopted the same business practice and to have refused to recognize any waiver that did not apply to all of an insured vehicles.these defendants can not rely on the same argument such a business practice is not required by section nor is it proscribed.thus,such a practice could not be said to constitute an unlawful business activity unless,of course,it were to constitute a violation of the cartwright act,discussed below.but it may well constitute an unfair business practice,which is also condemned by the uca.
it is not necessary for a business practice to be unlawful in order to be subject to an action under the unfair competition law.the unfair standard,the second prong of business and professions code section,also provides an independent basis for relief.this standard is intentionally broad,thus allowing courts maximum discretion to prohibit new schemes to defraud.citation.the test of whether a business practice is unfair involves an examination of that practice impact on its alleged victim,balanced against the reasons,justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer.in brief,the court must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim citations.citation.in people casa blanca convalescent homes.d,the court,acknowledging that the parameters of the term unfair business practice had not been defined in a california case,applied guidelines adopted by the federal trade commission and sanctioned by the united states supreme court in ftc sperry hutchinson,d,the court concluded that an unfair business practice occurs when that practice offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.citation.state farm,supra,th at,d.
examples of unfair business practices include charging a higher than normal rate for copies of deposition transcripts by a group of certified shorthand reporters,where the party receiving the original is being given an undisclosed discount as the result of an exclusive contract with two insurance companies citation placing unlawful or unenforceable terms in form contracts citation asserting a contractual right one does not have citations systematically breaching a form contract affecting many consumers citation,or many producers citation and imposing contract terms that make the debtor pay the collection costs citation.state farm,supra,th at,d.
without a doubt the concept of proscribing such a range of conduct by the term unfair business activity is very broad in its scope however,it is not unlimited.courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when for example specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor a plaintiff may thus not plead around an absolute bar to relief simply by recasting the cause of action as one for unfair competition.citation.the rule does not,however,prohibit an action under the unfair competition law merely because some other statute on the subject does not,itself,provide for the action or prohibit the challenged conduct.to forestall an action under the unfair competition law,another provision must actually bar the action or clearly permit the conduct.there is a difference between not making an activity unlawful,and making that activity lawful.for example,penal code section,which defines robbery,does not make murder unlawful.most assuredly,however,that section does not also make murder lawful.acts that the legislature has determined to be lawful may not form the basis for an action under the unfair competition law,but acts may,if otherwise unfair,be challenged under the unfair competition law even if the legislature failed to proscribe them in some other provision communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,italics added.
thus,to the extent that those defendant insurers that had issued single multiple vehicle policies refused to recognize any waiver of uninsured motorist coverage that did not apply to all of the insured vehicles,no cause of action can be stated under the ucl.given our construction and interpretation of section,there was neither anything unlawful or unfair about such a business practice.indeed,the insurers had no alternative under the law.
the same conclusion does not apply,however,to those insurers that issued separate policies for each of an insured multiple vehicles,but nonetheless refused to permit any waiver that did not include all of the insured vehicles.such conduct is at least generally alleged by plaintiffs and,it is also alleged,was done for the purpose of requiring insureds to purchase more uninsured motorist coverage than was needed,all to the alleged increased premium benefit of the defendant insurers and to the injury and damage of insureds who were faced with the choice of paying wasteful increased premiums or going without any uninsured motorist coverage we have no trouble concluding,given our review of the authorities discussed above,that such conduct,if proven,would constitute an unfair business practice actionable under the uca.bus.
plaintiffs have failed to allege adequately a conspiracy to violate the cartwright act 
business and professions code,section,a part of the cartwright act,includes the following among the acts it defines as a prohibited trust a cts by two or more persons a to create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.insurance is commerce within the meaning of this section.citation.while refusing to sell a product to a consumer does not itself violate the cartwright act,when that refusal is the result of a combination,agreement,or conspiracy to make that product unavailable in a given market a prohibited restraint of trade may be found.citation.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,quelimane.
an agreement among merchants is prohibited by business and professions code section only if restraint of trade in the commodity is the purpose of the agreement.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.a cause of action for restraint of trade under the cartwright act or common law principles must allege both a purpose to restrain trade and injury to the business of the plaintiff traceable to actions in furtherance of that purpose.citations.jones ahmanson cal d.

while the unilateral action of one or more insurers with respect to the terms upon which they will sell automobile policies would not offend the antitrust laws although it might still be actionable as a violation of the uca,when it is alleged that two or more insurers have entered into an agreement to act in concert to impose a business policy that is not mandated by the insurance code and has the purpose and effect of depriving insureds of the ability to purchase individual policies for each one of multiple vehicles owned,the ability to thus avoid premiums for unwanted uninsured motorist coverage for some but less than all of their vehicles,then a violation of the cartwright act would have been alleged.such alleged concerted action,which has the effect of limiting the market place options of insureds,increasing their premium costs or,alternatively,forcing them to forgo all uninsured motorist coverage a result which is itself contrary to california public policy,would sufficiently allege an unlawful combination which has as its purpose the restraint of trade.we do not believe,however,that plaintiffs third amended complaint sufficiently pleads facts which meet these requirements.
the only allegation that we can find in plaintiffs complaint that even purports to provide the required certain facts needed to enable the defendant insurers to understand the nature of their alleged wrongful act is found in paragraph the insurer defendants,and each of them,engaged together in a common scheme and civil conspiracy to unlawfully coerce certain consumers of automobile liability insurance,who owned more than one vehicle to be so insured to purchase more uninsured motorist coverage than what the purchaser desired,by refusing to sell said purchaser any uninsured motorist coverage at all unless said coverage applied to all of said purchaser insured vehicles.
this is a very conclusionary allegation and provides no factual information to the defendant insurers.as we have pointed out,most of the defendant insurers were compelled by law,section,subd.a to do the very act about which plaintiffs complain.thus,their conduct could not be described as unlawful.whether or not they acted in concert with other insurers,they could not lawfully do otherwise.as to these insurers,the most plaintiffs have alleged is parallel action in accordance with a clear statutory mandate.therefore,their conduct could not,as a matter of law,constitute a violation of the cartwright act.given the conclusions we have reached as to the lawfulness of their actions,the general allegations of the complaint simply state no claim against these insurers.see generally,cellular plus,superior court,supra,th at,d.in the absence of more particular allegations,we decline to engage in any speculation as to just what wrongful acts or unlawful purposes may have occurred or been present so as to justify the conclusion that a cartwright act violation was committed.as plaintiffs have not been able to state a viable claim for violation of the cartwright act as to all but three of the defendant insurers,the trial court properly sustained their demurrer without leave to amend.
as to those defendant insurers that issued separate policies covering each one of an insured multiple vehicles,they stand in a different position as they can not rely on the same statutory mandate.nonetheless,we are similarly concerned with the generality of plaintiffs allegations.we have a concern that plaintiffs can not truthfully allege that these insurers ever refused a separate request or demand to waive uninsured motorist coverage as to a particular policy.for example,there are no allegations that any of the plaintiffs ever demanded that a particular insurer do so.all we have are allegations of what amounts to parallel conduct accompanied by the general and conclusionary allegation that it was done pursuant to a common scheme and civil conspiracy.but there are no allegations that plaintiffs requested that their policies be modified as permitted by the statute or that the insurers in spite of such requests refused to allow the plaintiffs to effect a waiver as to some,but less than all,of their separate vehicle policies.in addition,the insurers unlawful economic motive or purpose is not apparent from the plaintiffs general allegations.the insurer is obviously exposed to greater risk as to each vehicle insured.thus,a premium charged for uninsured motorist coverage for a particular vehicle provides a separate additional benefit to the insured and a separate additional risk for the insurer.coverage for insured vehicle a will not protect the insured if he or she is driving uninsured vehicle b when he or she is injured by an uninsured motorist.under what circumstances would an insured,owning multiple vehicles,but insuring each with a separate policy,be paying for unneeded uninsured motorist coverage if relevant facts demonstrating the existence of such unneeded or wrongful coverage can be truthfully alleged,then plaintiffs should be given the opportunity to do so.given the otherwise apparently lawful nature of the insurers actions,however,more specific allegations are required.
these are all matters that need to be clearly alleged so that those defendant insurers selling individual policies will know precisely what unlawful acts they are charged with having committed and just what facts and circumstances exist that justify application of the cartwright act.as to those defendant insurers selling separate policies,the demurrer may have been properly sustained,but it should have been sustained with leave to amend.we acknowledge that plaintiffs already have had four opportunities to plead their claim,but the trial court sustained the demurrer of the insurer defendants on a basis that actually applies only to some of them it apparently did not consider the different legal position of those insurer defendants issuing separate policies.now that we have clarified and isolated this issue,we believe it is appropriate that plaintiffs be given one more opportunity to see if they can plead a cartwright that violation as to those particular insurer defendants whose specific business practice of issuing separate policies for each of an insured multiple vehicles was not reflected in the trial court order.
the need to exhaust administrative remedies before the insurance commissioner 
the final argument asserted by some of the defendant insurers see fn,ante is that the alleged business practice of the defendant insurers with respect to the all or nothing waiver of uninsured motorist coverage constituted an underwriting rule and thus came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner.see.this means that plaintiffs had an administrative remedy that they were required to exhaust and that they failed to do so.that trial court did not reach the issue,however,as it sustained the defendant insurers demurrer on the other ground that we have already discussed.plaintiffs did not address this argument in their briefs.therefore,we will not reach the issue either as we believe it should be addressed by the trial court in the first instance.for the assistance of the trial court,however,we will discuss some of the relevant principles 
critical to the argument of the defendant insurers is the proposition that the refusal to provide insurance except on an all or nothing at all basis is an underwriting rule.underwriting is a label commonly applied to the process,fundamental to the concept of insurance,of deciding which risks to insure and which to reject in order to spread losses over risks in an economically feasible way.group life health ins.royal drug,d wilson fair employment housing com.th,d bamattre manoukian,dissenting also couch,insurance ed.given such understanding and the provisions of section,subdivision a see fn,ante,it seems to us that an underwriting rule is properly characterized as a rule followed or adopted by an insurer or a rating organization which either limits the conditions under which a policy will be issued or impacts the rates that will be charged for that policy.
the defendant insurers cite us to three cases that seem to demonstrate the accuracy of that definition.the three cases cited all involved circumstances in which the rule either entirely excluded coverage for a particular category of risk wilkinson norcal mutual ins.d.neurosurgery and orthopedic surgery excluded from coverage wilson fair employment housing comm.th,d flights piloted by pilots over the age of excluded from coverage,or treated all automobile losses as chargeable to the principal place of garaging the insured vehicle,rather than the location of the accident,thus impacting the rates to be charged.county of los angeles farmers ins.exchange d.such actions clearly impacted rates or conditioned coverage.in each case,the insurer had decided that either excluding categories of risks,or applying rules as to the location of,was the method best suited to spreading its risks.
given the relief sought by the plaintiffs,the trial court should also consider the possible application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine.see farmers insurance exchange superior court cal th,d,state farm,supra,th at,d croskey,kaufman,et,cal.prac.guide insurance litigation the rutter group at to.
conclusion 
the trial court correctly sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of the defendant insurers selling policies covering multiple vehicles.no cause of action was or can be stated against them by the plaintiffs and a judgment of dismissal was properly entered.however,as to the defendant insurers selling separate policies covering each of multiple vehicles,the demurrer should have been sustained with leave to amend.but,before permitting such amendment or conducting any further proceedings in this matter,the trial court should consider and decide the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies raised by the defendant insurers,as well as the possible application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine,giving all parties a full opportunity to brief and argue those issues

given that this matter comes before us on demurrer,the facts we recite are those alleged in the plaintiffs third amended complaint,which is the operative pleading before us.
specifically,the plaintiffs set forth in paragraph of their current pleading the creation and existence of the alleged conspiracy in the following terms t he insurer defendants,and each of them,engaged together in a common scheme and civil conspiracy to unlawfully coerce certain consumers of automobile liability insurance,who owned more than one vehicle to be so insured,to purchase more uninsured motorist coverage than what the purchaser desired,by refusing to sell said purchaser any uninsured motorist coverage at all unless said coverage applied to all of said purchaser insured vehicles.
in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that they were representatives of the class of insureds adversely impacted by this common and business practice of the defendant insurers.to support their claim to the status of representative plaintiffs,the complaint alleges the following the plaintiff smith,although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only one of her vehicles,was required by state farm,as a condition to the purchase of uninsured motorist coverage on the first vehicle,to pay for uninsured motorist coverage on her other two vehicles the plaintiff armendariz,although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only one of his vehicles,was required by colonial penn,as a condition for purchasing uninsured motorist coverage on the first vehicle,to pay for uninsured motorist coverage on his other vehicle as well the plaintiff grace,although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only three of her six vehicles,was required by the auto club,as a condition for purchasing uninsured motorist coverage for those three vehicles,to purchase uninsured motorist coverage on the other three the plaintiff seiling,although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only one of her vehicles,was required by defendant farmers,as a condition for purchasing uninsured motorist coverage on the first vehicle,also to pay for uninsured motorist coverage on the second vehicle,and the plaintiff mossanen,although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only two of her three vehicles,was required by defendant mercury,as a condition for purchasing uninsured motorist coverage on those two vehicles,to pay for uninsured motorist coverage on the third as well.
unless otherwise indicated,all statutory references are to the insurance code.
subdivision m of section provides that the insurer must offer uninsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the bodily injury liability coverage in the underlying policy.
the agreement to delete uninsured motorist coverage for damage caused by an uninsured motor vehicle completely,or to delete uninsured motorist coverage when a motor vehicle is operated by a natural person or persons designated by name,must be in the following form the california insurance code requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorists coverage in each bodily injury liability insurance policy it issues covering liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of a motor vehicle.those provisions also permit the insurer and the applicant to delete the coverage completely or to delete the coverage when a motor vehicle is operated by a natural person or persons designated by name.uninsured motorists coverage insures the insured,his or her heirs,or legal representatives for all sums within the limits established by law,which the person or persons are legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury,including any resulting sickness,disease,or death,to the insured from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle not owned or operated by the insured or a resident of the same household.an uninsured motor vehicle includes an underinsured motor vehicle as defined in subdivision p of section of the insurance code,subd.a,italics added.the agreement to provide uninsured motorist coverage in an amount less than that required by subdivision m of section must be in the following form the california insurance code requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorists coverage in each bodily injury liability insurance policy it issues covering liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of a motor vehicle.those provisions also permit the insurer and the applicant to agree to provide the coverage in an amount less than that required by subdivision m of section of the insurance code but not less than the financial responsibility requirements.uninsured motorists coverage insures the insured,his or her heirs,or legal representatives for all sums within the limits established by law,which the person or persons are legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury,including any resulting sickness,disease,or death,to the insured from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle not owned or operated by the insured or a resident of the same household.an uninsured motor vehicle includes an underinsured motor vehicle as defined in subdivision p of section of the insurance code,subd.a,italics added.
in its order,the trial court stated the court has determined that insurance code section does not authorize deletion of otherwise mandatory uninsured motorist coverage except in the manner set forth therein and deletion of uninsured motorist coverage by car is not authorized by the statute.plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege an unlawful conspiracy between and among the defendants either under the cartwright act or otherwise.plaintiffs have been given three successive opportunities to amend and it now appears that they are unable to allege sufficiently the elements of a valid cause of action,hence the demurrers are sustained without leave to further amend.
there was an effort to provide evidence of such fact by a request to the trial court to take judicial notice of the contents of the actual policies issued to some of the representative plaintiffs.however,plaintiffs objected and such request was denied.the written requests for such judicial notice are in the appellate record and defendants argue that the trial court should have considered them.we believe,however,that the trial court was correct in limiting its ruling on the demurrer to the allegations of plaintiffs third amended complaint.the contents of actual policies issued to the representative plaintiffs may certainly be considered in connection with any motions for summary adjudication or judgment that may be brought following remand.
this argument is joined in by defendant insurers auto club,farmers,safeco and usaa.
section as passed in was repealed and in with certain modifications not pertinent here.
for sake of clarity,it should be noted that an uninsured motor vehicle for purposes of determining uninsured motorist coverage does not include any motor vehicle owned or operated by the named insured or any resident of the same household,subd.b.thus,the negligent uninsured motorist in the above described example necessarily refers to some third party motorist whose negligence resulted in an accident involving the son vehicle.
the court in cancilla also observed that section,subdivision b,was amended in to include the language that appears to limit the definition to subdivision b as used in this subdivision,insured motor vehicle means,subd.b,italics added.however,case law prior to expressly held that subdivision b applied to subdivision c.hartford casualty ins.cancilla,supra,th at,d.the court then held that subdivision b is a compendium of definitions of terms used in the statute and no substantive change was intended by the amendment.ibid.the legislative counsel digest noted that,this bill would restate existing provisions of law and would not make any substantive change in the law,italics omitted.the amendment,in other words,amounted to nothing more than routine code maintenance and therefore could not be held to alter the prior law.ibid.thus,the language of the statute makes clear that uninsured motorist coverage applies only to the vehicle s listed in the policy.
these insurers argue in their briefs that the individual policies actually sold to certain of the representative plaintiffs were subject to the waiver allowed under section,subd.a l and,where requested,such waivers were accomplished.however,the formal evidence supporting such claims is not before us.it is included in requests for judicial notice that were not considered by the trial court in light of the fact that the attack on plaintiffs complaint was by demurrer.
it is true that section,subdivision a,requires that any waiver of uninsured motorist coverage be accomplished by an agreement in writing.the defendant insurers,however,make no contention that they have any bargaining rights in the matter or that a liability insurer is entitled to withhold its agreement to an insured request for such a waiver.
for example,in,in section,subdivision a relating to cancellation of or failure to renew,an automobile insurance policy,the legislature defined a policy as an automobile liability,automobile physical damage,or automobile collision policy,or any combination thereof,delivered or issued for delivery in this state,insuring a single individual or individuals residing in the same hou
