we are asked to determine whether an arbitration panel violated the federal arbitration act faa.the process employed by the arbitration panel,which included an ex parte meeting with workers compensation experts,was unusual however,after deferentially reviewing the panel award,we determine that the arbitration process provided the parties with a fundamentally fair arbitration and that the arbitration award rested on a plausible interpretation of the governing arbitration documents.accordingly,we affirm the arbitration award in favor of superior national insurance companies in liquidation snicil.
background 
life contractually agreed to reinsure the workers compensation risks insured by five california insurers between may,and january.this reinsurance contract contained an arbitration provision.these california insurers later declared bankruptcy and will be referred to as snicil.the california insurance commissioner became snicil statutory liquidator.
ten years ago,on november,life requested arbitration,seeking rescission or reformation of the reinsurance contract because snicil misrepresented the reserves during the underwriting process and damages for snicil performance.snicil agreed to arbitrate,seeking a declaration that the reinsurance contract was valid,a ruling that u.life was to perform its contractual obligations,and damages.the panel,which consisted of an arbitrator appointed by each party and a neutral arbitrator selected by the parties arbitrators,bifurcated the arbitration proceeding into two phases 
phase i addressed rescission and reformation claims.after holding extensive hearings,the panel entered a final interim award that found no basis for rescission.the panel,however,reformed the reinsurance contract so that life became liable for only of the risks insured by snicil underlying policies because of snicil failure to be forthright during the contract formation period.the panel awarded snicil interest on this amount at a rate equal to the average of the and year treasury notes as posted in the wall street journal.
life sought vacatur of the final interim award.the district court denied life petition this court affirmed the district court decision.life ins.ins.comm r,fed.app x cir.
phase ii proceeded to determine whether snicil engaged in improper claims handling that resulted in bills to life in excess of the amounts due under the reinsurance agreement.a phase ii organizational meeting was held on april.rather than review each of the june,claims,life expert selected of the contested claims files for an audit.snicil expert used this same sample to conduct its audit.
prior to phase ii evidentiary hearings,snicil party arbitrator advised the parties that he had terminal cancer,but that he wished to continue as an arbitrator.the parties elected to continue with the arbitration proceeding with snicil appointing an alternate arbitrator to observe and potentially replace snicil party arbitrator.the parties agreed that phase ii would be governed by protocols governing the presentation of evidence the protocols.the panel approved the protocols.
in march,the panel listened to the parties phase ii evidence and arguments for approximately thirteen days after the hearings,the panel advised the parties that it was unable to reach a decision regarding the quality of snicil claims handling and,more pointedly,life reinsurance contract obligations given the parties divergent expert opinions.to rectify this stalemate,the panel advised that it would retain two workers compensation experts the reviewers to review the submitted bills.
the panel and the parties exchanged correspondence discussing what review process to use.ultimately,the determined that the following review process would be used the reviewers would review of the sample of the june,claims the reviewers would meet with the panel for three days hereinafter,the ex parte meeting and no transcript would be prepared of the ex parte meeting the reviewers would provide their conclusions in writing to the panel and the parties the parties could submit briefs responding to the reviewers conclusions a hearing would be held during which the parties could question the reviewers,under oath,for five hours each as to their qualifications and the reasons for their conclusions,but not as to the ex parte meeting and the parties could submit briefs to the panel.this procedure was used.
on december,the panel issued its phase ii interim award,finding that all amounts billed prior to june,were properly due the panel determined,in addition to the phase i final interim award interest requirement,that life was to disgorge its actual investment earnings on all monies due under the reinsurance agreement as of june.the panel also required u.life to pay,bills within thirty days of billing.
on february,the panel issued its phase ii interim final award,which clarified that the panel december,ruling 
did not change the interest awarded in its final interim award of december,as amended and clarified.any and all monetary awards for snicil of the excess investment earnings as set forth in this phase ii interim final award and in the phase ii interim award shall be deemed to be interest or other monetary remedy for life disgorgement of unjust enrichment.
on february,the panel issued its final arbitration award,requiring life to pay all bills submitted before december,along with phase i interest and phase ii disgorgement.furthermore,life was required to pay all,bills within thirty days of receipt.
life filed an action in district court to vacate this award.snicil answered and also filed a separate action to confirm the award.after consolidating the two actions,the district court upheld the arbitration award.life now seeks review.
standard of review 
when reviewing the district court confirmation of an arbitration award,the appellate court must accept the district court findings of fact unless clearly erroneous but decide questions of law de novo.first options of,kaplan,d schoenduve lucent,cir employers ins.of wausau union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.the issues before us involve questions of law.
during this de novo review,we were cognizant that arbitration is an encouraged method of dispute resolution and that our review of the arbitration panel decision is greatly limited.see united paperworkers int l union misco,d schoenduve,at.
federal arbitration act

section of the faa sets forth grounds to vacate an arbitration award.in march,the supreme court resolved a circuit conflict and ruled that lists the exclusive grounds for vacating an arbitration award.hall.at.section a provides 
in any of the following cases the united states court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a.section a limited grounds are designed to preserve due process but not to permit unnecessary public intrusion into private arbitration procedures.kyocera,at.the burden of establishing grounds for vacating an arbitration award is on the party seeking it.see employers ins.of wausau,at.
a misconduct 
life contends that,by closing the meeting of the panel with the reviewers,the panel refused to hear pertinent and material evidence regarding the appropriateness of snicil claims handling although an ex parte meeting between an arbitrator and a neutral expert is not a routine arbitration practice the panel had authority to adopt its own rules of procedure and it did our review of the record leads us to conclude that the panel did not refus e to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.a.before explaining the basis for this conclusion,we note that the parties disagree as to whether a requires life to show prejudice as a result of the panel alleged refusal to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.
our prior faa cases have not directly interpreted the text of a.in employers insurance of wausau,at,an faa case,though we did not explicitly reference a,we addressed the argument that a panel refusal to admit certain evidence was misconduct necessitating vacatur.there we said 
national has neither argued nor demonstrated that this evidentiary ruling influenced the outcome of the arbitration.yet a showing of prejudice is a prerequisite to relief based on an arbitration panel evidentiary rulings.see,burchell marsh,how.to warrant reversal because of an arbitrator mistake in the conduct of the hearing,party must show that if it had not happened,the arbitrator should have made a different award mut.fire,marine inland ins.norad resins,cir hoteles condado beach,la concha convention ctr.union de tronquistas local,cir accord misco,at.at vacatur appropriate only if refusal to hear evidence amounted to affirmative misconduct.consequently,even were the excluded evidence relevant,national still is not entitled to vacatur because of its lack of evidence of prejudicial impact.
section a provides 
an arbitration award may be vacated 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct a in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or b in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.
while an argument can be made that this text is ambiguous given its language and punctuation,we need not resolve this textual ambiguity,if any,for two reasons.first,we conclude that the phrase refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy necessarily implies prejudice to the rights of a party,without regard to the final phrase second,we hold that life failed to establish that the panel refusal to let the parties participate in or question the neutral experts about the ex parte meeting discussion constitutes a refusal to hear pertinent and material evidence.it was only after the panel listened to,and considered,the parties experts opinions and other evidence that the panel determined it needed additional information to resolve the phase ii dispute life obligations under the reinsurance contract.the panel advised the parties of its dilemma and determined what process to use only after receiving input from counsel through extensive and detailed correspondence.the process employed ensured due process by allowing the parties to present their respective arguments regarding the reviewers conclusions by reviewing the written conclusions,submitting briefing addressing these conclusions,questioning the reviewers about their qualifications and conclusions,and submitting briefing although the parties were not privy to what occurred during the ex parte meeting,the panel gave the parties ample opportunity to discover and critique the reviewers conclusions.
contrary to life assertion,this process allowed the parties to present material evidence because the parties were allowed to address why the reviewers conclusions were incorrect.accordingly,the panel gave each of the parties to the dispute an adequate opportunity to present its evidence and arguments.sunshine moving united steelworkers of,cir.arbitrators enjoy wide discretion to require the exchange of evidence,and to admit or exclude evidence,how and when they see fit.indus.risk insurers gutehoffnungshutte gmbh,cir.the panel appropriately exercised this wide discretion there was no panel misconduct.
this case is not similar to the arbitral misconduct in gulf coast industrial workers union exxon,usa,cir,where the arbitrator misled a party into believing that evidence was admitted,but then ruled against the party because it failed to present evidence on the very point to which the excluded evidence was central.nor is this case similar to the arbitral misconduct in teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers,local union clapp,where the party was not given an opportunity to complete its presentation of proof prior to the arbitration decision.here,the panel allowed each party the opportunity to complete its presentation by submitting a brief and participating in the hearing.
we acknowledge that the panel clearly discussed pertinent phase ii issues with the reviewers.therefore,this case is unlike lefkovitz wagner,where the seventh circuit determined it was unclear whether the arbitrator and an accounting firm discussed ex parte a pertinent overpayment issue,cir.yet,the impact of the panel ex parte meeting with the reviewers was mitigated by the notice,extensive correspondence,and more inclusive procedures.the extensive correspondence reflects that the panel intent was to accord due it did.the panel did not engage in misconduct.
we recognize that e x parte evidence to an arbitration panel that disadvantages any of the parties in their rights to submit and rebut evidence violates the parties rights and is grounds for vacation of an arbitration award.pac.reins.mgmt.ohio reins,cir.however,as set forth above,life failed to establish that the panel refused to hear material evidence.accordingly,life request to vacate under a second prong is denied.
a prejudicial misbehavior 
life alternatively argues it was unable to respond to evidence presented against it by the reviewers and therefore the panel ex parte meeting and limitation constituted a misbehavior prejudicing life.
as noted above,an arbitration award may be vacated where the arbitrators were guilty of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.a.life relies on the fifth circuit ruling that a rbitrators can not conduct ex parte hearings or receive evidence except in the presence of each other and of the parties,unless otherwise stipulated.totem marine tug barge,am.towing,cir quoting in re katz,misc d,spec.term.the fifth circuit prohibition is too broad,especially in light of the supreme court stance in hall street associates,because the faa does not expressly prohibit ex parte contact.ex parte conduct by an arbitration panel requires vacatur of an award only if the ex parte contact constitutes misbehavior that prejudices the rights of a party.see glass,molders,pottery,plastics allied workers int l union,clc,local excelsior foundry,cir an ex parte conduct is not an automatic ground for invalidating an arbitration award.
life relies upon totem marine.at.totem marine is distinguishable.there,the arbitrators contacted a party to obtain a critical damages figure and then did not allow the other party to respond to this damages figure.here,the ex parte contact was not with a party,but with neutral experts.further,both parties were aware of the ex parte contact,submitted suggestions as to the process to be used,and had the opportunity to contest the reviewers conclusions.
unlike arbitration by one person,the parties each chose an arbitrator those two then chose the umpire.therefore,the panel presented far less risk of prejudicial misbehavior than if one arbitrator was used,particularly given the extensive evidence of its efforts to provide due process to both parties to this protracted and e
