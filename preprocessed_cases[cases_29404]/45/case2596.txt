the consumer legal remedies act,et.clra,enacted in,is a statute intended to protect consumers from deceptive or unfair business practices.it prohibits specific deceptive or unfair acts in the sale or lease of goods and services.in these proceedings,we consider whether insurance is a good or service within the meaning of the clra.this case presents a difficult issue of first impression plausible arguments can be made on both sides of the issue.we ultimately conclude,however,that the more persuasive and better reasoned argument requires that we hold that insurance is neither a good nor service within the meaning of the clra.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review this motion de novo.although a clra cause of action can not be summarily disposed of by means of a motion for summary adjudication or summary judgment citation,it can be dismissed before trial on a motion for determination that it is without merit,a determination citation.in practice,courts nevertheless have applied the standards applicable to motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication in deciding motions for determinations.smith wells fargo bank,th,d.thus,on appeal,we review the record de novo to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at,d.
relevant statutes 
the clra is a statute that regulates any transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer,subd.a.it prohibits proscribed practices,a few of which could conceivably apply to insurance.for instance,r epresenting that goods or services have sponsorship,approval,characteristics,ingredients,uses,benefits,or quantities which they do not have is prohibited under this act,subd.a.additionally,r epresenting that goods or services are of a particular standard,quality,or grade,or that goods are of a particular style or model,if they are of another is prohibited,subd.a.representing that the subject of a transaction has been supplied in accordance with a previous representation when it has not,subd.a,and i nserting an unconscionable provision in the contract,subd.a,are additional acts proscribed by the clra that could arguably relate to insurance.the clra allows for restitutionary and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages and for attorney fees,subds.a a.
portions of the insurance code also regulate unfair and deceptive practices in the business of insurance.the unfair insurance practices act uipa prohibits the making,issuance or circulation of any estimate,illustration,circular or statement misrepresenting the terms of any policy issued or to be issued or the benefits or advantages promised thereby or the dividends or share of the surplus to be received,subd.a.in addition,the uipa proscribes the knowing misrepresentation of pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to any coverages at issue,subd.h,and any attempts to settle a claim by an insured for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed he or she was entitled by reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or made part of an application,subd.h.the uipa allows for the insurance commissioner to enjoin unfair or deceptive acts or practices,and to impose a civil penalty for each act or practice.we here consider whether the provisions of the clra override the provisions of the uipa,and provide for a private right of action where the uipa provides only for administrative enforcement.
the plain language of the clra does not include insurance as a good or service 
the plain language of the clra indicates that insurance is not a good.goods are defined as tangible chattels bought or leased for personal,family or household use,subd.a.insurance is not a tangible item.thus it can not be a good.it follows that the pertinent issue here is whether insurance can be considered a service under the clra.
the clra defines services as work,labor,and services for other than a commercial or business use,including services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods,subd.b.insurance,in contrast,is defined by the insurance code as a contract,whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss,damage,or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.obviously,insurance contracts are not work or labor.nor can these indemnification agreements easily be described as personal services or services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods.an insurance contract is not something akin to a haircut,a plumbing repair,or a warranty on a microwave is simply an agreement to pay if and when an identifiable event occurs.in an analogous context,one court has held that issuance of a credit card is not a service under the clra.berry american express publishing,th,d.the berry court reasoned that the extension of credit is not a service,especially when it is an extension of credit unconnected to a specific sale or lease transaction.a similar analysis applies to insurance,which is an essentially financial transaction,completely unrelated to the sale or lease of any identifiable consumer good or service.thus,insurance does not appear to be a service under within the plain meaning of the language of the clra 
case law strongly suggests that insurance is not a service 
in civil service employees ins.superior court cal d,the california supreme court considered a class action against an insurer.the court held that a trial court has the authority to order a defendant to bear the costs of notifying absent class members in a class action suit the court concluded that the clra class action procedures should be utilized in all class actions.however,in dicta,the court commented that insurance is neither a good nor a service under the clra.the court stated that although civil code section,subdivision d does not directly apply to the present case because insurance is technically neither a good nor a service within the meaning of the clra,we expressly held that the class action procedures prescribed by the consumer legal remedies act could and should appropriately be
