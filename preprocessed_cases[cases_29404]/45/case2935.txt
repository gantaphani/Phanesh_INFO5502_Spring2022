discussion 
i.the amendment to penal code section,subdivision a imposed the additional requirement bail be declared forfeit in open court.
national argues the trial court failed to make an pronouncement of bail forfeiture as required by statute and thus the forfeiture should be vacated and the bond exonerated.the people counter the bond should not be exonerated because the court substantially complied with the statutory requirements by clarifying its intended ruling in its minute order for the day.
in interpreting a statutory scheme our function is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.to ascertain such intent,courts turn first to the words of the statute itself,and seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning.when interpreting statutory language,we may neither insert language which has been omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted.the language must be construed in the context of the statutory framework as a whole,keeping in mind the policies and purposes of the statute,and where possible the language should be read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.
prior to its amendment in,penal code section,subdivision a required a declaration of bail forfeiture but did not specify any particular method for doing so.the statute then read a court shall declare forfeited the undertaking of bail or the money or property deposited as bail if,without sufficient excuse,a defendant fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance.thus,under section,subdivision a as it formerly read a bail forfeiture was nevertheless valid when declared solely on the minute order prepared for the day 
in the legislature amended this section to clarify the procedure for declaring a forfeiture by expressly requiring a court to declare a bail forfeiture in open court.section,subdivision a now provides a court shall in open court declare forfeited the undertaking of bail or the money or property deposited as bail if,without sufficient excuse,a defendant fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance.
the plain language of the amended statute indicates in order for bail to be forfeited a trial court must make a declaration of forfeiture stating bail is forfeited on the record while court is in session.the legislature use of the word shall signifies this dual requirement is mandatory 
legislative history of the amendment makes clear any other conclusion would frustrate the legislature purpose in imposing the open court requirement of providing sureties and their agents prompt notice of a defendant nonappearance so they can take immediate steps to apprehend the fugitive.
according to a report prepared for the senate committee on public safety the amendment was necessary to make the return of fleeing defendants swifter and easier.the longer a defendant remains at large,the greater the odds that he or she may commit other crimes,thereby putting the public at risk.the legislature determined open and public declarations of bail forfeitures addressed this problem.rather than waiting days or weeks to receive written notice of bail forfeiture,the legislature concluded notice of a bail forfeiture simultaneous with an unexcused absence of a defendant would permit sureties and their agents to immediately pursue the fugitive,which in turn would increase public safety.
a summary of the bill prepared for the assembly committee on public safety explained if a defendant fails to appear at a scheduled court appearance,existing law requires that the court order the bail forfeited and the bail agent or surety notified within days.this bill requires that the declaration of forfeiture be made in open court at the time the defendant fails to appear and a bench warrant is issued.this is a minor technical change to existing law and only requires the court to openly order forfeiture of the rationale being that the bail agent receives notice of the forfeiture at the time,rather than when the notice is sent and is able to immediately pursue the fugitive.despite judicial council objection,this requirement places an insignificant burden on the court as it only requires the court to state bail is forfeited.it is a better practice to openly declare the forfeiture most courts already follow this procedure and do the same thing in respect to an exoneration of bail when a defendant is returned to court after the issuance of a bench warrant.
the value of providing prompt notice to sureties and their agents was long ago recognized by our state highest court.there are sound reasons,implicit in the pertinent statutory provisions for holding that a forfeiture of a bail bond,where required,must be timely declared if a surety is to be afforded the protections provided by these provisions he must be advised at an early date of the fact of the forfeiture in order that he many institute procedures to locate and compel the appearance of the bailee.should the surety not have an early opportunity to institute these endeavors the possibility of discharging the forfeiture will be severely prejudiced,and it is manifest that he will suffer such prejudice whether there is an undue delay in advising him after the declaration of a forfeiture or a delay in making the declaration itself.
the amendment is an extension of this policy.it ensures timely notice by expressly requiring courts to make an unequivocal declaration of bail forfeiture on the record the very moment the court concludes the defendant has failed to appear without sufficient excuse.this is turn furthers the amendment purpose of providing timely notice and quickly apprehending fugitives.
the trial court in the present case failed to comply with the statutory requirements.it did not declare the bail forfeited in open court.at a recess the court clerk inquired whether bail was revoked as well as forfeited.in its discussion with the clerk the court agreed bail should be forfeited.the court did not recall the case to declare the bail forfeited in open court as it could have done.instead,during a recess in the proceedings it directed the clerk to enter a forfeiture on the minutes.the trial court candidly acknowledged at the hearing on national request to vacate the bail forfeiture,the transcript reflects that there was no forfeiture of the bail.
the people argue the court statement bail is revoked could logically in this instance include forfeiture.they point out the only instance in which a court may declare a forfeiture is when a defendant fails to appear,and the only fact before the court was the fact of the defendant nonappearance.the people contrast this situation with those in which the defendant commits a new crime while out on bail,thus warranting revocation of bail,as distinguished from forfeiture due to an unexcused nonappearance.they distinguish the present case from the situation in people stuyvesant insurance where it was clear the trial court had ordered the defendant bail status revoked rather than forfeited based on information the defendant had shot three persons while out on bail thus the people argue the court declaration of revocation should be considered synonymous with forfeiture in this case.
we are not persuaded the trial court simply misspoke.revocation of bail and forfeiture of bail have distinct legal meanings.forfeiture of bail can only occur in one a defendant fails to appear at a scheduled court appearance without sufficient excuse.bail in this context refers to the money or other property provided to secure the defendant release from custody and assure his presence in court.it affects the surety and the persons who have supplied the underlying funding for the bond.revocation of bail,by contrast,relates to a defendant status and freedom from custody.a court may order bail status revoked for any number of reasons,and all without ordering bail forfeit,new information regarding his flight risk,commission of new crimes,additional crimes charged,or the like.
moreover,a person charged with a felony who willfully fails to appear as required after release on bail is chargeable with the entirely new and distinct felony offense of evading the court process thus the defendant nonappearance is a crime in and of itself,which may alone be sufficient to justify a court in revoking a defendant bail also requiring the defendant to commit an additional crime while on bail as the people argument suggests.it is very possible the trial court in the present case did precisely what it intended to do in the,to revoke the defendant bail status for his failure to appear as scheduled.
the people next argue it is obvious the trial court intended to declare a forfeiture because it clarified its ruling during a recess.the people request this court to construe the ambiguity in the court actions in favor of its intention as reflected instead in the clerk minute order for the day stating bail is forfeited 
as an initial matter we find nothing ambiguous about the court pronouncement in open court.it ordered the defendant bail status revoked and issued a bench warrant.the record is silent regarding forfeiture of the bond.indeed,as noted,the trial court found no ambiguity but instead acknowledged it had not declared bail forfeited when the defendant failed to appear.moreover,to accept the people argument would be to ignore the statutory language prescribing the procedure for declaring bail forfeitures.it asks us to hold a trial court silent intention,expressed to a court employee,and during a recess when court was not in session,satisfies the requirements of section,subdivision a mandating bail forfeitures be declared in open court.no rule of statutory interpretation of which we are aware would permit this construction.
next the people claim a trial court has the power to make new and different orders provided it does so prior to the time the clerk enters the order in the permanent minutes.accordingly,they urge this court to find the clerk minutes for the day reflect the true orders of the court.in support of their argument the people cite the decision in people surety insurance company in surety,the court in fact declared bail forfeited when the defendant failed to appear at a trial conference without sufficient excuse.when the defendant appeared later the same day the trial court vacated the forfeiture and reinstated the bond the clerk of the court did not notify the surety the defendant had been tardy for his court appointment.the defendant failed to appear for the continued trial conference.again the court ordered bail forfeited and issued a bench warrant.the clerk mailed notice of the forfeiture to the surety and its agent.the surety moved to set aside the forfeiture,contending the controlling statutes provided no authority to reinstate the bond without notice to the surety and thus the court lost jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture at the later date the trial court denied its motion.the appellate court affirmed.the court held until the court order is entered in the permanent minutes for the day,a court has discretion to excuse a defendant late appearance and reinstate bail as if it had never been forfeited and may do so without notifying the surety 
the decision in surety is inapposite.it does not discuss the requirements for declaring bail forfeited.most importantly,contrary to what the people would have us believe,it does not stand for the proposition a trial court failure to declare bail forfeited in open court may be cured by a similar recitation in the court minutes.accordingly,the people reliance on this decision is misplaced.
the question then is the consequence of the trial court failure to declare the bail forfeited in open court as the express terms of the amended statute require.
ii.the trial court lost jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture of the bond by failing to declare the forfeiture in open court as required by penal code section,subdivision a.
national contends the bond must be exonerated as a matter of law because of the trial court failure to comply with the requirements of section,subdivision a for declaring forfeiture of a bond.
in reviewing the applicable bail statute we are mindful of the general rules governing the interpretation of bail bond statutes the law traditionally disfavors forfeitures and this disfavor extends to forfeiture of bail.thus,penal code sections and dealing with forfeiture of bail bonds must be strictly construed in favor of the surety to avoid the harsh results of a forfeiture.the standard of review,therefore,compels us to protect the surety,and more importantly the individual citizens who pledge to the surety their property on behalf of persons seeking release from custody,in order to obtain the corporate bond.sections and are said to be jurisdictional prescriptions.failure to follow the jurisdictional prescriptions in sections and renders a summary judgment on the bail bond void.
the people argue the statutory requirement of declaring bail forfeited in open court is not jurisdictional because in amending section,subdivision a the legislature did not expressly state failure to declare forfeiture in open court
