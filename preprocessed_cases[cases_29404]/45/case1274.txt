this appeal is before us once again,the supreme court having remanded it to us for further consideration in light of the court decision in empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d.the parties have fully briefed the question,which they answer differently,whether empire requires us to change our decision,cir,which had reversed the district court dismissal of the suit for want of jurisdiction.
to provide health insurance for federal employees,the federal office of personnel management contracts with insurance carriers such as blue cross.the contract with blue cross provides that an insured who having received benefits from blue cross recovers compensation for the same illness or injury from a third party for example,as the result of filing a tort claim against that party must return to blue cross so much of the benefits as the compensation offsets.blue cross reserves the right not to permit the insured to deduct any part of the attorney fee that he incurred in obtaining the compensation from the third party.the reason this provision appears in the contract between the government and blue cross is that any reimbursement received by blue cross must be remitted,minus a service charge,to the federal government.
blue cross filed this suit in federal district court against one of its insureds,cruz actually cruz representative,but we suppress that irrelevant detail.blue cross had paid in benefits to cover injuries that cruz had sustained in an automobile accident.he had hired his own lawyer to bring a tort suit against the injurer,had recovered in a settlement,and had paid his lawyer of that amount as the lawyer fee.blue cross wanted the entire reimbursed to it,but cruz argued that under illinois common fund doctrine he was entitled to deduct a third as blue cross share of the attorney fee.in that way,each of the beneficiaries of the lawyer and blue be paying the lawyer the same fraction of their respective benefits from his efforts.
the common fund doctrine allows a person who incurs attorney fees in obtaining a judgment or settlement that confers a benefit on another to deduct a portion of the fee,bloomer liberty mutual ins,d scholtens schneider,regnery meyers,d,stores.associates health welfare plan wells,cir.the theory is that a beneficiary of another legal efforts should contribute to the cost of those efforts otherwise they might not be undertaken.in economic terms,the successful plaintiff in such a case confers if he is not compensated external to his pocketbook benefits,which he has no incentive to do unless he is compensated and they therefore are internalized to him.cruz suit produced a benefit not only to himself but also to blue cross,so cruz believed that the common fund doctrine entitled him to deduct part of his attorney fee from the repayment demanded by blue cross.
blue cross disagreed.it does not want to create the incentive that the common fund doctrine provides.it or the treasury must like the tradeoff between fewer tort recoveries by insureds and a larger share of each recovery.at any rate,the contract is explicit that the insured is to have no right to common fund treatment,and blue cross contended that the federal employees health benefits act,et,which authorized the office of personnel management to make the contract in this case,preempts any state law that might prevent enforcement of a term of the contract relating to benefits or coverage.for section m provides that the terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature,provision,or extent of coverage or benefits including payments with respect to benefits shall supersede and preempt any state or local law,or any regulation issued thereunder,which relates to health insurance or plans.
ordinarily,however,preemption is a defense,and the anticipation of a federal defense does not entitle the plaintiff to bring a suit not otherwise within federal jurisdiction in federal court,caterpillar williams,d,as blue cross did.but blue cross argues that the act preemption provision,quoted in the preceding paragraph,is so broad that it extinguishes any state contract law relating to the insurance contract,so that blue cross claim had to arise under federal law,presumably a federal common law of contracts that are governed by the federal employees health benefits act.in the alternative,it argues that the contract between the government and it involves a unique federal interest that has to be protected against conflicting state laws,such as illinois common fund doctrine,boyle united technologies,d,and that achieving this purpose requires that all disputes arising from the contract be resolved under federal common law.
under either the complete preemption or unique federal interest approach,blue cross suit would arise under federal law and thus be within the jurisdiction of the district court.beneficial national bank anderson,d caterpillar williams,supra,at.illinois city of milwaukee,d.the district judge rejected both approaches,however,and so dismissed the suit for want of federal jurisdiction.we reversed,and it is our order reversing the district court that the supreme court has directed us to reconsider.
empire arose from a suit by a health insurer against an insured who had recovered tort damages but refused to reimburse the insurer,on the ground that his damages did not cover the injury for which he had received benefits from the insurer.the supreme court,resolving an intercircuit conflict that the court identified our decision as being on the wrong side of,held that the suit did not arise under federal law.at.with respect to unique federal interest the only basis on which blue cross persists in arguing for federal court ruled that the dispute between insurer and insured in the empire case should not be placed under the complete governance of federal law,to be declared in a federal forum the state court in which the suit was lodged is competent to apply federal law,to the extent it is relevant,and would seem best positioned to determine the lawyer part in obtaining,and his or her fair share in,the tort recovery.id.at.in attempting to distinguish empire,blue cross fastens on the end of this passage,and argues that while there may be no transcendent federal interest in the lawyer part in obtaining,and his or her fair share in,the tort recovery which were the issues over which the insurer and the insured were quarreling in is a transcendent interest in whether a state common fund doctrine should be allowed to override a term in the insurance contract,which was not an issue in empire.
that is to read the majority opinion too narrowly,and in any event ignores the principle that jurisdictional provisions should be simple and clear so that a party is not placed in the position of filing a suit in one court only to discover after years of litigating there that it has to start over in another court because the first court lacked jurisdiction.budinich becton dickinson,d kusay united states,cir unique concepts,manuel,cir cot√© wadel,cir kuntz lamar,cir.on blue cross submission,if a fight over an insured common fund defense involves messy,picky issues,such as the reasonableness of the attorney fee paid by the plaintiff,there is no federal jurisdiction,while if the insurer is arguing for preemption of all common fund defenses it can sue in federal court.
one reason the court gave in empire for rejecting a federal common law of federal employees health benefits is that a common fund defense will often involve a disagreement merely over the value to the insurer of the insured efforts in his suit,and that is hardly an issue on which a federal rule is necessary.our case involves the broader issue of the applicability of the common fund doctrine in light of the contract,which purports to entitle blue cross to reject the doctrine.another reason the court gave for its result in empire was that the contracts between the office of personnel management and the insurers allow an insurer to enforce the insured claim against the third party directly,and if the insurer followed that route his right to reimbursement would depend entirely on the third party tort liability no reimbursement or common
