in this appeal,the,karen stephenson stephenson challenged the district court award of summary judgment to,allstate insurance company allstate,alleging that allstate breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing when it denied her request to purchase another agent book of business.as allstate retained the exclusive and final approval of all agent purchases under the allstate exclusive agency agreement,agreement,appellant contention has failed to join a genuine issue of material fact and,for the reasons discussed below,this court affirms the summary judgment granted by the district court.
stephenson had operated as an exclusive agent through contract with allstate under the agreement she executed on june.appellant agency was located in livonia,ohio in zip code.during september of,stephenson began negotiations with alex yvannou,another agent,to purchase his allstate accounts.yvannou agency was located in canton,ohio in zip code.the offices were approximately eight miles apart.upon reaching a purchase agreement,stephenson and yvannou notified their immediate agency manager and allstate human resources department of the proposed sale.appellant was told that she should prepare a business plan while human resources finalized the paperwork for the deal.when stephenson contacted allstate to inquire where to send her business plan,she was informed that allstate had denied the purchase because of the zip code rule.yvannou subsequently sold his book of business to another agent within the same,canton,zip code.
the zip code rule is set forth in allstate agency relocation guidelines,under which all agency initiated agent relocations were limited to the agent current zip code or immediately contiguous zip code.nothing in the agreement,the supplemental agreement,or the independent contractor manuals manuals references a zip code rule however,each of these binding contract documents discusses the restrictions placed upon the appellant when seeking to purchase another agent book of business.

this agreement is personal to you accordingly,you may not execute a transfer of your interest in this agreement without prior written approval of the company.a transfer of interest is described in the supplement and includes,but is not limited to,any sale,merger,or assignment,in whole or in part,directly,indirectly,or contingently,of this agreement or any rights or obligations under it.you have the obligation to notify the company of a proposed transfer and to request approval.the company retains the right in its exclusive judgment to approve or disapprove such a transfer.

here are a few questions regarding with sic the noa changes 
q has the contiguous zip code requirements sic changed for agents moving from one location to another

no,the same requirements are still in effect.when purchasing a book of business,the contiguous zip code rule is not a requirement,but the books of business must be within reasonable proximity to one another.this requirement provides for the buying agent to consolidate the two books and still provide the required customer service.
emphasis in original.
appellant filed the instant action against allstate averring breach of contract and tortious interference with appellant business relationship or expectancy.on january,allstate filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that appellant claims failed as a matter of law because appellee retained the unqualified right to deny the sale based upon its exclusive judgment.
in a opinion,the district court agreed with allstate contentions.the court concluded that of the agreement reserved to allstate the unlimited right to make decisions with respect to the transfer sought by stephenson.additionally,as the parties had explicitly expressed their respective rights,the contract did not contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and the district court found that stephenson claim failed as a matter of law.finally,given allstate exclusive right to deny appellant transfer of another agent books of business,the court determined that the appellee did not tortiously interfere with stephenson business relationship or expectancy.
the instant appeal arose out of stephenson timely challenge of the district court determination regarding only the breach of contract claim.the appellant did not contest the district court conclusions on her claim of tortious interference.
