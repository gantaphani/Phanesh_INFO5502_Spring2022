we granted en banc rehearing to reconsider our precedent concerning the scope and application of federally mandated insurance for interstate commercial motor carriers.see carolina cas.ins.yeates,cir applying empire fire marine ins.guar.ins,cir.
federal regulations require interstate trucking companies to maintain insurance or another form of surety conditioned to pay any final judgment recovered against such motor carrier for bodily injuries to or the death of any person resulting from the negligent operation,maintenance or use of motor vehicles.a see also id.to satisfy this insurance requirement,most interstate trucking companies obtain a specific endorsement to one or more of their insurance guarantees payment of minimum amounts,as set forth in the regulations,to an injured member of the public.id.an endorsement is intended to eliminate the possibility of a denial of coverage by requiring the insurer to pay any final judgment recovered against the insured for negligence in the operation,maintenance,or use of motor vehicles subject to federal financial responsibility requirements,even though the accident vehicle is not listed in the policy.auto.liability ins.
in this circuit,the leading case interpreting the endorsement is empire fire.in empire fire,we evaluated the effect of an endorsement where multiple insurance policies covered an accident between a trucker and a member of the public.in resolving which of the policies provided primary coverage,we concluded the endorsement amended contrary language in the underlying insurance policy,which would otherwise have limited the insurance carrier liability to excess coverage.empire fire,at.because multiple potential sources of liability coverage existed,we held that liability for primary coverage should be allocated among the insurers pursuant to traditional state insurance and contract law principles.id.at.this holding has been interpreted to mean that an endorsement modifies the underlying insurance policy in a variety of ways,including allowing recovery from a policy that otherwise does not provide liability coverage,and allowing primary liability recovery from a policy that provides only excess coverage.
empire fire carefully addressed competing views in the precedent regarding the scope of the endorsement,but its rule has placed this circuit in the minority for quite some time.see generally appleman on insurance supp.to supp describing split.in fact,since our holding in empire fire,only one other circuit has apparently followed our lead.see prestige cas.mut.ins,cir but see kline gulf ins,cir declining to read an endorsement as modifying the underlying insurance policy limitations.
in this en banc proceeding,carolina casualty argues our decision in empire fire has evolved into an idiosyncratic,minority position that frustrates the regulatory purpose behind the endorsement and impedes the uniform regulation of interstate trucking.carolina casualty asks us to revisit our prior reasoning and join the majority of circuits in recognizing the endorsement as a surety obligation.we take that opportunity here.
for the reasons discussed below,we hold the endorsement only applies where the underlying insurance policy to which the endorsement is attached does not provide coverage for the motor carrier accident,and the motor carrier insurance coverage is either not sufficient to satisfy the minimum levels of financial responsibility or is.
we therefore vacate the panel opinion,reverse the district court judgment,and order the district court to enter judgment consistent with this opinion.
background 
in tymer yeates was severely injured when a car his wife was driving was involved in a collision with a truck owned by bingham livestock.yeates and his wife sued bingham livestock and the truck driver in state court.bingham livestock carried two insurance policies relevant to this accident,one issued by state farm and one issued by carolina casualty.bingham livestock notified both carriers of the claim.
state farm policy specifically insured the truck involved in the accident.without much delay,it tendered the policy limit of to the yeateses.in contrast,carolina casualty policy was a general liability policy covering a variety of commercial claims,but did not extend to the truck involved in the accident.it did,however,include an endorsement,which provided that carolina casualty would pay up to for any final judgment recovered against bingham livestock for public liability resulting from negligence in the operation,maintenance or use of motor vehicles,app.at endorsement.
while the yeateses negligence case was pending in utah state court,carolina casualty filed this declaratory judgment action in federal court.carolina casualty sought a ruling that it had no liability to the yeateses under the general liability policy because state farm had already tendered its policy limits federal regulations require a minimum of for such accident claims and therefore,the endorsement would not be needed to provide federally mandated minimum coverage.the district court rejected this argument on the basis of our holding in empire fire,concluding the carolina casualty policy also provides primary insurance for the accident under the endorsement and thus carolina casualty may be required to pay any final judgment resulting from the yeateses accident.
carolina casualty appealed,arguing one central point.since state farm policy specifically covered the accident at issue and state farm had already paid out its policy limits and carolina casualty general liability policy did not cover bingham livestock truck,the endorsement was not triggered.more specifically,carolina casualty contended its endorsement operated as a surety to make it an insurer of last resort,requiring payment only when no other insurance is available the endorsement attached to its policy was therefore not triggered because the yeateses had already received insurance benefits at least equal to the minimum amount required by the endorsement and,accordingly our precedent in empire fire was flawed under the reasoning adopted by the large majority of other circuit courts in the years since it was decided.a panel of this court affirmed,finding our prior decision in empire fire binding.
the panel determined carolina casualty policy as amended by the endorsement may be available to cover a final judgment arising from the accident.carolina,at.applying empire fire,the panel reasoned that two conditions must be satisfied before the endorsement will operate to amend the underlying policy there must be a covered accident,and the underlying policy must preclude coverage for that accident.id.because carolina casualty policy precluded coverage for the truck involved in the accident,the panel concluded the attached endorsement operate d to amend the underlying policy and guarantee d payment regardless of limiting provisions in the underlying policy.id.on this basis,the panel affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in the yeateses favor.
carolina casualty then sought a rehearing en banc,it has throughout this our decision in empire fire is out of step with the other circuits.we granted carolina casualty rehearing request and asked for supplemental briefing on whether our rule from empire fire,that an endorsement negates limiting provisions in the attached policy to render that policy a primary source of insurance coverage,should be reaffirmed,overruled,or modified 
today,we modify our prior holding in empire fire and adopt the rule used by the majority of our sister circuits.
ii.regulatory and legal framework 
we begin with an explanation of the endorsement and its associated regulations.we then address the competing legal analyses of the endorsement,including our approach in empire fire.finally,with this background in mind,we adopt the majority approach and apply it to the facts of this case.
endorsement 
as part of its push to deregulate the trucking industry,increase competition,reduce entry barriers,and improve quality of service,congress passed the motor carrier act of mca,et.see,as reprinted in see also deimling,gregory et al,the book truckers versus insurers and the government makes three.according to the house report accompanying the mca,the intent of this legislation was to overhaul outmoded and archaic regulatory mechanisms,while retaining the pluses of an industry that has worked by simply conducting itself under the rules of the game,at.
nevertheless,while the legislation was aimed at reducing regulatory barriers in the interstate motor carrier industry,some legislators fear ed that increased safety problems would result from the expanded entry provided in the mca and that increased entry would open the highways to truckers who might have little concern for the safe operation and maintenance of their vehicles,thereby posing a threat to those who share the highways with them.id.at.the mca,therefore,included provisions addressing these concerns as well as the abuses that had arisen in the interstate trucking industry which threatened public safety,including the use by motor carriers of leased or borrowed vehicles to avoid financial responsibility for accidents that occurred while goods were being transported in interstate commerce.canal ins.distrib,cir empire fire,at see also couch on insurance ed.the relationships in the trucking business are often complicated and usually involve multiple policies.for example,one entity can own the tractor while another entity owns the trailer,with both of these entities having contractual arrangements with another party,the trucking company.
the mca and the subsequent regulations promulgated by the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa require interstate motor carriers to obtain a special endorsement providing that the insurer will pay within policy limits any judgment recovered against the insured motor carrier for liability resulting from the carrier negligence,whether or not the vehicle involved in the accident is specifically described in the policy.cent.dupont,cir.in particular,the mca provides that a commercial motor carrier may operate only if registered to do so,and must be willing and able to comply with certain minimum financial responsibility requirements,id.a emphasis added.
the regulations promulgated pursuant to the mca require proof of financial responsibility by one of three methods 
endorsement s for motor carrier policies of insurance for public liability under sections and of the motor carrier act of form issued by an insurer s 
a motor carrier surety bond for public liability under section of the motor carrier act of form issued by a surety or 
a written decision,order,or authorization of the federal motor carrier safety administration authorizing a motor carrier to under,provided the motor carrier maintains a satisfactory safety rating as determined by the federal motor carrier safety administration 
d.in other words,a motor carrier can establish proof of the requisite financial responsibility in one of three ways by an endorsement,by a surety bond,or by.see distrib,at.
the regulations also denote the specific forms necessary to establish compliance with the financial responsibility requirements.specifically,the form is set forth in 
interplay of the endorsement and liability insurance 
the language of the endorsement and the underlying regulations evince several key conclusions with respect to the financial responsibility requirements first,the financial responsibility provisions require motor carriers to demonstrate they are adequately insured in order to protect the public from risks created by the carriers operations.see id.from the express language of the motor carrier act and the regulations,these provisions are intended to impose a mandatory requirement that motor carriers obtain a minimum level of liability insurance,depending on the cargo they carry.see id.
second,the provisions were designed to ensure the collectability of a to relieve the injured member of the public from the requirement that he or she obtain a final judgment of legal liability against the motor carrier and its insurers as a prerequisite.see id,illus.i t he insurer agrees to pay,within the limits of liability described herein,any final judgment recovered against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence emphasis added.
third,an one of the acceptable methods of demonstrating financial ambiguous with respect to how it interacts with the underlying insurance policy.the endorsement states that no condition,provision,stipulation,or limitation contained in the policy,this endorsement,or any other endorsement thereon,or violation thereof,shall relieve the insurance company from liability or from the payment of any final judgment,within the limits of liability herein described.id.on one hand,this provision may suggest the endorsement modifies the underlying policy to the extent the policy is inconsistent.but on the other hand,the endorsement further provides that all terms,conditions,and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company.id.it is precisely this ambiguity that has created the confusion about the effect of an endorsement on an injured party right to recover a negligence judgment against a motor carrier.
the tension between these competing clauses in the endorsement leads to confusion because courts are typically confronted with two determinations involving the endorsement that must be resolved contemporaneously the proper allocation of insurance liability among multiple insurers and the motor carrier,and any possible public financial responsibility because of a shortfall in available sources for satisfaction of a judgment against the motor carrier,at least up to the prescribed minimum amount under the regulations.
when we decided empire fire over years ago,the landscape was sparse.since then,our reasoning in empire fire has been relegated to a minority position.see appleman on insurance supp.to supp describing the circuit split and the various approaches.to better explain our decision today,we provide a brief summary of the competing approaches to the interpretation and application of the endorsement.
empire fire approaches in other circuits 
empire fire marine insurance guaranty national insurance,cir 
in empire fire,we resolved the conflict created when multiple insurance carriers with endorsements provided coverage for a trucker accident.there,the dispute involved two insurance companies,guaranty insurance company and empire fire insurance company,and concerned their respective responsibilities for a motor carrier accident involving a truck and driver it had leased from another company.empire fire,at.notably,both insurance policies provided coverage for the accident at issue,and the dispute centered on which insurer was responsible for primary,who would pay first.id.at.
the guaranty insurance policy,issued to the motor carrier,contained a clause limiting liability to excess coverage for accidents involving vehicles not owned by the carrier.id.at.the leasing company,which owned the truck and had leased the vehicle and the driver to the motor carrier,was insured under the empire fire policy.id.at.by its own terms the empire fire policy provided primary coverage.id.at.only the guaranty insurance policy,however,contained an endorsement.id.at.based on the endorsement,the district court concluded guaranty insurance was the primary insurer as a matter of law over any other insurer.empire fire,at.
we reversed,finding the endorsement made guaranty insurance coverage,guaranty was a primary insurer,but not necessarily the only primary insurer.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we considered three competing interpretations of the scope of the endorsement 
the endorsement makes the insurance policy to which it is attached primary as a matter of law over all other insurance policies that lack similar provisions.
t he endorsement only negates limiting provisions in the policy to which it is attached,such as an excess coverage clause,but does not establish primary liability over other policies that are also primary by their own terms.
t he endorsement applies only to situations in which a claim is being asserted by a shipper or a member of the public,and that the endorsement does not apply when allocating liability among insurance carriers.
we adopted the second approach,determining that both guaranty insurance policy and empire fire policy were available to cover a liability judgment arising from the accident.id.at.we did not,however,decide how the liability would be distributed between the two insurance policies.id.at.instead,we determined that once limiting language is read out the two policies then must be compared pursuant to traditional state insurance and contract law principles to determine how liability should be allocated among the insurers.id.at.we have applied the empire fire reasoning in several later cases.see campbell bartlett,cir budd am.excess ins,cir railhead freight fire ins,cir.
more recently,in adams royal indemnity,we addressed circumstances where no insurance policy,solely by its terms,extended to provide liability insurance coverage for a motor carrier negligence.cir.the injured party,adams,was unsuccessful in collecting a judgment of approximately million against the driver.id.at.he then sued royal indemnity,which had issued two insurance policies one to the lessee of the trailer involved in the accident and one to the partnership that owned the trailer.id.both policies contained endorsements.id.
we concluded that although neither policy provided insurance coverage for the accident,the lessee operation of the to make royal liable for adams unsatisfied judgment.id.at.several insights regarding the purpose and operation were key to this conclusion.
first,we noted that the icc endorsement is designed to require carriers to insure against public liability for all their motor vehicles and that b y requiring this icc endorsement,the icc prevents the possibility that,through inadvertence or otherwise,some vehicles may be left off a policy to the detriment of the public.id.at.
second,while the endorsement does not explicitly define insured,we concluded it indirectly modified the lessee policy with royal so the term extended to the trailer and driver involved in adams accident.adams,at.
finally,we acknowledged the endorsement is not intended to preclude insurers and carriers or multiple insurers from contractually apportioning ultimate liability among themselves,id.at,and most importantly,i n situations where the policy absent the endorsement did not insure the vehicle which caused the injuries,the endorsement explicitly requires that the insured reimburse the insurer because the insurer payment to the injured motorist is a payment the company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement,id.at quoting the mandatory language of the endorsement.thus,we concluded the public is protected by insurance and ultimate responsibility rests on the truckers,all as mandated by congress and the fmcsa.id.emphasis added.as noted below,our adams approach is in accord with the majority view.
but,our analysis under empire,as discussed above,involved a slightly different factual fallen into disfavor.specifically,other courts have disagreed with our conclusion in empire fire that if an insurance policy with an attached endorsement provides coverage for a motor carrier accident,the endorsement operates to read out any limiting provisions to make such an insurer a primary insurer,although not necessarily the only one.under this approach,an insurer may be forced to indemnify the motor carrier for its negligence to a greater extent than it bargained for and without a right to reimbursement from another primary insurer.
majority approach 
the majority of circuits approach the endorsement using a different framework from empire fire.we find their framework persuasive.
first,the cases describe the insurer obligation under the endorsement as one of a surety rather than a modification of the underlying policy the endorsement is a safety net in the event other insurance is lacking.see canal ins.carolina cas.ins,cir holding the endorsement to be a suretyship by the insurance carrier to protect the safety not insurance relieving another insurer.on the contrary,it simply covers the public when other coverage is lacking see also kline gulf ins,cir same canal ins.underwriters at lloyd london,cir same canal ins.distrib,cir same ins.larsen intermodal,cir same harco ins.bobac trucking,cir occidental fire cas.of int l ins,cir.under this reasoning,an insurer duty to pay a judgment arises not from any insurance obligation,but from the endorsement language guaranteeing a source of recovery in the event the motor carrier negligently injures a member of the public on the highways.
second,in marked contrast to our approach in empire fire,these cases describe the surety pay a negligence judgment against a motor carrier under the one that is triggered only when the underlying insurance policy to which the endorsement is attached does not otherwise provide coverage,and either no other insurer is available to satisfy the judgment against the motor carrier,or the motor carrier insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy the minimum levels of financial responsibility,kline,at underwriters at lloyd london,at minter great am.ins.of,cir.
third,according to the majority case law,the endorsement,its terms,and its operating provisions that supercede any limitation in the underlying insurance policy are only implicated as between an injured member of the public and the insurer,distrib,at.referencing the express language of the provides that all terms,conditions,and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company,these cases conclude the endorsement operates only to protect the public and does not alter the relationship between the insured and the insurer as otherwise provided in the policy.id.further,the endorsement can not reasonably be read to alter the terms of the policy for the benefit of other insurers.id.the endorsement,in other words,is irrelevant to and has no effect on the ultimate allocation of a judgment against a motor carrier as between the carrier and its various insurers 
finally,under the majority as we held in endorsement operates only to guarantee a source of payment of a judgment,and does not relieve the motor carrier or its liability insurers assuming the respective insurance policies extend to the accident at issue of their duty to satisfy an injured party judgment against the carrier.the peculiar nature of the endorsement grants the judgment creditor the right to demand payment directly from the insurer,and simultaneously grants the insurer the right to demand reimbursement from the insured.underwriters at lloyd london,at.a motor carrier may be required to reimburse the insurer for any payout the insurer would not otherwise have been obligated to make.the endorsement thereby presents neither a windfall for the motor carrier,nor does it alter the motor carrier coverage under its other insurance policies.see bobac trucking,at.
with this background,we turn to our analysis of the claims here.
iii.analysis 
a.we adopt the majority view 
carolina casualty argues we should abandon our empire fire framework because it is inconsistent with both the intended purposes and the interpretation of the endorsement by the majority of other circuits.we agree,and conclude the endorsement is intended to impose a surety obligation on the insurance company.
consequently,when an injured party obtains a negligence judgment against a motor carrier,an insurer obligation under the endorsement is not triggered unless the underlying insurance policy to which the endorsement is attached does not provide liability coverage for the accident,and the carrier other insurance coverage is either insufficient to meet the minimums or.once the minimums have been satisfied,however,the endorsement does not apply.
next,we discuss the reasoning behind our change in interpretation and application.
surety nature of the endorsement 
carolina casualty correctly notes that the regulatory framework underscores the surety nature of the obligation.it argues the endorsement should act as a safety net to protect the public where none of a motor carrier liability insurance policies satisfies at least a minimum amount of an injured party judgment.
we conclude the endorsement is intended to act as a surety for two reasons.initially,as explained above,the regulations provide a series of alternatives for satisfying the requisite proof of a motor carrier financial responsibility under the mca an endorsement attached to an insurance policy,a surety bond,or fmc saauthorized.see d distrib,at.because each of these alternatives equally satisfy the public financial responsibility requirements prescribed by the fmcsa,the concepts underlying the second and third alternatives are informative in understanding the nature of the obligation.
a surety bond,evidenced by an form,see,illus.ii,is a surety on its face.the form provides 
this bond assures compliance by the principal motor carrier with the applicable governing provisions,and shall inure to the benefit of any person or persons who shall recover a final judgment or judgments against the principal for public liability if every final judgment shall be paid for such claims resulting from the negligent operation,maintenance,or use of motor vehicles in transportation subject to the applicable governing provisions,then this obligation shall be void,otherwise it will remain in full effect.
id.emphasis added.by the express terms of the form,the surety obligation under the bond is inapplicable if a final negligence judgment against a motor carrier is paid from other sources.rather,the surety obligation to an injured member of the public only arises if there is an unsatisfied judgment.
similarly,the third alternative of requires a motor carrier to demonstrate to the fmcsa a financial ability to satisfy a negligence judgment.see id.a.as part of this option,the motor carrier must,among other things,demonstrate it 
has established,and will maintain,an insurance program that will protect the public against all claims to the same extent as the minimum security limits applicable to the motor carrier such a program may include,but not be limited to,one or more of the following irrevocable letters of credit irrevocable trust funds reserves sinking funds financial guarantees,parent company or affiliate sureties excess insurance coverage or other similar arrangements.
id.a.under this approach,nothing prevents the motor carrier from obtaining liability insurance coverage from an outside insurer that would otherwise satisfy any potential negligence liability obligations for the carrier accidents.in this way,the option may also operate as a suretyship rather than as primary insurance coverage.
this regulatory structure suggests the endorsement operates in much the same way as the two,as a surety in the event judgment against the carrier is for some reason unsatisfied.conceivably,the motor carrier may carry adequate insurance coverage providing least to the fmcsa prescribed a judgment in favor of an injured party.or,the carrier may choose to pay the judgment out of its own pocket.in either of these cases,the purposes behind the are satisfied,and the endorsement is unnecessary.see id.the purpose of these regulations is to assure that motor carriers maintain an appropriate level of financial responsibility for motor vehicles operated on public highways.on the other hand,if,for example,the carrier fails to maintain insurance or sufficient insurance on a truck involved in an accident and fails to pay out of its own pocket for its liability to the injured party,the endorsement purpose is clearly implicated.the endorsement in this circumstance would effectuate a minimum level of recovery for the injured party from the provider.
the second reason for finding the operates as a surety is because,by its express terms,the endorsement provides that while 
the insurer the company agrees to pay,within the limits of liability described herein,any final judgment recovered against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence,t he insured agrees to reimburse the company for any payment made by the company that the company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.
id,illus.nothing precludes the motor carrier from paying the judgment itself or obtaining the payment from other insurance sources.the endorsement obligates the underlying insurer to make this payment not in the motor carrier stead,but to ensure a minimum level of satisfaction of a public liability judgment.see id.noting the insurer obligation is irrespective of the financial condition,insolvency or bankruptcy of the motor carrier.this is exactly the way a surety obligation is designed to operate.see peter alces,the law of suretyship and guaranty the essence of suretyship is the undertaking to answer for the debt of another.the surety liability is coextensive with that of the debtor and arises only when the debtor fails to discharge his duties or to respond in damages for that failure.
in short,the surety concept flows naturally from the purpose and text of the governing regulatory provisions.
trigger for endorsement 
with this understanding of the surety nature of the endorsement,we move to the conditions that trigger its application.as discussed above,the relevant purpose of the motor carrier act was to ensure a motor carrier financial responsibility for negligence liability,not to preempt state insurance law or contracting principles.we thus agree with carolina casualty that an endorsement,rather than fundamentally altering the terms of the underlying insurance policy,operates to ensure payment of a minimum amount of an injured party judgment against a negligent motor carrier.
the endorsement comes into play,then,only where the underlying insurance policy to which the endorsement is attached does not otherwise provide liability coverage,and the carrier other insurance coverage is either insufficient to satisfy the minimum levels of financial responsibility or is.this conclusion flows from the language of the endorsement,and the nature of the coverage provided by it.
textual provisions 
as an initial matter,an understanding of when the endorsement comes into play can be obtained by examining two seemingly divergent provisions in the endorsement the first provision dictates that no condition,provision,stipulation,or limitation contained in the policy shall relieve the insurance company from liability or from the payment of any final judgment,within the limits of liability herein described and the second provision requires that all terms,conditions,and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company,illus.
the first provision requires the insurer to pay a public liability against the motor carrier for negligence with respect to vehicles subject to the financial responsibility or not the events giving rise to the judgment come within the policy express coverage.see id.requiring payout even if the particular vehicle involved in an accident was for some reason not specifically described in the policy or was driven on a route the carrier was not authorized to serve,and irrespective of the financial condition,insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured see also larsen intermodal,at.at first blush,the provision appears to automatically invalidate any contrary or limiting terms in the underlying insurance policy.
the second provision,however,reiterates the underlying insurance policy remains in force on its original terms as between the motor carrier and the respective insurance company.any policy exclusions,or outright lack of coverage by the policy for the accident at issue,remain valid and enforceable as between the motor carrier and its insurer.this conclusion is supported by the endorsement reimbursement provision if the insurer would not have been obligated to pay the judgment absent the endorsement,the insurer is entitled to reimbursement by the motor carrier.see,illus.i the insured agrees to reimburse the company for any payment that the company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in the endorsement.the motor carrier therefore is free to negotiate the terms of its insurance policies with various insurers as it sees fit.consequently,with respect to the ultimate allocation of responsibility,the endorsement should be irrelevant 
nature of the obligation 
notably,the endorsement and the underlying insurance policy,while linked,impose different obligations based on different requirements.an insurance policy typically imposes an obligation to indemnify,pay without reimbursement on the insurance company based on the policy coverage of a particular risk.the endorsement,on the other hand,imposes an obligation on the insurance company to make payment in the first instance,based on a final judgment entered against the motor carrier and subject to possible reimbursement by that carrier.
it is therefore helpful to distinguish between the two types of protection at play when a motor carrier is responsible for an accident causing injury to a member of the public.first,there is a public financial responsibility embodied in the and in the other two alternatives prescribed by d liability for a judgment rendered against a motor carrier in favor of an injured member of the public for negligence.an insurer guaranteeing a motor carrier public financial responsibility presents a readily accessible source for satisfaction of the judgment irrespective of the ultimate apportionment of insurance liability.this liability,by itself,imparts no duty to defend or right of subrogation to the insurance company.as the endorsement makes clear,although the insurer may be obligated to pay a liability judgment against the motor carrier,the insurer can obtain indemnification from the insured motor carrier.in essence,the is a guarantee an injured member of the public will obtain at least a portion of his or her judgment regardless of the ultimate allocation of liability and regardless of the financial health of the motor carrier.
the other type of more widely the insurance liability.a motor carrier insures itself against possible liability in its business operations.based on the insurance policy limits and in exchange for a premium paid,an insurance company agrees to cover the carrier,pay for certain liabilities without right of reimbursement for the carrier own negligence.the purpose of liability insurance is to minimize the motor carrier risks in operating its fleet insurance transfers a certain amount of risk from the trucking company to its insurer.further,the insurance company providing liability insurance has a duty to defend the carrier in a lawsuit for negligence and may be ultimately on the hook for any judgment against the carrier.
the insurance company has an incentive to ensure the motor carrier operates its business in a safe manner the insurance company can increase premiums,drop its coverage,or refuse to renew the policy in response to risks raised by the motor carrier operation.the motor carrier,having obtained liability insurance coverage,is typically obligated to pay two possible expenses the premium for the policy,and any portion of a negligence judgment exceeding all applicable insurance policy limits.the insurance company in turn is obligated to pay without right of reimbursement from the carrier for the motor carrier defense and liability costs covered by the policy,typically only up to the policy stated limits.
to accomplish the suretyship purpose,the out only those clauses in the policy that would limit the ability of a third party victim to recover for his loss.larsen intermodal,at quoting carolina cas.ins.underwriters ins,cir.this purpose,however,is not implicated where there is an allocation of responsibility as between multiple insurers.id.but there is no need for or purpose to be served by this supposed automatic extinguishment of a clause insofar as it affects the insured or other insurers who clamor for part or all of the coverage.quotation and brackets omitted.the should not render the primary,or,as a matter of law where the underlying policy provides otherwise.see id.t he states that all terms,conditions,and limitations in the policy to which the endorsement is attached shall remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the company.i t follows that when the protection of injured members of the public is not at stake,the and the relevant federal regulations do not address coverage for the purpose of disputes between the insured and the insurer.id see empire fire marine ins.transport,cir it is clear that while icc regulations require the carrier,or its certified insurer,to protect the public from loss due to negligent acts,the regulations do not alter or affect the obligations between the insured and the insurer,or where there is more than one insurer,the apportionment of liability between them.
additionally,the endorsement is not an ordinary insurance provision to protect the insured.the endorsement does not extinguish the debt of the insured.travelers indem.of am.specialized transp,cir.the endorsement instead grants the insurer the right to seek reimbursement from the insured party for any payment made by the company on account of any accident,claim or suit involving a breach of the terms of the policy,and for any payment that the insurance company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained herein,illus.i see also am.specialized transp,at the endorsement transfers the right to receive the insured debt obligation from the judgment creditor to the insurer.such a right of reimbursement is triggered only if there is no coverage under the insurer policy.larsen intermodal,at.
in sum,the endorsement creates an obligation entirely separate from other obligations created by the policy to which it is attached.the defines the insurer public financial responsibility obligation,while the underlying policy defines the insurer insurance liability obligation.it would make no sense to jump to the insurer endorsement obligation if the underlying insurance policy already provides coverage for the accident.
triggering circumstances 
it follows from the regulatory scheme and the text of the endorsement that the surety obligation is triggered only when the underlying insurance policy does not provide coverage and either no other insurance policy is available to satisfy the judgment against the motor carrier,or the motor carrier insurance coverage is insufficient to meet the minimum level.see distrib,at larsen intermodal,at.
first,if no other insurance policy is available the purposes behind the are clearly implicated.as the majority of circuits have recognized,the primary purpose of the is to assure that injured members of the public are able to obtain judgment from negligent authorized interstate carriers.john deere ins.nueva,cir.where,for example,a motor carrier fails to obtain insurance on a particular or driver,no liability policy would extend to cover the carrier potential negligence on the public highways.if an injured party obtains judgment,he or she would be left to rely solely on the financial stability of the motor carrier to satisfy judgment.this is the exact situation the endorsement contemplates and is designed to address.see,illus.i stating the endorsement imposes an obligation on the insurer to make payment of any final judgment irrespective of the financial condition,insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured.
under this scenario,the motor carrier becomes a to the injured party,the.the endorsement would then operate to read out any exclusions or limitations and thereby require the insurer,as a surety,to pay the injured party.however,the endorsement does not extinguish the debt of the insured it transfers the right to receive the insured debt obligation from the judgment creditor to the insurer.am.specialized transp,at.and most importantly,it merely shifts the risk of from the injured party to the insurer.see,illus.i stating the insurance company has a right to reimbursement from the motor carrier for payment of such a judgment.in t
