introduction 
did the trial court err in denying the motion of state farm general insurance company state farm for leave to intervene in a construction defect lawsuit brought by state farm insureds,douglas hodge and kylie schuyler hodge the hodges,against third party tortfeasors state farm obtained partial subrogation rights against the third parties by paying a portion of the hodges claims for property damage to their house.we hold state farm has a statutory right to intervene under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b and therefore reverse.
ii.facts and proceedings in the trial court 
state farm issued the hodges a homeowners insurance policy the policy covering certain risks to their house in laguna beach.the policy grants state farm subrogation rights against third parties who cause losses for which the policy provides benefits.the subrogation paragraph in the policy conditions states,in part an insured may waive in writing before a loss all rights of recovery against any person.if not waived,we may require an assignment of rights of recovery for a loss to the extent that payment is made by us.
in december,the hodges submitted a claim to state farm under the policy for water and mold damage to their house allegedly caused by the negligence of third parties.the hodges contended the cost to repair the water damage was about.the hodges made a total demand on state farm for water and mold damage in the policy limits amount of.state farm denied the hodges claim for mold damage and paid the hodges about on the claim for water damage.state farm contended it is still adjusting the water damage claim.
in september,the hodges filed a construction defect lawsuit,orange county superior court case the construction defect lawsuit,against the former owner,the developer,the general contractor,and one subcontractor who constructed the hodges house.the complaint in the construction defect lawsuit alleged defendants caused the water and mold damage by performing defective work,violating building codes,failing to comply with plans and specifications,using unauthorized or unqualified subcontractors,failing to repair defective work,conducting inadequate repair work,and negligently supervising construction of the house 
in november,the hodges filed a complaint for bad faith against state farm,orange county superior court case the bad faith lawsuit.the complaint in the bad faith lawsuit alleged water infiltration caused a covered loss to the hodges house and that state farm in bad faith denied coverage under the policy and refused to pay the policy benefits.the trial court denied state farm motion to consolidate the construction defect lawsuit and the bad faith lawsuit.
state farm moved for leave to intervene in the construction defect lawsuit to file a subrogation complaint.the hodges,as well as three of the four defendants in the construction defect lawsuit,opposed state farm motion.one defendant resg,filed nothing in response to state farm motion.
at the hearing on state farm motion for leave to intervene,the trial court announced a tentative ruling to deny the motion because the diversion or complication of adding state farm would outweigh any prejudice to state farm by not allowing an intervention.on august,the trial court issued a minute order denying state farm motion for leave to intervene for reasons as stated on the record.
state farm timely appealed from the order denying its motion for leave to intervene.an order denying a motion for leave to intervene is directly appealable because it finally and adversely determines the moving party right to proceed in the action.bame city of del mar th,d.
iii.as a partially subrogated insurer,state farm has a right to intervene in the insureds lawsuit under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.
intervention is governed by code of civil procedure section.subdivision a of section states in relevant part,u pon timely application,any person,who has an interest in the matter in litigation,or in the success of either of the parties,or an interest against both,may intervene in the action or proceeding.
intervention is mandatory as of right or permissive.a nonparty has a right under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b to intervene in a pending action if the person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and that person is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede that person ability to protect that interest,unless that person interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
a.the requirements for intervention as of right under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b 
interest related to the property or transaction that is the subject of the underlying lawsuit 
state farm,as a partially subrogated insurer,has an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the construction defect lawsuit.under the doctrine of subrogation,when an insurer pays money to its insured for a loss caused by a third party,the insurer succeeds to its insured rights against the third party in the amount the insurer paid.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d.upon subrogation,the insurer steps into the shoes of its insured.allstate ins.mel rapton,th,d mel rapton.subrogation is the insurer right to be put in the position of the insured,in order to recover from third parties who are legally responsible to the insured for a loss paid by the insurer.plut fireman fund ins.th,d plut.partial payment to the insured results in partial subrogation the insurer is subrogated in the amount of the insurance proceeds.ferraro southern cal.gas d.ferraro.
deutschmann sears,roebuck d.deutschmann supports the position that state farm has an interest in the litigation sufficient to support intervention as a matter of right.in that case,the insured sued the retailer sears,roebuck company for personal injury and property damages resulting from a fire caused by a defective television set.id.at.the insurer became subrogated to the insured by paying policy proceeds for property damage and intervened in the insured lawsuit.ibid.the trial court dismissed the action,including the insurer complaint in intervention,on the ground the insured had failed to file the proof of service of summons in a timely manner.id.at.
the court of appeal reversed.the court held dismissal of the insurer intervention complaint was erroneous because the insurer,having timely intervened,was entitled to proceed with the lawsuit notwithstanding the insured failure to timely file the proof of service of summons.deutschmann,supra,d at.the court stated that to intervene under code of civil procedure section,the proposed intervener must have a direct interest in the success of one of the parties to the litigation or an interest against both of them.deutschmann,supra,at.it is clear under the facts of this case,the court concluded,that the insurer has a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation between plaintiff and respondent.ibid.the insurer was subrogated to the rights of the insured in the amount the insurer had paid the insured for the loss suffered,and a s such subrogee,the insurer may intervene in a pending action for damages brought by the insured.ibid.
while deutschmann does not state whether such intervention would be permissive or as of right,the case supports the proposition a subrogated insurer has an interest related to the transaction that is the subject of the underlying lawsuit.indeed,the deutschmann court recognized a subrogated insurer has a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation between the insured and the responsible third party.deutschmann,supra,d at.
relying on california physicians service superior court d.california physicians service,the hodges contend subrogation does not give the insurer an interest in the property or transaction that is the subject of the lawsuit in which intervention is sought.we disagree.in california physicians service,the trial court denied the motion of a health insurer to intervene in its insured medical malpractice action.the appellate court denied the insurer petition for writ of mandate,stating a cause of action in tort would not qualify as property under code of civil procedure section.california physicians service,supra,at.the insurer lack of subrogation rights was due to a provision of the civil code applicable to medical malpractice actions.d at fn,subd.b.because the insurer lacked a right of subrogation,its interest in the case was merely that of a creditor under the insurance contract and under a settlement agreement reached with the plaintiff.california physicians service,supra,d at.
in mylan laboratories th,d mylan laboratories,the court cited california physicians service for the proposition a tort cause of action does not qualify as property for purposes of intervention.mylan laboratories did not concern the intervention rights of a subrogated insurer.the issue in mylan laboratories was whether a nonparty desire to preserve the confidentiality of a memorandum and assert privileges qualified as an interest supporting intervention.id.at,d.the court held the memorandum did not constitute property which is the subject of the action under code of civil procedure section.mylan laboratories,supra,at,d.
here,in contrast to california physicians service and mylan laboratories,state farm has subrogation rights by operation of law and under the terms of the policy.state farm is not merely a creditor rather,state farm has stepped into the hodges shoes and,to the extent it has made payments under the policy,has the same rights as the hodges against the various defendants and tortfeasors in the construction defect lawsuit.as an insurance carrier with a right of partial subrogation,state farm has a direct pecuniary interest in the hodges action against the allegedly responsible third parties.
disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede ability to protect interest 
is state farm so situated that the disposition of the construction defect lawsuit may as a practical matter impair or impede state farm ability to protect its subrogation rights within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b yes.
it is the insurer duty to protect subrogation rights.mel rapton,supra,th at,d.it is generally acknowledged the insurer safest course to protect those rights is to seek intervention in the insured lawsuit against the legally responsible third party.plut,supra,th,d,citing cal.insurance law practice d,to.
intervention is the safest course because the other courses may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the insurer ability to protect its subrogation rights.in theory,there are two possible alternatives to subrogation a separate lawsuit against the responsible third party,or recoupment of payments directly out of the insured recovery from the responsible third party.plut,supra,th at,d mel rapton,supra,th at,d ferraro,supra,d at.thus,w here a subrogation provision exists,an insurer may recoup its payments directly from the tortfeasor or from the proceeds of the insured action against a tortfeasor.pacific gas electric superior court th,d.or,in a partial subrogation,t he insured retains the right to sue the responsible party for any loss not fully compensated by insurance,and the insurer has the right to sue the responsible party for the insurer loss in paying on the insurance policy.mel rapton,supra,th at,d.
both alternatives are,in practice,inadequate or inconsistent with the purpose of intervention.the first a second lawsuit against the responsible third or impedes the insurer ability to protect subrogation rights because the responsible third party can defeat the subrogated insurer lawsuit by asserting the defense of splitting a cause of action mel rapton,supra,th at,d.the rule against splitting a single cause of action prohibits a plaintiff from turning a single cause of action into the basis of several suits.id.at,d ferraro,supra,d at.a single cause of action arises when a single tortious act causes several items of property damage,while two causes of action arise when a single tortious act causes the plaintiff to suffer both personal injury and property damage mel rapton,supra,th at,d.
when,as here,the insurer partially compensates the insured for the loss,thereby becoming partially subrogated,the subrogation doctrine results in two or more parties having a right of action for recovery of damages based upon the same underlying cause of action.ferraro,supra,d at.see also mel rapton,supra,th at,d.the insured can sue the responsible party for any loss not fully compensated by insurance,and the insurer can sue the responsible party for the insurer loss in the amount paid on the insurance policy.mel rapton,supra,th at,d.
the hodges complaint alleges a single cause of action for property damage to their house.the construction defect lawsuit defendants therefore could defeat a separate lawsuit by state farm with a plea in abatement asserting state farm is splitting a cause of action.in that event,state farm,unable to intervene in the construction defect lawsuit,would be left with the second alternative of suing its own insureds.as explained below,that option is not practical.
the hodges assert filing a second lawsuit is a viable option for state farm because the construction defect lawsuit defendants waived the defense of splitting a cause of action by opposing state farm motion for leave to intervene.a defendant may waive the defense of splitting a cause of action h owever,a waiver generally arises when the tortfeasor has been sued in two actions and could have avoided the multiplicity of actions by bringing a plea in abatement in response to the second action while the first action was pending.mel rapton,supra,th at,d see also ferraro,supra,d at.t he defense that a plaintiff has split a cause of action is an affirmative defense,which must be pleaded by a defendant in abatement.it is not certain the actions construction defect lawsuit defendants in the insured lawsuit would necessarily be found to constitute a waiver of a defense in a second,yet unfiled,lawsuit by state farm.one of the four defendants resg,filed nothing in response to state farm motion.
waiver is an intensely factual determination.plut,supra,th at,d.the trial court in this case made no finding,express or implied,of waiver.as an appellate court,we decline to do so.
a subrogated insurer right to intervene should not depend on a predetermination whether the defense of splitting a cause of action will succeed it is enough the defense is available in a second lawsuit and may,in the statute words,as a practical matter impair or impede code civ,subd.b the subrogated insurer ability to protect its rights.denying the subrogated insurer the right to intervene because of the mere possibility the responsible third party might withhold or waive the defense of splitting a cause of action in a second lawsuit would give that third party the ability to force the insureds and the insurers to pursue their claims through two separate lawsuits.that result would defeat t he legislative purpose of code of civil procedure section,to reduce the burden on our already overcrowded dockets.deutschmann,supra,d at.
the second payments directly from the insured would,as a practical matter,impair or impede the insurer ability to protect its subrogation rights.this alternative might not be permissible although there is little california case authority regarding the status of an insurer subrogation rights when the insurer foregoes participating in the underlying action,the weight of foreign case authority supports the proposition that,in some circumstances,an insurer may recover funds paid to the insured by a legally responsible third party,even though the insurer did not participate in the insured legal action against the third party.plut,supra,th at,d,citing couch on insurance ed,d insurance.
assuming an insurer nonparticipation in the insured action does not,as a matter of law,preclude the insurer from recouping its payment to the insured from the insured recovery see plut,supra,th at,d,that procedure,as a practical matter,would impair or impede state farm ability to protect its interest.it is a general equita
