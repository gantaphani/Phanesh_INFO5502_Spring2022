sompo japan insurance,sompo,as an insurer subrogated to the rights of hitachi data systems corporation hds,brought this action against yusen air and sea service company yusen,nippon cargo airlines nca and pace air freight pace.it sought compensation for damage to computer equipment that the defendants transported from japan to hds indiana facility sompo settled its claims with yusen and pace,but nca proceeded to trial.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment against nca in the amount of plus costs.nca then timely filed this appeal,and sompo timely filed a cross appeal that challenged the district court denial of prejudgment interest.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court 
background 
hds purchased a number of computer parts from its manufacturer in japan.hds hired yusen to arrange for their transportation from tokyo to its facility in indiana.yusen contracted with nca to transport the parts by air from tokyo to chicago airport.hds separately retained pace to transport the goods from to indiana by truck.
on december,a portion of the shipment was damaged while the goods were in the process of being transferred from the loading dock to pace trucks at nca cargo facility at.the undisputed value of the damaged cargo was at least.sompo,a subrogated insurer,paid the insurance proceeds to hds and commenced litigation against pace,yusen and nca.before trial,however,sompo settled its claims against pace and yusen for and,respectively.
sompo then moved for summary judgment against nca,seeking recovery under the warsaw convention and montreal protocol.the warsaw convention establishes a ceiling on damages recoverable against an airline,limiting nca potential liability to special drawing rights sdrs per kilogram,or approximately.nca for summary judgment it sought a setoff of the sompo had received in settlements against the limited damages allowable under the warsaw convention.such a setoff,taken from the limited liability amount,would reduce any potential judgment against nca to.
the district court initially granted sompo motion for summary judgment,denied nca motion for summary judgment and entered judgment against nca for.after nca moved to amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e,the district court vacated the judgment.it conducted a bench trial and returned a verdict in favor of sompo.it held that nca was entitled to a setoff of the settlement amounts under illinois law,but the court nevertheless refused nca motion to apply the setoff against the limited liability amount established in the warsaw convention.rather,it applied the setoff against sompo total proven damages,reducing that amount to.the district court then entered judgment against nca in the amount of plus costs,the maximum amount allowable under the warsaw convention liability cap at the time of the judgment.
nca now seeks review of the district court decision to apply the setoff against the total amount of proven damages rather than its limited liability amount.sompo the court denial of prejudgment interest.
a.the warsaw and purpose 
the warsaw convention was the product of two international conferences that occurred between and,while the airline industry was in its infancy.the convention,largely a response to fears of airline carrier bankruptcy,had two primary goals to establish uniformity in the aviation industry regarding the procedural and substantive law applicable to claims arising out of international air travel and to limit air carriers potential liability in the event of an accident 
the warsaw convention set out a scheme for limiting an air carrier liability.it established a presumption of liability against the air carrier for accidents arising out of international air travel.warsaw convention.potential plaintiffs received the benefit of presumptive liability against the carrier,but they also were subject to certain affirmative defenses and a strict damages ceiling.the original convention set the liability cap at for personal injury and approximately per kilogram for damage to goods,thus protecting the airlines from the risk of catastrophic damages.
as the fledgling airline industry matured,it became clear that the liability limitations of the warsaw convention were far too low.largely at the insistence of the united states,the warsaw convention signatories reconvened in at the hague to amend the convention.see paul dempsey michael milde,international air carrier liability the montreal convention of,at.among other alterations,the hague protocol increased the liability cap to approximately for personal injuries.id.at.the united states ultimately refused to ratify the hague protocol,in part because it saw the amended liability cap as still too low.id.at.
recognizing the harsh results of the unamended warsaw convention for potential plaintiffs,in the united states gave notice of its denunciation of the convention.id.at.shortly before the denunciation was to take effect,however,a large number of private air carriers entered into an interim agreement,in which they voluntarily increased their personal injury liability limitation to.this voluntary action by the airlines became known as the montreal agreement consequently,the united states denunciation was withdrawn.
efforts to modernize the convention continued,and a number of different amendments,most notably the montreal protocols,were developed to address formally concerns about for plaintiffs.in,the united states ratified montreal protocol which raised the liability cap for damage to cargo to sdrs per kilogram.at the time of ratification,this equaled approximately per kilogram.id.at.the went into effect in the united states on march.
prior to,then,a complex interplay of conventions,treaties and domestic laws governed international air carrier liability.see dempsey milde,supra,at.the montreal convention not to be confused with the or montreal agreement was the product of a united nations effort to reform the warsaw convention so as to harmonize the hodgepodge of supplementary amendments and intercarrier agreements of which the warsaw convention system of liability consists.ehrlich american airlines,cir.in may,representatives of nations gathered in montreal,canada to negotiate and adopt a new treaty that would replace the warsaw convention.id.at the end of a conference,the delegates approved the montreal convention,and countries,including the united states,immediately signed the treaty.id.the new treaty unifies and replaces the system of liability that derives from the warsaw convention,explicitly recognizing the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of consumers in international carriage by air and the need for equitable compensation based on the principle of restitution.montreal convention,pmbl.it establishes strict liability for personal injury claims up to sdrs,and presumptive liability without limit above that amount.montreal convention.this convention seems to have reversed one of the premises of the original warsaw convention,which favored the airlines at the expense of consumers.ehrlich,at.nevertheless,the montreal convention did not alter the original warsaw convention goal of maintaining limited and predictable damage amounts for airlines.the united states senate ratified the treaty on july,and it entered into force on september.
in this case,the incident giving rise to sompo claim took place on december,the ratification of but several years before the montreal convention became effective in the united states.therefore,nca liability here is governed by the warsaw convention as amended by the,not by the new montreal convention.under article of the warsaw convention,nca is presumptively liable for any damage sustained to goods while they are in the airline custody.under article,however,nca potential liability is limited to sdrs per kilogram of damaged goods,or approximately in this case.
nca right to a setoff 
before trial,sompo settled its claims against both pace and yusen for and,respectively.nca claims that it is entitled to a setoff or,more precisely,a reduction in the judgment the extent of these settlement amounts.the district court held that a setoff was appropriate under the illinois joint tortfeasors contribution act jtca.comp.stat.c.we review such conclusions of law de novo.johnson west,cir.
relying on el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,d,sompo contends that the warsaw convention generally preempts any domestic contribution or setoff laws.el al indeed stands for the proposition that the warsaw convention preempts local law causes of action to the extent that they are inconsistent with the convention.el al,at.however,the convention preemption is not complete auxiliary issues not addressed by the convention,such as who may recover and for what harms they may be compensated,are left to domestic law.id.at.zicherman korean air lines,d holding that the question of whether loss of society damages may be recovered under the warsaw convention is an issue governed by domestic law.an air carrier right to a setoff or contribution from a joint tortfeasor is,similarly,incidental to the causes of action available under the convention and therefore not subject to its limited preemption.
sompo further submits that the convention contains its own setoff provision,which specifically preempts other domestic setoff or contribution laws.article states 
if an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which this convention relates,such servant or agent,if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment,shall be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which that carrier himself is entitled to invoke under article.
the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier,his servants and agents,in that case,shall not exceed the said limits.
warsaw convention as amended by,art.in sompo view,because article effectively allows an air carrier a setoff against its limitation amount for any payments made by its servants or agents,setoffs not mentioned in the provision,such as setoffs against codefendants who are not such servants or agents,are not permitted.consequently,sompo argues,nca can not seek a setoff because article would not allow such a setoff.
article simply is not a provision designed to deal with joint and several liability.it addresses whether an airline may effectively be held liable for damages above the convention liability cap because of judgments against its agents.see,reed wiser,cir examining the history of the and noting that the purpose of article was to prevent an end run around the liability limits in the convention.article fulfills the purpose of the convention by precluding suits against agents that could increase effectively the liability of the airlines.joint tortfeasors,whose money flows from different sources,are not the concern of article.
cases about preemption,such as el al,note the intent of the convention framers to create a uniform scheme of regulation for international air carriers.the convention concern with uniformity focuses on protecting the airlines from catastrophic judgments and ensuring them predictability in liability.el al,at.given the convention comprehensive scheme of liability rules and its textual emphasis on uniformity,the court would be hard put to conclude that the warsaw delegates meant to subject air carriers to the distinct,nonuniform liability rules of the individual signatory nations.the convention precludes both state causes of action and suits against agents because of their potential to erode the effectiveness of the treaty liability limitations.the airline relationship to joint tortfeasors is merely an auxiliary issue,however,and uniformity in this context is,under the scheme of the convention,less important.
the convention also contains a savings clause which specifically notes that n othing in this convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.warsaw convention,art.thus,it appears that the convention refused explicitly to preempt local contribution schemes.furthermore,preemption of state laws by treaty is generally disfavored.el al,at.stevens,dissenting a treaty,like an act of congress,should not be construed to preempt state law unless its intent to do is clear.medtronic,lohr,d.absent clear evidence of preemption,then,we decline to rule that state setoff and contribution laws are preempted by the warsaw convention.
having determined that the warsaw convention does not,by its own terms,address the issue,we must look to the law that would govern the parties setoff and contribution rights absent the convention.zicherman korean air lines,d.both parties agree that,in the absence of the convention,their dispute would be governed by illinois law therefore,we turn to an examination of illinois law regarding contribution and setoffs.
nca claims a right of setoff under the illinois joint tortfeasor contribution act jtca or contribution act.comp.stat.c.the jtca provides in pertinent part 
when a release is given in good faith to one or more persons liable in tort arising out of the same injury it reduces the recovery on any claim against the others to the extent of any amount stated in the release or in the amount of the consideration actually paid for it,whichever is greater.
id.the setoff is applied even if the resultant judgment is thereby reduced to zero dollars.pasquale speed prods.eng g.in order for the jtca to be applicable,however,both nca and pace must have been liable in tort for the same injury.comp.stat.c.both parties concede that the plaintiff here suffered a single,indivisible injury to its goods.their disagreement lies in whether both parties were liable in tort for the purposes of the jtca.
the purpose of the contribution act is to balance the equities between all culpable parties while ensuring that plaintiffs do not receive double recovery.doyle rhodes,pasquale,at.in furtherance of this purpose,the supreme court of illinois has construed liability in tort to mean potential tort liability,doyle,at,and the illinois courts have construed broadly this potential liability criterion illinois courts determine potential tort liability at the time of the injury to the plaintiff,not when the basis for liability is actually decided by the court.joe dan int l fid.guar,d.the jtca focuses,as it was intended to do,on the culpability of the parties rather than on the precise legal means by which the plaintiff is ultimately able to make each defendant compensate him for his loss.doyle,at.
sompo contends that the illinois statute is inapplicable here because neither pace nor nca was potentially liable in tort sompo complaint included claims against nca and pace under the warsaw convention and the carmack amendment,both of which provide their own cause of action.in support of its contention,sompo notes that illinois courts have looked to the pleadings to determine whether a party is potentially liable in tort although a party complaint is relevant,illinois courts consistently have held that the plaintiff own theory of liability is not conclusive for the purposes of the contribution act furthermore,even if its pleadings were considered dispositive,that fact would not help sompo here.sompo brought claims against nca and pace under the warsaw convention and the carmack amendment it also,however,chose to include negligence claims against nca and yusen in its original complaint and against pace in its amended complaint.under sompo own theory of liability,then,the defendants were potentially liable in tort.
sompo next submits that nca in fact never was potentially liable in tort because its claim arose under the warsaw convention,a federal liability scheme that has been held to preempt state tort claims in cases involving interstate carriers and a loss of goods.see el al,at.in its view,nca likely could have defeated a state law negligence claim by arguing that the warsaw convention provides the exclusive grounds for recovery against it.id.therefore,sompo argues,nca was not a potential tortfeasor for the purposes of the jtca.
the logic of the supreme court of illinois,expressed in doyle,is helpful to our analysis.in doyle,the defendant employer maintained that its statutory immunity under the illinois workers compensation act also immunized it from a contribution claim under the jtca because the state workers compensation act preempted other state law tort claims,the employer maintained that it had no potential liability in tort.id.at.the court rejected this argument,concluding that the defendant was potentially liable in tort at the time of the incident,even though any common law tort action ultimately would have been preempted by the workers compensation regime.id.at.it reasoned that,although preemption is a defense to any tort action brought by an employee for a incident,it is merely an affirmative defense,not an outright bar to liability.id.at.in its view,an employer could make the strategic decision to defend against an employee tort claim on its merits rather than invoke the protections of the workers compensation scheme,perhaps in the hopes that the jury would find the evidence of negligence lacking.in such a case,the employer legal exposure would be based on liability in tort.id.such potential liability was enough for the supreme court of illinois to find the jtca applicable.id 
the reasoning in doyle may be applied in this case.as we noted earlier,the warsaw convention preempts state tort laws to the extent that those state rules conflict with its own regulatory structure.see el al,at.t he convention preemptive effect is clear the treaty precludes passengers from bringing actions under local law when they can not establish air carrier liability under the treaty.however,this preemption is limited.article provides in the carriage of cargo,any action for damages,however founded,whether under this convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise,can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits of liability set out in this convention emphasis added.article expressly contemplates that an action may be brought in contract or in tort.the liability limitation provisions of the warsaw convention simply operate as an affirmative defense accordingly,the supreme court of illinois reasoning in doyle suggests that the limited preemption in the warsaw convention does not preclude the application of the jtca here.
although the parties do not reference it,we acknowledge that we previously have held that the jtca did not apply to a party sued under the carmack amendment because the federal statute preempt ed the field formerly occupied by common law theories of liability.american van lines pinkerton sec,cir.nevertheless,we found that decision to be consistent with the illinois supreme court analysis in doyle because,in north american,liability could be premised solely on the carmack amendment.the plaintiff there was foreclosed from suing in tort by the terms of the carmack amendment,which preempts the field formerly occupied by common law theories of liability.id.at.accordingly,there was no need for the defendant to plead the liability limitations in the carmack amendment as an affirmative defense the contract defined both its liability and the plaintiffs right to relief.id.at.
notably,we emphasized in north american that the carmack amendment was unique.id.at.it was intended by congress to be a law,establishing its own mechanism for contribution and relieving shippers of the burden of determining which of the several carriers handling interstate shipments bears the blame for loss or damage under diverse state laws.id.at.the warsaw convention,on the other hand,privileges the air carrier and provides it with a partial affirmative defense to claims by potential plaintiffs.unlike the carmack amendment,the warsaw convention does not have its own apportionment system,and it expressly contemplates the use of state law to fill in the interstices.see warsaw convention,art.a ny action for damages,however founded,whether under this convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise,can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits of liability set out in this convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.art.nothing in this convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.the warsaw convention therefore is particularly suited to the application of state setoff and contribution schemes.accordingly,the carmack amendment and the warsaw convention are distinguishable,and our application of doyle here is consistent with our prior opinion in north american.
furthermore,the two other circuit courts that have addressed the question have concluded that a right of setoff or contribution is available for the airlines in claims arising under the warsaw convention.see in re air crash at little rock,arkansas on june,cir examining the question of tortfeasor contribution under the warsaw convention,and directing the district court to allow the defendant airline to file a claim for contribution against the united states piamba cortes american airlines,cir assuming that a state law claim for contribution was proper under the warsaw convention.our conclusion that the warsaw convention is compatible with a state law contribution scheme,therefore,is consistent with the interpretation of other circuits.
although we conclude that a claim for liability under the warsaw convention is compatible with a claim for contribution or setoff under the jtca,our inquiry does not end there.a party seeking contribution or a right of setoff under the jtca must show that the plaintiff potentially had a cause of action sounding in tort against both the party seeking contribution and the party from whom contribution is sought.american,at emphasis added.to seek a setoff under the jtca,then,nca must show that sompo could have brought a claim sounding in tort against pace yusen as well as against the air carrier.sompo does not dispute that yusen was potentially liable in tort here accordingly,nca is entitled to a setoff of the yusen paid to sompo in the settlement.pace,however,was potentially liable only under the carmack amendment,a fact that,as we have already discussed,precludes nca from seeking a setoff of its payments under the jtca.see american,at.
even if pace is not a potential tortfeasor within the meaning of the jtca,however,nca can claim a setoff right based on illinois common law.see,maher chicago park,d,noting that the jtca is not the sole source of a setoff right,and a setoff right existed at common law hentze unverfehrt,d,holding that a right of setoff is implied in contract cases,even if not statutorily encompassed by the jtca johnson belleville radiologists,d,the provision for a setoff contained in the contribution act is not the source of the defendants right to a setoff it is merely a codification of that right.defendants were entitled to a setoff at common law.sompo does not dispute the existence of this common law right,and therefore we conclude that nca is entitled to a setoff of the entire settlement amount.
in sum,we hold that the illinois joint tortfeasors contribution act is not preempted by the warsaw convention,and that nca is entitled to a setoff of the entire amount of the settlement under the jtca and illinois common law.we next must determine whether the setoff should be taken from the capped judgment amount,reducing sompo award to zero,or from the total proven damages amount,granting sompo the maximum damages allowable under the convention.
to which amount does the setoff apply 
the district court found that the plaintiff in this case had sustained at least in proven damages.applying illinois contribution law,it then reduced that amount by,the amount that sompo had received from pace and yusen in settlements.the court therefore concluded that sompo was entitled to in damages.as the warsaw convention capped nca liability at,however,the district court awarded sompo only.
on appeal,nca contests the district court method of calculation.it submits that sompo settlement with pace and yusen instead should have been applied against the limited liability figure,effectively reducing nca liability to.sompo,on th
