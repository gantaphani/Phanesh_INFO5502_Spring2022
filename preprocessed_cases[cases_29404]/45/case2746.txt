appellant industrial trucking service itsc appeals from a trial court ruling denying its application for an order to show cause why its claim presented to respondent john garamendi,insurance commissioner of the state of california commissioner,should not be allowed in full.itsc is the successor in interest of an entity insured by mission insurance company mission in through a second excess policy.as the result of actions of its predecessor in dumping waste on land located in new jersey,itsc became embroiled in environmental cleanup litigation.itsc settled the litigation and then pursued the potentially liable insurers.in the meantime,mission became insolvent and the commissioner was appointed its liquidator.the commissioner,when presented with a claim based on mission proportionate share of liability less the liability of the primary and first excess carrier,denied it in part on the ground that there were two occurrences and mission liability did not attach until a million threshold had been reached for each occurrence.there was language in the policy which created an annual aggregate,but the commissioner determined it did not apply.
we conclude as a matter of law that the commissioner misread the policy,and that mission liability attached after the primary and first excess carrier paid or became liable to pay a total of million,no matter how many occurrences took place in the policy year.we therefore reverse.because this case came to us after denial of an application for an order to show cause without a show cause order having been issued,and because the commissioner claims there are matters that remain unsettled such as the right to raise new defenses to itsc claim in the trial court,we remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
underlying facts 
the basic facts are not in dispute.in the,itsc predecessor,industrial trucking service,owned and operated by rudolph kraus hauled waste generated by three separate companies to two parcels of land one a parcel situated mile south of new jersey state highway and one a parcel situated mile south of burlington county route,both located in woodland township,new jersey.although the precise timing is not clear,the parties are in agreement that kraus initially deposited waste on the parcel and then,when that parcel could no longer be used,began to dump waste on the parcel.
mission provided excess liability coverage to itsc for one year effective january.the policy stated that coverage was i n the amount of excess excess primary.a primary policy and a excess policy,both issued by transamerica insurance company transamerica,covered the same period.the parties agreed that the transamerica primary policy provided coverage in the amount of.the transamerica excess coverage policy provided this insurance is excess and the company shall not be liable for amounts in excess of for each accident in excess of the underlying limit of for each accident.the transamerica policy also stated that its limits of liability included million for each occurrence and million annual aggregate where applicable.
beginning in the,the three waste generating companies that had done business with itsc predecessor found themselves in litigation with the environmental protection agency epa and the new jersey department of environmental protection over cleanup and response costs for damage to the two parcels.they agreed to perform and pay for the removal and disposal of surface waste materials and contaminated soil,and to perform other remedial action.in,they brought suit against itsc and its parent,better materials corporation,to recover their costs 
itsc and better materials,in turn,sought defense and indemnity from the insurance companies that had provided liability policies during the period from to.the insurers rejected the claims,and in,itsc and better materials settled the waste generating companies suit on their own,agreeing to pay percent of response costs paid or to be incurred in the future the parties then caused a consent judgment to be entered.
prior to settlement,itsc and better materials had brought suit in new jersey district court against the former insurers.due to the insolvency of two of the insurers,including mission,the pennsylvania property and casualty insurance guaranty association ppciga and new jersey property liability insurance guaranty association were named defendants.the new jersey court entered partial summary judgment in favor of itsc and better materials,granting judgment in their favor on two affirmative defenses raised by the insurers that there was no occurrence as defined in the policies which gave rise to coverage and that the pollution exclusion clauses in the policies exclude coverage.itsc and ppciga entered into a partial settlement pertaining to mission share of liability which specified that it in no way release d any claims of any kind that itsc may have against any other persons,including any other liquidators of mission ppciga paid based on mission second excess policy,the same policy at issue here.
in march,itsc served a proof of claim on the california department of insurance.itsc allocated of total damages to mission.this number was derived from itsc liability per its settlement having allegedly reached million at the time the claim was filed.an allocation for each year between and was calculated by assigning a percentage risk to each year based on the total amount of insurance and place during the relevant period under this formula,for the year,the allocation for both parcels totaled,approximately percent.subtracting the million provided under the transamerica primary and first excess policies reduced mission share to.
the commissioner approved only of the claim,million less than the amount sought.that figure was calculated by subtracting the million payable under the transamerica primary and excess coverage policies twice,once for each parcel,and then deducting the paid by ppciga on behalf of mission.the commissioner letter specifically stated all bases to support the rejection are reserved,including,but not limited to.the damages when properly allocated over the years of exposure and number of sites do not support the full claimed amount.a portion of the claim was previously paid by the ppciga.the claim is aggregating two separate hazardous waste sites as one occurrence.all other bases for rejection or reduction of your claim are reserved,including,without limitation,the qualified pollution exclusion contained in the policy,of the losses should the court find a claim,to permit allocation of the losses among all involved policies,the right to credit for any recoveries from other carriers should the court find a covered claim the right to demonstrate that the policy claim is overstated,and all other rights granted by the policy,whether express or implied,which are all preserved.
proceedings in trial court 
in october,itsc filed an application for an order to show cause why its claims should not be allowed in full itsc argued that the two parcels of land should be treated as one occurrence because they were relatively close in proximity t he generators waste was disposed of at both locations by kraus as part of the same ongoing waste disposal operation b oth locations were the subject of one contribution action,the woodland action and the invoicing of the costs for the remedial effort did not distinguish between the sites.
the commissioner contended in the opposition to the application for order to show cause that under the purportedly applicable new jersey law,multiple cleanup sites are treated as multiple losses or occurrences for purposes of insurance coverage.treating the parcels as two occurrences,in conjunction with the commissioner interpretation of certain language in the mission policy that described when coverage attached,led to the commissioner decision to deduct million twice.the language at issue stated it is expressly agreed that liability shall attach to the company only after the underlying umbrella insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective ultimate net loss liability as follows as stated in item of the declarations ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence item of the declarations stated underlying umbrella limits insurance agreement ii excess primary.since primary coverage was,the commissioner reasoned that each occurrence is subject to exhaustion of of underlying coverage.itsc,however,had deducted only one underlying set of coverages,although there are two environmental sites involved.according to the opposition,t his wa s inappropriate,and resulted in an overstatement of the claims of the claimant.
in its reply,itsc argued that the cleanup involved only one occurrence under the express terms of the policy,the relevant principles of construction of insurance policies,and case law.itsc further contended that,even assuming there were two occurrences,the commissioner misinterpreted the policy language defining when mission coverage attached,which resulted in an improper double deduction of million.in itsc view,the underlying transamerica policy had an aggregate limit of liability for property damage claims,and the mission policy must respond once this aggregate limit is exhausted.in support,itsc quoted the following language from the transamerica excess coverage policy the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay for damages and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss,on account of i personal injury,ii property damage,iii advertising liability,to which this insurance applies caused by an occurrence anywhere.this obligation to pay was restricted by the following provision the limit of the company liability shall not exceed the amount stated in item a of the declarations as a result of any one occurrence.the company liability shall be further limited to the amount stated in item b of the declarations in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of this policy separately in respect of the products hazard the completed operations hazard personal injury by occupational disease sustained by any employees of the insured the rendering of or the failure to render during the policy period professional services by or on behalf of the named insured and insurance afforded under divisions ii and iii of paragraph coverage,property damage and advertising injury.items a and b set forth million as the limits of liability for each occurrence and for the annual aggregate,respectively.
based on this language,itsc argued e ven assuming for argument sake that there are two occurrences,the annual aggregate limit of the transamerica umbrella policy is million.once that amount is applied to the first site,the transamerica umbrella policy limit is exhausted and there is no amount that must be applied to the second site.the same analysis applies for the transamerica primary policy.in other words,the transamerica primary policy has a per occurrence and an annual aggregate limit of.thus,once that amount is allocated to one of the sites,this policy limit is exhausted.consequently,the limits of the mission policy apply immediately to the second parcel because the aggregate limits of the transamerica policies are exhausted.
according to itsc,this was a more reasonable reading of the mission policy because otherwise itsc could exhaust the million aggregate limit of the underlying transamerica policies for an occurrence which aggregate limit clearly exists for the reasons discussed above and then under the commissioner reasoning be required to pay million out of its own pocket on the next occurrence before reaching the mission coverage,creating a coverage gap.
turning to the language of the mission policy provision relied on by the commissioner it is expressly agreed that liability shall attach to the company only after the underlying umbrella insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective ultimate net loss liability as follows million excess primary ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence itsc pointed out that the sentence goes on to say but as stated in item of the declarations million in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of this policy separately in respect of products liability and in respect of occupational injury itsc argued that,through this language,the mission policy also recognized that there was a single million excess primary aggregate limit for each annual period during the currency of the policy for all the different types of covered claims,even though the provision only specifically mentioned products liability and occupational injury.as stated in its reply memorandum,this language does not mean that the aggregate limit in the transamerica policies exists only for these types of claims.rather,it means that there is a separate aggregate limit for these types of claims.
the trial court ruled in favor of the commissioner,and denied the application for order to show cause.the court found that the commissioner partial rejection of itsc application was neither an abuse of discretion nor an error of law.this appeal followed.
discussion 
ioccurrence issue 
the commissioner relied on two factors to reduce itsc claim the conclusion the damage caused to the two parcels in woodland,new jersey,by itsc predecessor dumping of waste materials represented two occurrences and the conclusion that the mission policy called for its liability for each and every occurrence to attach only after a theoretical million had been paid by the underlying insurer toward each occurrence,whether or not the underlying insurer was obligated to pay such amount.
with respect to number of occurrences,the commissioner cites authority from the field of environmental cleanup caldo oil state water resources control bd.th,d,norfolk southern california union ins.so d,and endicott johnson liberty mutual ins.in caldo,the court held that separate leaking underground storage tanks operated on adjacent parcels by the same company represented two occurrences for purposes of obtaining up to per occurrence reimbursement from the state water resources control board for corrective actions undertaken.in norfolk southern,supra,a case involving the cleanup of several sites in louisiana,two of which were contaminated at slightly different times as the result of wood preserving operations,the court held that a single occurrence took place in each policy period from to at the first site,and a single occurrence took place in each policy period from to at the other site.id.at.in endicott johnson,supra,property damage at the endicott landfill site triggered policies issued during the period to and property damage at the barrel site triggered policies issued during the period to.the issue before the court was whether plaintiff dumping at each waste site constituted one occurrence or multiple occurrences under the legal definition of occurrence in the insurance policies.id.at.
the commissioner takes the view that these cases stand for the existence of a rule that in all cases involving cleanup of two or more separate parcels,the damage to each parcel must be deemed a separate occurrence.this overlooks the holdings in the two most pertinent southern and endicott johnson.the courts determination in those cases that disposal of similar contaminants on two parcels of land represented two occurrences was based in part on the fact that the conduct took place during different time periods and triggered insurance policies issued during different years.here,the record indicates that,although kraus used each property for disposal purposes in different years,the same insurance policies were triggered and cleanup costs were intermingled.even the epa,in the reports relied on by the commissioner to support its two occurrence theory,described the cleanup progress in terms of the combined tons of contaminated waste materials removed from both the route and route sites and disposed of by the potentially responsible parties at an facility.italics added.because we conclude that the commissioner was incorrect in his interpretation of the annual aggregate provision,the number of occurrences is irrelevant at this juncture and we need not resolve the issue now.but should it be revived at a later point,its resolution would require a comprehensive discussion of whether the two sites can realistically be separated given what has transpired in the prior litigation and settlements.
annual aggregate issuea.standard of review 
the preliminary procedural issue which must be resolved is standard of review,an issue debated at length in the briefs.both sides agree that interpretation of insurance contract language generally presents a question of law to be reviewed de novo.see,in re first capital life ins.th,d.even where interpretation requires consideration of facts,if the facts are undisputed,the question presented is a legal one.see,state farm fire casualty elizabeth th,d when an insurance policy interpretation is based on stipulated evidence,the appeal from the judgment presents a question of law that is subject to our independent determination royal globe ins.whitaker d.the construction of the policy before us is one of law because it is based on stipulated evidence and the terms of the insurance contract.but the commissioner maintains that the abuse of discretion standard put forth in low golden eagle ins.th,d should govern our review in all aspects of this case.
we disagree.in low,a number of factual issues had been resolved by the commissioner,including whether the insured gave notice of the claim or suit as soon as practicable,whether it cooperated in the investigation,settlement,or defense of the claim or suit,and whether it made any voluntary payments.as the court of appeal noted there,our review of factual matters is highly deferential.th at,d,italics added.courts have expressed a different view when the commissioner decision is attacked on purely legal grounds.in quackenbush mission ins.th,d,the court stated a n administrative determination will be interfered with by the courts where the determination is based upon an error in law.citation.it is for the courts,not for administrative agencies,to lay down the governing principles of law.accordingly,questions of law are reviewable.id.at,d,quoting people ex rel.fund american companies california ins.d.accord,garamendi golden eagle ins.th,d.
here,with respect to the interpretation of the annual aggregate provision,the commissioner made a determination based solely on the language of the insurance policy,which was deemed to be plain and unambiguous.because the issue was resolved without consideration of any facts,it presents legal questions and we review it de novo.
choice of law 
although both sides seemingly agree that the law of new jersey where the land is located or pennsylvania where itsc did business and where the mission policy was issued should be applied,neither side cites controlling authority from those jurisdictions that differs from california law,apparently since none is to be found.the fact that two or more states are involved does not in itself indicate there is a conflict of laws problem.washington mutual bank superior court cal th,d.in order to persuade a california court to apply the law of another forum,the proponent of the other forum laws must invoke the law of the foreign jurisdiction,show that it materially differs from california law,and demonstrate how applying that law will further the interest of the foreign jurisdiction.id.at,d.otherwise,a california court will apply its own rules of decision.ibid.since the parties cite no conflicting authority from new jersey or pennsylvania,we will apply california law.
interpretation of the annual aggregate provision 
the rules governing policy interpretation require us to look first to the language of the policy in order to ascertain its plain meaning.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the plain meaning of policy language is the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,emphasis omitted the test is not what the insurer or its attorneys intended the policy to mean but what a reasonable person in the position of the insured would have understood the words to mean.although each term must be read in its ordinary and popular sense,it must also be interpreted in context and with regard to its intended function and the structure of the policy as a whole.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,quoting bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.one of the circumstances that may properly be considered is the existence and coverage limits of other insurance held by the insured.fibreboard hartford accident indemnity th,d because insured had separate product liability insurance,provision in a policy applying to claims arising out of premises or operations was construed as covering different risks.when a provision is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable,it will be deemed ambiguous.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins,supra,at,d.
once it is determined that a provision has no clear and unambiguous meaning,different rules come into play.ambiguous coverage clauses are to be interpreted to protect the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.aiu ins.superior court cal d,accord,bank of the west superior court cal th,d,courts are urged to apply a little common sense to determine which of two or more reasonable interpretations meets the objectively reasonable expectations of the party claiming coverage.paul fire marine ins.american dynasty surplus lines ins.th,d.
the next rule,which is applied only if neither of the above rules resolves the problem,is to interpret the ambiguous provision against the insurer.bank of the west,supra,cal th,d,finally,provisions that limit coverage must be conspicuous,plain and clear to be enforceable.de may interinsurance exchange th,d.
with these rules in mind,we plunge into the actual language of the policy.the mission policy describes the basic coverage provided as follows the company hereby agrees,subject to the limitations,terms and conditions hereinafter mentioned,to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability a imposed upon the insured by law,or b assumed under contract or agreement by the named insured any officer,director,stockholder,partner or employee of the named insured,while acting in his capacity as such,for damages on account of i personal injuries ii property damage iii advertising liability,caused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world,and arising out of the hazards covered by and as defined in the underlying umbrella policy ies stated in item of the declarations and issued by certain insurance companies hereinafter called the underlying umbrella insurers.italics added.item of the declarations identified transamerica as the issuer of the underlying umbrella policy.
the mission policy not only referenced the transamerica excess policy,it specifically adopted the majority of its terms.paragraph of the mission policy states this policy is subject to the same terms,definitions,exclusions and conditions except as regards the premium,the amount and limits of liability and except as otherwise provided herein as are contained in or as may be added to the underlying umbrella policy ies stated in item of the declarations prior to the happening of an occurrence for which claim is made hereunder.italics added.further,it was an express condition of the mission policy that the underlying umbrella policy ies shall be maintained in full effect during the currency hereof without reduction of coverage or limits except for any reduction of the aggregate limits contained therein solely by payment of claims in respect of accidents occurrences occurring during the period of this policy.failure of the named insured to comply with the foregoing shall not invalidate this policy but in the event of such failures,the company shall only be liable to the same extent as it would have been had the named insured complied with the same condition.
the provision that underlies the current dispute is contained under the heading limit of limits and appears to be an attempt to clarify both the amount of damages or loss that must be incurred before mission coverage attaches and the upper dollar limit on mission liability.as we have seen,this provision begins it is expressly agreed that liability shall attach to mission only after the underlying umbrella insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective ultimate net loss liability as follows as stated in item of the declarations million excess primary ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence,but as stated in item of the declarations million in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of this policy separately in respect of products liability and in respect of occupational injury.it goes on to say and mission shall then be liable to pay only the excess thereof up to a further as stated in item of the declarations million excess million excess primary ultimate net loss in all in respect of each to a limit of as stated in item of the declarations million in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of this policy,separately in respect of products liability and in respect of occupational injury.italics added.
as we have discussed,it was and is the commissioner position that the italicized portion of this provision,setting an aggregate annual floor of million excess primary before insurance attaches and an aggregate upper dollar limit on coverage of million,does not apply here because it refers specifically only to products liability and occupational injury claims,and the claim at issue is a real property damage claim.itsc contends that the italicized language does apply.in its view,the first italicized phrase should not be construed as saying that the underlying aggregate annual amount which,once reached,causes mission liability to attach,exists only for products liability and occupational injury but instead should be interpreted to mean that there is a separate aggregate annual limit for those types of claims.under itsc interpretation,it is implicit in this provision that mission liability attaches as soon as transamerica payments for any nonproduct injury types of claims covered by the policy,property damage,advertising injury,or nonoccupational personal injury,either singly or together,reach a total of million within one year.by the same token,under itsc theory,the second italicized phrase should be construed as placing a million upper limit on mission potential annual liability.
to support its position,the commissioner relies on the washington supreme court decision in weyerhaeuser commercial union insurance,the only case cited by the parties or found by our research where a similar provision in an excess policy has been interpreted.in that case,commercial union cu had issued a first excess policy insuring weyerhaeuser for the years to.the policy specified limits of in excess of the primary policy limits.id.at.the policy also contained the following provision under the heading limit of limits it is expressly agreed that liability shall attach to cu only after the underlying insurers have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of their respective ultimate net loss liability as follows ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence,but in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of this policy separately in respect of products liability and separately in respect of occupational injury.a nd cu shall then be liable to pay only the excess thereof up to a further ultimate net loss in all in respect of each to a limit of in the aggregate for each annual period during the currency of this policy,separately in respect of products liability and separately in respect of occupational injury.id.at,italics added,bracketed figures inserted by washington supreme court.
the issue in weyerhaeuser was how this language should be interpreted in the face of claims for the cleanup of dozens of sites,costing millions of dollars.in a motion for partial summary judgment brought by weyerhaeuser,the trial court had interpreted the italicized portion of the provision as providing no aggregate upper limit for property damage claims or losses,only a per occurrence limit.in other words,the trial court believed that cu had agreed to pay million per occurrence for an unlimited number of long as the claims or losses were not the result of products liability or occupational injury.at the same time,the underlying primary coverage policy provided by fireman fund specifically said that,the aggregate limit of fireman fund liability for all damages shall be as a result of all occurrences or accidents happening during the policy period.at.because of this language,the trial court applied only a single deduction for coverage under the primary policy,leaving cu to shoulder the rest of the monetary burden of up to million per occurrence.on appeal,cu sought either a reinterpretation of either the upper limit of its policy or a reinterpretation of when its coverage attached.
on the first issue,cu argued that the italicized language created three annual aggregate limits a general aggregate limit for all property than products liability and occupational injury an aggregate limit for products liability claims and an aggregate limit for occupational injury claims limiting its total exposure to million.weyerhaeuser,supra,at.the supreme court dismissed that interpretation because the figure million was nowhere expressly reflected in the policy language.id.at.without further analysis,the court agree d with the trial court that there is no ambiguity in this policy and that if cu had intended to place an aggregate limit on property damage it would have said so if there are multiple occurrences within an annual period the plain language of this policy does not limit the insured aggregate recovery for property damage or other types of loss aside from products liability and personal injury.ibid.
the court then turned to the issue of when cu coverage attached.as we have seen,the language of the underlying fireman fund policy clearly excluded coverage of any amount over.therefore,cu asked the court to examine language from its insurance policy to determine its right to offset the threshold exclusion for which weyerhaeuser agreed to provide underlying insurance or not weyerhaeuser successfully obtained that coverage.at.noting that the cu policy language describing when coverage attached was identical to the language that described when coverage ended,cu contended if cu has no aggregate limit for property damage,weyerhaeuser by virtue of the same be responsible for the first of each property damage claim also without aggregate limit.ibid.in other words,cu argue d the underlying aggregate exclusion clause should be given the same meaning as the supplemental aggregate limitation clause,thus entitling it to offset against each property damage claim notwithstanding the fact weyerhaeuser underlying fireman fund policy does in fact impose a aggregate limit on coverage to benefit its insured.ibid.
the court agreed that a fair,reasonable,and sensible construction compelled it to agree with cu that the two clauses of the same policy must have the same meaning.weyerhaeuser,supra,at.because the cu aggregate limits clause can not be read to provide an aggregate property damage limit on cu liability,the exclusion clause similarly limits cu liability to that in excess of per incident,no matter how many incidents.ibid.
four justices dissented in weyerhaeuser.the dissent began by stating that,the majority misunderstands the nature of excess liability insurance coverage.at,dis.opn.of talmadge.as the dissent explained,in the ordinary case,excess or umbrella coverages are designed to pick up where the primary insurance coverage leaves off,providing an excess layer of coverage above the limit of the primary policy,and protect against gaps in coverage.id.at.objecting to the majority characterization of the cu policy provision as unambiguous,the dissent insisted that it was ambiguous,and that the court should seek its meaning by referring to the commercial context in which the policy was sought,written,and purchased and give the provision a commercially reasonable construction.id.at.under the facts presented,t
