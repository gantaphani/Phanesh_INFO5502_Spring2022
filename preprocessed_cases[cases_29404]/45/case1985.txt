this insurance case arises out of a tragic accident in which a siberian tiger attacked and fatally injured haley hilderbrand,a high school student,during her senior picture photo shoot.the accident occurred on the property of keith and sharon billingsley,who used their farm to shelter exotic animals.the billingsleys ran the lost creek animal sanctuary,a foundation designed to rescue exotic animals,and animal entertainment productions,a partnership meant to fund the sanctuary by exhibiting the rescued animals at magic shows and other events.the tiger involved in the incident was one of the billingsleys rescued animals.at the time of the accident,the billingsleys held a homeowners insurance policy issued by safeco insurance company of america.
haley father,randy hilderbrand,brought suit against the billingsleys in state court,seeking monetary damages for haley wrongful death.the billingsleys claimed liability coverage from safeco.safeco then filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court,arguing it was not required to provide coverage to the billingsleys,because the incident arose out of the operation of a business,and the billingsleys homeowners policy contained an exclusion for business pursuits.after a bench trial on the merits,the district court concluded the insurance policy did not cover the incident in question.this appeal followed.
exercising jurisdiction under,we conclude the district court correctly applied kansas law to the insurance policy in question.the homeowners policy does not apply to the billingsleys exotic animal rescue and exhibition business,nor does any other exception in the policy apply to the facts of this case.
accordingly,we affirm.
background 
lost creek animal sanctuary 
the facts are largely undisputed.keith and sharon billingsley,along with their son doug billingsley,operated lost creek animal sanctuary on their kansas farm.the sanctuary sheltered a variety of exotic tigers,bears,lions,cougars,monkeys,and longer wanted by zoos or circuses.it was incorporated as a organization in,with the hope that it would be financed through donations.
donations,however,ultimately proved insufficient to maintain the sanctuary.in,the billingsleys created animal entertainment productions aep.aep was formed to generate income by exhibiting the sanctuary exotic animals in educational settings or entertainment events such as magic shows.aep was a general partnership by keith,sharon,and doug.to assure aep legitimacy as a business,the billingsleys obtained licenses from state and federal agencies to house and exhibit the animals.
doug received extensive training in animal handling.he spent time working with magic shows involving large cats,in both malaysia and on a cruise ship.he also worked in the lion habitat of the mgm grand casino in las vegas.at times,doug received a salary from aep,and engaged in substantial marketing efforts to obtain business for the partnership,even traveling to various locations to meet with potential customers.although not a large success,aep did produce a few performances,and occasionally leased its animals to other companies as a source of income.
in,aep received a small business administration sba loan in the amount of.those funds were used to purchase equipment,build a shop,and pay doug salary.in general,the billingsleys used income from other as keith and sharon full time jobs as social than income derived from aep,to service the loan.
aep filed tax returns indicating it always operated at a net loss,despite earning some income from shows and sales of animals and equipment.aep operating expenses always outweighed the income the partnership generated.keith,sharon,and doug also deducted aep losses on their personal tax returns.
august accident 
in august,haley hilderbrand,who had been volunteering at the sanctuary,asked to have her high school senior pictures taken with one of the large cats.the sanctuary had been used for this purpose before,so doug agreed to the photo shoot.he did not charge haley for the opportunity.doug selected one of the tigers,shaka,based on his assessment of the tiger mood and his knowledge of its past behavior.during the photo shoot,something went wrong.despite doug training as an animal handler,he lost control of the tiger.it attacked haley,and she later died from her injuries.
homeowners insurance policy 
while the billingsleys had at times carried business insurance for aep,no business insurance policy was in effect when the attack occurred.the billingsleys,however,did hold a safeco homeowners insurance policy in august.
the homeowners policy contained language excluding losses for business activities 
liability losses we do not cover 
coverage liability and coverage payments to others do not apply to bodily injury or property damage 
arising out of business pursuits of any insured 
this exclusion does not apply to 
activities which are ordinarily incident to pursuits.
business includes trade,profession or occupation.
at,italics in original 
the district court denied liability coverage under this provision.

business pursuits exclusion 
safeco contends it is not required to provide coverage because the incident in question arose out of a business pursuit of the insured.to defeat the exclusion,hilderbrand argues that aep had ceased to be a business pursuit under the policy before the accident.in his view,the billingsleys care of the animals had become more akin to a hobby,and therefore the exclusion should not apply.
to apply the business pursuits exclusion,kansas courts adopted a test overwhelmingly followed by other state courts.krings safeco ins,d.to constitute a business pursuit,there must be two elements first,continuity,and secondly,the profit motive.id.emphasis added.see also appleman on insurance,in general,business pursuits exception requires continuity consisting of customary engagement or stated occupation and profit motive requiring that activity be shown as a means of livelihood,gainful employment,means of earning a living,procuring subsistence or profit,commercial transactions or engagements.
as to the first element,there must be a customary engagement or a stated occupation.the second element requires a showing of such activity as a means of livelihood,gainful employment,means of earning a living,procuring subsistence or profit,commercial transactions or engagements.krings,at see also beck,at.
continuity 
kansas case law provides an instructive application of the continuity element.in krings safeco insurance,the insured was sued in his capacity as an officer on the board of a savings and loan association.at.as an officer,he received a small fee for each board meeting attended.he also invested a significant amount of his own money in company stock.id.the court concluded on these facts that the insured service as an officer was a regular activity engaged in with a profit motive and therefore a business pursuit that was excluded from coverage.id.at.and in amco insurance beck,the court addressed the situation of a who babysat for two or three days each week while on summer vacation.the court concluded the activity satisfied the element of continuity.at.
the activities of the billingsleys in operating aep meet the continuity requirement.during the period in question,doug held himself out to be a professional animal trainer.aep paid his salary,and the extensive training he received indicates that this was more than a mere hobby or occasional pursuit.also,although cert
