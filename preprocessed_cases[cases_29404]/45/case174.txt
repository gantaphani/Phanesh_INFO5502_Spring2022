when a dispute arose between the national casualty company and the first state insurance group over the amount of a reimbursement the former owed the latter under a reinsurance contract,the parties undertook to arbitrate it.during the arbitration proceedings,national casualty sought certain documents in discovery,but first state refused to produce them despite an order from the arbitration panel to do so.ultimately,the arbitrators reached a decision in first state favor despite first state failure to produce the desired documents.frustrated,national casualty brought suit in federal district court seeking to overturn the decision of the arbitration panel.the district judge denied all relief,and this appeal followed.we affirm.
background 
appellant national casualty and appellee first state were parties to a set of contracts under which national casualty served as a reinsurer to first state on a number of first state insurance obligations.the arbitration agreement and proceedings at issue in this case relate only to the reinsurance contracts,but the argument between the parties over their obligations under the reinsurance contracts will be more intelligible if we relate some background information relevant to the first state policies for which national casualty was the reinsurer.we use the term underlying policies to designate the policies first state issued to its insureds.the reinsurance contracts or simply the contracts will refer to the reinsurance contracts at issue in the case.there is no dispute over the facts,so we relate them as represented by the parties,with certain supplemental information gleaned from the record.
first state was required under the underlying policies to cover some portion of its insureds liability for asbestos liability claims the and firms typically exposed to these claims generally carry what is called operations insurance.where insurance for product liability claims is often at a fixed sum,operations insurance,by contrast,usually repays a certain maximum amount for each incident giving rise to liability.the coverage means that,if an insured had a given amount,for example,million,of liability,and first state offered coverage of,first state obligation to the insured could be determined only in light of the source of the liability.if the million in liability arose from one incident,first state would owe its amount only once,and pay,while if million was the insured total liability on three claims,first state would pay.under the policies at issue,therefore,first state would pay a smaller share of a given amount of a policyholder liability to third parties if that liability was based on a single incident,and a greater share if the underlying liability was based on multiple incidents.
national casualty was first state reinsurer for these policies.it was obligated to reimburse first state for some portion of the latter payments to its insureds.briefly put,the structure of the reinsurance contracts was such that,if first state settled its underlying claims on a basis,national casualty would reimburse it for a greater amount,and if it settled those claims on a basis,national casualty would pay less.
first state settled a number of contested claims under the underlying policies,and looked to national casualty for reimbursement.it asserted to national casualty that the underlying claims had been settled on a basis and that it was therefore entitled to a high level of reimbursement.national casualty,suspecting that first state had misrepresented the bases on which the underlying claims had been settled in an effort to maximize its reimbursement,compelled arbitration,as it was entitled to do under the contracts binding and mandatory arbitration clauses the parties selected an arbitration panel under the terms of their agreement,which permitted each side to choose one member of the panel,with a third panel member selected by the two unilaterally appointed members.
during the arbitration,national casualty requested that first state provide it with certain documents that detailed first state internal legal assessments of the claims for which it was requesting reinsurance payments.national casualty claimed that these documents,and these documents only,would reveal the basis on which first state had settled the underlying claims,and that production of the documents was therefore necessary in order to determine national casualty obligations to first state.the panel ordered first state to produce the documents,warning that,if it did not,the panel would draw whatever negative inferences it deemed appropriate.first state,claiming that the documents were privileged communications or attorney,declined to produce the documents out of fear,it said,of waiving any privilege in future dealings with its insureds.
national casualty immediately protested first state failure to produce the documents.it requested that the arbitration panel delay its hearings in order to give the parties time to brief the prejudicial effect of the withholding of the documents,but the panel denied the request.national casualty then filed a claim in the district court for the district of massachusetts,asking the court to enjoin further arbitral proceedings.while the claim before the district court was pending,the panel ruled in favor of first state,and national casualty paid first state the balance owed as determined by the panel.the issuance of a final order by the arbitration panel rendered national casualty initial claims for an injunction against continuation of the arbitration moot,but national casualty then amended its complaint.in the amended complaint,national casualty argued that the court should overturn the arbitration award in first state favor because first state failure to comply with the arbitration panel production order constituted a breach of contract,voiding the arbitration clause and terminating the arbitration panel jurisdiction.it also moved to have the district court vacate the arbitration panel award for procedural deficiencies under sections a and of the federal arbitration act faa,a.first state requested dismissal of the complaint,challenged the motion for vacatur,and moved for sanctions.the district court denied the motion to vacate and dismissed national casualty complaint,but declined first state request that it impose sanctions on national casualty.national casualty timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
on this appeal,national casualty urges that the district court was wrong to deny its motion to vacate under its various faa theories and to dismiss its breach of contract claim.we discuss each issue in turn.

national casualty limited its faa claims on the motion to vacate to claims of procedural irregularity.specifically,it claims that the award was procured by undue means in violation of section a,and that the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct under section a our review of the procedures that an arbitrator has implemented is,under the statute,extremely narrow.we turn now to identifying the scope of our review under each section and to evaluating the claims themselves.
arbitrator misconduct 
section a of the faa lists three separate grounds for vacatur it is appropriate w here the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.a.national casualty urges an argument based on the second ground it complains that the panel refused to hear pertinen
