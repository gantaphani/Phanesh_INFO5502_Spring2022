a bankrupt corporation which purportedly only existed as a shell through which personal injury claims were passed on to its insurer for resolution was sued for personal injury.pursuant to its reorganization plan,the action was submitted to its insurers,who provided a defense.when discovery was propounded to the corporation,the corporation attorney who had been provided by the insurers filed substantive responses to the discovery,but represented to the court that the responses could not be verified,as the corporation had no officer,director,employee,or agent who could verify the discovery responses.the personal injury plaintiff challenged the sufficiency of the discovery responses.the trial court agreed that,under the circumstances,no individual existed who could verify the responses,and,at the corporation request,simply deemed them verified.the plaintiff filed the instant writ petition,challenging the trial court order.
as we shall discuss,the law provides that an attorney can verify responses on behalf of a corporation,although such an act constitutes a limited waiver of the and work product privileges with respect to the identity of the sources of the information contained in the response.in this case,the attorney argued that she could not verify the discovery responses because the corporation was the holder of the privilege,but had no officer or director who could waive it.we conclude that the court could have directed that further effort be made to have a director elected or appointed on behalf of the corporation.it may,however,be that the corporation no longer exists and no director can be elected or appointed.if that is the case,we believe that the corporation privilege would be passed to its insurers,the de facto assignee of its policies and the claims against them.we will therefore grant plaintiff petition for a writ of mandate and remand for further proceedings on the issue.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs and petitioners mary melendrez,individually and as personal representative of the estate of lario david melendrez mario melendrez phillip melendrez david melendrez and veronica pueyo collectively,melendrez brought the instant wrongful death action against numerous entities,including respondent special electric company,seco,alleging that the decedent died of mesothelioma as the result of exposure to asbestos seco was alleged to be liable as a manufacturer and supplier of crocidolite mats,and as a supplier of raw crocidolite asbestos.
in,years prior to the action being filed,seco filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.as described by one of seco attorneys,attorney amber lee kelly,i n,the bankruptcy court approved seco second amended plan of reorganization,which reduced seco to a shell for the sole purpose of processing asbestos lawsuits.italics added.pursuant to the reorganization plan,a registered agent was appointed for the service of asbestos claims,who was required to forward those claims to seco insurers.the insurers,in turn,were required to defend settle the claims in accordance with and in a manner consistent with the language of the applicable i nsurance p olicies and applicable state law.as we shall discuss,this was not the sole term of the reorganization plan.it also provided that an unsecured creditors trust would be created to hold and liquidate seco assets,apart from,inter alia,its insurance policies.it further provided that the existing owners of outstanding common stock in seco retained those interests and that,if any assets remained after termination of the unsecured creditors trust,those assets would be deemed transferred to the holders of those interests.one john erato,who was,in some way,affiliated with seco,served as seco director and president.
in any event,melendrez complaint was defended on behalf of seco by its insurers,as provided in the reorganization plan.counsel was retained by the insurers to represent seco for the purpose of providing such defense.
on december,melendrez served seco counsel with requests for admission rfas pursuant to the provisions in code of civil procedure,section,et the rfas sought admission of many facts the admission of which would result in a judgment in melendrez favor counsel for seco prepared a response which contained objections,denials,and statements of inability to admit or deny after reasonable investigation.the response was signed by counsel,but unverified.
as caselaw provides that an unverified response is tantamount to no response at all allen pacific,superior court th appleton superior court d,melendrez moved under section,subdivision b for an order deeming the matters specified in the rfas admitted.
seco opposed the motion on the basis that it was impossible for seco to verify the response,due to its lack of officers,directors,employees,and agents.section,subdivision b provides that,if the party responding to rfas is a corporation,one of its officers or agents shall sign the response under oath on behalf of that party.seco submitted a declaration of attorney kelly explaining seco history,its bankruptcy,and its lack of directors,officers or employees.attorney kelly declared that john erato,who had served as director and president of seco,had resigned,effective november,leaving seco with no officers,directors,employees,or agents 
in seco opposition to the motion to deem the rfas admitted,seco acknowledged that section,subdivision b provides that the agent signing on behalf of a corporation can be an attorney acting in that capacity for the party.however,when an attorney verifies the response,the party waives any privilege and any protection for work product during any subsequent discovery from that attorney concerning the identity of the sources of the information contained in the response.italics added.seco argued that it could not be compelled by the court to waive the privilege,and noted that it had no officer or director who could waive the privilege and authorize defense counsel to sign verifications.
seco acknowledged that there were two purposes to a verification first,to made the discovery responses admissible second,to provide a witness who could testify concerning the sources for the discovery responses.as to the first purpose,seco offered to stipulate that its responses would be admissible against it at trial.as to the second purpose,seco argued that,since it had no employees or agents who could be deposed,nothing could be gained by a verification.
at the hearing on the motion,the issue arose as to the basis on which seco denied several of the rfas.seco counsel explained that,in the past,when seco had employees,information was gathered through depositions and communications.counsel based seco denials on the information already in its possession.counsel represented that it could provide this information in response to other discovery requests.the court suggested that melendrez proceed by means of form interrogatory.concluding that no one could verify the rfa response,the court denied the motion to deem the rfas admitted,and instead deemed the response verified by seco 
five days later,melendrez served seco with form interrogatory,which asks,with respect to each rfa not unqualifiedly admitted,for the facts upon which the response is based the names and contact information of all persons with knowledge of those facts the identity of all documents and tangible things that support the response and the contact information of the persons in possession of the documents and things.
as they had promised,seco attorneys provided a substantive response to the interrogatory counsel identified specific facts which supported seco denials of the rfas many individuals who have or had,in the case of deceased individuals knowledge of the facts cases in which those individuals gave relevant deposition testimony and several other documents which also supported their denials.the interrogatory response was,as with the rfa response,signed by counsel,but not verified.
melendrez moved for an order compelling seco to provide a verified response.in the alternative,melendrez sought an order authorizing it to depose seco attorney who had signed the response.
seco opposed the motion,arguing,as it had before,that it had no officer or agent to verify the response as before,seco acknowledged that the law provides that an attorney may verify the response,but to do so works a limited waiver of the privilege,subd.b.seco again argued that it had no officer or director who could waive the privilege and authorize defense counsel to sign verifications.seco again offered to stipulate that the responses would be admissible against it.
after a hearing,the court denied the motion and deemed the responses verified.at the hearing,there was some dispute regarding whether melendrez counsel had possession of the deposition transcripts referenced in the interrogatory response the court ordered the transcripts,and other documents in seco counsel possession,to be provided to melendrez counsel.at the close of the hearing,the trial court stated to melendrez counsel you will get those documents,and if you find out there something different,i will be sitting here ready to do whatever needs to be done.melendrez counsel responded,and i very much appreciate that,but i will never know if i got all the documents because nobody is under oath.
melendrez filed a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the trial court rulings deeming verified the responses to the rfas and the form interrogatory.we issued an order to show cause.while the matter was pending,seco sought judicial notice of an official document indicating that seco was administratively or involuntarily dissolved,effective september.we have granted that motion for judicial notice.
issue presented 
while the parties did not initially focus on the issue,it appears that seco attorney is both a an agent of seco and b the individual with the knowledge necessary to verify seco responses.seco counsel argues that it can not verify the responses because an attorney verification effects a limited waiver of the privilege,and that seco counsel must assert the privilege on behalf of its client.seco counsel further argues that seco has no officer or director who could waive the privilege and permit its attorney to verify the responses.while all of that may be true,the real issue raised by this case is who can waive the privilege on behalf of a dissolved corporation with no officers,directors,or employees it may be that,although seco had no officers or directors,a means may have existed by which a director could have been elected or appointed.if that is not the case,we believe that the privilege,in the somewhat unique circumstances of this case,would have passed to seco insurers.
discussion 
we first discuss the verification requirement and the limited waiver of the privileges set forth in the governing statutory provisions.second,we turn to the issue of the applicable privileges and their holders.finally,we apply that law to the facts of this case.
the verification requirement and the limited waiver 
we are concerned with both rfas and interrogatories.as noted above,responses to both types of discovery,other than those containing only objections,must be signed by the responding party under oath,subd.a,subd.a.the applicable statutes provide,identically,if that party is a public or private corporation,or a partnership,association,or governmental agency,one of its officers or agents shall sign the response under oath on behalf of that party,subd.b,subd.b.
an attorney can not verify a response on behalf of an individual party.brigante huang th.however,an attorney may verify a response as officer or agent of a corporate party,subd.b,subd.b.doing so,however,will constitute a limited waiver of the and work product privileges,during any subsequent discovery from that attorney concerning the identity of the sources of the information contained in the response,subd.b,subd.b.
the reason for this waiver should be obvious.as a general matter,when an individual verifies discovery responses,further discovery can be directed to that individual to determine the sources for the initial responses.indeed,seco conceded this is one of the purposes of a verification of a discovery response,and melendrez pursued this course by following the rfas with form interrogatory.but if an attorney verifies the initial discovery response without a corresponding limited waiver of the privileges,the attorney can frustrate discovery by simply asserting those privileges indeed,when the limited privilege waiver was enacted as part of the civil discovery act of,the reporter note to the state bar judicial council joint commission on discovery explained,frequently,the one signing on behalf of an organization is either the attorney of the party in the action or someone on the organization legal staff.this practice invites assertion of the privilege and the work product protection when the party who requested the admissions tries to learn the sources of any information in the response.the commission concluded that it should be made clear that neither this privilege nor the work product protection may be claimed when that party tries to explore the sources of the information used by the attorney in preparing the response.state bar judicial council joint commission on discovery,proposed civil discovery act of.
we note that,in its briefs in the instant writ proceeding,seco argues that waiver of privilege is a slippery slope.once there is a waiver,it is difficult to confine it.requiring attorneys for seco to verify the discovery responses has every potential to infringe on protected communications in this case,and all future cases.we respectfully disagree.the applicable statutes narrowly circumscribe the waiver the privileges are only waived during any subsequent discovery from the attorney concerning the identity of the sources of the information contained in the response.the statutes do not provide for or permit lengthy further discovery from a verifying attorney.indeed,there is no indication that a deposition of the verifying attorney would ever be necessary in any particular case nor is there any reason to believe that a trial court would not promptly and properly limit any such further discovery directed to the verifying attorney.
the holder of the privileges 
at issue in this case are the work product and privileges.any concerns regarding the ability to waive the work product privilege are easily addressed.the attorney,not the client,is the exclusive holder of the work product privilege.state comp.ins.fund superior court th.thus,the attorney can waive the work product privilege without the consent of the client.
the privilege,however,is held by the client,subd.a.an attorney who received or made a privileged communication is required to claim the privilege whenever the communication is sought to be disclosed and the attorney is authorized to claim the privilege.the attorney,in turn,is authorized to claim the privilege unless there is no holder of the privilege or the attorney is instructed by the holder to permit disclosure,subd.c.
while it is true that the privilege is generally held by the client,this is not always the case.consider the case of an individual client who is deceased.initially,if the client is dead,the personal representative of the client becomes the holder of the privilege,subd.c.however,once the client estate is distributed and the personal representative is discharged,the privilege is terminated.hlc properties,superior court cal th.
we are concerned in this matter with a corporate client.as a general matter,the power to assert and waive the privilege held by a corporation belongs to corporate management and is normally exercised by the corporation officers and directors.venture law group superior court th.in considering the holder of the privilege of a corporation no longer in operation,it is important to recognize the distinction between a dissolved corporation,and one no longer in existence.if the corporation is dissolved,it continues to exist for the limited purposes of winding up.reilly greenwald hoffman,llp th,reilly.because it continues in existence,not unlike the personal representative of an individual client who has died citation,it would appear the persons authorized to act on the dissolved corporation beha
