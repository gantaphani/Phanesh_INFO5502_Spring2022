backgrounda.
agency is a cooperative that was formed by school districts in illinois to provide insurance for those districts.in,east moline school district,one of agency members,was sued by a student and his family after the student brought mercury home from school.east moline had a general liability insurance policy issued by agency and therefore filed a claim under that policy for coverage of its costs and attorney fees in defending the mercury lawsuit.agency administrator,the martin boyer company,determined that the policy covered east moline claim.agency therefore began paying for east moline defense and continued to do so for the next two years.in,agency retained a new administrator.the new administrator determined that east moline claim actually was not covered by the general liability policy.based on that determination,agency stopped paying east moline defense costs.
east moline ultimately settled the mercury suit.it then sued agency to recover the defense costs it had incurred after agency stopped paying.in that suit,east moline advanced three claims that agency refusal to pay the claim violated section of the illinois insurance code,which requires insurers to act in good faith the section claim that agency had waived its right to assert a defense under the general liability policy the waiver claim and that agency was estopped from denying that it was obliged to pay for east moline defense the estoppel claim.agency prevailed on all of the claims.
agency then filed an action in illinois state court against martin boyer,its former administrator.in that action,agency advanced a number of claims related to boyer determination that the general liability policy required agency to pay east moline costs in defending the mercury lawsuit.
agency had an errors and omissions e o insurance policy issued by pacific.agency filed a claim under this e o policy for reimbursement of the costs and attorney fees it had incurred in defending the suit for defense costs by east moline.pacific denied agency claim.agency then brought this action in the united states district court for the central district of illinois it sought reimbursement for its costs in defending the east moline suit as well as for its costs and fees in its suit against martin boyer.after discovery,agency and pacific each filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted partial summary judgment to agency it concluded that the e o policy required pacific to reimburse agency for its expenses in defending against east moline section claim.the court concluded,however,that the insurance policy did not cover east moline waiver and estoppel claims,and it granted summary judgment for pacific on those claims.with agency consent,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of pacific on the claims related to the martin boyer lawsuit.
the district court then held a bench trial to determine agency damages on the section claim.the court found that agency spent defending against that claim.the court entered judgment against pacific in that amount.
agency then filed its first appeal to this court.in that appeal,agency sought review of the district court grant of summary judgment against it on the estoppel claim.pacific did not file any appeal.on agency appeal,we reversed the grant of summary judgment for pacific on the estoppel claim.see.sch.dist.agency pac.ins,cir.we noted that,under illinois law,there were two kinds of estoppel that east moline could have raised against agency equitable estoppel and contractual estoppel.we interpreted the e o policy to require pacific to reimburse agency for its costs in defending against an equitable estoppel claim but not against a contractual estoppel claim.because it was unclear from the record whether east moline estoppel claim had been equitable or contractual,we vacated the grant of summary judgment on that claim and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.
on remand,the district court held a second bench trial to determine the nature of east moline estoppel claim.the court concluded that east moline had raised both equitable and contractual estoppel claims and that,according to our decision on agency first appeal,agency was entitled to reimbursement of the funds it had spent defending against the equitable estoppel claim.the court did not make a finding as to the amount of damages at that time.
meanwhile,agency suit against martin boyer was proceeding in state court.that suit ended with a judgment in agency favor in the amount of plus interest.in late the district court had ruled against pacific on the estoppel claim in agency suit,but before the district court had determined boyer paid agency to satisfy the judgment.
pacific then filed a motion for summary judgment.pacific argued that the judgment recovered by agency from martin boyer fully compensated agency for its costs in defending the east moline suit.in its view,because both the martin boyer suit and the pacific suit sought damages for the same,agency costs and fees in defending the east moline now had been made whole and therefore could not prove any damages in its suit against pacific.because damages are an essential element of a claim for breach of contract,pacific argued that it was entitled to summary judgment.
the district court agreed that the martin boyer judgment fully compensated agency for the costs and fees it had incurred in defending against east moline claims and that agency therefore could not prove any damages in its suit against pacific.accordingly,it granted pacific motion for summary judgment.agency filed a notice of appeal on march.
on april,the district court entered a second amended judgment that reiterated the award to agency on the section claim and awarded in costs to pacific on the estoppel claim.pacific then filed a rule motion to correct the second amended judgment,in which it argued that the award to agency on the section claim should have been omitted from that judgment because t he november,judgment had been previously by the seventh circuit court of appeals and this court opinion on february,granting summary judgment.at.without waiting for agency response,the court granted the motion and issued an amended judgment on april.that judgment granted summary judgment only to pacific it omitted any mention of summary judgment in agency favor on the section claim,and it also omitted mention of the award to agency.agency appealed from that judgment as well agency two appeals have been consolidated.
