this case arises from a dispute between appellant royal maccabees life insurance company and appellee rita foisy,who purchased an annuity policy from maccabees.foisy received sixty months of annuity payments,but claims that under the terms of the policy,she was entitled to lifetime payments.maccabees disagrees,contending that the policy she purchased provides only the sixty months of benefits and nothing further.foisy filed suit in massachusetts state court,and maccabees removed to federal court on the basis of diversity a jury trial resulted in a verdict for foisy on claims of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.on appeal,maccabees challenges the timeliness of foisy action and the evidentiary basis for the jury verdict.we affirm the district court on all counts.
background 
in,year old rita foisy consulted her,gerald healy,about how she might use received from her late husband life insurance to secure an income stream for herself.healy,an independent licensed insurance broker and credentialed financial consultant,agreed to research annuity products on her behalf.healy contacted bader insurance agency with whom he had an established business relationship for information on annuity policies.bader,in turn,contacted maccabees.
in response to bader inquiry,maccabees provided three illustrations of annuity policies for foisy,each detailing a different scenario available for a premium.bader passed the illustrations on to healy,who then met with foisy to explain the various policy options.foisy elected what both she and healy believed to be an annuity that provided lifetime monthly payments of,including a guaranteed minimum of payments totaling.healy and foisy understood that should foisy die before the minimum payments,her beneficiary received the remainder of the guaranteed sum if foisy died after the minimum payments,the annuity would simply cease with her death and there would be no payment to the beneficiary.healy filled out the portion of the annuity application reserved for writing agents and in the process applied for an agent license from maccabees,foisy signed the application,and the monthly payments began in may.
foisy received exactly the benefits she expected until,in the fall of,she began bouncing checks and discovered that the annuity payments that had been deposited directly into her checking account had stopped in may.when healy contacted maccabees on her behalf the company maintained that foisy policy provided only monthly payments,nothing thereafter,and that the provisions of the contract had thus been fulfilled 
healy efforts to persuade maccabees that the policy provided lifetime benefits failed,and foisy subsequently filed suit.she received a jury verdict in her favor on counts of breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation,and was awarded damages of and,respectively.although maccabees pled the statute of limitations as a defense,at the close of evidence the district court determined as a matter of law that foisy claims were timely,and thus the jury did not consider any limitations issues.the district court denied maccabees motions for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative a new trial.
maccabees appeals the district court judgment on multiple grounds.first,the company objects to the court decision on the statute of limitations,arguing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the claims were barred or,at a minimum,the jury should have decided the limitations question.second,with respect to the contract claim,maccabees contests the district court decision to allow the jury to interpret disputed language in the policy.according to maccabees,the contract was unambiguous and should have been interpreted in its favor by the judge.the company further claims that,in any event,the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of breach.third,maccabees attacks the evidentiary basis for the negligent misrepresentation verdict,claiming that there is no support for the jury finding that healy was maccabees agent and that foisy reasonably relied on healy statements.
maccabees bears a heavy burden in seeking relief from the judgment below.in reviewing a denial of judgment as a matter of law,we examine the evidence in favor of foisy,the party.marrero goya of puerto rico,cir.although our review of the court decision is plenary,our scrutiny of the jury verdict is tightly circumscribed we will reverse only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.white new hampshire dep t of corrections,cir.
we review denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion,a similarly stringent standard which recognizes that a district court should grant such a motion only if the verdict is against the demonstrable weight of the credible evidence or results in a blatant miscarriage of justice.sanchez puerto rico oil,cir.
ii.statute of limitations 
maccabees asserts that the statute of limitations began to run on both claims when foisy purchased the policy in april.according to the company,the limitations period for contract claims and limitations period for negligent misrepresentation claims had passed by the time foisy filed suit in march.
under massachusetts law,which applies in this diversity case,contract claims generally accrue at breach.saenger org.nationwide ins.licensing,cir.similarly,tort claims accrue at the time of injury.tagliente himmer,cir.under the massachusetts discovery rule,however,a claim will not accrue until the plaintiff knows of the cause of action or should have known of the cause of action.riley presnell.
we are unpersuaded by maccabees argument that our decision in loguidice metro.life ins,cir,requires us to find that foisy had knowledge of her claims as far back as.in loguidice,despite a sympathetic factual background in which an unsavory insurance agent misled the plaintiff into believing she purchased a retirement plan when in fact she purchased life insurance,we held that the claims were barred because the language of the policy clearly indicated it was life insurance,thus putting the plaintiff on inquiry notice of her claim.see id.at.here,however,because the language in maccabees policy is ambiguous,see infra at,foisy could not be expected to have had knowledge of a particular construction of the policy.
for the same reason,maccabees reliance on quigley unum life ins,is misplaced.the quigley plaintiffs contract and negligent misrepresentation claims were barred because the contract coverage was ascertainable had the plaintiffs performed annuity calculations.maccabees suggests that,a fortiori,the relative simplicity of the maccabees policy requires a finding that foisy should have known that she purchased a policy different from what she intended.maccabees,however,confuses brevity with clarity.it is the policy by the relatively short made foisy claim unknowable until.
even absent a favorable ruling on its motion for judgment as a matter of law,maccabees contends that,at the very least,the question of accrual was for the jury to decide.see taygeta varian,in most instances,the question when a plaintiff knew or should have known of its cause of action is one of fact that will be decided by the trier of fact.having been deprived of jury consideration on a material issue,maccabees argues it is entitled to a new trial.acknowledging that the court decision to rule on the issue as a matter of law was a close call,we nevertheless affirm.in light of the jury verdict,that decision was at worst harmless error.
since the jury found that the contract was a life verdict which we uphold,see infra at could be no breach,and therefore no accrual of the contract claim,until after may,when maccabees stopped making monthly payments.the contract action,filed two years later,was thus timely.although the negligent misrepresentation claim deserves slightly more attention,in the end foisy prevails here as well.
under the massachusetts discovery rule,the limitations period on a tort claim will not commence until a plaintiff is able to recognize some causal connection between the defendant actions and her injury.see,szymanski boston mut.life ins.in other words,foisy claim
