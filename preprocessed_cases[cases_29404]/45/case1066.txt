after suffering severe injuries in an automobile accident,stefanie shields brought a declaratory action against her two insurers,government employees hospital association,geha and state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm.geha initially paid significant sums for shields medical treatment,while state farm paid nothing due to a clause in its policy.later,however,geha demanded reimbursement from the proceeds that shields had received in a tort settlement as a result of the accident.shields subsequently brought this declaratory action to challenge the validity of geha demand for reimbursement or,alternatively,to require state farm to replace the amount that she would lose as a result of geha reimbursement claim.
shields latter argument prevailed.the district court,however,awarded only a portion of the attorney fees and none of the penalty interest sought by shields.specifically,the court allowed fees only with respect to shields claim against state farm,excluding her claim against geha.the court,moreover,declined to grant shields any penalty interest because she had failed to establish precisely when state farm obligation to pay her became overdue.shields appeal is limited to the district court and determinations.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the underlying facts are undisputed,as this court noted in state farm earlier appeal in this matter.shields gov t employees hosp,cir.briefly summarized,shields was severely injured in an automobile accident in february of.id.a piece of steel fell from the back of a truck and crashed into her car,causing shields extensive medical injuries.id.at the time of the accident,shields was covered by both her mother benefit plan with geha and by her mother automobile insurance policy with state farm.id.the state farm policy coverage for medical expenses and lost wages,however,was coordinated.id.this meant that,in exchange for a lesser premium,the policy benefits payable by state farm were subject to reduction by any amount paid or payable to shields under any other individual,blanket or group accident or disability insurance.id.
geha paid in benefits to cover shields medical expenses.because geha provides insurance for federal employees under the federal employees health benefits act,it is authorized to seek reimbursement from funds paid to a claimant out of a related tort recovery.id.at.although seeking reimbursement from a claimant is contrary to the provisions of michigan no fault insurance act mnfia,federal law preempts michigan statutory scheme.id.shields ultimately obtained a settlement pursuant to her tort claim against the trucking company involved in her accident.id.at.neither the amount nor the date of the settlement are set forth in the record.on april,geha filed notice of its lien against any settlement that shields might obtain.shields,in turn,sent a demand letter on may,seeking payment from state farm for all of her medical expenses that geha had initially covered.
procedural background 
in june of,shields filed a lawsuit in federal district court against both geha and state farm.jurisdiction was based upon diversity of citizenship.this court,in ruling on state farm separate appeal from the district court summary judgment order,described shields suit as simply seeking to clarify all parties obligations.id.at.according to state farm,however,shields took the position that geha was not entitled to reimbursement or alternatively that geha must seek payment directly from state farm.shields agrees that she took a position questioning the legitimacy of geha right to seek repayment.in the alternative,shields sought a decision that state farm was ultimately liable for the same medical expenses for which geha paid and should have paid her.geha,state farm,and shields all filed motions for summary judgment.
the district court ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of geha,granted shields motion for summary judgment as against state farm,and denied state farm motion.essentially,the court held that geha had properly sought reimbursement out of shields tort recovery,and that this reimbursement triggered state farm obligation to pay shields under the latter coordinated policy.the court explained that state farm may not subtract the amount initially paid by geha for shield medical expenses,and repaid by shields,from the insurance benefits it would otherwise be responsible for paying.moreover,the district court summary judgment order provided that shields was entitled to recover attorney fees and penalty interest on state farm overdue payment.state farm appealed the merits of the district court summary judgment order,but did not address fees or interest.shields,at.in june of,this court issued an opinion affirming the district court summary judgment disposition.id.at.
during the pendency of state farm merits appeal,shields filed a petition for the payment of in itemized attorney fees and in penalty interest.geha filed a motion opposing shields petition,but state farm did not.the district court granted only the portion of shields itemized fees that it determined were attributable to her claims against state farm alone,and awarded just half of the fees that were attributable to shields claims against geha and state farm jointly.in total,the court awarded shields in attorney fees.regarding penalty interest,the district court awarded nothing at all because,based on the information provided by shields,it was impossible for the court to determine when state farm became liable,and therefore,when it became dilatory.shields subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.the sole issues in the present appeal concern the district court determinations regarding attorney fees and penalty interest.

entitlement to attorney fees under 
michigan law provides that a claimant attorney fees shall be a charge against the insurer in addition to the benefits recovered,if the court finds that the insurer unreasonably refused to pay the claim or unreasonably delayed in making proper payment.comp.laws.the district court initial order granting summary judgment in favor of shields explained that 
i n this case,the facts were not in question and there was no issue of constitutional law.michigan supreme court had constructed sic the relevant statutory provision in regard to federal benefits,which is the situation here.state farm relied on a court of appeals decision addressing benefits paid by the insured employe r,and therefore,not applicable here.in light of the holdings in sibley and gunsell,the court finds that state farm refusal to reimburse plaintiff was unreasonable.accordingly,the court awards plaintiff her reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing this action.
although state farm appealed the district court grant of summary judgment,it did not raise the issue of attorney fees in that appeal.state farm also failed to respond to shields petition for attorney fees and interest,even though geha objected separately.shields accurately points out,moreover,that state farm filed no from the district court partial grant of attorney fees only shields presently appeals the partial fee award.
to the extent that state farm seeks to argue for the first time on appeal,no reversal of the fee award based on the reasonableness of its refusal to pay under,its argument is not.see ford motor credit aetna cas.and sur,cir quoting massachusetts mutual life insurance ludwig,d,for the proposition that,in the absence of a,the appellee may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging
