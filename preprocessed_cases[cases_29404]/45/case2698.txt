insurance code section enacted in november as part of proposition,limits the factors that an insurer can consider in determining insurance rates.statutes predating proposition created a comprehensive scheme for administrative enforcement of insurance rate regulations.proposition provided for greater public participation in those proceedings and enhanced the effectiveness and public accountability of the insurance commissioner commissioner.section,subdivision a,also enacted as part of proposition,states,any person may initiate or intervene in any proceeding permitted or established pursuant to this chapter,challenge any action of the commissioner under this article,and enforce any provision of this article.the superior court ruling on motions for judgment on the pleadings determined that section creates a private right of action against an insurer for a violation of section.the defendant insurers petitioned this court for extraordinary relief.in these consolidated writ proceedings,we conclude that there is no private right of action for a violation of section and grant the insurers petitions.
procedural background 
complaints 
douglas ryan,on behalf of himself and the general public,sued farmers insurance exchange farmers in april alleging that it denied a good driver discount to drivers with no prior automobile insurance coverage,in violation of insurance code section.he alleged a single count for unfair business practices under the unfair competition law bus,et.he later dismissed the action without prejudice and filed a complaint with the commissioner pursuant to a stipulation with farmers.the commissioner issued an order in january stating that the department of insurance had proposed a regulation to define a permissible persistency credit,stated that it would be inefficient to address each insurer class plan piecemeal,and declined to accept jurisdiction.
the proposition enforcement project the project,on behalf of itself and the general public,sued safeco insurance company of america safeco and first national insurance company of america first national in january lasc no,alleging that they charged higher premiums to drivers with no prior automobile insurance coverage or no continuous coverage in violation of section,and that they failed to report their true underwriting practices in violation of section.the project alleged counts for violation of section,violation of section,and unfair business practices.the superior court stayed the action in july stating that the alleged insurance code violations were within the primary jurisdiction of the commissioner.meanwhile,the department of insurance adopted regulations addressing the proper use of the persistency rating factor the regulations became effective in september and november,tit,subd.d,subd.i after the project submitted the matter to the commissioner,the commissioner issued an order in december declining to exercise jurisdiction because the factual questions presented by the litigation do not require any actuarial or rate making expertise,matters which the california department of insurance regularly handles,and matters in which the commissioner is vested with unique authority.the particular facts necessary to resolve the dispute will best be obtained through the discovery processes available in the superior court.
ryan commenced another action against farmers in june lasc no,filing a complaint alleging a single count for unfair business practices.the superior court determined that the two actions,and several others,were related and stayed the actions pending a final decision by the court of appeal in donabedian mercury ins.after that opinion was filed donabedian mercury ins.th,d donabedian,the court continued the stay pending a final decision by the court of appeal in poirer state farm mut.auto ins,wl.the court of appeal filed a nonpublished opinion in poirer in october,wl.
motions for judgment on the pleadings 
the insurers jointly moved for judgment on the pleadings in both cases arguing that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue for violation of the unfair competition law in light of proposition,approved by the electorate in november,and that the alleged violations of sections and did not give rise to a private right of action.the superior court granted the motion as to the unfair competition law counts in both actions in march,with leave to amend the complaints to substitute plaintiffs with standing under the new law.the plaintiffs apparently have not amended their complaints.
after further briefing,the court issued an order on may,in case no.stating that because the commissioner declined jurisdiction,there is no further basis to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.the order stated that section,subdivision a authorizes a private right of action and quoted language from donabedian,supra,th,d.the court granted farmers motion for judgment on the pleadings with leave to amend the complaint to allow ryan to allege a cause of action for violation of section.the court invited review of its interlocutory ruling pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the court issued an order on june,in case no.denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings by safeco and first national for the reasons stated in the order of may,in lasc no,and incorporated that order.
original proceedings in this court 
the insurers in both cases petitioned this court for a writ of mandate challenging the ruling that section,subdivision a creates a private right of action based on a violation of section.we issued an order to show cause and consolidated the proceedings for purposes of our review.
contentions 
the insurers contend section,subdivision a does not create a private right of action based on an insurer violation of section.the plaintiffs and the department of insurance as amicus curiae contend the statutory language any person may enforce any provision of this article,subd.a expressly creates a private right of action.
discussion 
standard of review 
a defendant can move for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action against the defendant.code civ,subd.c b ii.a trial court ruling on the motion must consider only the face of the complaint and matters subject to judicial notice,accept as true the properly pleaded factual allegations of the complaint,and liberally construe the complaint,subd.d gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d.we independently review the trial court ruling.gerawan farming,supra,at,d.
whether a statute creates a private right of action is a question of statutory construction depending on the intent of the enacting body 
a statute creates a private right of action only if the enacting body so intended.fireman fund ins.companies cal d,crusader ins.scottsdale ins.th,d.is instructive.in that case,our supreme court held that the legislature did not intend to create a private right of action to enforce section,subdivision h,overruling royal globe ins.superior court cal d,royal globe.section,subdivision h,part of the unfair trade practices act et,prohibits certain unfair claims settlement practices.the act authorizes the commissioner to investigate violations,conduct hearings,impose penalties,and issue cease and desist orders,and provides for judicial review.section states that a cease and desist order issued by the commissioner shall not relieve or absolve an insurer from any administrative action,civil liability or criminal penalty under the laws of this state arising out of the methods,acts or practices found unfair or deceptive.held that neither section nor section creates a private right of action against an insurer for unfair claims settlement practices,supra,at.
adopted statements by the dissent in royal globe that if the legislature had intended to create a private right of action,then surely much more direct and precise language would have been selected than the language of section,and that one would reasonably have expected that the legislature simply would have directly imposed such liability in clear,understandable,unmistakable terms,as it has done in numerous other statutes,supra,cal d at,quoting royal globe,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of richardson.the court concluded that the legislative history did not indicate an intent to create a private right of action cal d at,and stated,the fact that neither the legislative analyst nor the legislative counsel observed that the new act created a private right of action is a strong indication that the legislature never intended to create such a right of action.citations.id.at.
subsequent opinions by the courts of appeal have held that a statute creates a private right of action only if the statutory language or legislative history affirmatively indicates such an intent.vikco ins.services,ohio indemnity th,d crusader ins.scottsdale ins,supra,th at,d.that intent need not necessarily be expressed explicitly,but if not it must be strongly implied.see vikco,supra,at,d crusader,supra,at,d.particularly when regulatory statutes provide a comprehensive scheme for enforcement by an administrative agency,the courts ordinarily conclude that the legislature intended the administrative remedy to be exclusive unless the statutory language or legislative history clearly indicates an intent to create a private right of action,supra,cal d at,vikco,supra,th,d.
we construe a statute enacted by an initiative measure under the same principles of construction applicable to statutes enacted by the legislature.robert superior court cal th,d.our task is to ascertain the intent of the electorate so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.id.at,d.we first examine the statutory language,giving the words of the statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construing them in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme.ibid.we read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citations.state farm mut.auto.ins.garamendi cal th,d.if a statute is ambiguous,we consider other indicia of the voters intent,such as the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.robert,supra,at,d.
proposition 
california voters approved proposition as an initiative measure in november.the stated purpose of the initiative was to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices,to encourage a competitive insurance marketplace,to provide for an accountable insurance commissioner,and to ensure that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians.stats.proposition added article to division,part,chapter of the insurance code chapter added other sections to the insurance code and revenue and taxation code,and repealed several insurance code sections that had protected the insurance industry from state antitrust laws.the initiative required an immediate percent rollback of rates for automobile insurance and other forms of insurance established mandatory rating factors for determining automobile insurance rates,authorized the commissioner to approve other rating factors,and prohibited use of unapproved rating factors,subd.a required automobile insurers to offer a good driver discount of at least percent,subds.b,c and established the office of commissioner as an elected,rather than appointed,office.proposition also required that insurance rates be approved by the commissioner prior to use,subd.c,required insurers to apply to the commissioner for approval of future rate changes,and provided for public hearings on applications,subds.b,c.section,subdivision a,states in part,no rate shall be approved or remain in effect which is excessive,inadequate,unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of this chapter.
proposition added section,subdivision a,which states,the business of insurance shall be subject to the laws of california applicable to any other business,including,but not limited to,the unruh civil rights act sections to,inclusive,of the civil code,and the antitrust and unfair business practices laws parts commencing with section and commencing with section of division of the business and professions code.the initiative also added section,subdivision a,which states,any person may initiate or intervene in any proceeding permitted or established pursuant to this chapter,challenge any action of the commissioner under this article,and enforce any provision of this article.the initiative included an uncodified provision stating,this act shall be liberally construed and applied in order to fully promote its underlying purposes.stats.
the public dissatisfaction with former laws regulating insurance rates provided the primary impetus for proposition.the former laws were widely viewed as ineffective.the uncodified findings and declaration of the initiative stated,enormous increases in the cost of insurance have made it both unaffordable and unavailable to millions of californians.the existing laws inadequately protect consumers and allow insurance companies to charge excessive,unjustified and arbitrary rates.therefore,the people of california declare that insurance reform is necessary.first,insurance rates shall be immediately rolled back to what they were on november,and reduced no less than an additional.second,automobile insurance rates shall be determined primarily by a driver safety record and mileage driven.third,insurance rates shall be maintained at fair levels by requiring insurers to justify all future increases.finally,the state insurance commissioner shall be elected.insurance companies shall pay a fee to cover the costs of administering these new laws so that this reform will cost taxpayers nothing.stats.
an administrative procedure to enforce the laws regulating insurance rates predated proposition and still exists.section,subdivision a states that any person aggrieved by a rate charged,rating plan,rating system,or underwriting rule may file a complaint with the commissioner and request a public hearing.the commissioner must review and investigate the matter and may conduct a public hearing,subd.c,subds.a b.if the commissioner finds that a violation has occurred,the commissioner must issue an order prohibiting the misconduct and may order other corrective action.any finding or determination by the commissioner under chapter is subject to judicial review under the independent judgment standard,including a decision not to conduct a hearing.any failure to comply with a final order by the commissioner gives rise to a monetary penalty,and the commissioner may bring an action in the superior court to enforce collection.the provisions discussed in this paragraph all predated proposition.proposition enhanced the preexisting administrative procedures by extending standing from a ny person aggrieved,subd.a to a ny person,subd.a and required more exacting review of insurance rates and approval of rates by the commissioner 
section,subdivision a does not create a private right of action 
section,subdivision a,quoted in full ante,states initially,any person may initiate or intervene in any proceeding permitted or established pursuant to this chapter.this language expressly encompasses not only a proceeding concerning an application to increase rates,but also any other proceeding permitted or established pursuant to chapter.the plain language of this clause provides no independent authority for a proceeding not otherwise authorized by chapter,but creates broad standing in a proceeding permitted or established pursuant to chapter.section,subdivision a states that the insurance business is subject to state laws applicable to any other business,including specifically the unruh civil rights act,antitrust laws,unfair practices act bus,et,unfair competition law,et,and false advertising law,et.chapter therefore permit s only a proceeding authorized by those laws or by any other law generally applicable to other businesses.section,however,is not among the laws specified in section,subdivision a and is not generally applicable to other businesses.
chapter authorizes,and therefore establish es within the meaning of the first clause of section,subdivision a,an administrative proceeding to challenge a rate charged,rating plan,rating system,or underwriting rule,subd.a an administrative proceeding to review an application for a rate increase,judicial proceedings to review those administrative decisions,and a judicial proceeding by the commissioner to enforce collection of a monetary penalty.chapter establishes only administrative proceedings and judicial proceedings to review those administrative decisions or enforce a monetary penalty.apart from the possibility that another part of section,subdivision a itself creates a private right of action based on a violation of section,we conclude that chapter does not permit or establish a judicial proceeding against an insurer based on a violation of section,and that the first clause of section,subdivision a does not create a private right of action based on a violation of section.
the authority provided by the first clause of section,subdivision a for a ny person to initiate or intervene in a proceeding is expressly limited to proceedings permitted or established pursuant to this chapter.ibid.that authority is limited to conferring standing to a ny person in a proceeding otherwise authorized by law the second and third clauses of the statute,in contrast,do not specify the types of proceedings in which a ny person may challenge any action of the commissioner under this article,and enforce any provision of this article.ibid.the plaintiffs construe the third clause,enforce any provision of this article,as providing independent authority for a ny person to maintain a civil action to enforce any provision of article.in our view,the plain language of the provision,liberally construed,does not justify such an expansive reading.a more reasonable construction of the express language of the statute is that both the second and third clauses are subordinate to the first clause and are limited to the proceedings referenced in the initial clause.we thus construe section,subdivision a to mean that any person may challenge any action of the commissioner under this article ibid.and enforce any provision of this article ibid.only in a proceeding otherwise authorized by law and referenced in the initial clause.
several additional considerations support this conclusion.first,the analyses and arguments in the official ballot pamphlet did not indicate that proposition would create a private right of action.neither the analysis by the legislative analyst,the summary prepared by the attorney general,nor the arguments for or against the initiative so stated.the legislative analyst and attorney general both stated that the measure would increase administrative costs for the department of insurance,but made no mention of an anticipated increase in court administrative costs in discussing the costs to state and local governments,as would be expected if the initiative created a broad private right of action.the text of the initiative together with the analyses and arguments in the ballot pamphlet do not indicate that the voters intended to create a private right of action.
second,proposition preserved and enhanced a comprehensive administrative scheme regulating insurance rates.insurance rates must be approved by the commissioner prior to use,and the commissioner may conduct a public hearing on a rate change application,subd.c,subds.b c.the commissioner must review and investigate a complaint concerning a rate charged,rating plan,rating system,or underwriting rule,and may conduct a public hearing.by entrusting complaints to the commissioner in the first instance,chapter relies on the commissioner expertise in technical matters concerning insurance rates and ensures uniform rate regulation.the commissioner decision is subject to judicial review,including a decision not to hold a hearing.although the independent judgment standard of review applies,the reviewing court ordinarily has the benefit of both the commissioner fact finding and the application of the commissioner expertise on technical matters.the voters are presumed to be aware of existing law horwich superior court cal th,d,including the administrative enforcement provisions.the provisions for enforcement by the commissioner would serve little purpose and the benefits of administrative review and enforcement could be thwarted if a plaintiff could circumvent the administrative process in every case by filing directly in court.although the court could stay an action based on the primary jurisdiction doctrine farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,farmers,it seems unlikely that the voters intended to require that exercise.absent a more explicit indication that the electorate intended to create a private right of action,we would not conclude that the electorate so intended.
third,section quoted in full in fn.ante states,the administration and enforcement of this chapter is governed solely by the provisions of this chapter.in light of section,the absence of any reference in chapter to the means to enforce any provision of this article,subd.a apart from the expressly specified administrative proceedings and judicial proceedings to review those administrative proceedings or enforce a monetary penalty,and indirectly through laws applicable to other businesses,subd.a,indicates that the voters did not intend the quoted language in section,subdivision a,to create a private right of action.
our conclusion is consistent with farmers,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,in which our supreme court stated,albeit in dictum,that claims for violations of sections and were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the commissioner and did not support a direct private right of action.in that case,the trial court sustained a demurrer to the count for violations of sections and based on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.farmers,supra,at,d.the supreme court stated,with regard to the trial court conclusion this conclusion appears correct.pursuant to the insurance code,the people claims under that code are exclusively the province of the insurance commissioner.the enforcement of this chapter shall be governed solely by the provisions of this chapter.et setting out procedures for administrative determination of rate and issues.judicial review is of course available to challenge those administrative determinations see,but such review may be obtained only after the available administrative procedures have been invoked and exhausted.farmers,supra,at,fn,d.
donabedian,supra,th,d,is not on point.the plaintiff in that case alleged that the insurer consideration of the absence of prior insurance in determining eligibility for a good driver discount,rates,and insurability was an unfair business practice.the plaintiff did not allege a direct count for violation of section,subdivision c,as the plaintiffs here allege,but only a count for violation of the unfair competition law based on a violation of section.donabedian,supra,at,d.the plaintiff submitted the dispute to the commissioner,who declined to exercise jurisdiction.id.at,d.donabedian held that the complaint stated a cause of action for violation of the unfair competition law based on an illegal act or practice.id.at,d.the court explained that the plain language of sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a compelled the conclusion that the defendant was subject to the unfair competition law and that the plaintiff could enforce section,subdivision c in an unfair competition law proceeding.donabedian,supra,at,d.the court explained further that the unfair competition law count was originally cognizable in the courts and was not within the commissioner exclusive jurisdiction,citing farmers,supra,cal th at page,d,and that there was no basis to invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine after the commissioner had declined to exercise jurisdiction.donabedian,supra,at,d.donabedian did not hold or imply that section,subdivision a provided an independent basis for a private right of action under either the unfair competition law or section,subdivision c.rather,donabedian stands for the proposition that because section,subdivision a subjects insurers to the unfair competition law,a cause of action under the unfair competition law is a proceeding permitted pursuant to chapter within the meaning of section,subdivision a.
