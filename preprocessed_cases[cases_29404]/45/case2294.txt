standard comprehensive liability insurance policies provide that the insurer must both indemnify and defend the insured against claims within the scope of the policy coverage.the insurer duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.the latter duty runs only to claims that are actually covered by the policy,while the duty to defend extends to claims that are merely potentially covered,buss superior court cal th,d,buss montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.the insurer defense duty is a continuing one,arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded citation,or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage montrose,supra,at,d.
here,however,we address issues concerning the contractual duty to defend in a noninsurance context.we consider whether,by their particular terms,the provisions of a residential construction subcontract obliged the subcontractor to defend its of the lawsuits brought against both parties,insofar as the plaintiffs complaints alleged construction defects arising from the subcontractor negligence,even though a jury ultimately found that the subcontractor was not negligent,and the parties have accepted an interpretation of the subcontract that gave the builder no right of indemnity unless the subcontractor was negligent.we conclude that the answer is yes.we will therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
facts and procedural background 
the basic facts are not in dispute.peters jmp was the developer,builder,and general contractor of a large huntington beach residential project.weather shield manufacturing,weather shield,contracted with jmp to manufacture and supply windows for the project.in the contract,weather shield promised to indemnify and save jmp harmless against all claims for damages loss,theft growing out of the execution of weather shield work,and at its own expense to defend any suit or action brought against jmp founded upon the claim of such damage,loss or theft.italics added.
in september and october,owners of finished homes in the project sued jmp,weather shield,and other participants in the project construction.the defendants included darrow the framing corporation darrow,the project principal subcontractor,whose responsibilities included framing the structures and installing the windows.the complaints alleged numerous construction defects,including electrical,plumbing,roofing,chimney,framing,and other structural problems.as relevant here,they also asserted that,because of improper design,manufacture,and installation,windows in the homes,including those supplied by weather shield,leaked and fogged,causing extensive damage.theories of negligence,strict liability,breach of warranty,and breach of contract were set forth 
in april,jmp against weather shield,darrow,and all the other project subcontractors sued by the homeowners.the asserted,among other things,that under the pertinent subcontract of which had been drafted by jmp and were identical on the subcontractors owed jmp duties of indemnity and defense against the homeowners complaints.the sought declaratory relief with respect to jmp alleged indemnity and defense rights 
jmp,and all the subcontractors except weather shield and darrow,settled before trial.the sliding scale settlement agreement provided the homeowners a minimum payment of million,and guaranteed an additional sum of million against any recovery from the nonsettling subcontractors.the settling defendants also agreed to assist the homeowners in prosecuting their claims against the nonsettling parties.jmp and the settling subcontractors mutually released all claims,demands,and liabilities among themselves.all complaints and were dismissed except as to weather shield and darrow.
in july,during final pretrial proceedings,weather shield moved to dismiss the homeowners strict liability causes of action.the motion cited then extant case law holding that a subcontractor hired by a a subcontractor that supplied a component product rather than a not be strictly liable for defects in homes,unless the subcontractor also owned or controlled the housing development.see,casey overhead door th,d casey la jolla village homeowners superior court d.la jolla village.the court granted the motion,subject to a reevaluation of prejudice in the event of an intervening change in the law.
the window leak and framing issues went to trial against weather shield and darrow on the remaining theories of negligence and breach of warranty.in october,the jury returned general verdicts against darrow and in favor of weather shield.the jury awarded the homeowners approximately million in damages against darrow.following the jury verdict,darrow settled all the complaints against it.
thereafter,in march,jmp against weather shield was separately tried to the court.jmp sought both express indemnity for amounts paid to the homeowners in settlement,and under the provisions of weather shield subcontract,attorney fees and expenses incurred by jmp in defending itself against the homeowners suit.
the trial court ruled that the subcontract terms obliged weather shield to indemnify jmp for amounts paid to the homeowners only if weather shield was found negligent.thus,the court determined,the jury verdict that weather shield was not negligent absolved weather shield of indemnity liability in this case.on the other hand,the court concluded,the subcontract did give weather shield responsibility for jmp legal defense against the homeowners claims,insofar as those claims concerned the windows supplied by weather shield,regardless of whether weather shield was ultimately found negligent.
jmp presented evidence that it had incurred in attorney fees to defend the homeowners claims,and that percent of the homeowner settlement amount was attributable to the window problems.jmp therefore urged that,under their subcontracts,weather shield and darrow were together liable for percent of jmp defense fees,or.the court apportioned this amount equally between darrow and weather shield,and therefore awarded jmp in damages against weather shield.the court also found weather shield contractually liable to jmp,as the prevailing party on jmp,for in attorney fees incurred by jmp to prosecute the.
meanwhile,in december,this court held in jimenez superior court cal th,d,jimenez that,contrary to the teaching of such cases as casey,supra,th,d,and la jolla village,supra,d,the manufacturer or supplier of a component part installed in a home may be held strictly liable when a defect in the component causes damage to other parts of the structure.jimenez,supra,at,d.
following entry of judgment in this case in march,the homeowners moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict judgment nov code civ,and a new trial,against weather shield.among other things,the homeowners asserted that,under jimenez,they were entitled to try their previously dismissed strict liability causes of action.in may,the court denied the motion for a judgment nov,but granted a new trial against weather shield on the issue of strict liability.
weather shield appealed the new trial order,and the declaratory relief judgment insofar as it required weather shield to reimburse jmp expense of defending the homeowners action and prosecuting jmp.two of the groups of homeowner plaintiffs filed protective from the judgment against them,and in weather shield favor,on the claims.jmp did not appeal the order absolving weather shield from contractual indemnity liability for amounts paid by jmp to the homeowners 
in a divided decision,the court of appeal affirmed the orders and judgments challenged by weather shield,and dismissed the as moot.on the issue of weather shield liability for jmp defense,regardless of its own negligence,the majority reasoned,in essence,that weather shield promise to defend jmp against suits founded upon claims arising out of the execution of weather shield work necessarily contemplated an immediate duty to provide a service,which duty arose at the time such a suit was brought and a defense was therefore needed.thus,the majority concluded,the duty could not depend upon the outcome of issues to be litigated in the very action weather shield was obliged to defend.
the concurring and dissenting opinion argued that the contract language did not compel the majority interpretation of the duty to defend.moreover,the concurring and dissenting opinion urged,policy concerns weigh against allowing a builder or developer with superior bargaining power to impose contractual defense obligations on a nonnegligent subcontractor.
weather shield sought review,raising both the and issues.we granted review,limited to the following issue did a contract under which a subcontractor agreed to defend any suit or action against a developer founded upon any claim growing out of the execution of the work require the subcontractor to provide a defense to a suit against the developer even if the subcontractor was not negligent we turn to that issue.
discussion 
parties to a contract,including a construction contract,may define therein their duties toward one another in the event of a third party claim against one or both arising out of their relationship.terms of this kind may require one party to indemnify the other,under specified circumstances,for moneys paid or expenses incurred by the latter as a result of such claims.see,indemnity is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal consequence of the conduct of one of the parties,or of some other person.they may also assign one party,pursuant to the contract language,responsibility for the other legal defense when a third party claim is made against the latter.see mel clayton ford ford motor th,d mel clayton ford.
as befits the contractual nature of such arrangements,but subject to public policy and established rules of contract interpretation,the parties have great freedom to allocate such responsibilities as they see fit.white,city of huntington beach cal d,heppler peters th,d heppler.when the parties knowingly bargain for the protection at issue,the protection should be afforded.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d,rossmoor see heppler,supra,at,d.hence,they may agree that the promisor indemnity defense obligations will apply only if the promisor was negligent,or,conversely,even if the promisor was not negligent.heppler,supra,at,d continental heller amtech mechanical services,th,d continental heller peter culley associates superior court th,d peter culley associates.
in general,such an agreement is construed under the same rules as govern the interpretation of other contracts.effect is to be given to the parties mutual intent,as ascertained from the contract language if it is clear and explicit.unless the parties have indicated a special meaning,the contract words are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.continental heller,supra,th,d accord,centex golden construction dale tile th,d centex golden.
though indemnity agreements resemble liability insurance policies,rules for interpreting the two classes of contracts do differ significantly.ambiguities in a policy of insurance are construed against the insurer,who generally drafted the policy,and who has received premiums to provide the agreed protection.see,buss,supra,cal th,d,la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d.in noninsurance contexts,however,it is the indemnitee who may often have the superior bargaining power,and who may use this power unfairly to shift to another a disproportionate share of the financial consequences of its own legal fault,goldman cal d,goldman see regan roofing superior court th,d regan roofing.
this public policy concern influences to some degree the manner in which noninsurance indemnity agreements are construed.for example,it has been said that if one seeks,in a noninsurance agreement,to be indemnified for his or her own active negligence,or regardless of the indemnitor beyond those afforded by the doctrines of implied or equitable on the point must be particularly clear and explicit,and will be construed strictly against the indemnitee,white,supra,cal d,rossmoor,supra,cal d,goldman,supra,cal d,centex golden,supra,th,d heppler,supra,th,d.
for similar public policy reasons,statutory law imposes some absolute limits on the enforceability of noninsurance indemnity agreements in the construction industry.at the time weather shield contracted with jmp,a party to a construction contract could not validly agree to indemnify the promisee for the latter sole negligence or willful misconduct,subd.a see also.
finally,civil code section,unchanged since,sets forth general rules for the interpretation of indemnity contracts,unless a contrary intention appears.if not forbidden by other,more specific statutes,the obligations set forth in section thus are deemed included in every indemnity agreement unless the parties indicate otherwise.several subdivisions of this statute touch specifically on the indemnitor obligations with respect to the indemnitee defense against third party claims.
in this regard,the statute first provides that a promise of indemnity against claims,demands,or liability embraces the costs of defense against such claims,demands,or liability insofar as such costs are incurred reasonably and in good faith,subd,italics added.second,the section specifies that the indemnitor is bound,on request of the indemnitee,to defend actions or proceedings brought against the indemnitee in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity,though the indemnitee may choose to conduct the defense,subd,italics added.third,the statute declares that if the indemnitor declines the indemnitee tender of defense,a recovery against the indemnitee suffered by him in good faith,is conclusive in his favor against the indemnitor,subd.on the other hand,section provides,if the indemnitor got no reasonable notice of the action,or was not allowed to control the indemnitee defense,recovery by the third party against the indemnitee is only presumptive evidence against the indemnitor,subd.
with these principles in mind,we examine the pertinent terms of weather shield subcontract with jmp.we agree with the court of appeal majority that,even if strictly construed in weather shield favor,these provisions expressly,and unambiguously,obligated weather shield to defend,from the outset,any suit against jmp insofar as that suit was founded upon claims alleging damage or loss arising from weather shield negligent role in the huntington beach residential project.weather shield thus had a contractual obligation to defend such a suit even if it was later determined,as a result of this very litigation,that weather shield was not negligent.
we focus on the particular language of the subcontract.its relevant terms imposed two distinct obligations on weather shield.first,weather shield agreed to indemnify and save jmp harmless against all claims for damages to persons or to property and claims for loss,damage theft growing out of the execution of weather shield work.second,weather shield made a separate and specific promise at its own expense to defend any suit or action brought against jmp founded upon the claim of such damage loss,or theft.italics added.
a contractual promise to defend another against specified claims clearly connotes an obligation of active responsibility,from the outset,for the promisee defense against such claims.the duty promised is to render,or fund,the service of providing a defense on the promisee duty that necessarily arises as soon as such claims are made against the promisee,and may continue until they have been resolved.this is the common understanding of the word defend as it is used in legal parlance.see,black law dict.ed.to represent someone as an attorney merriam webster collegiate dict.ed,to act as attorney for random house webster college dict.ed.to serve as attorney for a defendant american heritage dict.ed.law to represent a defendant in a civil or criminal action.
a duty to defend another,stated in that way,is thus different from a duty expressed simply as an obligation to pay another,after the fact,for defense costs the other has incurred in defending itself.section,the statute governing the construction of all indemnity agreements,makes the distinction clear.on the one hand,as noted above,the section specifies that a basic contractual indemnity against particular claims,demands,or liabilities embraces the costs of defense against such claims,demands,or liabilities,subd.on the other hand,the statute separately specifies the indemnitor duty actually to defend,upon the indemnitee request,proceedings against the latter in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity,though the person indemnified has the right to conduct such defenses if he chooses to do so,subd.finally,section sets forth how the indemnitor obligations will be affected if the indemnitor fails to accept an indemnitee tender of defense or,alternatively,if the indemnitor is denied an opportunity to assume and control the defense,subds.
by virtue of these statutory provisions,the case law has long confirmed that,unless the parties agreement expressly provides otherwise,a contractual indemnitor has the obligation,upon proper tender by the indemnitee,to accept and assume the indemnitee active defense against claims encompassed by the indemnity provision.where the indemnitor has breached this obligation,an indemnitee who was thereby forced,against its wishes,to defend itself is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of doing so.
thus,in safeway stores,massachusetts bonding ins.d.safeway stores,one king undertook,by written agreement,to act as general contractor in the construction of a new safeway store.the agreement included king obligation to indemnify safeway against any claims,demands,or suits for damage,loss,or injury result ing from or occur ring in connection with the performance of the contract,at.construction workers employed by king sued safeway for injuries they sustained when recently installed roof trusses collapsed.the workers alleged that safeway had negligently permitted the installation of trusses it knew to be defective.king offered safeway a defense,which safeway initially accepted.however,it thereafter became apparent that the attorney furnished by king was serving king conflicting interests in discussions between the parties,king indicated he would deny indemnity liability if safeway was found negligent.safeway thereupon retained its own attorney to defend the workers action,and later sought reimbursement of its defense costs from king.
the court of appeal agreed with safeway.the court noted that under the contract of indemnity,no contrary intent appearing,king was bound to defend the actions,subd.safeway stores,supra,d,italics added.however,the court reasoned,in light of the obvious conflict between safeway litigation interests and king position on the indemnity issue,safeway had reasonably inferred that,despite king technical proffer,king did not intend to honor his contractual obligation to provide safeway with a complete defense.under these circumstances,the court concluded,safeway did not act as a volunteer in assuming its own defense,and was entitled to reimbursement for king breach of the duty to defend.
similarly,in buchalter levin d,the court acknowledged that subdivision of section establishes an indemnitor obligation to defend the indemnitee upon request,even though the indemnity agreement does not expressly so provide.buchalter,supra,at,italics added.however,the court concluded,the subdivision provision that the indemnitee may conduct his own defense if he chooses to do so ibid.does not mean the indemnitee ordinarily may refuse the indemnitor good faith proffer of a complete defense,then still collect reimbursement from the indemnitor for the defense costs the indemnitee has voluntarily incurred,at.goodman severin d.
in gribaldo,jacobs,jones associates agrippina versicherunges cal d,gribaldo,a majority of this court carefully distinguished between the costs of defense described in subdivision of section,on the one hand,and the duty to defend the indemnitee,as set forth in subdivision of the statute,on the other.there,an errors and omissions indemnity policy provided for a deductible of,said nothing about a duty to defend,gave the underwriters the right to assume the insureds defense,specified that the insureds need not contest any legal claim unless counsel mutually chosen by the parties advised otherwise,and prohibited either party from settling a claim against the insureds without the other consent.the policy further stated that if the insureds refused a settlement offer against the underwriters recommendation,and elected to contest the claim further,the underwriters liability would not exceed the amount for which the claim could have been settled,plus costs and expenses incurred by the insureds with the underwriters consent.
after the insureds settled a third party claim,they sought declaratory relief against the underwriters on the issue of liability for defense costs.the insureds contended that under subdivision of section,the policy included,and the underwriters had breached,an actual duty to defend gribaldo,supra,cal d,any claim,of a type covered by the policy,in which the initial demand exceeded the deductible.hence,the insureds insisted,the underwriters were now obliged to pay the insureds costs of defending such claims in full,regardless of the amounts for which the claims were actually resolved.
the trial court disagreed.it reasoned that,under the particular terms of the policy,the underwriters were not obliged to defend the insureds.hence,the court concluded,any liability of the underwriters for the insureds defense costs arose solely under subdivision of section,as part of any indemnity the underwriters otherwise owed the insureds.that obligation,the court held,applied only to costs incurred by the insureds to defend claims embraced within the provisions of the policy,that is,those claims in excess of actually paid by the insureds.gribaldo,supra,cal d.
this court affirmed.the majority agreed that under the provisions of subdivision of section the indemnitor is required to defend matters embraced by the indemnity if requested to do so by the indemnitee.gribaldo,supra,cal d.however,the majority noted,the policy at issue indicated a contrary intent,as section permits.by its plain terms,the policy allowed the underwriters,at their option,to assume the insureds defense,and it require d the insureds to defend claims where so advised by counsel.ibid.moreover,the majority noted,even assuming the policy did not,at the outset,exclude a duty to defend,the insureds had,contrary to the policy,incurred defense costs without first obtaining the underwriters consent,and had failed,as required by subdivision of section,to request a defense.gribaldo,supra,at.
accordingly,the majority reasoned,the underwriters had breached no duty under subdivision of section to defend any and all claims in which the demand exceeded the deductible.instead,the majority concluded,the trial court had acted correctly in calculating the underwriters liability under subdivision of the statute.under the latter provision,the majority held,the underwriters liability was limited to the insureds expense of defending claims as to which the underwriters otherwise owed,those claims actually paid by the insureds in amounts exceeding the deductible.gribaldo,supra,cal d.
recently,city of watsonville corrigan th,d observed once again that subdivision of section describes the indemnitor duty to defend actions or proceedings brought against the indemnitee if the latter requests the defense.city of watsonville,supra,at,d,original italics.however,the court of appeal held that by failing to request a defense,or to notify the indemnitor of the third party action,and by unilaterally deciding to conduct its own defense,the indemnitee does not necessarily forfeit its contractual right to reimbursement of its defense costs under the indemnity provisions of subdivision of the statute.
thus,as these decisions indicate,subdivision of section,by specifying an indemnitor duty to defend the indemnitee upon the latter request,places in every indemnity contract,unless the agreement provides otherwise,a duty to assume the indemnitee defense,if tendered,against all claims embraced by the indemnity.the indemnitor failure to assume the duty to defend the indemnitee upon request,subd.may give rise to damages in the form of reimbursement of defense costs the indemnitee was thereby forced to incur.but this duty is nonetheless distinct and separate from the contractual obligation to pay an indemnitee defense costs,after the fact,as part of any indemnity owed under the agreement,subd.
implicit in this understanding of the duty to defend an indemnitee against all claims embraced by the indemnity,as specified in subdivision of section,is that the duty arises immediately upon a proper tender of defense by the indemnitee,and thus before the litigation to be defended has determined whether indemnity is actually owed.this duty,as described in the statute,therefore can not depend on the outcome of that litigation.it follows that,under subdivision of section,claims embraced by the indemnity,as to which the duty to defend is owed,include those which,at the time of tender,allege facts that would give rise to a duty of indemnity unless the indemnity agreement states otherwise,the statutorily described duty to defend the indemnitee upon tender of the defense thus extends to all such claims.
here,the subcontract at issue not only failed to limit or exclude weather shield duty to defend jmp,as otherwise provided by subdivision of section,it confirmed this duty.in language similar to that of the statute,the subcontract explicitly obligated weather shield both to indemnify jmp against certain claims,and at its own expense to defend jmp against any suit or action founded upon such claims.italics added.the duty to defend expressly set forth in weather shield subcontract thus clearly contemplated a duty that arose when such a claim was made and was not dependent on whether the very litigation to be defended later established weather shield obligation to pay indemnity.
moreover,the subcontract at issue included a further express indication that the express duty to defend actions against jmp was not strictly limited to those claims on which,in the end,weather shield actually owed indemnity.the indemnity and defense clauses of the subcontract contained linguistic differences that conform to the logical distinctions between the two duties.on the one hand,the subcontract obligated weather shield to indemnify jmp against all claims for injury,damage,loss,or theft arising from performance of the subcontract,while,on the other,it required weather shield to defend any suit or action against jmp founded upon the claim of such injury,damage,loss,or theft.italics added.
one can only indemnify against claims for damages that have been resolved against the indemnitee,those as to which the indemnitee has actually sustained liability or paid damages.indemnification,after all,is the act of saving another from the legal consequence of an act.hence,a clause requiring weather shield to indemnify jmp against defined claims clearly indicated that the indemnity obligation would apply only if jmp ultimately incurred such a legal consequence as a result of covered claims.
by contrast,as noted above,the subcontract required weather shield to defend jmp against any suit or action founded upon the claim of such damage italics added.under this language,the duty to defend arose,as it logically must,as soon as a suit or action was brought against jmp that was founded upon a covered claim,that asserted a claim within the coverage of both clauses.necessarily,a duty expressed in this manner did not require a final determination of the issues,including the issue of weather shield negligence,before weather shield was required to mount and finance a defense on jmp behalf.
the court of appeal majority so concluded.dissenting on this point,justice conceded at the outset that the word defend,as defined in the abstract,would ordinarily mean providing legal services for a pending claim.nonetheless,she stressed,noninsurance indemnity contracts,unlike liability insurance policies,are construed to limit the obligations imposed,and the duties undertaken must be stated with particular clarity and specificity.examined in that light,she asserted,weather shield subcontract did not make absolutely clear that weather shield duty to defend,unlike its duty to indemnify,arose regardless of its negligence.
to conclude that,absent greater specificity,the indemnity and defense obligations stated in the subcontract both required a finding of weather shield negligence,justice reasoned as follows the indemnity and defense obligations in weather shield subcontract were described in a single sentence with two clauses.the first clause,stating the indemnity obligation,covered claims for damages growing out of the execution of weather shield work everyone the litigants,trial court,and majority seems to agree that matters embraced by this indemnity clause were narrowly limited to damages caused by weather shield own negligent work on the project.original italics.the second clause,defining the defense duty,confined that responsibility to suits or actions founded upon the claim of such damage the qualifying phrase,claim of such damage clearly refer red to the earlier language limiting the scope of claims embraced by the indemnity,all claims for damages growing out of the execution of the work.therefore,both obligations appear to be dependent on the same coverage terms.
but justice analysis overlooks the clear differences in the two clauses that we have described above.in particular,weather shield express contractual duty to defend suits founded upon the kinds of claims specified in the agreement necessarily extended to suits that alleged such claims,not just suits in which they were proven.assuming,as we must,that weather shield subcontract obligated it to indemnify jmp against claims arising from weather shield negligent performance of the subcontract,it follows that weather shield contractual duty to defend jmp encompassed suits or actions that alleged such negligence on weather shield part.weather shield could not avoid this duty on the ground that the very litigation to be defended might later result in a finding weather shield was,in fact,not negligent.
parties to an indemnity contract can easily disclaim any responsibility of the indemnitor for the indemnitee defense,or the costs thereof.short of that,they can specify that the indemnitor sole defense obligation will be to reimburse the indemnitee for costs incurred by the latter in defending a particular claim.however,the instant subcontract did neither.on the contrary,it specified that weather shield would be required,at its own expense,to defend jmp against suits founded upon claims arising from weather shield performance of its subcontract.this language indicated a more immediate obligation,one that would necessarily arise before the litigation to be defended could determine whether weather shield owed indemnity to jmp.
in arguing otherwise,weather shield relies heavily on heppler,supra,th,d.there,in connection with another of jmp large residential construction projects,concrete mueller signed a subcontract containing indemnity and defense clauses identical to those at issue here.homeowners sued jmp,mueller,and others for construction defects.mueller declined jmp tender of defense.in a global settlement,jmp assigned its contractual rights against mueller to plaintiff homeowners.as jmp assignees,they sought to recover against mueller under both the indemnity and defense provisions.the defect,indemnity,and defense issues went to trial against mueller.the trial court ruled that plaintiffs must prove negligence and causation against mueller in order to trigger mueller contractual indemnity obligations.the jury returned a general verdict for mueller.
on appeal,plaintiffs challenged the lower court ruling that mueller negligence was a prerequisite to its contractual duty of indemnity.the court of appeal affirmed the judgment in mueller favor.for a number of reasons,the court concluded that the language of the subcontract triggered mueller indemnity obligation only if mueller itself was found negligent.heppler,supra,th,d.
however,the plaintiffs in heppler did not contend that,even if the indemnity clause in mueller subcontract was triggered only by mueller actual negligence,the clause applied more broadly.accordingly,the heppler court never separately addressed the defense clause of the subcontract,or considered how the particular language of that clause might distinguish it from the indemnity clause.in affirming the general verdict for mueller,the court simply assumed that the indemnity and defense provisions of the subcontract were congruent 
here,by contrast,we directly confront the relationship,and the distinctions,between the two clauses.upon examination,as explained above,their language differs in a way suggesting that,even if the indemnity obligation is triggered only by an ultimate finding of the indemnitor fault,the defense obligation applies before,and thus regardless of,any finding to be made in the course of the litigation for which a defense is owed.hence,whatever heppler merits on the issues actually considered in that case,we do not find the decision helpful or persuasive on the narrow question before us.
similarly,goldman,supra,cal d,cited by weather shield,is of little use in construing the particular defense clause at issue in this case.our opinion noted a clause,phrased in language different from that we address here,that might bind the subcontractor in that case.see,at,fn.we also indicated that the indemnitee had demanded both indemnity and a defense from the subcontractor,at.however,our decision addressed only the subcontractor duties under the separate indemnity clause at issue in the case.our holding was simply that if one seeks contractual indemnity protection for his own active negligence,the language providing such protection must be particularly clear and explicit,at.here,upon close examination of weather shield subcontract,we find it did clearly and explicitly create a defense duty not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues,such as weather shield fault,that would only be determined after the duty arose.
nor,under close examination,is mel clayton ford,supra,th,d,helpful to weather shield cause.weather shield suggests mel clayton ford stands for the proposition that a clause in a noninsurance agreement does not extend to mere allegations that would trigger an indemnity obligation only if proven.we do not so interpret the decision.in our view,weather shield takes out of context the passage on which it relies.
in mel clayton ford,an agreement between a vehicle manufacturer and its retail dealer specified that the manufacturer would defend and indemnify the dealer against any third party suits,complaints,or claims concerning injury or damage arising out of an occurrence caused solely by a manufacturing or design defect in a vehicle supplied to the dealer by the manufacturer.mel clayton ford,supra,th,d,italics added.thus,the manufacturer excluded from its defense obligation any suit or claim that alleged dealer negligence,or any theory other than manufacturing or design defect,as a sole or contributing cause of the injury or damage.
in,the plaintiff purchased from the dealer a truck supplied by the manufacturer.thereafter,the dealer performed maintenance on the vehicle.in,while the plaintiff was driving the truck,it burst into flames,seriously injuring him.he sued both the manufacturer and the dealer,alleging not only a defectively designed and manufactured product,but also claims based on failure to warn,breach of warranty,and theories of the dealer direct or active negligence in the maintenance of the vehicle.mel clayton ford,supra,th,d.
the court of appeal held that the manufacturer had no duty to undertake the dealer defense under such circumstances.this was because t he indemnity provision required the manufacturer to defend the dealer only where the occurrence was caused solely by a production defect,and not whenever product liability was one of the allegations of the underlying complaint.mel clayton ford,supra,th,d,second italics added.
thus,in mel clayton ford,it was not an distinction that negated the duty to defend.rather,given the word solely in the clause there at issue,the crucial fact was that the suit for which a defense was sought included allegations other than those to which the manufacturer had limited its defense or production defects attributable to the manufacturer itself 
here,weather shield contractual duty was not similarly limited.weather shield promised to defend jmp against any suit founded upon a claim of damage growing out of the execution of weather shield work.the contract did not specify,or even hint,that no defense duty would exist unless the suit was solely concerned with weather shield performance under its own subcontract and included no other claims or allegations.nor does weather shield so claim.hence,nothing decided in mel clayton ford establishes that until weather shield faulty performance of its work was proven,it had no duty to defend jmp.
finally,we are not persuaded by regan roofing,supra,th,d,insofar as that decision suggests that a contractual duty to defend specified classes of claims,expressed in such terms,necessarily depends on the promisor ultimate liability for indemnity on those claims.
in regan roofing,after a housing developer,pacific scene,was sued for construction defects,it against numerous project subcontractors to establish its contractual indemnity and defense rights.each of these agreements required the subcontractor to indemnify pacific scene against all mechanic liens related to the subcontractor work,as well as any other liability,cost or expense of any nature or kind arising out of or in any way connected with subcontractor performance,save and except only such liability,cost or expense caused by pacific scene sole negligence or sole willful misconduct.regan roofing,supra,th at,d,italics added.pursuant to the foregoing,the subcontracts declared,subcontractor shall indemnify and hold harmless pacific scene from any costs and expenses for attorney fees resulting to pacific scene from such claims or liens,italics omitted.finally,each agreement separately provided that i n the event any suit on any claim is brought against pacific scene,subject to the provision,subcontractor shall defend said suit at subcontractor own cost and expense,italics omitted.
pacific scene sought pretrial summary adjudication of a number of issues,including rulings on the subcontractors duties to indemnify and defend.the trial court determined that the indemnity provision of the subcontracts included coverage for pacific scene own negligence.however,the court found that the question whether the subcontractors actually owed indemnity was premature,because,among other things,pacific scene had not yet incurred liability or paid claims subject to indemnity.on the other hand,the court concluded,under the language of the agreements and section,each subcontractor did have an immediate duty to defend claims brought against pacific scene in respect to matters embraced by the indemnity clause.regan roofing,supra,th,d.
the court of appeal reversed on the latter point.the appellate court indicated that summary adjudication of the duty to defend and its relationship to the duty to indemnify,the scope of the matters embraced by the indemnity is premature.no determination has yet been made as to whether the subcontractors were negligent in the performance of their work,giving rise to a duty to indemnify and a related duty to defend.pacific scene has not clearly established that under this indemnity clause,the duty to defend against claims of liability is entirely of the duty to indemnify for liability arising out of a subcontractor negligence.citation.regan roofing,supra,th,d,italics added.
in reaching this conclusion,however,the court of appeal erred.the court seems to have assumed that,under subdivision of section,and unless the agreement at issue clearly provides otherwise,an indemnitor duty to defend the indemnitee upon request in matters embraced by the indemnity is not,in the court words,but extends only to claims as to which indemnity is actually owed.regan roofing,supra,th,d.and the court found no such explicit contrary intent in the subcontracts there under consideration.
however,as we have explained,the duty to defend upon the indemnitee request,as set forth in subdivision of section,is distinct from,and broader than,the duty expressed in subdivision of the statute to reimburse an indemnitee defense costs as part of any indemnity otherwise owed.moreover,the subcontracts at issue in regan roofing,like the one before us here,did explicitly indicate a separate and distinct duty to defend the indemnitee,at the indemnitor own cost and expense,against suits raising claims covered by the indemnity.that weather shield in this arose when such a claim was made against the indemnitee,and thus did not depend on whether the conditions of indemnity were,or were not,later established.
regan roofing was therefore mistaken insofar as it concluded that,under the agreements there at issue,the subcontractors defense duties arose only if the subcontractors became liable for indemnity.we will disapprove the regan roofing decision to that extent 
weather shield and its amici curiae raise numerous,and substantial,policy concerns about an indemnity agreement that requires a subcontractor to defend a residential developer or builder in a construction defect suit,before and regardless of whether the subcontractor itself is found to be at fault.arguments asserted include the following large builders and developers use their superior bargaining power,and contract terms,unfairly to shift the financial consequences of their own legal liability to faultless subcontractors,who are not compensated for the risk and agree only because they need the work such shifting discourages builders and developers themselves from taking proper care in construction oversight.small subcontractors,moreover,lack the resources to fund a developer defense up front while often simultaneously defending themselves in the same lawsuit,where the developer typically pursues the hostile and conflicting strategy of pinning blame on them.the developer can demand a defense from a single subcontractor among many,and the latter may later be unable to obtain contribution from other subcontractors.further,subcontractors,unlike liability insurers,lack defense attorney panels available at favorable fee rates.because of privilege and issues,they may also lack access to the developer attorney billing records.as a result,a subcontractor may be forced to pay exorbitant and unreasonable legal costs for the developer defense.finally,the vagaries of construction defect litigation in california have caused many insurers to leave the market.thus,and contrary to the court of appeal assumption,backup insurance to cover subcontractors contractual defense burdens is not readily available at reasonable cost.
as weather shield and its amici curiae point out,statutes effective january,and january,respectively,were adopted to address just such concerns.these new laws,which apply to residential construction contracts entered after their effective dates,void any term in such a contract that obliges a subcontractor to indemnify certain other project participants,including the cost to defend,against construction defect claims to the extent the claims arise out of,pertain to,or relate to the negligence of those other entities,subds.c,d,as added by stats,ch,see,subd.e,as added by stats,ch.however,weather shield and its amici curiae assert that,unless we hold otherwise,california statute of limitations for construction defects code civ,still exposes numerous subcontractors who signed earlier agreements to unfair and burdensome defense demands by developers.
in effect,weather shield and its amici curiae ask us to conclude as a matter of law that,in a residential construction contract,a term which expressly obliges a subcontractor to defend a builder,developer,or general contractor against claims founded upon the subcontractor negligent work,but says nothing further about the scope of the duty,means only that the subcontractor must reimburse the promisee,after the fact,for the promisee legal expenses as part of any indemnity ultimately owed by the subcontractor to the promisee.they suggest that to produce a contrary result,the subcontract should say,in so many words,that the duty to defend arises immediately when a claim is asserted against the promisee,is not limited to later reimbursement of the promisee legal expenses,and applies regardless,and independent,of any duty of indemnity for which the subcontractor may later become liable.
we are sensitive to the policy issues raised by weather shield and its amici curiae.nonetheless,for reasons stated at length above,we decline the holding they propose.even applying the rule of strict construction they espouse,the instant contract already sets forth,in unambiguous terms,an immediate and independent duty to defend.as we have indicated,an express promise to defend another against claims founded upon the promisor acts or omissions inherently incorporates the characteristics they insist must be set forth in additional explicit terms.and if the parties intended only to give the indemnitee a right to after the fact reimbursement of its legal expenses as a component of any indemnity otherwise owed by the indemnitor,they would need no language to say so.that right is already included in every indemnity contract,unless otherwise specifically provided,under subdivision of section 
finally,weather shield does not suggest that,as applied to it,the subcontract was either procedurally or substantively unconscionable.nor does weather shield otherwise imply that it is a relatively small and powerless subcontractor overwhelmed by jmp superior bargaining power.furthermore,weather shield does not claim it naively signed the instant subcontract without understanding the terms.indeed,in its opening brief,weather shield describes itself as the manufacturer of the wood windows installed in the huntington beach residential development that included at least homes.this description suggests a multistate scale of operations,and a consequent sophistication,that would undermine any such assertions 
we therefore conclude that the duty to defend jmp against claims founded upon damage or loss caused by weather shield negligent performance of its work,as set forth in weather shield subcontract,imposed such duties on weather shield as soon as a suit was filed against jmp that asserted such claims,and regardless of whether it was ultimately determined that weather shield was actually negligent.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
conclusion 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.the decision in regan roofing superior court,supra,th,d,is disapproved to the extent it conflicts with the conclusions set forth in this opinion.
the cases were consolidated for pretrial and trial purposes.
jmp alleged that the subcontractors had a present duty to provide,and jmp had a present right to receive,a contractual defense.each also recited that b y way of this,jmp hereby tenders the defense of this action to the,and each of them,pursuant to the applicable subcontracts.jmp is informed and believed and based thereon alleges that the,and each of them have will reject,ignore,or fail to properly accept the tender of defense.the record is silent as to whether jmp had previously tendered defense of the homeowners actions to the subcontractors,or any of them.weather shield does not urge on appeal that it was absolved of any duty to defend by reason of jmp failure to timely tender the defense of the homeowners actions.
we were informed by the parties that,following the trial court judgment,jmp assigned all its rights thereunder to the homeowners.the homeowners then defended jmp award in the court of appeal.in this court as well,the homeowners have briefed the issue as assignees of jmp rights under the award.
subsequent to our grant of review,an issue arose whether,despite our limitation of issues,the pendency of review precluded further proceedings in the trial court under the new trial order,the propriety of which order we did not intend to address.concluding that there was no reason to delay the homeowners trial while we considered the issue,we therefore dismissed review with respect only to the order granting a new trial on that issue,as affirmed by the court
