we must determine whether a check stop payment liability endorsement to a commercial general liability insurance policy provides the insured,a bank,with a right to a legal defense of a brought against it for its wrongful dishonor of drafts drawn on an irrevocable letter of credit.because we conclude that the policy imposes a duty on the insurance company to defend the insured,we vacate the district court judgment concluding otherwise and remand for further proceedings.
on may,provident bank of maryland was served with a summons and complaint in the case of suriel finance,provident bank of maryland,filed in the district of maryland.the complaint alleged that provident bank wrongfully dishonored a draft drawn on a letter of credit it had issued.the suit demanded over million in damages.provident bank forwarded the suit papers to travelers property insurance company travelers,its insurer travelers acknowledged its receipt of the papers by a letter dated july,and notified provident bank of travelers appointment of counsel to defend the bank.in the letter,travelers also stated 
as you are aware,your coverage for this suit falls under the check stop payment liability endorsement to your policy.the limit of insurance on this endorsement is,subject to a deductible of per claim.
the total amount of damages sought by the plaintiff is in excess of your policy limits and,therefore,any judgment rendered against you in excess of your policy limits will not be covered.
but a few weeks later travelers wrote provident bank again and stated that it had reviewed the allegations and other information available to us at this time and was reserving its right to disclaim coverage 
there may be coverage under special endorsement,for count iii wrongful dishonor claim.if it is determined that coverage is available under this endorsement,the amount of coverage is limited to.this limit of insurance is stated in the endorsement language.
we will conduct any investigational activity in conjunction with the case under a full reservation of the company rights.such investigation or activity does not prejudice our right to disclaim coverage at a later date.
we will inform you of our decision on these issues when our investigation is complete.in the meantime,your rights and interests are being protected.
the initial litigation was succeeded by a second suit entitled banca del sempione suriel finance,and provident bank of maryland,which presented the same claims relating to provident bank wrongful dishonor of a draft drawn on a letter of credit issued by it.thereafter,in may,travelers again wrote provident bank about coverage,stating that travelers had submitted the coverage question to its outside lawyers for purposes of assisting our coverage determination.the letter continued 
the findings of our coverage counsel were in agreement with the previous correspondence forwarded to you.we have been advised,however,that there does exist a potentiality of coverage with respect to count iii wrongful dishonor of the letter of credit under the ucc as a result of special endorsement vi check stop payment liability.
the letter reassured provident bank that travelers would provide a defense for the wrongful dishonor claim and requested provident bank to have its counsel coordinate with travelers counsel to defend that claim.travelers never withdrew its agreement to provide a defense of count iii through provident bank lawyers,but it did continue to reserve its right not to pay any part of a resulting judgment.following a bench trial during march and april of,the district court entered judgment against provident bank in the amount of.
the background against which this underlying suit was litigated involved a million loan made by banca del sempione to suriel finance,which in turn loaned the money to its client,rock solid investments.suriel finance required rock solid investments to secure the interest on this loan with an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank to suriel finance in the amount of,which credit was to renew annually.to obtain the letter of credit,rock solid investments deposited in certificates of deposit with provident bank and paid the bank a fee.under the arrangement,the beneficiary of the letter of credit,or any assignee thereof,could present a draft to provident bank for an amount up to the face amount of the credit and be paid that amount by the bank.the draft had to be accompanied by a certification that rock solid investments had defaulted on its obligation to pay interest on the underlying loan.
a dispute later arose among the parties whether provident bank obligation under the letter of credit would automatically be each year under a revolving arrangement,providing beneficiaries of the letter of credit with a total of million upon which to draw.provident bank took the position that credit was limited to,and therefore,when banca del sempione,as assignee of the letter of credit,presented drafts that exceeded by,provident bank refused to pay the overdraft.
the district court in the underlying case concluded,for complex factual reasons involving a purported amendment to the letter of credit,that provident bank was obligated to honor drafts on a revolving basis up to million,and on that basis,it entered a million judgment in favor of banca del sempione and against provident bank.we affirmed that judgment in banca del sempione provident bank,cir.in defending this lengthy litigation,which involved two separate appeals,provident bank incurred over million in attorneys fees and costs.
provident bank filed this action to obtain reimbursement from travelers for its litigation costs under a commercial general liability policy issued by travelers to provident bank for the period april,through april.this policy included coverage for wrongful dishonor liability,or check stop payment liability as the endorsement was denominated.on for summary judgment filed by the parties,the district court denied provident bank coverage under the policy.the court ruled that the check stop payment liability endorsement did not cover the wrongful dishonor claim because the endorsement contained an exclusion that withheld coverage for liability assumed by provident bank under any agreement to be responsible for a loss,and the court found the letter of credit to be such an agreement.the court also ruled that travelers did not have a duty to defend the underlying litigation for wrongful dishonor because,even if the exclusion did not apply,the check stop payment liability endorsement contained no duty to defend.the court added,
i n the final analysis provident reading of the policy as a whole is strikingly unreasonable.it is simply beyond imagination that the check stop payment liability containing a limit of liability was intended to impose potential liability upon travelers for millions of dollars in fees and costs for defending provident in a sophisticated commercial transaction into which it voluntarily entered.
from the judgment entered in favor of travelers,provident bank noticed this appeal.
under maryland law,which applies in this diversity action,the duty to defend,as may be imposed by a liability insurance policy,is a question of contract law determined by the intent of the parties as manifested in the language of the policy.see mesmer maryland auto.ins.fund.and the duty to defend exists only if the insurance contract contains language that imposes the duty,and there is a potentiality or possibility that the claim could be covered by the policy duty to indemnify.see litz state farm fire cas,brohawn transamerica ins,utica mutual ins.miller.thus,in resolving the case before us,we first must determine whether,through application of maryland contract law principles,the policy before us includes language imposing a duty to defend check stop payment liability endorsement claims,and second,if there is such language,whether the claim for which a duty to defend is asserted is potentially covered by the endorsement.we address these issues in order.
in ruling that the travelers policy does not provide a duty to defend a potential claim under the check stop payment liability endorsement,the district court relied on a structural argument.it observed first that the endorsement itself does not include language imposing a duty to defend.it also noted that the body of the commercial general liability policy provides coverages,a,b,and c,and that each coverage individually addresses whether travelers has a duty to defend for claims made under the coverage.the court analysis continued 
two of them,coverages a and b,each contain a duty to defend clause.however,there is a third coverage,coverage c,that does not.the check stop payment liability endorsement,in effect,provides a fourth coverage.presumably,if a duty to defend were to attach to that coverage,the parties would have expressly so stated.
but the court then questioned its own conclusion.it stated 
i recognize that the endorsement can be read not as creating a fourth category of coverage but as modifying the coverage provided by coverage under that interpretation of the policy,the duty to defend established in coverage a might reasonably be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the endorsement.
the court rejected this possibility,however,because of its determination that it was beyond imagination,that the endorsement would provide a duty to defend costing travelers millions of dollars in fees when its indemnity obligation only covers.in making this point,the district court failed to recognize that under maryland law,as elsewhere,the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.see litz,at.and that duty may,indeed,result in costs to the insurer greater than costs incurred to indemnify,unless,of course,the language of the duty to defend limits the costs available for a defense.see sherwood hartford accident indem,not infrequently,that expense for defense may approximate or even exceed the amount of any judgment rendered in the action.moreover,the court should not have permitted the costs to travelers of a duty to defend to justify its determination of whether travelers had such a duty.
on appeal,travelers not only relies upon the district court structural argument but also goes further,arguing that the check stop payment liability endorsement is a endorsement which does not provide a duty to defend.
neither the analysis provided by the district court nor the argument made by travelers examines the policy and endorsement as an integrated contract from which the intent of the parties must be derived.see collier practice,to determine the intention of the parties we construe the instrument as a whole quoting pacific indem.interstate fire cas,internal quotation marks omitted.that examination,when resorting to principles of maryland contract law,discloses that the parties intended that the check stop payment liability endorsement would provide a coverage,not an coverage,requiring travelers both to pay the litigation costs and to indemnify provident bank for any judgment up to.see brohawn,at although the type of policy here considered is most often referred to as liability insurance,it is litigation insurance as well,protecting the insured from the expense of defending suits brought against him.
in maryland,insurance policies,like other contracts,are construed as a whole to determine the parties intentions.sullins allstate ins.maryland does not follow the rule that insurance policies are to be construed against the insurer except when an ambiguity remains after considering the intentions of the parties from the policy as a whole and,if necessary,after admitting and considering any relevant parol evidence.bailer erie.
as is typical with insurance policies generally,the insurance policy in this case contains a page of declarations,stating the dollar limits for the coverages the terms of the coverages provided a list of endorsements that are incorporated into the policy and the general terms and conditions applicable to the entire policy.the declarations page lists three general coverages coverage a for liability for bodily injury and property damage coverage b for liability for personal and advertising injury and coverage c for medical payments.these coverages are in turn modified by the endorsements that are expressly incorporated.the list of endorsements begins with the language it is hereby understood and agreed that this policy includes these endorsements and schedules followed by a list of endorsements that are incorporated into the policy.endorsement special vi,the check stop payment liability endorsement in question here,is headed by the interpretive instruction this endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following commercial general liability coverage part.it is therefore apparent that this check stop payment liability endorsement modifies the commercial general liability part to the extent provided in the endorsement.while the check stop payment liability endorsement itself does not include any language,all liability coverages in the main body of the policy do include duties to defend.the only coverage for which a duty to defend is not provided is the coverage for medical payments,which is not a of coverage,but rather a coverage.
therefore,the check stop payment liability endorsement expands the liability protection to the insured,amending either coverage a or coverage b,because coverages a and b constitute the entirety of the liability coverages.regardless of which liability coverage the endorsement amends,a duty to defend is provided.
we can not agree with travelers that the endorsement is a provision.both the body of the policy and the endorsement itself belie travelers argument.the body of the policy lists the endorsements that are incorporated into the policy,including the check stop payment liability coverage.similarly,the endorsement indicates that it modifies the liability coverage otherwise provided by the policy.because the endorsement is incorporated into the main policy and modifies the liability coverage provided,it can not be construed as a coverage.the proper construction includes the endorsement coverage as part of the liability coverage afforded by the policy.and,as we have observed,all liability coverages in the policy afford not only indemnification for loss,but also the defense of related lawsuits.
virtually every other indication given by the policy in this case points to the parties intention that travelers would have the obligation,as well as the right,to defend and control any litigation covered by the check stop payment liability endorsement.first,liability policies by definition typically include both a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify.see mesmer,at the promise to defend the insured,as well as the promise to indemnify,is the consideration received by the insured for payment of the policy premiums quoting brohawn,at see also rowland long,the law of liability insurance,pointing out that the duty to defend is one of the most important obligations imposed by the liability policy of insurance and distinguishes liability insurance from most other forms of insurance couch on insurance,ed.indicating that the duty to defend is an important distinction between a liability policy and an indemnity policy.
second,the general terms and conditions applicable to all liability portions of the policy indicate that the insured was to be provided a defense of lawsuits.section iv of the policy,which is applicable to the entire policy and which is entitled commercial general liability conditions,imposes duties on provident bank to notify travelers of any claim as soon as practicable,to send travelers copies of suit papers immediately,and to c ooperate with travelers in the investigation,settlement or defense of the claim or suit.these liability conditions could not be meaningful in the absence of a duty to defend.because the check stop payment liability endorsement is a modification to the policy liability coverage,it must be assumed that these general conditions are applicable also to that endorsement.
finally,travelers itself,as well as its outside attorneys,reached the conclusion that it had a duty to defend when it first received notice of the lawsuit.in its letter acknowledging receipt of suit papers,travelers stated that it would be providi
