today we hold that we lack appellate jurisdiction to review a federal district court order remanding a case to state court based on a ground colorably characterized as a defect for purposes of c.see d powerex reliant energy.
in october,a fire caused over million in damage to buildings and property owned by lebanon hardboard,llc.atlantic national trust,llc atlantic had loaned money to lebanon hardboard secured by interests in the buildings and property.the loan agreements required lebanon hardboard to maintain fire insurance on the property for the benefit of atlantic,and to assign all insurance proceeds to atlantic.tritalent funding group,llc tritalent had also loaned money to lebanon hardboard and had likewise obtained a security interest in the buildings and property.
before the fire,lebanon hardboard submitted an application for fire insurance to crump insurance services,crump and chamberlain insurance agency llc chamberlain,both of which were agents of hawley insurance company.hawley issued an insurance binder the actual policy was not delivered until after the fire to lebanon hardboard with a million per occurrence limit,but the binder did not designate atlantic or tritalent as mortgagees or loss payees.
after the fire,atlantic demanded payment under the policy from lebanon hardboard and hawley.hawley denied that atlantic was covered by the insurance policy or that it had any obligation to pay atlantic.on february,atlantic filed a complaint for damages and declaratory relief against hawley,crump,chamberlain,lebanon hardboard,and tritalent in oregon state court.atlantic sought,among other things,reformation of the contract and a declaration that atlantic rights to the insurance proceeds were superior to tritalent and lebanon hardboard.atlantic gave lebanon hardboard and hawley courtesy copies of the complaint on february.
the next day,hawley removed the case to federal court without the consent of the other defendants.at that time,neither hawley nor any of the other defendants had been served.lebanon hardboard and tritalent waived service on march.
on march,days after hawley removed the case,lebanon hardboard and tritalent filed a motion in district court to remand the case to state court.the next day,atlantic joined the motion to remand.
a magistrate recommended that the district court remand the action because lebanon hardboard and tritalent had not consented to removal and they timely exercised their right under to choose a state forum the magistrate reasoned that removal of a complaint to federal court is subject to the unanimity rule set forth in chicago rock island pacific railway martin,which holds that all defendants must consent to or join in a removal,and here hawley had violated that rule by failing to obtain the consent of its.the district court adopted the magistrate findings and recommendation and remanded the case to state court this timely appeal followed.
the issue in this case is whether we have appellate jurisdiction to consider the appeal of the district court remand order.as always,we have jurisdiction to determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear the case.guam election comm n,cir.because the scope of our authority to review an allegedly erroneous remand order is not entirely clear,we begin with a review of the legal framework.
the beginning point of statutory interpretation must be the language of the statute.am.bird conservancy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under d,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise the supreme court has interpreted this section more narrowly than its plain language would indicate.see thermtron prods.hermansdorfer,superseded by statute on other grounds,c.as explained in thermtron,d prohibits review only of remand orders issued pursuant to a ground enumerated in c.id.at the time thermtron was decided,c stated,in part if at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction,the district court shall remand the case,and may order the payment of just costs.thermtron,at.thermtron indicated that the case at issue had not been removed improvidently because there was no express statutory provision forbidding the removal of the action and the case had been timely removed in strict compliance with.id.at.moreover,the case had not been removed without jurisdiction because the case could have been filed initially in the district court pursuant to.id.at.
according to thermtron,i f a trial judge purports to remand a case on the ground that it was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction,his order is not subject to challenge in the court of appeals.id.at.as the supreme court later explained,w here the order is based on one of the enumerated grounds,review is unavailable no matter how plain the legal error in ordering the remand.briscoe bell,see also gravitt southwestern bell,u.per curiam.nevertheless,an appellate court can review a remand order when a trial judge exceeded his statutorily defined power by remanding a properly removed case on grounds that he had no authority to consider.thermtron,at.in the matter before it,thermtron noted that the district court had remanded the case based on its concern about its heavy docket,which the district court thought would unjustly delay plaintiffs in going to trial on the merits of their action.id.at.because docket congestion was not a ground enumerated in c,thermtron held that there was appellate jurisdiction to review and reverse the district court decision.id.at.
after thermtron,congress amended c several times.see powerex,at.at present,c states,in relevant part 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
in powerex,the court stated that it would assume for purposes of this case that the amendments to c were immaterial to thermtron gloss on d,so that d bar on appellate review is limited to remands based on subject matter jurisdiction and nonjurisdictional defects.powerex,at citing quackenbush allstate ins.this assumption is consistent with the court practice of applying thermtron rule despite the changes in statutory language.see,carlsbad tech.hif bio,kircher putnam funds trust,quackenbush,at things remembered,petrarca,briscoe,at gravitt,at.our cases have followed the court lead in assuming that amendments to c are immaterial to thermtron gloss on d.see,kamm itex,cir applying thermtron to the present form of c without addressing the changed statutory language executive software,dist,cir same for amendments to c.
in applying thermtron rule that d does not preclude all appellate review of remand orders,we have held that review is appropriate in a number of situations not discussed in thermtron.for instance,in order to determine whether we lack jurisdiction under d in cases where the basis of a district court remand order is unclear,we may look to the substance of the order to determine whether it was issued pursuant to section c.schmitt ins.of,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,c.in this vein,we have analyzed the basis of a district court remand order where the district court did not identify the ground for its remand,united investors life ins.waddell reed,cir,where the order was ambiguous,schmitt,at,or where it was not clear that the ground specified by the district court was a ground enumerated in c,see kamm,at,examining whether a district court remand of a breach of contract action based on the contract forum selection clause fell within c.in those cases,however,we acknowledged that if the district court had based its remand on a ground enumerated in c,we would lack jurisdiction to review whether the district court application of that ground was correct.see,united investors,at.
we have also held that we may review remand orders where the district court exceeded the procedural limitations in c,even where a district court purported to reman
