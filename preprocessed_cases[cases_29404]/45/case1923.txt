background 
pmi is a large financial institution that sells,among other things,mortgage guaranty insurance to residential mortgage lenders who provide loans to homebuyers considered to be at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.this insurance covers a lender for losses incurred when a borrower defaults on the repayment of a mortgage loan and the collateral is not sufficient to make the lender whole.pmi also offers its lender clients underwriting services,claims services,policy administration services,loan underwriting,loss mitigation,pool insurance and captive reinsurance.
in december,a putative class of plaintiffs who had obtained mortgage insurance through pmi lender clients sued pmi in the southern district of georgia the baynham action.the third amended class complaint alleged that pmi was undercharging its lender clients for various insurance products and services in exchange for customer referrals on mortgage insurance.since the lender clients had not passed these savings on to their customers,plaintiffs claimed that this scheme violated the provisions of the real estate settlement procedures act respa.
the baynham complaint also alleged that n one of the loan documents or disclosures given to the borrower s disclose s that part of the charges paid by borrowers are compensation to the defendant pmi for the discounts accorded to the lenders on its various products and services,nor disclose the tainted nature of defendant relationship with the lender,also in violation of respa while pmi was formally charged only with violating respa provisions,the complaint also asserts that pmi acted in concert with its lenders to violate the duty to disclose.the baynham lawsuit was settled in june for million.
when the baynham action arose,pmi held a financial institution professional liability insurance policy issued by american international specialty lines insurance company aislic,which required aislic to pay pmi up to million for any loss covered by the policy.pmi had also purchased layers of excess coverage from columbia casualty company columbia and federal insurance company federal,which obligate these insurers to cover pmi on terms identical to those of the aislic policy once the limits of aislic liability have been exhausted.these excess policies provide that columbia will pay and federal will pay of any losses between million and million 
the aislic insurance policy provides that aislic and hence columbia and federal as well will indemnify pmi for the loss of the insured arising from a claim for any actual or alleged wrongful act of any insured in the rendering or failure to render professional services.emphasis added.the policy defines wrongful act as any act,error or omission in the rendering of or failure to render professional services.the policy defines professional services as follows 
t hose services of the company permitted by law or regulation rendered by an insured pursuant to an agreement with the customer or client as long as such service is rendered for or on behalf of a customer or client of the company i in return for a fee,commission or other compensation or ii without compensation as long as such services are rendered in conjunction with services rendered for compensation.
on april,pmi filed a breach of contract and declaratory relief action against aislic,federal and columbia the insurers alleging that the losses incurred in the baynham action were covered by the professional liability policy issued by aislic and,thus,that the insurers had a legal duty to indemnify pmi for its losses aislic denied that pmi losses arose from the rendering of professional services as required by the policy,and it made a counterclaim seeking repayment of legal defense costs it had previously advanced to pmi totaling some million.
both parties moved for summary judgment on the question whether pmi alleged violations of respa in the baynham action were wrongful acts committed in the rendering of professional services as required by the aislic policy.in its december,order,the district court granted aislic summary judgment,ruling that pmi actions giving rise to the baynham action were fundamentally administrative and thus did not constitute professional malpractice or involve the rendering of professional services as required by the insurance policy.see pmi mortgage ins.am.int l specialty lines ins,no,wl.
on march,the district court dismissed pmi complaint with prejudice and entered judgment in favor of aislic in the amount of million.pmi timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment on april.
on may,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of columbia and federal as well,dismissing pmi complaint against both parties with prejudice.on may,pmi filed an appeal from the judgment in favor of columbia and federal,as well as an appeal from the earlier judgment in favor of aislic.on june,this court granted pmi motion to consolidate these appeals.this court is now called upon to review the district court grants of summary judgment in favor of aislic,columbia and federal.

iii.discussion 
the sole question before us is whether pmi alleged violations of respa,as presented in the baynham action,were wrongful acts committed in the rendering of professional services under the aislic policy.the district court answered this query in the negative,granting the insurers motion for summary judgment.having reviewed both the text of the contested policy and the relevant case law,we are convinced that this disposition was erroneous.the plain language of the pmi policy and the basic principles of insurance policy interpretation under california law support a finding of coverage,and the implications of prevailing case law on professional malpractice interesting but only indirectly not compel a contrary result.additionally,the fact that the baynham claim alleges a respa violation,while not determinative,bolsters this conclusion.we therefore reverse.
interpretation of the policy text 
in resolving this constructional dispute,the lodestar of our analysis must be the mutual intent of the parties as expressed in the provisions of the insurance policy itself.under california law,which governs this diversity action,courts must construe insurance policy terms so as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties at the time the policy was issued,and this intent should be inferred,to the extent possible,solely from the written provisions of the policy contract.mackinnon truck ins,cal th,d,emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted see also bank of the superior court,cal th,d,same aiu ins.superior court,cal d,same.neither party disputes the applicability of this basic directive to the instant case.accordingly,we begin our inquiry with a consideration of the policy text itself,mindful that the insured party generally bears the initial burden of demonstrating that the claim is within the basic scope of coverage.waller truck ins,cal th,d,internal quotation marks omitted.
turning then to the policy language at issue,the pmi policy defines professional services simply as those services of the company permitted by law or regulation rendered by an insured pursuant to an agreement with the customer or client.emphasis added.from a strictly textualist perspective,pmi alleged kickback scheme and the resulting baynham action clearly fall within this broad provision,as they resulted directly from pmi provision of mortgage insurance services under various allegedly improper agreements with lender clients.the plain meaning of the policy language thus does encompass pmi alleged misconduct 
of course,one could argue that it may not be appropriate to take this broad policy language at face value.while the bare text of the policy ostensibly covers all services rendered pursuant to an agreement with a customer or client,the policy use of the term professional services as opposed to merely services does invoke a traditional professional malpractice vocabulary,and the policy is actually titled financial institution professional liability insurance policy.emphasis added.but even assuming,arguendo,that these considerations bear on this case,california law instructs that such interpretive quandaries be resolved in favor of the insured and against the insurer.the california supreme court has consistently held that insurance policies are to be interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured.mackinnon,d,at internal quotation marks omitted see also white title ins,cal d,any ambiguity or uncertainty in an insurance policy is to be resolved against the insurer internal quotation marks omitted.the california supreme court has explained this constructional policy as follows the purpose of this canon of construction is to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage in a situation in which the controls the language of the policy.id.at.
the plain meaning of the policy text and the applicable canons of construction under california law thus point us in the same both militate in favor of finding coverage for pmi.
b.the case law on professional malpractice insurance 
since our primary analytical considerations under california plain language of the pmi policy and the canons of interpretation applicable to insurance policy demand a finding of coverage,we need proceed no further.however,since the district court ultimately arrived at the opposite conclusion via a different analysis,it is appropriate to address the disposition below on its own terms.
confronted with the pmi policy strikingly broad definition of professional services,the district court turned to leading judicial constructions of that term in traditional professional malpractice policies.wl,at.the most authoritative construction of the term professional services as used in the malpractice insurance setting was made by the ninth circuit in bank of california,opie 
something more than an act flowing from mere employment or vocation is essential a professional act or service is one arising out of a vocation,calling,occupation,or employment involving specialized knowledge,labor,or skill,and the labor or skill involved is predominantly mental or intellectual,rather than physical or manual in determining whether a particular act is of a professional nature or a professional service we must look not to the title or character of the party performing the act,but to the act itself.
cir quoting marx hartford accident indem.to be considered a professional service for insurance purposes,a liability must arise out of the special risks inherent in the practice of the profession.id.this standard has been cited with approval by several courts across the country,including a california federal district court applying california law.see,pac.ins.burnet title,cir applying a similar standard med.records,am.empire surplus lines ins,cir applying the same standard horizon,paul fire marine ins,d,applying california law and adopting the opie standard.
in keeping with this general rule,california state courts have uniformly held that insurance policies covering professional services reach only those acts committed by the insured in his or her capacity as a do not cover general administrative activities that occur in all types of businesses.for example,inglewood radiology medical group,hospital shared services,held that professional malpractice insurance does not cover a lawsuit concerning a physician decision to fire an employee,even though the physician professional medical knowledge was required to make employment evaluations.d,t he decision to terminate employment is a business or administrative decision.in making such a decision,the physician is acting as an employer and not as a physician rendering services.similarly,blumberg guarantee insurance held that professional malpractice insurance does not cover a lawsuit between attorneys over an alleged breach of their partnership agreement since,in bringing the suit,the plaintiff was acting in his capacity as a law partner,not as an attorney rendering services.d.transamerica insurance sayble held that professional malpractice insurance did not cover litigation expenses arising from an attorney alleged mismanagement of a law firm.d.since the case was held to concern essentially a business dispute,it did not implicate the defendant professional activities as an attorney.at least one california court has held that,in such cases,the dispositive question is whether the alleged injuries occurred during the performance of professional services.tradewinds escrow,truck ins,th,d.
in applying these precedents to the case at bar,the district court characterized pmi alleged kickback scheme and disclosure failures as a b illing matter involving undercharging its clients for products and services.wl,at.it cites medical records for the proposition that the bill is an effect of the service provided,not part of the service itself.at.insurers also cite several cases that establish the general proposition that claims regarding the amount of fees charged for professional services are not covered under professional liability policies.this conclusion,anchored in an unqualified analogy between the pmi policy and traditional professional malpractice policies,is flawed.
it should be observed,first,that pmi is a major financial institution whose core lines of business include,among other things,the sale of mortgage insurance.pmi is not engaged in one of the traditional professions as that term is commonly understood,and it does not render the physical or intellectual acts of service one commonly associates with doctors or lawyers.additionally,it is important to note that the pmi policy language is significantly broader than the language at issue in any of the aforementioned professional malpractice insurance cases.the professional malpractice policies in virtually all of those cases define professional services narrowly,explicitly limiting coverage to acts performed by the insured in its professional capacity.see,johnson first state ins,th,d,professional services defined as all services rendered or which should have been rendered for others.by the insured in the insured capacity as a lawyer,notary administrator of an estate emphasis added sayble.at professional services defined as all services rendered or which should have been rendered for others.by the insured in the insured capacity as a lawyer inglewood radiology.at professional services defined as those services performed in the practice of the profession of a physician emphasis added blumberg.at policy covers claims arising out of any acts or omissions of the insured in rendering or failing to render professional services for others in the insured capacity as a lawyer emphasis in original.the pmi policy does not contain any such explicit restriction and thus is distinguishable from the policies analyzed in these cases.a policy that uses the buzzwords professional services,but then proceeds to define them more broadly than most standard malpractice policies,should certainly be read differently than policies containing narrower language.
but even to the extent that the aforementioned malpractice precedents are indirectly relevant core business does,after all,involve specialized knowledge and is not clear that they favor the insurers.pmi was acting in its professional capacity as a mortgage lender,and within the context of its specialized relationships with its,when the alleged improper conduct occurred.while the kickback scheme at issue does involve the valuation or pricing of services,pmi has not been charged merely with sending customers inflated invoices.it has been accused of participating in an ongoing collusive scheme under which it received customer referrals in exchange for undercharging lend
