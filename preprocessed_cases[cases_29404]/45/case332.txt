general star national insurance general star appeals from a memorandum opinion and order dated september,by the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira scheindlin,judge granting summary judgment for,the new york marine and general insurance company and mutual marine office,together,mutual marine.the question presented on appeal is whether general star,an excess insurer,is required to reimburse mutual marine for the amount mutual marine paid above its policy limit to cover a portion of a personal injury judgment.
in answering this question in the affirmative,the district court concluded that a judgment against the owner of and stevedore at the ship terminal where the personal injury city of new york the city and the international terminal operating company ito,an adjudication of liability against general star insured,universal fabricators,ufi,a contractor doing work at the time and place of the injury.ufi was insured by both mutual marine for the first million dollars of loss,and general star for four million dollars above that amount,under general star national insurance company umbrella policy no.genstar policy.because under the terms of the genstar policy,an adjudication that established an amount that the insured was legally obligated to pay constituted an ultimate net loss,which required general star to reimburse its insured,the district court decided that general star was obligated to pay mutual marine for the amount it had paid above its primary insurance policy limit.
we conclude that the district court erred in deciding that general star insured was liable for the amount at issue as a result of the state court personal injury judgment.because neither the district court nor the parties addressed in substance the issue of whether general star insured was legally liable for some other reason,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions for the court to resolve this issue and decide whether a trial with respect thereto is warranted.
background 
the new york city passenger ship terminal the terminal is owned by the city and operated in part by ito.in,ito retained ufi to perform repair work at the terminal.the contract between ito and ufi contained a rider which provided,among other things,that ufi would a procure general liability insurance coverage in the amount of five million dollars per occurrence,with the insurance policy naming ito and the city as additional insureds,and b indemnify,defend and hold harmless ito and the city from and against all claims arising from any negligent act or omission by ufi that was related to the repair work.as required by the rider,ufi purchased a primary general liability insurance policy in the amount of one million dollars from mutual marine and a secondary excess policy in the amount of four million dollars from general star.
the genstar policy provided that general star would pay for ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit because of bodily injury or property damage to which the policy applies.it also stated that ultimate net loss means the total amount of damages for which the insured is legally liable.ultimate net loss may be established by adjudication,arbitration or a compromise settlement to which general star ha s previously agreed in writing.
on february,ronald ernish,a ufi employee performing repair work at the terminal,was seriously injured when he fell from a makeshift scaffold or ladder that collapsed under his weight.ernish and his wife brought suit in supreme court,new york county,not against ufi,ernish because they would have been confined to a workers compensation claim had they sought to recover from ufi but against ito and the city the ernish lawsuit.ito and the city then filed a complaint against ufi seeking indemnification the action.
general star was informed of the ernish lawsuit and the action against ufi.after concluding that it was unlikely ufi would be exposed beyond mutual marine policy limit,general star decided to allow mutual marine,ufi primary insurer,to defend ufi in the action,and so informed mutual marine in two notes dated may and june,respectively.with regard to its conclusion that ufi was unlikely to be exposed beyond mutual marine policy limit,general star instructed mutual marine in the first note that s hould future developments lead you to believe otherwise,please notify us immediately.
before trial began in the ernish lawsuit against ito and the city,mutual marine attorneys executed a settlement agreement the first agreement with both ito and the city,purportedly on behalf of ufi,settling the claim ito and the city had asserted against ufi.the first agreement provided that ito and the city would discontinue their claim against ufi,and that ito and the city would pay percent and ufi would pay percent of whatever amount was ultimately awarded to ernish against ito and the city in the ernish lawsuit.
it is not disputed that mutual marine knew of and participated in the first agreement.general star,however,neither knew of nor participated in it.and according to ufi and general star,mutual marine counsel entered into the first agreement on ufi behalf without ufi consent.
the state trial court directed a verdict in the ernish lawsuit in favor of the plaintiffs against ito and the city on liability pursuant to labor law,which provides that a ll contractors and owners and their agents shall cause to be furnished or erected scaffolding which shall be so constructed,placed and operated as to give proper protection to a person so employed in repairing a building or structure,among other things.labor law see also ernish city of,dep t.a jury,left to decide the amount of damages,returned an award of three million dollars against ito and the city.the amount apparently came as something of a surprise to the parties and their insurers.on appeal to the appellate division,the directed verdict was affirmed but the judgment was reduced to plus an amount substantially exceeding the parties and insurers initial expectations.id.
ito and the city were insured by the national union fire insurance company of louisiana,marine adjusters,the marine office of america corporation,and navigators insurance services of texas,collectively national union.national union initially paid ernish percent of the judgment to satisfy the obligation of ito and the defendants in the ernish the first agreement.mutual marine,in turn,to its policy limit of one million dollars plus of ufi share of the judgment against ito and the city under the first agreement.of ufi share under the first agreement remained unpaid.the parties looked to general star to pay that amount under its excess policy,but general star declined,arguing that neither it nor ufi was bound by the first agreement,and that it therefore had no liability for payment of any of ufi share of the judgment,which share had been decided upon in the first agreement.see,letter from general star to mutual marine,at june,what remains clear and fact mutual marine does not even argue to the that neither general star nor universal fabricators ever authorized mutual marine to execute the first agreement on their behalf.
because the judgment was entered against ito and the city,their insurer,national union,then paid the remainder of the judgment.national union thereupon commenced an action for a declaratory judgment against ufi,mutual marine,and general star to the effect that national union was due reimbursement for the money it paid in excess of the percent share of the ernish judgment that was apportioned to ito and the city under the first agreement.general star removed the action,which was originally filed in new york county supreme court,to the united states district court for the southern district of new york on the basis of diversity of citizenship.
after the case was removed,mutual marine,ufi,and national union,entered into two additional settlement agreements.mutual marine and ufi entered into a settlement and cooperation agreement the second agreement,under which mutual marine agreed to indemnify and defend ufi in national union declaratory judgment action.in exchange,ufi agreed that to the extent mutual marine pays any judgment or verdict against ufi in the national union litigation,or pays any settlement of any claim against ufi in the litigation or for any further liability under the first agreement,mutual marine shall be subrogated to any and all rights of ufi,be assigned such rights by ufi,including any right to pursue claims against genstar for amounts paid and for attorneys fees and costs second agreement.
then mutual marine and national union entered into a settlement and cooperation agreement the third agreement,under which mutual marine paid national union for the amount national union had paid to satisfy ufi obligation to ito and the city under the first agreement,and national union dismissed its suit against ufi and mutual marine,assigning the rights it had asserted against general star in that lawsuit to mutual marine.
following the second and third agreements,then,ufi has been indemnified and national union has been paid in full.neither of those parties has an interest in the present appeal.mutual marine maintains its suit against general star for the excess over its policy limit that it paid to national union following the third agreement to cover ufi alleged obligation under the first agreement.
mutual marine,as directed by the district court,filed a motion for summary judgment against general star on the limited issue of whether general star was directly obligated under the first agreement to pay the remainder of ufi percent share.in an opinion and order entered july,the district court denied summary judgment,finding that general star was not obligated to contribute to ufi share directly pursuant to the first agreement.union fire ins.of universal fabricators,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july,union i.the court concluded that because general star was not aware of,did not take part in,and was not a party to the first agreement,it was not directly bound by its terms.id.the opinion explicitly refrained from addressing whether general star was obligated under the terms of the genstar policy itself to pay the amount in dispute,and invited general star to move for summary judgment on that issue.union i,wl at,dist.lexis at the present motion for summary judgment was made on the limited issue of whether genstar was bound under the terms of the first agreement as a result,this opinion does not address the remaining issue of whether genstar is bound to pay under the terms of its excess insurance policy.genstar may move for summary judgment on this issue.
general star did just that.but in a memorandum opinion and order entered september,the district court denied general star motion and,instead,entered summary judgment for mutual marine.the court found that although general star was not directly bound by the first agreement,it was nonetheless obligated to reimburse mutual marine under the terms of the genstar policy.union fire ins.of universal fabricators,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,union ii.
the district court noted that the genstar policy provided that general star would pay in the event of a judgment in excess of mutual marine policy limit for ultimate net loss,which,the policy stated,may be established by adjudication,arbitration or a compromise settlement to which general star ha s previously agreed in writing.union ii,wl at,dist.lexis at quoting genstar policy at.the court found that ufi had agreed to indemnify,defend and hold harmless ito and the city,wl at,dist.lexis at,and concluded that the directed verdict by the new york supreme court against ito and the city was u nder any definition of the term,an adjudication of liability as to ito and the city and ultimately,of ufi if and when called upon to indemnify ito and the city,wl at,dist.lexis at.
the district court decided that because the ernish judgment was an adjudication with respect to ito and the city,who were named in the genstar policy as additional insureds,and because in the district court view the ernish judgment was also an adjudication with respect to ufi,general star was liable to pay the excess over mutual marine policy limit under the terms of the genstar policy,which provided that an adjudication establishing ultimate net loss was a covered loss.wl at,dist.lexis at.
summary judgment was entered for mutual marine.general star appeals.
discussion 
the judgment in favor of ernish has been satisfied.the question on appeal is whether mutual marine must bear the full a significant amount that exceeds its policy it paid to national union to cover the share of the ernish judgment ufi allegedly owed under the terms of the first agreement,or whether general star is obligated to reimburse mutual marine for that excess.the district court found the latter,that general star was obligated to reimburse mutual marine based on the judgment against ito and the city,both because ito and the city were additional insureds under the genstar policy and because the district court considered the judgment effectively also to be an adjudication against ufi,general star primary insured.we conclude that the district court erred in holding general star obligated to reimburse mutual marine on either of these grounds.because there remains a question,substantially unaddressed in the district court,as to whether general star may be obligated to reimburse mutual marine on other grounds,whether liability was established against ufi by means other than the judgment against ito and the city that would obligate general star to vacate the summary judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings.

federal jurisdiction over this case is based on diversity of citizenship.in the absence of any contractual obligation of the parties to the contrary,we therefore apply the substantive law of the forum state,new york.see,omega eng g,omega,cir.
ii.liability under the first agreement alone 
the district court correctly decided that general star was not directly obligated to reimburse mutual marine under the first agreement,which settled the action brought by ito and the city against ufi see union i,wl at,dist.lexis at.as the district court pointed out,under new york law,a settlement agreement is not binding upon a party unless it is in a writing subscribed by him or his attorney wl at,dist.lexis at quoting new york civil practice laws and rules.because the first agreement was not subscribed to by general star or its attorney or other agent,general star is not directly bound by its terms.see,bonnette long island college.
iii.liability under the genstar policy 
the harder question is whether general star is bound by the terms of its own policy with ufi to reimburse mutual marine.under the terms of the genstar policy,general star was obligated to pay its insured for ultimate net loss in excess of the primary insurer limit.according to the policy 
ultimate net loss means the total amount of damages for which the insured is legally liable.ultimate net loss may be established by adjudication,arbitration or a compromise settlement to which we have previously agreed in writing.
genstar policy at.
while general star appears to have assumed that under paragraph,the legal liability binding an insured could only be established by an adjudication,arbitration,or compromise settlement to which general star agreed that is not what the provision says.it defines ultimate net loss as the total amount of damages for which the insured is legally liable.it then provides that ultimate net loss,thus defined as an amount,may be established by adjudication,arbitration or a compromise settlement to which general star ha s previously agreed in writing.in other words,as mutual marine appears to acknowledge it is the amount of damages for which the insured is legally liable that may be established by adjudication,arbitration or a compromise settlement to which general star ha s previously agreed in writing,not the legal liability itself.the establishment of liability is the predicate to the applicability of the provision rather than being governed by it 
the preliminary issue that must be addressed on this appeal,then,is whether general star insured was legally liable for any amount,which liability would trigger the provision concerning the establishment of the amount of such liability.in other words,only if general star insured was legally liable does the question arise as to whether the amount of that liability was established in a manner consonant with the terms of the genstar policy.
establishment of liability by the ernish lawsuit alone.
the district court decided that the ernish lawsuit,which resulted in the judgment of liability against ito and the city,was an adjudication of liability as to both ito and the city and,ultimately,as to ufi if and when called upon to indemnify ito and the city.union ii,wl at,dist.lexis at.the district court concluded that general star was obligated to reimburse mutual marine based on each of these alleged adjudications of liability.
adjudication as to ito and the city.
the district court was obviously correct in finding that the ernish lawsuit was an adjudication of liability as to ito and the city,against whom the judgment was entered.it does not follow,however,that general star is obligated to reimburse mutual marine on the basis of that adjudication.
mutual marine brought this lawsuit against general star based on ufi rights,to which it had succeeded,not those of ito and the city.only the percent share ostensibly apportioned to ufi in the first agreement has ever been at issue in the litigation against general star,and not the percent share apportioned to ito and the city.indeed,three of the five filed by mutual marine against general star are based explicitly on rights belonging to ufi.see am.ans.to sec.am.compl.
the fourth includes mention of rights allegedly belonging to ito and the city and their insurer,national union,against general star.see am.ans.to sec.am.compl.but in its motion papers before the district court,mutual marine explicitly disavowed the notion that it was basing a claim against general star on claims belonging to ito and the city to the extent that the fourth mentions any rights of ito and the city or their insurer against general star,it does so as background for its assertion that the first the district court has already correctly found not to bind general star beneficial to general star.see generally am.ans.to sec.am.compl.see,am.ans.to sec.am.compl.by virtue of the added insured status of new york city and ito the first agreement reduced by the possibility that any judgment would pierce general star excess umbrella layer of coverage.indeed,mutual marine motion papers refer throughout to ufi,not ito and the city,as the insured.
finally,the fifth asserts a nebulous independent right against general star allegedly belonging to mutual marine.am.ans.to sec.am.compl.it is not alleged to have ever belonged to ito or the city.
thus mutual marine position throughout this litigation has been that general star is liable to it based on its insuring agreement with its insured ufi which obligated it to pay the sums ufi became obligated to pay as a result of an unquestionably covered loss.mem.of law in opp to mot.for summ.at.that continues to be mutual marine position on appeal.see appellee br.describing mutual marine as seeking reimbursement for satisfy ing the judgment entered against ufi fabricators,id.at mutual marine properly showed the district court that there was no question of fact but that general star breached its duties to ufi and that mutual marine acquired ufi right to recover for that breach by general star.
mutual marine is not pursuing any rights that may or may not have belonged to ito and the city or their insurers based on their status as additional insureds.it is therefore immaterial for purposes of this lawsuit whether general star has ever owed ito and the city anything as additional named insureds under the genstar policy.that is not the claim that was made.the material question is whether there was an adjudication of liability against ufi,for which general star would be obligated under the genstar policy to reimburse ufi.
since mutual marine does not assert rights in the place of ito and the city against general star,general star is not liable to mutual marine on the basis of any direct obligation general star may have had to ito and the city arising out of the adjudication in the ernish lawsuit against them.
adjudication as to ufi.
the district court also concluded that the judgment against ito and the city in the ernish lawsuit was an adjudication of liability ultimately of ufi if and when called upon to indemnify ito and the city.union ii,wl at,dist.lexis at parentheses omitted.we disagree.
following ernish filing of the suit against ito and the noted,he did not bring suit against ufi,his and the city filed a action impleading ufi.they claimed that they were entitled to,inter alia,contractual indemnity,common law indemnity,and added insured status.but before this action was litigated to a conclusion,ito and the city reached a settlement with ufi,purportedly executed on its behalf by mutual first of the action and dismissing all claims against ufi with prejudice 
by the time the ernish suit was decided,then,ufi was no longer party to it.when the state trial court directed a verdict of liability against the defendants,ito and the city,and the jury thereafter awarded damages of million reduced on appeal to,judgment was not entered against ufi.
the district court thought it puzzling that general star would complain about the first agreement because,in the court view,absent the first agreement,general star would have been obligated to pay percent of the ernish judgment in excess of mutual marine policy.union ii,wl at,dist.lexis at.in the ernish litigation,ito and the city were held strictly liable for ernish injuries under new york scaffolding law.see labor law ernish,at,at.liability pursuant to this statute is not predicated on fault it is imputed to the owner or contractor by statute and attaches irrespective of whether due care was exercised and without reference to principles of negligence.brown two exch.plaza partners,internal citation omitted.while strict liability attaches under section,i t is well settled that an owner or general contractor who is held strictly liable under labor law is entitled to full indemnification from the party actually responsible for the incident.frank meadowlakes dev,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,if ufi was actually responsible for ernish injuries,it could have become liable to indemnify ito and the city for the judgment against them.
but that outcome was uncertain.a party seeking either contractual or common law indemnity must establish that it was free from any negligence and was held liable solely by virtue of the statutory liability.correia prof l data,dep t see also brown,at,at explaining that new york law prohibit s indemnity agreements in which owners or contractors seek to pass along the risks for their own negligent actions to other contractors or subcontractors,even if the accident was caused only in part by the owner or contractor negligence.emphasis in original.therefore if ufi could prove that ito or the city were negligent in connection with the incident that caused ernish injuries,ufi would not have been obligated to indemnify ito and the city for their losses 
the district court found,nonetheless,and mutual marine urges on appeal,that there was no evidence in the record of negligence on the part of ito or the city and that ufi therefore would not have had to indemnify them.union ii,wl at,dist.lexis at.but the district court was in no position to make that finding at the summary judgment stage,as a matter of law.the question of any such negligence was not before the district court and there was therefore no basis for a belief that the record before the district court contained all possible evidence of such negligence.put another way,the district court was making a finding in a lawsuit that was not before hypothetical action by ito and the city against ufi that was litigated to the finish.
thus the ernish adjudication was not tantamount to an adjudication of legal liability on the part of the relevant insured in this case,ufi.and without an establishment of legal liability,ultimate net loss could not be established either.
establishment of liability pursuant to the first agreement.
although the ernish adjudication did not establish the legal liability of ufi for ernish judgment,the first agreement itself may have.if it was properly executed by mutual marine on behalf of ufi and rendered ufi liable for of the judgment against ito and the city,then the ernish adjudication would have determined not liability,but the amount 
for which ufi was legally liable,thereby constituting an ultimate net loss for which general star was liable under its policy in other words,it is possible that the first agreement,which preceded the ernish adjudication,provided that ufi was liable for the underlying accident at issue in the adjudication,and the adjudication itself then determined the amount for which ufi was legally liable.
at first blush,using the first agreement to establish the legal liability of ufi would appear to violate the condition in the genstar policy that n o insureds will,except at their own cost,voluntarily make a payment,assume any obligation,or incur any expense without our consent,genstar policy,section v,d.but as mutual marine argues and general star appears to concede,general star never issued a disclaimer to that effect,as it was required to do under ins.law d see reyes diamond state ins,dep t an insurer must give written notice of a disclaimer of coverage as soon as is reasonably possible pursuant to ins.law after it first learns of the accident or of grounds for disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage.this rule applies not only to an insurer disclaimer of primary insurance coverage,but to a disclaimer of excess coverage as well.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also mann gulf ins,dep t.
general star argues that it was not required to disclaim coverage because d isclaimer pursuant to insurance law section d is unnecessary when a claim falls outside the scope of the policy coverage portion.see appellant reply br.quoting worcester ins.bettenhauser,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.but it bases this argument on the notion that section vi,paragraph of the genstar policy limited the ways ufi legal liability,rather than simply the amount of such liability,could be established,see appellant reply br,a notion that is incorrect.as we have explained,it did not.general star does not argue that paragraph d alone would take the first agreement outside the scope of the policy coverage portion such that disclaimer would be unnecessary,and such an argument would fail because paragraph d is a policy condition that is plainly in the nature of an exclusion,for which disclaimer is required,and is not part of the coverage portion of the genstar policy.see columbia cas.emergency,dep t it is settled that failure by the insurer to give written notice of disclaimer based on an exclusion or failure to comply with a policy condition as soon as is reasonably possible renders the disclaimer ineffective.emphasis added,internal citation omitted zappone home ins,concluding that insurer did not have to disclaim coverage for accident involving automobile that was not the subject of the insurance policies in question.
therefore section v,paragraph d of the genstar policy does not foreclose the possibility that the first agreement established ufi liability and thereby,in conjunction with the ernish litigation,obligated general star to reimburse mutual marine for the excess mutual marine paid over its policy limit to cover ufi share of the judgment.
general star also argues,however,that it was not required to issue a disclaimer because ufi disavowed any obligation under the first settlement agreement.as such sic,this agreement could not create any obligation to disclaim coverage to ufi or mutual marine.appellant reply br.emphasis in original,internal citations omitted.in letters sent to mutual marine prior to litigation in this matter,ufi represented that it had never authorized mutual marine to execute the first agreement on its behalf.the letters,also sent on behalf of general star,state that it remains clear and fact mutual marine does not even argue to the contrary that neither general star nor ufi ever authorized mutual marine to execute the first agreement on their behalf,letter at,and neither general star nor principals of ufi ever gave permission or express authorization for mutual marine to execute th e first agreement on their behalf.letter from general star and ufi to mutual marine,at may.handwritten notes allegedly written by mutual marine loss secretary prior to the execution of the second agreement regarding national union action against mutual marine,general star,and ufi,indicate,moreover,that mutual marine was concerned about the availability to general star of an argument that ufi never consented to the first agreement.according to the notes,there is n o way ufi will be left without insurance so it s mmo mutual marine gen eral star.if gen eral star get s ufi on its side,its position will be that mutual marine took upon itself to incur exposure past its properly advising ufi.paul smith handwritten notes,may,declaration of natasha van der griendt in opp.to mot.for summ,ex.m,union fire ins.of universal fabricators,civ.sas,doc.
plainly,if ufi was never bound by the first agreement,that agreement could establish no legal liability on the part of ufi for which general star would be liable under the genstar policy.in that case,there would also be no need for general star to have disclaimed.see zappone,at,at,t he legislature in using the words denial of coverage did not intend to require notice when there never was any insurance in effect,and intended by that phrase to cover only situations in which a policy of insurance that would otherwise cover the particular accident is claimed not to cover it because of an exclusion in the policy.matter of arbitration between state farm mut.auto.ins.merrill,dep t it is true that an insurance company is not subject to the timely disclaimer provisions contained in insurance law d where no coverage existed under the policy.
because it granted summary judgment on the grounds of the ernish adjudication alone,the district court appears not to have decided whether the first agreement established the legal liability of ufi and thereby obligated general star to reimburse mutual marine in this action in an amount determined by the outcome of the ernish adjudication.inasmuch as the answer to this question depends on the factual question of whether ufi was ever bound by the first agreement,we think it is a question best left to the district court to answer in the first instance 
remaining arguments 
we have considered general star other arguments on this issue and find them to be without merit.
iv.mutual marine as a volunteer 
general star argues,as it did before the district court,that it was entitled to summary judgment because mutual marine was acting as a volunteer when it agreed to indemnify and defend ufi,pursuant to the second agreement,and when it paid national union the at issue,pursuant to the third agreement.if the payment was indeed voluntary,then general star has no obligation to reimburse mutual marine for it.see merch.mut.ins.group travelers ins,dep t w hen an insurer who is not acting under a mistake of material fact or law assumes the defe
