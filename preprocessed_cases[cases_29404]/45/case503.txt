opinion of the court 
faced with competing claims to the proceeds of a life insurance policy,prudential insurance company of america filed an interpleader complaint against the claimants,seeking to deposit the disputed sum with the district court and withdraw from the proceedings.one of the claimants,robert hovis,then counterclaimed,alleging that prudential had acted negligently and in bad faith in its handling of the policy changes that led to the dispute.the district court ruled that the interpleader action was properly brought,and that,because it was properly brought,prudential could not be held liable for its prior handling of the requested policy changes.
this case requires us to decide how far the protection of the interpleader device extends.does bringing a valid interpleader action shield a stakeholder from further liability to the claimants not only with respect to the amount owed,but also with respect to counterclaims brought by the claimants we hold that it can where the stakeholder bears no blame for the existence of the ownership controversy and the counterclaims are directly related to the stakeholder failure to resolve the underlying dispute in favor of one of the claimants.accordingly,we affirm the order of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
in february,hovis,a prudential representative,sold a life insurance policy in the sum of to bonnie shall,a retired widow the policy designated shall son,david potter,as the primary beneficiary and her daughter,denise gerski,as the contingent beneficiary.shortly thereafter,shall and hovis became romantically involved,and in began to live together.in,shall was diagnosed with a reoccurrence of cancer and given a very grim prognosis.on january,shall submitted through hovis a request to prudential to change ownership of the policy from herself to hovis and to change its primary beneficiary from potter to hovis the request described hovis relationship to shall as that of fiancé.it was signed by both shall and hovis in the presence of a former prudential agent.on february,shall died.
when hovis submitted the policy changes to prudential,he specifically requested that they be processed on an expedited basis,due to shall terminal condition.prudential,however,did not process the changes immediately because of an internal policy prohibiting its sales professionals from having an ownership or beneficiary interest in their clients policies unless they are members of the immediate family of the policyholder.in order to receive an exception to that policy,hovis was required to obtain approval from his managing director and prudential compliance division,something that he had not done at the time the changes were initially submitted.
in february,prudential began an investigation to determine whether to grant an exception in hovis case on the ground that he had an insurable interest in the policy.hovis informed his managing director,steve marziotto,that shall was his fiancé and that they had lived together and shared expenses for two years.at marziotto request,hovis provided two items attempting to verify his relationship with shall a bank letter indicating that hovis had a joint account with shall and a copy of a marriage license.no effort was made by marziotto to communicate with shall,and she died while he was in the midst of his investigation.on march,marziotto recommended that the beneficiary change be allowed,but that the ownership change be denied.five days later,hovis submitted a claim for the life insurance proceeds.
in march,prudential corporate investigations division cid began a separate investigation into the policy changes.the cid had a handwriting analysis done of the request to change,which analysis concluded that,due to shall physical condition when she allegedly signed the request,there was no way to verify the authenticity of her signature.the cid report also concluded that hovis had only been joined with shall on the latter bank account in early,just shortly before she died,and that the marriage license was dated january,and was valid for only sixty days.the cid then forwarded the matter to prudential law division to make an ultimate determination on the putative policy change.in april,prudential advised hovis that it had yet to make a decision.
in may,while prudential was wrapping up its internal investigation,potter,shall son,spoke with prudential about the insurance policy.only then did potter learn that a policy change had been submitted naming hovis as owner and beneficiary.according to potter,hovis had previously deflected all his attempts to check on the status of the insurance proceeds even though hovis had helped him file a claim on his mother other life insurance policy.on learning that the beneficiary change was still being investigated,and that,in the interim,he was listed as the beneficiary of his mother policy,potter informed prudential that he intended to file a claim.in early june,potter sent a letter to prudential asking to have the status of the policy resolved.he also expressed his belief that his mother would not have approved the changes and that hovis must have submitted them fraudulently.
prudential then decided to pursue an interpleader action,rather than resolve who was entitled to the funds.it informed both hovis and potter by letter of this decision,and,on july,prudential brought an interpleader complaint in the eastern district of pennsylvania pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,naming hovis,potter and gerski as defendants.in its complaint,prudential requested permission to deposit its admitted liability with the clerk of th e court,and asked the court to order that the defendants be permanently enjoined from instituting or prosecuting against prudential in a proceeding affecting the insurance proceeds due under the policy and on account of the death of bonnie shall.venue was transferred to the middle district of pennsylvania at hovis request.
hovis filed an answer contending that prudential was not entitled to interpleader relief because prudential has no legally cognizable reason for failing to pay the policy proceeds to hovis.in addition,hovis sought a declaratory judgment against all parties,naming him as the proper beneficiary,and brought counterclaims against prudential for breach of contract,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,bad faith and unfair trade practices,all relating to prudential alleged failure to process shall request to change the ownership and beneficiary of her policy in a timely manner.potter and gerski filed an answer contesting prudential right to pass its failure to resolve ownership of the insurance proceeds onto the claimants themselves,and seeking declaratory judgment against all parties that they were the rightful owners of the proceeds.
prudential moved for summary judgment on both its claim for interpleader relief and hovis counterclaims,arguing that a s the federal rules provide for interpleader in a situation like this,defendant hovis is estopped from counterclaiming for breach of contract,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,bad faith and violations of pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law.stat.ann.et.shortly thereafter,hovis reached a settlement with potter and gerski for distribution of the insurance proceeds.nonetheless,in his brief in opposition to prudential motion for summary judgment,hovis argued that while the issue of who was entitled to the interpleaded funds had become moot,that did not entitle prudential to judgment in its favor on his counterclaims 
on october,the district court dismissed prudential interpleader complaint,along with the various declaratory judgment actions,as moot,and directed prudential to pay the proceeds of the life insurance,plus interest,to hovis,potter and gerski in accordance with their settlement agreement.prudential ins.of am.hovis,wl,at.the court also granted summary judgment to prudential on hovis counterclaims on the ground that the appropriateness of prudential interpleader action shielded it from any liability relating to its failure to resolve the dispute over the interpleaded funds.id.at.hovis timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides in pertinent part that p ersons with claims that may expose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as defendants and required to interplead.a.the purpose of the interpleader device is to allow a party who fears being exposed to the vexation of defending multiple claims to a limited fund or property that is under his control a procedure to settle the controversy and satisfy his obligation in a single proceeding.charles allen wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed,at wright miller.accordingly,interpleader allows a stakeholder who admits it is liable to one of the claimants,but fears the prospect of multiple liability,to file suit,deposit the property with the court,and withdraw from the proceedings.metro life ins.price,cir.the result is that t he competing claimants are left to litigate between themselves,while the stakeholder is discharged from any further liability with respect to the subject of the dispute.id.
the typical interpleader action proceeds in two distinct stages.see nylife,v.the adherence group,cir.during the first stage,the court determines whether the interpleader complaint was properly brought and whether to discharge the stakeholder from further liability to the claimants.united states high tech,cir wright miller,at.during the second stage,the court determines the respective rights of the claimants to the interpleaded funds.nylife,at high technology,at.because hovis came to a private settlement with potter and gerski about how to distribute the life insurance proceeds,the second stage was never reached in this case.the subject of this appeal is what happened at the first district court determination that the interpleader action was properly brought,and that prudential is therefore discharged from any liability relating to hovis counterclaims.
hovis challenges the district court dismissal of his counterclaims on two grounds.first,he argues that prudential lacked the clean hands required of a party bringing an interpleader action and thus was not entitled to the protections such an action offers.he also argues that,even if prudential were entitled to bring an interpleader complaint,that action did not encompass his counterclaims,which,as they are not themselves claims to the disputed funds,fall outside the scope of prudential interpleader action.
was the interpleader action properly brought 
the district court concluded that this case presents the perfect utilization of an interpleader because prudential was presented with competing claims for the life insurance proceeds of shall.hovis,wl,at.hovis does not dispute that,at the time prudential filed for interpleader,it was facing competing claims to the insurance proceeds.rather,his argument is that prudential is at fault for allowing things to get to that point.therefore,he contends,prudential was ineligible for interpleader relief of any kind,as it was not an innocent stakeholder.see farmers irrigating ditch reservoir kane,cir explaining that t he typical plaintiff in interpleader is an innocent stakeholder who is subject to competing claims.
it is true that,b ecause interpleader is an equitable proceeding,it is subject to dismissal based on equitable doctrines.fire ins.asbestospray,cir see also high technology,at noting that among the issues relevant to whether interpleader has been properly invoked is whether any equitable concerns prevent the use of interpleader.indeed,i t is a general rule that a party seeking interpleader must be free from blame in causing the controversy,and where he stands as a wrongdoer with respect to the subject matter of the suit,he can not have relief by interpleader.farmers irrigating ditch,at.
here,however,it is difficult to see how prudential is in any way to blame for causing the controversy.id.what hovis is essentially arguing is that,by failing to process shall request to change the owner and beneficiary of her policy quickly,prudential created circumstances in which there were competing claims to the proceeds.but this argument is premised on the strange idea that the controversy over entitlement to the funds was caused by prudential failure to pay out the proceeds to hovis before potter found out about shall request to have the owner and beneficiary of her policy changed,rather than the unmistakable appearance of impropriety surrounding that request.
there is every indication that,had prudential expedited its investigation and paid out the proceeds to hovis,it would have faced a suit from potter and his sister relating to the same funds.potter said as much in his deposition testimony.thus,insofar as there was a genuine dispute over entitlement to the insurance proceeds,and prudential was not to blame for its existence,the interpleader action was properly brought whether bringing that action immunized prudential against hovis counterclaims is a separate issue,to be addressed in the next section.but prudential was certainly entitled to some measure of interpleader protection.
are hovis counterclaims outside the scope of the interpleader action 
hovis second,and more substantial,argument is that,even if the district court were correct in concluding that prudential interpleader action was properly brought,it nonetheless erred by dismissing his counterclaims.that is because,according to hovis,those counterclaims are not claims to the interpleaded funds and thus fall outside the scope of prudential interpleader action.
under the old interpleader practice,if a claimant alleged that the stakeholder was independently liable to him or her,the stakeholder would lose its right to bring the interpleader action.see libby,mcneill libby city bank,cir note,the independent liability rule as a bar to interpleader in the federal courts,yale.the modern approach,however,is that,where a claimant brings an independent counterclaim against the stakeholder,the stakeholder is kept in the litigation to defend against the counterclaim,rather than being dismissed after depositing the disputed funds with the court.see high technology,at wayzata bank trust v.a b farms,cir libby,at.that is what hovis argues should have occurred should have been required to face hovis counterclaims even after entitlement to the disputed funds was resolved.
to assess this argument,it is necessary to determine how far interpleader protection extends.hovis argues that it extends only to the claimants competing claims to the funds.if so,his counterclaims are plainly independent of prudential interpleader action.while each relates to prudential handling of shall life insurance policy,each nonetheless attempts to subject prudential to liability apart from its duty to account for the insurance proceeds.
hovis proposed understanding of the scope of interpleader protection is not without support.because what entitles a stakeholder to bring an interpleader action in the first place is the prospect of multiple liability,in the typical case the protection provided by that device is limited to the interpleaded defendants competing claims to the stake.thus,the normal rule is that interpleader protection does not extend to counterclaims that are not claims to the interpleaded funds.state farm fire cas.tashire,d cautioning that interpleader was never intended to be an bill of peace.
this is not the typical case,however.here,each of hovis counterclaims concern prudential failure to resolve its investigation in his favor and pay out the life insurance proceeds to him.see hovis,wl,at we are quite certain that if prudential had immediately paid hovi
