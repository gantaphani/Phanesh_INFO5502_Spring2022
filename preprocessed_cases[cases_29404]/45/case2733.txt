in this appeal,we apply the rule that the plain meaning of insurance policy language may be established by considering such language in the context of the entire policy,even though,in other contexts,it might have a different meaning.the question presented by this case is the proper interpretation to be given to the wrongful eviction portion of the personal injury coverage provisions contained in a standard commercial general liability cgl policy.the defendant,appellant and,california insurance guarantee association ciga,argues that due to the specific language of the policy there can be no coverage liability for a claim for wrongful eviction of an organization in this case,a corporation,because coverage is only extended under the policy to a claim by a natural person.the plaintiffs,respondents and,on the other hand,insist that it would be improper to read so narrowly the personal injury coverage provisions.they contend that there is coverage for a wrongful eviction claim whether it is brought against the insured by a person or an organization.the trial court,on stipulated facts,sided with plaintiffs and entered judgment in their favor.
an examination of the policy demonstrates that when the word person is used in isolation elsewhere in the policy,it clearly means a natural person.under principles of policy construction,which require us to consider disputed language in the context of the policy as a whole,it should be given the same meaning in the disputed clause before us.when the disputed language is so construed,its plain meaning is explicit,clear and unambiguous.whatever contrary expectations of coverage mirpad,as a commercial landlord,may have had,they could not have been objectively reasonable.thus,we conclude that the trial court erred and the construction of the disputed policy language advocated by ciga is correct.we will therefore reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in december,mirpad purchased a commercial office building located at south,foothills plaza,phoenix,arizona the building.one of the tenants in the building was pos systems,a corporation pos,which had leased square feet in the building the premises.
after mirpad purchased the building,it retained allred to manage it.in april,allred notified pos that it was in default under the terms of its lease.later in that month,allred locked pos out of the premises.at about the same time,pos filed a chapter petition in bankruptcy.one anthony mason was appointed as the bankruptcy trustee.
in december,the trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the several plaintiffs,alleging multiple causes of action,including wrongful termination,breach of the lease and fraudulent transfer,wrongful lockout.in april,a second lawsuit was filed against the plaintiffs.this was filed in the arizona superior court maricopa county.the plaintiff in that action was one ken macdonald the founder,president and chief executive officer of pos.his complaint concerned the same acts,facts and transactions alleged in the mason action.there is no dispute that these two actions collectively,the underlying actions alleged injuries arising from,and damages and other relief for,an alleged wrongful eviction.
at the time of pos alleged eviction from the premises,both mirpad and allred were named insureds in a cgl policy issued by united pacific insurance company united pacific with a coverage limit of million.the policy included coverage for personal injury and advertising injury liability.pursuant to that coverage,united pacific promised to pay those sums to which this insurance applies,that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury italics added.the policy defined the term personal injury as injury other than bodily injury,arising out of one or more of the following offenses false arrest,detention or imprisonment malicious prosecution wrongful eviction from,wrongful entry into,or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a a room b a dwelling or c premises that a person occupies by or on behalf of its owner,landlord or lessor oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services or oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy.italics added.
defense of the underlying actions was tendered to united pacific.on october,prior to responding to that tender,united pacific was declared insolvent by an order issued by the insurance commissioner of the commonwealth of pennsylvania as a result of such an order,united pacific became an insolvent insurer within the meaning of insurance code section.tender of the defense to the underlying actions was therefore referred to ciga on or about july,ciga denied coverage and rejected the tender.plaintiffs,at their own expense,defended the underlying actions,incurring defense costs in excess of.
on july,plaintiffs filed this action for declaratory relief and for violation of insurance code,section plaintiffs sought a resolution of ciga claim that there was no coverage under the united pacific policy and a judgment for damages,which they expressly limited to in their fact stipulation,the parties also included their respective contentions with regard to the issue of coverage.it is ciga position that plaintiffs claims are not covered claims because the coverage under the policy issued by united pacific for personal injury,arising out of a wrongful eviction from premises,applies only where the tenant allegedly wrongfully evicted was a person as opposed to an organization.plaintiffs,on the other hand,contend that coverage under the united pacific policy,and the applicable provisions of the insurance code,does extend to an organization.therefore,it is argued,ciga is obligated to pay for the fees and costs incurred by them in connection with the defense of the underlying actions and,in particular,to reimburse the plaintiffs for such fees and costs that they have paid up to a maximum of.
on february,the parties filed competing motions for judgment on the pleadings based on the stipulation of facts and their respective positions,all as summarized above.the matter came on for hearing on march,and the trial court ruled in plaintiffs favor,rejecting ciga arguments as to the lack of coverage under the united pacific policy.the court characterized the dispute as whether the policy covers organizations in the context of personal injuries for wrongful evictions.without attempting to construe or interpret the relevant policy language with respect to the scope and meaning of the word person,the trial court adopted as controlling the definition of that word set out in insurance code section the court noted that the word person was not defined in the policy,but was defined as a matter of state law.
thereafter,on april,the trial court entered judgment in plaintiffs favor and awarded in damages ciga has prosecuted this timely appeal and the parties make the same contentions that they did in the trial court,as already discussed 
discussion 
standard of review 
in light of the circumstance that this matter is presented to us upon a written stipulation of facts also relied upon by the trial court,and involves only a pure question of law as to the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions in the united pacific policy,we apply a de novo standard of review.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller.
ciga can only be liable for a covered claim 
ciga was created by legislation in,et to establish a fund from which insureds could obtain financial and legal assistance in the event their insurers become insolvent,that is to provide insurance against loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies.citations.isaacson california ins.guarantee cal d,italics added.
ciga is only liable for a covered claim.a covered claim means the obligation of an insolvent insurer,including those imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer,subd.c italics added.thus,it seems clear that the claims asserted in the underlying actions can only be covered claims if they are within the coverage of united pacific policy.if,but for an insurer insolvency,a claim would not have been within the coverage of the insurer policy,such insolvency would not create any broader obligation for ciga.in other words,ciga statutory obligations can not be any greater than those of the insolvent insurer had it remained solvent.w e conclude that the legislature intended the phrase within the coverage of an insurance policy in section,subdivision c to mean within the risks of loss protected against by an insurance policy.thus,the reading of the pertinent portion of subdivision c would be the obligations of an insolvent insurer within the risks of loss protected against by an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer.we believe this reading is faithful to the legislative intent.aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee th,d,fn.omitted.
in this case,however,plaintiffs are seeking only to recover for costs of defense that they incurred in resisting the claims asserted in the underlying actions.they do not seek to recover any damages for ciga failure to discharge a duty to indemnify.an insurer owes a duty to defend any claim for which there is a potential for coverage under the policy.gray zurich insurance cal d,wausau underwriters ins.unigard security ins.th,d.in other words,the duty to defend arises whenever the lawsuit against the insured seeks damages on any theory that,if proved,would be covered by the policy.thus,a defense is excused only when the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,italics added.it is settled that the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.id.at,d.thus,an insurer may have a duty to defend even when it ultimately has no obligation to indemnify,either because no damages are awarded in the underlying action or because the actual judgment is for damages not covered by the policy.borg transamerica ins.th,d.if coverage depends on an unresolved dispute over a factual question,the very existence of that dispute would establish a possibility of coverage and thus a duty to defend.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d.however,where as here the only potential for coverage turns on resolution of a legal question,there is no duty to defend see waller,supra,cal th at,d,financial cigna property casualty companies th,d,unless and until the coverage issue is resolved in favor of the insured.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.as the supreme court recently stated,if,as a matter of law,neither the complaint nor the known extrinsic facts indicate any basis for potential coverage,the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance.scottsdale ins.mv transportation cal th,d.thus,ciga can only avoid liability by demonstrating,as a matter of law,that there was no possibility of coverage for the wrongful eviction claim asserted against plaintiffs.
as we now explain,the issue of coverage in this case is an issue of law turning upon proper construction of the united pacific policy.depending on how we construe the relevant policy language,there will either be coverage or there will not.it will be conclusive,one way or the other.
relevant general principles of policy construction 
the rules pertaining to contractual interpretation are clearly delineated in published case law,and apply equally to insurance contracts.they are summarized in palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d,i nterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.citation.while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.thus,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.citation.if possible,we infer this intent solely from the written provisions of the insurance policy.citation.if the policy language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation.when interpreting a policy provision,we must give its terms their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.citation.we must also interpret these terms in context citation,and give effect to every part of the policy with each clause helping to interpret the other.citations.id.at,d,italics added.
the clear and explicit meaning of policy provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.citations.a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citations.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.waller,supra,cal th at,d.italics added.
our supreme court has long followed the same meaning rule in the construction of contracts.words used in a certain sense in one part of an instrument are deemed to have been used in the same sense in another.citations.caminetti pac.mutual ins.cal d,see also zurich american ins.cal th,d.similarly,while most words,when considered in isolation,may have more than one definition or usage,in construing a contract the court function is not merely to import all of the possible definitions or even the broadest definition,but to glean the meaning of the words from the context and usage of the words in the contract itself.fire ins.exchange superior court th,d.
put another way,it is not a court function to select a particular definition of a single word and apply it without regard to other language in the policy.reserve insurance pisciotta cal d.ambiguity is not necessarily to be found in the fact that a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more than one meaning.citation.castro fireman fund american life ins.d.as we have already stated,the critical principle is that an insurance policy must be interpreted as a whole and in context.waller,supra,cal th at,d.
the word person as used in the united pacific policy necessarily refers to a natural person 
united pacific promised coverage for a claim arising out of a wrongful eviction from,wrongful entry into,or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a a room b a dwelling or c premises that a person occupies by or on behalf of its owner,landlord or lessor italics added.plaintiffs argued and the trial court held that the word person as used in the quoted provision must be construed to include organization such as the corporate claimant pos in the underlying actions.but as already noted,we must read the quoted policy language not in isolation but in the context of the entire policy.an examination of how the isolated word person is used throughout the policy including even in another provision of the personal injury clause demonstrates that it is consistently used to refer only to natural persons.see fn,post.other types of legal entities,corporations,partnerships or joint ventures on the other hand,are clearly characterized as organizations.
as the policy repeatedly uses the words person and organization separately and distinctly,these two words must be accorded their separate and distinct meanings.even within the definition of personal injury itself,the word person without the word organization is used in connection with the offenses of wrongful eviction and invasion of right of privacy but the term person or organization is used with respect to the defamation offenses where coverage is expressly extended to include a claim by an organizational entity.it is stipulated that the tenant,pos,was a corporation,and thus,it was an organization.since the policy only provided personal injury coverage for wrongful eviction from a room,dwelling or premises that a person occupies italics added,it would seem that such coverage should not extend to the wrongful eviction of organizations such as pos 
we are persuaded that the words person and organization,as used in the united pacific policy,must be given separate meanings.any other interpretation would be unreasonable given the repeated usage of those terms in contexts where there is no doubt as to the meaning intended.it is clear that what plaintiffs seek to do is have us construe the word person as used in the wrongful eviction clause to include organization even though they concede that in all other places where the word person is used in the policy it means a natural person.
this contention runs contrary to existing law.quite apart from its same meaning rule of construction,discussed above,the supreme court has expressly adopted a clear approach to the definition of separate words separately utilized in an insurance policy.for example,in,national union fire ins.cal th,d,the court held that where a policy used the words suit and claim separately,they must have separate meanings.as the court stated,m oreover,the policies do not treat the terms suit and claim as interchangeable,but consistently treat them separately.citation omitted.this careful separation indicates that the insurers differing rights and obligations with respect to suit s and claim s were deliberately and intentionally articulated in the policies.citations.id.at,d,italics added see also zurich american ins,supra,cal th at,d,significantly,the word theft is used both in the vehicle theft exclusion and its exception.despite this,zurich would have us find that the vehicle theft exclusion applies generally to all thefts from a vehicle,while the exception applies only to the greater crime of robbery.accepting zurich interpretation would require that we give different meanings to the same term used in the same policy paragraph.this would run afoul of the rule of contract interpretation that the same word used in an instrument is generally given the same meaning unless the policy indicates otherwise.citations.
the conclusion that person as used in the context of the offense of wrongful eviction refers to only a natural person is further supported by noting the places from which the eviction must take place are places where people live.the relationship between eviction and the intent that it be from a place where people live is consistent with the places listed in the definition of personal injury wrongful eviction from a room,a dwelling or a premises.under the principle of ejusdem generis,the general word premises should be defined in the same class or nature of the more specific words that precede it.see waranch gulf insurance d.private occupancy,when grouped with wrongful entry and wrongful eviction,could only mean occupancy of real property,not a motor vehicle martin marietta insurance of north america th,d the policy term o ther invasion of the right of private occupancy must be read as similar to terms eviction and trespass appearing in the same coverage phrase.a room is a a partitioned part of the inside of a building esp such a part used as a lodging.a dwelling is a shelter as a house or building in which people live.a premise is a building or part of a building usu ally with its appurtenances as grounds.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary.obviously,the word premises is the more general of the three terms,but,as noted,settled rules of construction compel us to conclude that it is of the same class as the other two.see also truck ins.exchange bennett th,d.
moreover,if,as was done by the trial court,person is interpreted to include organizations,the word organization in the phrase person or organization becomes redundant and surplusage.this is contrary to well established rules of construction.it is a very fundamental principle that policy language be so construed as to give effect to every term.see,fireman fund ins.superior court th,d a court must strive to give every term meaning unless to do so would render the term inconsistent or contradictory martin marietta insurance of north america,supra,th at,d quoting union oil international ins.th,d,and noting that an interpretation that gives effect to every clause is preferred over one that would render other policy terms meaningless aiu ins.superior court cal d,construing the phrase damages the insured is legally obligated to pay and declining to adopt interpretation of the term damage that would render the phrase legally obligated to pay moot.
the policy discretely uses the term organization twelve times and the phrase person or organization twenty times.the trial court ruling effectively renders such usage in the policy superfluous and meaningless,or worse,creates an ambiguity where none otherwise existed.the problem created by construing the terms person and organization as interchangeable is no more evident than in the clause relating to the offense of libel or slander that is part of the policy definition of personal injury.if the word organization is redundant and therefore unnecessary,then the offense of libel and slander is effectively rewritten to read oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or disparages a person goods,products or services.to do so,however,creates an ambiguity as to whether the policy covers commercial slander as well as personal libel and slander.these are different offenses.as written,the policy clearly covers both offenses.an interpretation of the policy that creates an ambiguity where none existed by rendering words redundant or superfluous violates all rules of construction.acl technologies,northbrook property casualty ins.th,d.
if the term organization is not redundant or surplusage,then to interpret person as the trial court has done to include an organization in the context of the offense of wrongful eviction,while recognizing that person within the phrase person or organization in the libel and slander clause must refer only to natural persons,is to confer on the word person two separate and distinct meanings within the same personal injury coverage clause.only by giving the word person its plain and ordinary meaning as referring to a natural person that is distinct from the word organization can a violation of fundamental construction rules be avoided.
in adopting the insurance code statutory definition of person as the basis of its ruling,the trial court failed to recognize that the definitional language of insurance code,section was intended to govern the construction and interpretation of the insurance code.it provided no authority for the trial court to ignore its obligation to apply the settled rules of construction that we have discussed above.indeed,what the trial court did,in effect,was to confer on the word person a technical meaning which should not be done unless it is clear from the policy that this was intended.armstrong world industries,aetna casualty surety th,d.in this case,there clearly was no such intent.indeed,the policy language demonstrated that the intent was otherwise.as the supreme court emphasized in,supra,cal th,d,when an insurance policy consistently treats separately two different words,it indicates that the insurer differing rights and obligations were deliberately and intentionally articulated id.at,d,italics added.
the united pacific policy did not contain policy language that was written specifically for mirpad,such that mirpad could have had an objectively reasonable expectation that the policy would afford coverage for the alleged wrongful eviction of corporate tenants.in interpreting the policy,there is no principled basis for the court to import into the policy a technical statutory meaning of the common word person.rather,as illustrated above,reading the words person and organization as used in the policy as a whole,affording these words their ordinary,layperson meaning,mandates a conclusion that person as used in the definition of personal injury relating to wrongful eviction,like every other use of the word person throughout the policy,means a natural person.
this case presents a paradigmatic example of the now well established principle that a court,in determining the plain meaning of policy language,must not only interpret that language in its ordinary and popular sense,but also in the context of its usage in the policy
