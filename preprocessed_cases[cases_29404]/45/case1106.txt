timothy brainard,george chanter,robert domachowski,and james dovak collectively plaintiffs appeal from a summary judgment entered in the district court in favor of american skandia life assurance corporation aslac.plaintiffs complaint,filed against aslac and kevin neil and company securities hereinafter referred to collectively as the,alleges wrongdoing in connection with the purchase of certain annuity contracts from aslac.plaintiffs first contend that the court erred by finding that no agency relationship existed between the and aslac.second,plaintiffs assert that the court wrongly termed the opinion of their chosen expert conclusory and thereafter disregarded the expert declaration.third,plaintiffs argue that the court improperly granted a portion of aslac motion to dismiss and,fourth,inappropriately disallowed plaintiffs from amending their complaint to add a necessary party.finally,plaintiffs complain that the district court erroneously failed to strike a declaration submitted by aslac attorney in support of its motion for summary judgment.we disagree and affirm the judgment.
plaintiffs are unsophisticated investors who sought out financial advice from the in connection with the investment of retirement funds totaling in doing so,plaintiffs indicated to the that they wished to pursue conservative investments.the recommended that plaintiffs purchase variable annuities offered by aslac and,in response,plaintiffs completed an application for an american skandia advisor plan ii asap ii variable annuity.by signing that application,each plaintiff acknowledged receipt of a copy of the prospectus,and that annuity payments are variable and not guaranteed as to a dollar amount.
the prospectus referenced in the asap ii application revealed the particular features of the annuity and,in particular,contained sections discussing applicable fees and charges.a particular portion of the prospectus allowed plaintiffs to authorize a financial representative to decide on the allocation of their account value and to make financial transactions between investment options,subject to aslac rules.significantly,the prospectus goes on to state as follows 
we or an affiliate of ours may provide administrative support to financial representatives who make transfers on your behalf.these financial representatives may be firms or persons who are appointed by us as authorized sellers of the annuity.however,we do not offer you advice about how to allocate your account value under any circumstance.any financial firm or representative you engage to provide advice make transfers for you is not acting on our behalf.we are not responsible for any recommendations such financial representatives make,any market timing or asset allocations programs they choose to follow or any specific transfers they make on your behalf.
on the day of signing their asap ii applications,plaintiffs,acting pursuant to the prospectus,appointed the as their registered investment adviser by signing a document entitled investment advisory contract.in pertinent part,that document reflected that the would serve as plaintiffs and as agent with authority to act in the name of plaintiffs on behalf of the plaintiffs with respect to the election,implementations,purchase,sale and timing of the contract owner mutual fund accounts or.
in the days following plaintiffs execution of the investment advisory contract iac,plaintiffs received the annuities themselves,including a variable annuity contract.on the first page of that document,it conspicuously cautioned that i n the accumulation period any payments and values provided under the variable investment options are based on their investment performance and are,therefore,not guaranteed.that front page likewise provided plaintiffs with a day window,during which plaintiffs could return the annuity and receive a refund.
shortly after finalizing execution of the investment advisory contract,plaintiffs entered into an investment allocation services agreement iasa with the.in pertinent part,that document noted that aslac will accept on behalf of plaintiffs,instructions from the to reallocate cash value among the investment options provided under the annuity based upon the advisor investment expertise in order to take advantage of changes in the market.significantly,the iasa expressly warned that aslac has no responsibility or liability with respect to the transactions contemplated by this agreement.
despite plaintiffs requests to the contrary,the apparently made a series of investments which were unsuitable for plaintiffs given their ages and investment objectives.those decisions led to precipitous market losses starting in.plaintiffs thereafter filed suit against aslac,kevin individually,and company in cuyahoga county court of common pleas on june.defendant aslac filed a notice of removal to the northern district of ohio on august.plaintiffs complaint originally alleged fifteen claims,which aslac moved to dismiss on september.by order dated april,the court dismissed all but four of plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs then asked the court to reconsider its ruling or,alternatively,to allow plaintiffs to amend their complaint to cure certain pleading deficiencies.
although the court denied plaintiffs motion to reconsider,it granted in part plaintiffs motion to amend,thereby allowing plaintiffs to amend six of their claims.rather than simply amending those claims,plaintiffs all fifteen counts and added prudential financial,as a new party defendant.after reviewing the amended complaint,the court issued an order striking,sua sponte,prudential as a party defendant,noting that the deadline to add new parties had long since passed,and plaintiffs failed even to seek leave to add prudential as a party defendant 
aslac then filed its motion for summary judgment on july,which plaintiffs opposed.plaintiffs also filed a motion to strike declaration of matthew solum in support of motion for summary judgment and attached exhibits from the record on september,hereinafter solum declaration.by order dated november,the court granted summary judgment in favor of aslac.in doing so,the court agreed with aslac that plaintiffs had failed to come forward with any evidence whatever reflecting an agency relationship between the and aslac.as for plaintiffs motion to strike the solomon declaration,the court stated in a footnote at the conclusion of its opinion as follows 
the grounds for plaintiffs motion is that solum is simply an attorney for the defendant and has no personal knowledge regarding any of the facts alleged in his declaration or any of the exhibits attached thereto.further,plaintiffs argue that solum declaration improperly sets forth legal arguments and attempts to authenticate exhibits.the court rules as follows.the court grants plaintiffs motion to the extent solum declaration contains any legal argument or unsupported factual assertions grants plaintiffs motion with regard to any exhibits which are not independently authenticated by deposition testimony and denies plaintiffs motion with regard to any exhibits which are independently authenticated by deposition testimony.

plaintiffs first assert that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that no agency relationship existed between aslac and the for the purpose of investment decisions.for support,plaintiffs highlight deposition testimony given by aslac experts who both indicated that an agency relationship existed between aslac and the.plaintiffs likewise direct this court to kevin insurance license with the state of ohio,which aslac signed and,in doing so,agreed to accept the responsibility for the management and supervision of the applicant while engaged in the business of insurance.
an agency relationship may arise pursuant to several theories.first,actual agency occurs where a consensual relationship exists between the agent and principal.funk hancock,ohio app d.agency relationships may also arise from apparent agency or agency by estoppel.agosto leisure world travel,ohio app d.the principal ratification of the unauthorized acts of another may also establish an agency relationship.eske,sucher,at given that the existence of an agency relationship is a question of fact,rather than one of law,mcsweeney jackson,ohio app d,the court should have denied aslac motion if any conflicting evidence of an agency relationship between plaintiffs and aslac was presented.in this case,plaintiffs argue that the instant facts potentially raise all three types of agency discussed above.
actual authority.
ohio law reflects that actual agency occurs where there is a consensual relationship between the agent and principal.flick westfield ins,wl,at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.such actual agency may be informally created and the assent of the parties thereto may be either express or implied.wisor zimmerman,wl,at,ohio app.lexis,at ohio.march,citation omitted see damon missouri,davis,ohio,noting an agent,acting within the scope of his actual authority,expressly or impliedly conferred,can bind the principal.simply stated,express authority is that authority which is directly granted to or conferred upon the agent or employee in express terms by the principal,and it extends only to such powers as the principal gives the agent in direct terms.davis,at.in contrast,an agent implied authority may arise from the express delegation of actual authority and unless its extent is otherwise expressly limited,implied authority carries with it the power to do all that which is reasonably necessary to carry into effect the power actually conferred.id.citing spengler sonnenberg,ohio.
in this case,no actual agency relationship,be it express or implied,was created between the and aslac.although,as noted,plaintiffs suggest that the deposition testimony given by aslac experts indicates the presence of an agency relationship between aslac and the,the district court rejected this argument.in doing so,the court properly noted that although the experts recognized that an actual agency relationship existed between aslac and the,that relationship was limited solely to the selling of aslac insurance products.as the district court observed,agency for the purpose of selling defendant products is far different from agency for the purpose of providing investment advice.accord aluminum line prods.motors,ohio app d,a gency for the one purpose does not necessarily imply agency for the other.quoting funk,at.
plaintiffs further argue that an insurance product sales agreement ipsa creates an issue of material fact with regard to whether an agency relationship existed between aslac and the for the purpose of investment advice.that document,however,reflects an agreement whereby aslac authorize d the to solicit sales of contracts identified in the attached schedule s.pursuant to the ipsa,that authorization was limited solely to the extent expressly granted in this agreement.no further authority is granted or implied.thus,as the district court found,a grant of authority to solicit sales and payments can not be equated to a grant of authority to provide investment advice on behalf of american skandia 
contrary to plaintiffs contentions,no implicit agency relationship existed between aslac and the.plaintiffs rely chiefly on their own deposition testimony,which generally reflects their belief that aslac would watch over their retirement monies.pursuant to ohio law,however,plaintiffs subjective beliefs are irrelevant to the inquiry governing the existence of actual authority.see chevrolet calhoun,ohio,at a n implied agency exists by reason of actual authority given implicitly by the principal to the agent and does not depend upon what a third party may believe to be the agency relationship.citing rubbo hughes provision,ohio app.thus,the district court properly held that plaintiffs subjective beliefs regarding the relationship between the and aslac is simply not relevant to the issue of actual authority.accordingly,no agency relationship was created by a grant of actual authority from aslac to the for the purpose of giving investment advice.
apparent authority.
for similar reasons,no apparent authority agency relationship existed between aslac and the.for an agent to bind the principal in the context of apparent authority,the presented evidence must reflect that the principal held the agent out to the public as possessing sufficient authority to embrace the particular act in question,or knowingly permitted him to act as having such authority,and that the person dealing with the agent knew of the facts and acting in good faith had reason to believe and did believe that the agent possessed the necessary authority.master consol.bancohio bank,ohio.in this regard,t he apparent power of an agent is to be determined by the act of the principal and not by the acts of the agent.accord logsdon inv,ohio app.
plaintiffs again offer their deposition testimony in support of their apparent authority claim.again,however,a court focus during an inquiry into the existence of apparent authority must be on the acts of the principal and whether those actions manifested a conveyance of authority to the agent.see cupac,ins.agency,noting the touchstone of apparent authority is the principal conduct toward a third party and not the agent citing logsdon,at.plaintiffs reliance on their own testimony sheds no light on this inquiry and,accordingly,their arguments must fail 
for the totality of the foregoing reasons,no agency theory supports the conclusion that aslac should somehow be held liable for the consequences of the investment advice.significantly,each plaintiff testified that his financial damages arose from the investment decisions.moreover,as discussed above,aslac expressly distanced itself from any investment decisions via a number of binding documents,such as the prospectus,the iac,and the iasa.as the district court properly found,the record is devoid of evidence reflecting the existence of such a relationship.accordingly,summary judgment was appropriate.
plaintiffs next assign error to the district court decision to reject the opinions of their expert,john duval.specifically,they argue that duval based his expert opinion that aslac had full knowledge of the actions in part on the following kevin once gave aslac ideas for subaccounts an aslac employee attended one of the financial planning seminars the supplied marketing materials that including information about aslac annuities certain employees at aslac knew about the seminars and the were the nation largest distributor of aslac annuities.thus,plaintiffs conclude,the district court erroneously disregarded the duval affidavit as conclusory.
as a baseline premise,i n rulings on the admissibility of expert opinion evidence,the trial court has broad discretion and its rulings must be sustained unless manifestly erroneous.viterbo dow chem,cir citation omitted.an expert opinion submitted in the context of a summary judgment motion must be more than a conclusory assertion about ultimate legal issues.id.quoting hayes douglas dynamics,cir see fed.civ.e.moreover,an expert opinion must set forth facts and,in doing so,outline a line of reasoning arising from a logical foundation.am.key cole,cir.thus,a n expert who supplies nothing but a bottom line supplies nothing of value to the judicial process.fertilizer exch.bank,cir citing richardson.
