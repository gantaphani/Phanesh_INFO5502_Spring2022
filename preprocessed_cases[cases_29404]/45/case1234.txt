lora liskowitz applied for disability insurance benefits more than eight years ago.an administrative law judge initially denied her claim,was reversed by the district court and subsequently denied her claim following a second administrative hearing.the district court affirmed the alj second decision.although this second decision is less clear than it might have been,the decision was supported by substantial evidence.we affirm.
lora liskowitz was born with a congenitally deformed left hip.as a consequence of her hip condition,she underwent multiple surgical procedures as a child,including a procedure when she was twelve to equalize the length of her legs by removing growth material from her right tibia and femur plates.she reports that she has experienced pain in her knee,hips and back ever since.in spite of the pain,she was able to work for fifteen years in her parents waterbed factory,splitting her time between the upholstery shop and the factory office,where she performed basic clerical tasks.however,she stopped working in because,by her own account,her pain grew progressively worse,and she became incapable of performing even sedentary clerical tasks.
liskowitz testified that since she stopped working,she has been bedridden for all but a few hours each day and that she can remain seated without discomfort only for ten minutes at a time.her assessment of her own condition is at least partly corroborated by her rheumatologist,doctor joseph bretza.liskowitz began seeing bretza in,after she initially tested positive for rheumatoid arthritis.in,bretza completed a questionnaire in which he indicated that liskowitz can remain seated only for an hour at a time,that she can use her hands only for twenty percent of an workday and that she has suffered from these limitations since.
the record shows,however,that prior to,liskowitz was more functionally capable than she now admits.for instance,in her examining physician noted,contrary to bretza retrospective assessment,that liskowitz had no significant upper extremity limitations.between and,multiple healthcare providers noted that she was fully able to perform household and child care duties,and was not otherwise limited in activities of daily living.and in,a healthcare a nurse that liskowitz had lost weight since giving birth to her third child,and that her exercise regime included some walking.
liskowitz own statements also belie her claim that she has been incapable of sedentary activity since.in,she told her doctors at the milwaukee medical clinic that she does a lot of squatting,kneeling and lifting off the floor of her young children,who were five and seven months at the time she expanded on this claim at her initial administrative hearing in,where she admitted that she alone was responsible for the care of her children,and testified that she walked or drove her eldest daughter to school,changed diapers,made lunch and occasionally dinner,did some vacuuming and dusting,washed dishes,did laundry and shopped for groceries.she also testified that she was able to control her pain by taking celebrex and vicodin.as she stated at the time,t he celebrex is awesome.
two state agency physicians concluded that liskowitz was capable of standing for two hours and sitting for six hours in an workday.the alj concurred,finding that she was capable of sedentary work and that her testimony to the contrary was not credible.liskowitz appealed the alj decision,and in the district court remanded the case for a new administrative hearing based on problems with the testimony of an expert witness.however,the district court affirmed the alj findings regarding liskowitz credibility.liskowitz does not challenge,or indeed even mention,this aspect of the district court decision on appeal.
following the remand,liskowitz appears to have changed her theory of the case.in the second hearing,liskowitz emphasized swelling and pain in her hands,which she did not even mention in the first hearing,as evidence of her disability.based in part on her previous factual findings,the alj refused to fully credit either liskowitz own testimony or the corroborating testimony of her rheumatologist.instead,the alj found that liskowitz remained capable of sedentary work through december,when her insured status expired.the alj credited the testimony from an expert witness who identified unskilled jobs in the milwaukee area that a person with liskowitz background and limitations would have been capable of performing.the appeals council denied review.
the alj denied benefits initially in,and again in.only the decision is at issue here.because the appeals council declined to review the alj second ruling,this ruling constitutes the agency final decision.getch astrue,cir.we review this decision directly without giving deference to the district court decision.elder astrue,cir.we will uphold the alj decision if it is supported by substantial evidence,see g,which means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d.
to qualify for disability benefits,a claimant must be disabled,a e,which the social security act defines as an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.id.at d a.further,a claimant must show that the disability arose while he or she was insured for benefits.see a a,c sienkiewicz barnhart,cir per curiam 
social security regulations prescribe a test for determining whether a claimant is disabled within the meaning of the act.see.only the fifth requires the alj to determine the claimant residual functional capacity and to ascertain whether there are a significant number of jobs that the claimant could at issue here.
in considering whether a claimant is capable of work,an alj must determine the claimant residual functional capacity,which is the work he or she can still do despite his or her physical and mental limitations.a hickman apfel,cir.in the present case,because the alj found that liskowitz was capable of sedentary work in april and liskowitz has not challenged this finding on this appeal,our review is limited.the only question that remains is whether there was substantial evidence for the alj determination that liskowitz condition did not become dramatically worse in the roughly one and years between the alj first decision and expiration of liskowitz insured status.
liskowitz argues that it was error for the alj to refuse to credit her own testimony regarding her functional limitations.we are not persuaded.first,and most obviously,the alj had found liskowitz to be a witness in the first hearing,and was entitled to rely on this finding in the second hearing.see berger astrue,cir an alj is entitled to view the testimony of an applicant who has been deceptive with skepticism.this is not to say that having found liskowitz to have exaggerated her symptoms once,the alj could automatically disregard her testimony in the second hearing.but this is not what happened here.instead,the alj found that liskowitz testimony at the second hearing was inconsistent both with the alj prior findings and with liskowitz own testimony during the first hearing.having already found the witness to have exaggerated her symptoms,and having reasonably observed that the witness account of those symptoms materially changed from the first hearing to the second,there was nothing improper about the alj adherence to her previous credibility determination.
but even if it were somehow improper for the alj to adhere to her previous credibility assessment,this would still not justify a second remand.a second problem with liskowitz argument is that her testimony at the second hearing did not speak to the one narrow point regarding her functional limitations that was still at issue in the second hearing.again,the alj had previously found that liskowitz was capable of sedentary work prior to.liskowitz appealed this finding to the district court and lost.she has not pursued her challenge to the alj findings in this appeal.thus,to be entitled to disability benefits,liskowitz would have had to show that her condition became dramatically worse between,when the alj rendered her initial decision,and,when liskowitz insured status expired.however,liskowitz had practically nothing to say during the second hearing about how her condition had changed.on the contrary,although she stated that she has gradually declined over the years,she also testified that her functional limitations have remained the same since she initially applied for benefits thus,even if the alj were somehow required to credit liskowitz testimony,this testimony did not speak to a rapid deterioration in her condition between and.
liskowitz treatment records,including her rheumatologist bretza opinion,also evidence no dramatic deterioration of her condition.even without more,this undermines liskowitz somewhat more plausible argument that the alj impermissibly played doctor by refusing to credit the opinion of her treating physician.a n alj can not play the role of doctor and interpret medical evidence.murphy astrue,cir.along the same lines,an alj can not disregard medical evidence simply because it is at odds with the alj own unqualified opinion.id.here,there is at least a strong argument to be made that the alj improperly substituted her own,opinion for that of liskowitz treating physician.what the alj said was 
there is no basis for relating back bretza findings from to the period from the alleged onset date in to december,the date last insured.bretz sic.assessment conflicts with the claimant lack of treatment for a condition which could be rheumatoid arthritis in the year.it also conflicts with claimant infrequent treatment for hip dysplasia during the period from to.it is noted that bretz sic found in march that the claimant had a full range of motion in all joints with no synovitis.
we are troubled by this aspect of the alj decision.it is quintessentially a matter for medical judgment whether disabling rheumatoid arthritis is consistent with a full range of motion or joint synovitis.perhaps the alj is right that disabling rheumatoid arthritis would result in significant joint swelling.see stedman medical dictionary ed defining synovitis as inflamation,especially that of a joint.but we do not know this and the alj does not know either.
standing alone,the alj remarks give us pause.were this the alj first decision on the matter,there would be a strong case for reversal.however,when we consider the remarks together with the alj findings following the first administrative hearing,we conclude that there was substantial evidence for the alj decision.again,the alj made these remarks only after she had already found that liskowitz was capable of certain forms of sedentary work.liskowitz appealed this aspect of the alj first decision,and lost because the factual findings that furnished the basis for the alj first decision to deny benefits were affirmed on appeal,the alj was entitled to rely on these findings in the second hearing.
indeed,even if the alj had elected to reconsider the issue of liskowitz functional limitations prior to,bretza retrospective functional assessment does not strike us as particularly strong evidence,especially in the light of the contrary assessments of liskowitz contemporaneous examining physicians.a retrospective diagnosis may be considered only if it is corroborated by evidence contemporaneous with the eligible period.estok apfel,cir see also evangelista sec.of health human,cir adams chater,cir perez chater,cir jones chater,cir.in the present case,bretza retrospective opinion was that since,liskowitz has been able to use her hands for of an workday.this opinion was inconsistent,not only with the opinions of the two state agency doctors,but also with the opinion of liskowitz examining physician,who noted in that liskowitz suffered from no significant upper extremity limitations.
faced with competing opinions,the alj had to decide which opinion to credit.we can not say,as a matter of law,that the alj made the wrong choice here.see donahue barnhart,cir t he resolution of competing arguments based on the record is for the alj,not the court.there may be situations where it would be appropriate for an alj to repudiate previous factual findings in the light of new medical evidence.however,it was not error for the alj to refuse to credit a treating physician opinion four years after the fact where this opinion was inconsistent with contemporaneous medical evidence that the alj had previously and properly credited.
this leaves bretza retrospective opinion on rather shaky footing.like liskowitz herself,bretza did not say that liskowitz functional limitations became more pronounced between and.indeed,even this claim would not have been supported by the record.during this period,liskowitz reported to her doctors that she was experiencing decreased pain through her knee and hips,and that she was capable of performing all household and child care duties.because bretza had nothing to say on the one novel question concerning liskowitz functional limitations that was properly before the alj,the alj findings concerning liskowitz residual functional capacity were supported by substantial evidence.
we are also unpersuaded by liskowitz claim that the commissioner did not properly show that there were a significant number of jobs that she was capable of performing.an individual is disabled only if he or she can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.d a the commissioner bears the burden of showing that there are a significant number of jobs that the claimant is capable of performing.see c britton astrue,cir per curiam.the commissioner typically uses a vocational expert ve to assess whether there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can do.lee sullivan,cir 
in the present case,the ve testified that there were approximately jobs in the milwaukee area that a person with liskowitz functional limitations would be capable of performing.liskowitz does not argue that jobs is insignificant nor would such an argument be plausible.as few as jobs has been held to be significant,see allen bowen,cir,and it appears to be that jobs is a significant number.see lee,at see also hall bowen,cir jobs barker sec.of health human,cir jobs trimiar sullivan,cir jobs jenkins bowen,cir jobs.
although the ve indisputably identified a significant number of jobs,liskowitz argues that it was error for the alj to credit the ve testimony for two reasons first,the ve was not able to testify as to the reliability of the data she used to reach her conclusions second,the ve was unable to identify the number of jobs that were included in her data set.
as to this first argument,it is not entirely true that the ve failed to vindicate the reliability of the data on which she relied.the ve initially admitted that she could not assess the degree of accuracy of the data sources on which she was relying.however,on questioning,she added that these sources were widely recognized as acceptable sources in the vocational rehabilitation area.perhaps ideally the ve would have been able to say a bit more,but this does not go without saying.the witness was testifying as a vocational expert,not as a census taker or statistician.indeed,even if the ve had happened to know something about the statistical basis for her testimony,she arguably still would not be in a position to fully vindicate her conclusions.after all,statisticians use arithmetic operations,but few probably have studied the foundations of arithmetic in set theory.is the statistician use of arithmetic therefore unjustified clearly not.in administrative proceedings,no less than in ordinary life,explanations come to an end somewhere.ludwig wittgenstein,philosophical investigations anscombe.
in addition to testifying that her sources were widely recognized as acceptable,the ve actually identified her sources.two of th
