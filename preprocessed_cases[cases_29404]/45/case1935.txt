international healthcare management ihm,a company that develops healthcare programs,and health hawaii network hhn,which was established to provide a network of doctors in hawaii for a managed care health plan developed by ihm,appeal from summary judgment in favor of the hawaii medical association hma,the hawaii coalition for health the coalition,queen physician group qpg,and certain of their officers who were also named as defendants ihm and hhn alleged a conspiracy to fix prices and to boycott their plan in violation of section of the sherman act,and hawaii law.the district court found no evidence to support either theory,and no evidence of qpg involvement in the alleged conspiracy.it concluded that,in the absence of any agreement or threat to boycott hhn,or attempt to fix prices,the joint efforts of hma and the coalition to negotiate the terms of hhn provider agreement caused no antitrust injury under state or federal law.we agree,and affirm.
in,ihm and others not involved in this litigation created the francis preferred provider organization managed care health plan francis plan that it hoped to market to employers in hawaii.hhn was the provider network for the francis plan.
the hma is a professional association of physicians in the state of hawaii.it is affiliated with the american medical association and has over members of whom are active full pay members.at the time there were approximately active physicians in hawaii.among other things,the hma reviews and provides information to its members about provider contracts,including managed care health plans operating in the state.the coalition is a consumer advocacy organization that focuses on health care issues with a membership of physicians and.qpg is an independent practice association ipa formed to enter into contracts with health plans.
when the hawaii medical services association hmsa,which is hawaii blue shield plan,asked physicians to sign a new participating provider agreement ppa in,the coalition,the hma,qpg,and two other physicians groups joined in a consortium to discuss the ppa with hmsa.in hhn view,this was the beginning of the conspiracy about which it complains.the consortium asked hmsa to make a number of changes to the ppa none of which included changes to the fee schedule or to physicians compensation.the organizations comprising the consortium communicated with their members about the progress of negotiations,and one letter noted that f or the first time many of our physician organizations have joined forces and are working to seek improvement of hmsa new ppa.hmsa revised its ppa somewhat,and the contract went into effect in.
against this background,hhn began recruiting physicians for its provider network in february.a solicitation packet was sent to doctors with hhn participating provider agreement for the francis plan.happened to be on the mailing list.in her capacity as president of the coalition,she wrote to hhn that its ppa contained several provisions which were similar to the ones hmsa had recently modified,and offered to help hhn improve its provider agreement.she also advised coalition members that the ppa is not very good as it contained provisions similar to the initial version of hmsa ppa.
hhn set up a meeting with with hhn blessing,she invited representatives from other organizations that had participated in the hmsa discussions to attend.an hma representative was there,but no one came from qpg.hhn indicated that it would only consider concerns with its ppa that the coalition put into writing.complied on march with a letter that identified eleven specific concerns,including the requirement that physicians fully comply with the ppa utilization management program or face a threat of reduced reimbursement and the lack of assurance that reimbursement rates would be fair or reasonable hhn forwarded the letter to sidney steinberg,a health care management consultant,who responded to the coalition on april that letter raised several issues that need review and either modification or clarification,including credentials evaluation and utilization management.he invited the coalition to stay in touch as hhn undertakes a comprehensive review of the provider agreement to assure that the issues you raised are properly addressed 
meanwhile,hhn acquired the assets of pacific benefit services,pbs.on april hhn advised physicians who were pbs providers that their agreements with pbs were being assigned to hhn.this prompted the coalition to communicate with its members about the assignment,and the hma,hawaii federation of physicians and dentists,and the coalition to issue an alert.the june alert informed members that their organizations had tried without success to enter a dialogue with hhn about serious problems with its ppa that hhn had acquired pbs but may not have notified all pbs physicians that their ppas had been assigned to hhn and that they had met with the insurance commissioner,who expressed concerns about the number of corporate entities involved in hhn health plan and the accuracy of the participating provider listings that hhn may be using to recruit members.the alert reported that 
t he insurance commissioner suggested that it might be wise for physicians to wait until these issues can be clarified and resolved before signing up as a participating provider with hhn.if physicians have concerns about the possibility that their pbs participating agreement has been assigned to hhn,they could also call hhn to clarify the situation.
the insurance commissioner reviewed and commented upon a draft before the alert was distributed.
on july,the hma sent counsel for the francis plan a copy of the hhn provider agreement noting suggested changes.these suggestions were consistent with the modifications that hmsa had previously made to its ppa.representatives of the hma and hhn met several times in july.the discussions centered on hhn credentialing procedures whether doctors were required to use only hhn list of hospitals in all situations the one day notice for inspection of records the termination of doctors without cause the indemnification provision the quality of hhn utilization management program whether doctors should be allowed to provide hhn with information regarding their costs so hhn could consider those costs when revising the fee schedule and the lack of an appeal process for doctors regarding reimbursement.hhn was unwilling to make any changes.
overall,some physicians signed up for the francis plan.seventy physicians,as well as a large ipa and queens medical center,the largest hospital in hawaii,executed ppas after the hma alert.fewer than a dozen withdrew at any time.nevertheless,hhn abandoned its marketing efforts in hawaii and filed this action.the district court granted summary judgment on all claims,and this timely appeal followed 
the material facts are largely undisputed.although antitrust cases are sometimes difficult to resolve on summary judgment because of their factual complexity,summary judgment is still appropriate in certain cases.county of tuolumne sonora cmty,cir citing bhan nme,cir.summary judgment is only disfavored in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent are important,proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators,and relevant information is controlled by hostile witnesses.see metronet servs.west communications,wl at cir.may,quoting toscano prof l golfers ass n,cir.this is not such a case.
hhn argues that the district court erroneously held that it is lawful for physician associations to negotiate with health plans on behalf of their competing physician members.it faults the court for having found that hhn flunked the monsanto test because hhn failed to produce evidence that the organizations held discussions or negotiations that concerned the hhn fee schedule the organizations threatened retaliation against member physicians who signed the hhn ppa or member physicians had explicitly agreed among themselves and with the organizations to boycott hhn.hhn submits that there is no authority that allows professional associations to restrain competition as long as they avoid a of anticompetitive acts.instead,it urges us to follow the third circuit decision in pennsylvania dental ass medical service ass of pennsylvania,cir,which reversed a summary judgment in favor of organized dentists who engaged in concerted activity to modify blue shield cost containment efforts.
the hma does not dispute that the coalition and the federation agreed to discuss the hhn contract with hhn and jointly sent out the alert.however,it does maintain that the agreement was not unlawful.in the hma view,all that remains without evidence of a boycott or of price fixing is the fact of joint negotiations and communications.it contends that these activities fall within the safe harbor of united states lanoy alston,cir,where we applied a per se analysis and upheld the conviction of dentists who had agreed on higher fees to be paid by prepaid dental plans,but recognized that other kinds of collective activity involving the relationship between health care providers and plans may be legitimate.the hma also argues that it was entitled to express its opinions and to share information about health care plans,whether or not its opinions carried weight and regardless of market effects.
we start with hhn argument.hhn is undoubtedly correct that acts other than negotiating about fees,threatening retaliation or coercing members not to become a plan provider,and agreeing to boycott hhn may run afoul of the antitrust laws.we do not understand the district court to have held otherwise.hhn complaint alleged a conspiracy to negotiate fees and to boycott hhn to support a price fixing arrangement among physicians in hawaii,and it was toward these allegations that the organizations motion for summary judgment was directed and to which the district court responded by holding that hhn failed to produce evidence of conduct that amounts to price fixing or an agreement to boycott for the purpose of price fixing.hhn effectively conceded this in the district court.while its argument on appeal still has boycott and overtones,its focus is on the joint negotiation itself.
hhn asserts that such an arrangement is per se unlawful,but we disagree.per se categories are not to be expanded indiscriminately to new factual situations.see,ftc.fed of dentists,d am.ad,gte,cir.the hma and the coalition joint efforts to modify terms of hhn ppa is not in a class of restraints previously held to be per se unreasonable,see.fed of dentists,at,nor is it a practice that facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output.paladin.power,wl,at cir.may,quoting wholesale stationers,pac.stationery and printing,d.as we observed in alston,the arena in which healthcare providers deal with plans is a complex and evolving one that may in some circumstances justify collective action 
medical plans serve,effectively,as the bargaining agents for large groups of consumers they use the clout of their consumer base to drive down health care service fees.uniform fee in a normal,competitive standard operating procedure when medical plans are involved.in light of these departures from a normal competitive market,individual health care providers are entitled to take some joint action short of price fixing or a group boycott to level the bargaining imbalance created by the plans and provide meaningful input into the setting of the fee schedules.thus health care providers might pool cost data in justifying a request for an increased fee schedule.providers might also band together to negotiate various other aspects of their relationship with the plans such as payment procedures,the type of documentation they must provide,the method of referring patients and the mechanism for adjusting disputes.such concerted actions,which would not implicate the per se rule,must be carefully distinguished from efforts to dictate terms by explicit or implicit threats of mass withdrawals from the plans.

the record here is quite unlike pennsylvania dental ass n.in pennsylvania dental ass n,concerted action by organized dentists to encourage dentists to withdraw from blue shield to force blue shield to change the upper limit on charges by participating dentists was manifest.members of several local dental associations passed resolutions recommending withdrawal written pledges to try to withdraw from participation were circulated among dentists officials of the pennsylvania dental association threatened blue shield that more resignations would take place unless it modified the cost containment efforts to which the organized dentists objected and,when blue shield held firm,more resolutions were passed and mass withdrawals occurred.at.this abundance of direct evidence of concerted action,id.at,made the case an easy one for the third circuit.as the court said,finding a violation of section followed a fortiori from ftc indiana federation of dentists,d.id.at.in indiana federation,there was a horizontal agreement among participating dentists to withhold the forwarding of to insurance companies along with their customers claim forms.fed of dentists,at.the supreme court held that this refusal to compete with respect to the package of services offered to customers could not be sustained.id.at.see also alston,at fifty dentists met to discuss the fees they were receiving under certain health plans and sent letters requesting higher fees arizona maricopa county med.soc y,d doctors agreed by majority vote to set maximum fees they could claim for certain health services provided to policyholders of specified health plans.
hhn contends that there is similar,direct evidence that the hma,the coalition and qpg were members of a combination the consortium whose purpose was to accomplish by joint action what physicians could not accomplish as competitors.this evidence consists of a declaration by jonathan won,the hma former executive director,that the coalition organizations joined together to bring hmsa to the bargaining table and collectively to negotiate terms of physician provider agreements with managed health care organizations.however,this alone does not show a motive or any other unlawful objective.won also opined that at one point during the hmsa negotiations,an hma communication gave a false impression to physicians that the provider contract could be signed and he declared that when the hma speaks,its physician members listen and a substantial number take whatever action that the hma recommends.again,this is not direct evidence of anything unlawful at most it shows that the hma is influential.as the seventh circuit explained in schachar american academy of ophthalmology,cir,a n organization towering reputation does not reduce its freedom to speak out.there,the academy had criticized radial keratotomy as experimental and called on the profession to use caution until more research was done.id.at.the court rejected ophthalmologists claim that this amounted to a restraint of trade because the communication did not constrain anyone to follow the advice.id.much the same can be said of what the hma and coaltion did in this case.
finally,hhn posits that the organizations conduct is not lawful under alston,and that per se analysis may be appropriate,where joint negotiations are accompanied by threats of mass withdrawals.it argues that such threats are implicit in the communications to physicians on the status of the negotiations.we disagree that any such inference can reasonably be drawn from the communications in this case.the alert is the only communique that arguably comes close it conveyed a suggestion from the insurance commissioner that physicians wait before signing up with hhn until issues about the number and interrelationship of corporate entities involved in hhn,and the accuracy of the provider listings for pbs,were resolved.these concerns had nothing to do with price,or any other element of competition so far as the record discloses.the communications appear to have had little,if any,impact no more than ten out of physicians withdrew from the francis plan after the alert,and seventy signed hhn provider agreements after the alert was issued.nor is there any evidence that physician decisions ab
