after numerous small corporations submitted claims to nautilus insurance company nautilus for the insurer defense and indemnity for lawsuits the small corporations were facing,nautilus sought a declaration that it did not owe such duties to the small corporations for the underlying claims.the insurance policies did not contain provisions as a federal court sitting in indiana,the district court applied indiana rules to choose which state had the most intimate contacts with the contracts.after deciding that indiana law governed the interpretation of the contracts,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nautilus on the ground that indiana law does not contemplate insurance coverage for the types of claims arising under the insurance policies held by the for negligent hiring.the district court correctly applied indiana law to the insurance policies involving two of the small corporations involved in this appeal.however,for the insurance policies involving one of the corporations,phoenix imagery,there is conflicting evidence about the small corporation principal place of business.because we can not resolve the conflict on the basis of the paper record,we remand this particular determination to the district court for further proceedings,such as an evidentiary hearing.
this case arose after several individuals tragically suffered violent crimes committed by magazine salespersons.the assailants were employees of small corporations associated with american community services acs,an magazine clearinghouse that sells magazines by contracting with small corporations that,in turn,hire and employ their own salespersons.the small corporations that employed the violent offenders were insured by nautilus acs was listed as an additional insured on each of the relevant comprehensive general liability cgl policies.when numerous civil lawsuits were brought against the small corporations and acs by the victims of the crimes and their families,the insureds submitted claims to nautilus,requesting the insurer defense and indemnification.nautilus then filed this suit in federal district court,under,seeking rescission of the contracts and a judgment declaring that it did not owe duties of defense or indemnification under the cgl policies.nautilus explained that the civil complaints alleged only negligent hiring by the small corporations and acs,but in indiana,negligent hiring and negligent supervision do not fall within the ambit of traditional cgl coverage,where an occurrence is defined as an accidental event.see erie ins.am.painting.nautilus argued that indiana law governed the insurance contracts,because the small corporations were incorporated in indiana and were mere shells of acs.
the insurance policies secured by the small corporations in which acs is listed as an additional insured contain no provisions.the small corporations were all incorporated in indiana,but illinois addresses were listed on their insurance applications.accordingly,the insurance policies listed the corporations locations at the illinois addresses.the insurer nautilus or its agent,jimcor paid taxes on the policies in illinois,and the policies were stamped by the illinois department of insurance,in accordance with section of the illinois insurance code,which outlines the requirements for surplus line insurance that insures an illinois risk.comp.stat.
the determination is especially important in this case because the substantive law in indiana and illinois differs on the point of law at the heart of the underlying lawsuits against the corporations whether negligent hiring can constitute an occurrence under an insurance policy.under indiana law,allegations of negligent hiring do not trigger an insurer duties to defend and indemnify the insured if the policy defines occurrence as an accidental event.see am.painting,at.but under illinois law,negligent hiring can constitute an occurrence under insurance policies that define the term as an accidental event.see am.family mut.ins.enright,d.
nautilus named as defendants in its declaratory action acs,the numerous small corporations that submitted claims to nautilus for defense and indemnification,and the individual plaintiffs who had filed lawsuits against acs and the small corporations,including david reuter,individually and as a representative of the estate of shirley reuter,and justin chretien.shirley reuter,david reuter mother,was murdered by a salesman in her new jersey home,and justin chretien was assaulted by a salesman in virginia.in their respective lawsuits,david reuter sued acs and the small corporations phoenix imagery and innovators chretien sued acs and the small corporation unified stars.
the parties engaged in extensive discovery,which included document production,interrogatories,depositions,and declarations.the gathered will be discussed more thoroughly below as it relates to the that the states of illinois and indiana both have contacts with the insurance contracts.
following for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nautilus.it concluded that indiana law applied to the insurance policies and consequently,that nautilus had no duty to defend or indemnify acs or the small corporations in the civil lawsuits.the district court observed that acs is an indiana corporation with its principal place of business in indiana.it labeled all of the small corporations shell corporations of acs,and found that each had an indiana registered agent.the court also relied on the fact that acs procured the insurance policies for the small corporations from its base in michigan city,indiana.on these facts,the district court decided all of that is enough to get this court to the substantive law of indiana with regard to the key question about the contents of the insurance contract here.
ii.analysis 
neither acs,nor any of the small corporations,appealed from the judgment.of the individually named defendants,only reuter and chretien have appealed.reuter and chretien have a strong pragmatic interest in the application of illinois the insurer with its deep pockets may be liable for costs attributable to the allegedly negligent small companies with their very shallow pockets 
reuter and chretien argue that the district court improperly pierced acs corporate veil by concluding that the small corporations were shells of acs,and that the district court erred by deciding that the substantive law of indiana,and not illinois,governed the construction of the insurance policies.reuter and chretien contend that illinois law should have applied because illinois had the most intimate contacts with the insurance contracts.see restatement second of conflicts.reuter and chretien claim that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of nautilus as a result of its erroneous choice of law.nautilus continues to use the shell terminology for the small corporations,and insists that the district court correctly applied indiana law to the insurance policies.
the selection of one state substantive law over another in the event of a conflict presents a question of law that is decided by the court.gramercy mills,wolens,cir.we review that selection de novo.tanner jupiter realty,cir.the district court,sitting in diversity,used indiana principles to determine which state substantive law governs the proceeding.see also klaxon stentor.indiana choice of law rule for contract actions calls for applying the law of the forum with the most intimate contacts to the facts.employers ins.of wausau recticel foam.this approach is embodied in the restatement second of conflicts,and calls for consideration of the following factors a the place of contracting b the place of contract negotiation c the place of performance d the location of the subject matter of the contract and e the domicile,residence,nationality,place of incorporation,and place of business of the parties,id.citing eby,restatement second of conflicts.
in its analysis,the district court noted that acs is an indiana corporation with its principal place of business in michigan city,indiana.it then stated that most of the remaining defendants are shell corporations with an indiana registered agent.a shell corporation is a company that is incorporated,but has no significant assets or operations.shell corporation wikipedia entry,corp oration last visited june,quoting barron finance investment handbook see also guidance memorandum from the department of the treasury,financial crimes enforcement network,available at.stating that shell companies typically have no physical presence other than a mailing address and generate little or no independent economic value.shell companies are not in themselves illegal,see guidance memorandum,supra,at,but may be used by another corporation or entity to advance fraud by way of the shell front.see hok sport,fc des moines,cir p iercing the corporate veil is appropriate if the corporation is a mere shell,serving no legitimate business purpose,and used primarily as an intermediary to perpetuate fraud or promote injustice.internal quotation omitted.
the district court apparently assumed the small corporations were shells.because there was no analysis in the district court opinion to support the statement that the small corporations were shells,we do not read the court invocation of the shell terminology to be a factual finding that the corporations existed as shams,solely to facilitate acs alleged fraud.the district court dismissal of the plaintiff rescission claims as moot supports our conclusion that the district court made no finding of fact about the legitimacy of the small corporations.had the court actually concluded that the small corporations were shams that existed solely to further acs fraud,then nautilus would have been granted rescission of the insurance policies under either illinois or indiana law.see.sur,bill builders,d,jesse am.cmty.mut.ins.
on the record before us,it is not clear that the small corporations were illegitimate,sham corporations under either indiana law or illinois law.although it is evident that the small corporations operated to the benefit of acs,that fact alone does not render the corporations alter egos of one another.in fact,the record contains evidence that the small corporations maintained operations independent from their dealings with acs.the independent contractor agreements between the small corporations and acs provide that the small corporations are free to work with other magazine clearinghouses.lynne harvey,the president of phoenix imagery,attested that she was not an employee of acs,and that she alone controlled the operations of phoenix.she explained that phoenix reimbursed acs for its insurance premiums,and that phoenix principal place of business was in crete,illinois.additionally,acs denied that it operated as a single business enterprise with the small corporations.
on the other hand,there is evidence in the record that supports nautilus shell theory.the address provided by lynne harvey for phoenix principal place of business is actually the residential address of acs founders.phone numbers listed for some of the small corporations overlap with phone numbers for acs.acs personnel are listed as contact persons for some of the small corporations in insurance documents and marketing materials.additionally,the record is devoid of independent contractor agreements between innovators and acs,and between unified stars and acs,and neither of those two small corporations responded to nautilus discovery requests.
with the conflicting evidence regarding the nature of the small corporations,we are not comfortable piercing acs corporate veil and declaring the small corporations to be shells that existed solely to allow acs to perpetrate insurance fraud.to resolve that conflict at this there are factual disputes surrounding the nature of the small corporations and their relationships with effectively relieve nautilus of its burden under either illinois law,see pederson paragon pool,d,or indiana law,see cmty.care centers,hamilton,of proving that the small corporations and acs were alter egos of one another,and that they should be treated as the same entity for all purposes,including for determinations surrounding insurance policies.
one of the factual disputes at the heart of nautilus shell argument mirrors the dispute at the heart of the is,whether the small corporations principal places of business are in indiana,or alternatively,in illinois.the first four factors outlined in of the restatement second of conflicts do not conclusively call for application of the substantive law of either indiana or illinois,so the domicile,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties is particularly important.see restatement second of conflicts.we turn now to the restatement factors to decide whether indiana had the most intimate contacts to the facts of the insurance contracts with each of the three small corporations.
place of contracting 
the comment to instructs that the place of contracting is the place where occurred the last act necessary,under the forum rules of offer and acceptance,to give the contract binding effect restatement second conflicts cmt.e.the place of contracting,standing alone,is often insignificant.id.in several recent indiana cases dealing with contractual negotiations between insureds,their agents,and insurers in different states,the place of contracting was deemed indeterminate by the indiana court of appeals.see am.employers ins.coachmen,recticel,at travelers indem.summit of,hartford accident indem.dana.in recticel,the insured sometimes listed its address in indiana,and other times in new york,but the insured managed its insurance affairs in indiana.even so,the indiana court of appeals decided that the place of contracting was not determinative.at.
from the testimony of tina green,acs office manager,it appears that acs initially procured the insurance policies on behalf of the affiliated small corporations,from its location in indiana.thereafter,acs charged the cost of the insurance to the small corporations accounts with acs.lynne harvey,of phoenix imagery,confirms that she reimbursed acs for the cost of phoenix insurance premium.
the insurance agent with whom acs communicated,john damiani,worked for sun insurance in new jersey.the policies were ordered from and underwritten by jimcor,a pennsylvania insurance agency.the ultimate insurer,nautilus,is incorporated in arizona,and has its principal place of business there.the policies were stamped by the illinois department of insurance,in accordance with section of the illinois insurance code,which outlines the requirement for surplus line insurance that insures an illinois risk.comp.stat.illinois law provides that it is unlawful for an insurance producer to deliver any unauthorized insurer contract unless such insurance contract is countersigned by the surplus line association of illinois.
with all of the different parties involved in these particular insurance,sun insurance,jimcor,nautilus,the small corporations,and the illinois department of is impossible to pinpoint the place of contracting.under illinois law,the contract could not be delivered,and thus could not come into effect,until it was approved by the surplus line association of the state.that fact weighs in favor of applying illinois law to the contracts.on the other hand,the indiana court of appeals has downplayed the significance of countersignatures that are required by state law as indicators of the place of least where the countersignatures are of the insurer registered agent.see dana,at.like the indiana court of appeals in coachmen,we can not conclusively point to illinois or indiana as being the state where the last act necessary to give the contract binding effect occurred coachmen,at.so we conclude that this factor is not determinative.
place of negotiation of contract 
normally,the place of a contract negotiation is a significant contact.restatement second of conflicts cmt.e.the state where contract negotiations occur has an interest in the legality of the negotiations themselves,as well as the ultimate agreement.see id.however,t his contact is of less importance when there is no one single place of negotiation and agreement,as for example,when the parties do not meet
