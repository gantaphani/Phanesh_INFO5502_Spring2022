this case requires that we decide whether a renovation to an existing commercial building falls under the under construction exception to the vacancy exclusion of a property insurance policy.we conclude that the term under construction does not encompass these types of renovations.
factual background 
plaintiffs,trb investments,fran mar company,coldwater farms,llc,p r almond orchards,incorporated,and chester group plaintiffs,are a group of local businesses that develop and manage commercial real estate.in november,plaintiffs acquired a former bank building located at chester avenue in bakersfield,intending to renovate it.after acquiring the building,plaintiffs added it to an existing insurance policy through defendant fireman fund insurance company that was issued in and covered another commercial property owned by plaintiffs.
the salvation army leased the building until the end of.in november,prior to the expiration of the salvation army lease,efforts to remodel the building began specifically,materials containing asbestos were removed.after the salvation army lease expired,the property was not occupied by any tenant.
in january,an architectural firm and a general contractor were hired to provide renovation and design services for the building.in may,the architects did designs for exterior and interior modifications to the building.work on the project was delayed because a number of potential tenants were interested in the building.however,the architect and the contractor were able to take preliminary steps,such as conducting inspections and contacting the city planning department.
in may,plaintiffs entered into an agreement with a new tenant,goodwill industries.the lease agreement provided that the building would be built to suit the needs of goodwill.the architect began making specific designs for the improvements to the building that were requested by goodwill,including initial floor plans.in addition,demolition specifications were made,as well as an agreement to begin work immediately.
in june,the insurance policy covering the building was renewed.the renewed policy contained the following vacancy clause 
if loss or damage occurs to a building that has been vacant for more than consecutive days prior to the occurrence of that loss or damage,we will 
not pay for any loss or damage cause by 
sprinkler leakage,unless you have protected the system against freezing 
building glass breakage 
water damage 
attempted theft.
reduce the amount we would otherwise pay for the loss or damage by.
a building is vacant when it does not contain enough business personal property to conduct customary operations.
buildings under construction are not considered vacant.italics added.
on june,the contractor walked through the building and discussed the scope of the design and work for the project.the contractor also walked through the building with various subcontractors on june.the subcontractors immediately began work on the building electrical and air conditioning systems.work was performed on the building from june,through july.that work included removing the electrical main panel covers,walls around the two main panels and subpanels,unneeded circuits and floor boxes,and exposed electrical lines tracing circuitry testing circuitry checking and pressurizing the air conditioning system and starting compressors.
on monday,july,the architect discovered a large amount of standing water in the building.the cause was later determined to be a failure of the water heater located on the top floor of the building.it occurred during the weekend of july through july.
as a result of the water damage,plaintiffs tendered a claim to fireman fund.on august,fireman fund notified plaintiffs about the possibility of a problem with coverage due to the vacancy endorsement.on december,fireman fund denied coverage for the water loss,explaining that the building had been vacant for over days when the loss occurred.the denial letter also observed that tenant improvements did not begin until august,which was days after the occurrence of the water loss.from june through may,plaintiffs requested three times that fireman fund reconsider its denial of coverage,and each time fireman fund denied the request.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed a complaint in kern county superior court on may,alleging the following causes of action breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of an insurance contract.plaintiffs also sought declaratory relief,requesting that fireman fund pay the benefits for the building water damage.on july,fireman fund answered plaintiffs complaint.
fireman fund filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that,as a matter of law,the company did not breach the insurance contract with plaintiffs because a building renovation can not be considered construction pursuant to the vacancy exception for buildings under construction.on january,plaintiffs filed an opposition to fireman fund motion for summary judgment.
on march,the trial court granted fireman fund motion for summary judgment.the court found 
c onstruction as contained as an exception to the vacancy exclusion in the subject policy to mean the creation of something new,as distinguished from the repairing or improvement of something already existing as opposed to repairs which includes restoring by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken.citation.as pointed out in myers merrimack mutual fire insurance company cir,at page,this distinction is in accord with the probable purpose of this clause.such a clause balances a willingness to extend coverage through the construction period with a desire to guard against excessive vandalism that occurs when a dwelling is vacant,and the interpretation urged by plaintiff would intolerably alter this balance by greatly extending the construction period to include any time during which some repairs or renovations are being made.the construction period can not go on forever.
plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.
on march,plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint to assert three new causes of action,reformation,and.this motion was also denied by the trial court.in denying the motion to amend,the court explained that plaintiffs were attempting to amend the complaint to assert new causes of action that were available to them at the time the complaint was originally filed,and that fireman fund would be substantially prejudiced if the amendment was permitted at this stage of the litigation.
a notice of the entry of judgment was filed.
discussion 
motion for summary judgment 
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the court erred in granting fireman fund motion for summary judgment.specifically,they contend that under both the plain meaning and reasonable expectation of the insured rules of contract interpretation,the renovation of the building is considered construction for purposes of the vacancy exclusion to the insurance policy.plaintiffs assert that the court incorrectly followed the minority view held by jurisdictions outside of california that renovations are not considered construction and contend that the majority view favors their interpretation of the insurance policy.
fireman fund,on the other hand,argues that the court applied the correct definition of under construction,which requires new construction and does not include renovation.fireman fund further asserts that even if renovations were within the exception to the vacancy exclusion,the actions taken by the architects and the contractor do not amount to renovation,but instead constituted repairs to the building.

principles of insurance policy interpretation 
in aiu ins.superior court cal d,the california supreme court explained the rules that apply when interpreting an insurance policy 
under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.citations.if there is ambiguity,however,it is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor,the insurer believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.if application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity,ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at.
these principles were further clarified by the california supreme court in bank of the west superior court cal th,d.in that case,the court stated 
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation.on the other hand,i f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.citations.this rule,as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy,protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.citation italics added.only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer.citation.in summary,a court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.in so doing,the court must interpret the language in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy.citation.this is because language in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citations.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.

applicability and vacancy exclusion for under construction to renovations of an existing building 
applying the principles of insurance policy interpretation to this matter of first impression in california,we are persuaded that the court correctly decided that the term under construction in the subject policy does not include renovations to an existing building.
first,the plain meaning of the word construction,in its ordinary and popular sense,does not include steps taken to renovate an existing building.the words construction and renovation are not do not encompass the same type of action that may be done to a building and their use in the insurance policy does not create an ambiguity.construction is defined as the act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object,and the creation of something new,as distinguished from the repair or improvement of something already existing.webster new internat.dict.black law dict.ed.to renovate,on the other hand,is defined as restor ing to life,vigor or activity,and clean ing up,replac ing worn and broken parts in,and repair ing.webster new internat,supra,at webster new world dict.college ed.
in our view,based on these definitions,construction envisions the building of a new structure and requires the putting together of various parts in order to bring the building to a point of readiness for occupancy,while a renovation does not.a building under renovation is readily able to be occupied but requires some repair and improvements in order to meet the aesthetic or business needs of the occupant.that was the case here.the salvation army occupied and leased the building without any renovation for a period of time.once the salvation army vacated,the building was capable of being immediately occupied by and leased to another tenant however,the new tenant,goodwill,negotiated a lease to allow for improvements and changes to be made to the building in order to meet their business needs.goodwill chose not to occupy the building until the changes were completed.however,the fact that these improvements and repairs were being made to the building did not render the building unable to be essential structural parts of the building remained despite the renovations.as a result,the building was not under construction for the purposes of the vacancy exclusion.
