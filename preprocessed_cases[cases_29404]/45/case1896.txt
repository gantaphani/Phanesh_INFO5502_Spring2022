beatriz lounsburry lounsburry appeals the district court judgment affirming the commissioner of social security decision to deny her disability benefits under title ii of the social security act.lounsburry application for benefits was denied initially and on reconsideration,and lounsburry requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the alj found that although lounsburry had severe exertional and impairments that precluded her performing her previous work,these impairments were not disabling because they did not preclude lounsburry from performing a single occupation that existed in significant numbers in the economy.lounsburry contends that the alj committed legal error because rule c of the guidelines,as applied to the alj uncontested findings of fact,directs as a matter of law a determination that lounsburry is disabled.we agree,and hereby reverse and remand with instructions for the payment of benefits.
factual and procedural background 
on february,lounsburry filed a claim for social security disability insurance ssdi under title ii of the social security act,et.lounsburry alleged that her disability arose on august,when she was years of age.as the basis of her disability,lounsburry alleged easy fatigue,pains discomforts on the upper and lower extremities,severe pain in both hips,joints,back shoulder,not feeling well at times,and bunionous toes.a series of medical evaluations between may and december resulted in diagnoses of degenerative joint disease,resulting in chronic bilateral lower extremity,knee,ankle,heel,and foot pain,and pain in the lumbar spine,diabetes mellitus,hypertension,and sick sinus which lounsburry received a permanent pacemaker implant.
lounsburry completed high school and two years of education.she was employed as a certified nurse assistant from october to may and was employed as a certified home health aide from june to november.she has not engaged in substantial gainful activity at any time since the alleged onset of her disability.
lounsburry application for social security disability insurance was denied initially and on reconsideration.at the hearing before the alj on november,testimony revealed lounsburry to have the residual functional capacity to perform light work,defined as lifting carrying pounds frequently and pounds occasionally.a vocational expert ve indicated that lounsburry also had postural limitations preventing her from repetitive stooping,crouching,crawling,kneeling,and climbing activities.because lounsburry past relevant work as a certified nurse assistant requires a medium exertional capacity,the ve testified she would not be able to return to that job.the ve did find,however,that lounsburry past work was and involved skills transferable to other work.specifically,the ve identified four jobs that lounsburry could do,but in response to interrogatories propounded by the alj,later eliminated all but one as requiring more than very little vocational adjustment,pursuant to the requirements of the guidelines,part,subpart p,app,rule f the grids.
the ve identified the remaining occupation,companion,as,requiring light exertional capacity and very little vocational adjustment.he testified that companion positions exist in the local economy,and nationally.the alj followed the sequential evaluation required by.he determined in his written decision dated march,that lounsburry was not disabled 
the social security appeals council declined review and adopted the alj decision as the final decision of the commissioner.having exhausted her administrative remedies,lounsburry sought review in the northern district of california.district judge white rejected lounsburry argument that the alj was required to apply the guidelines directly,including rule c,denied her motion for summary judgment,and granted the commissioner for summary judgment,thereby upholding the alj decision.
ii.a guidelines analysis 
we review de novo the decision of the district court affirming the decision of the alj.aukland massanari,cir.we may set aside the commissioner denial of disability insurance benefits when the alj findings are based on legal error.see penny sullivan,cir.in this appeal we are called on to determine lounsburry disability status under the guidelines,commonly referred to as the grids.part,subpt.p,app.
the ninth circuit articulated the sequential process for determining whether a claimant is disabled in tackett apfel,cir.the five steps are as follows 
step is the claimant presently working in a substantially gainful activity if so,then the claimant is not disabled within the meaning of the social security act and is not entitled to disability insurance benefits.if the claimant is not working in a substantially gainful activity,then the claimant case can not be resolved at step one and the evaluation proceeds to step two.see b.
step is the claimant impairment severe if not,then the claimant is not disabled and is not entitled to benefits.if the claimant impairment is severe,then the claimant case can not be resolved at step two and the evaluation proceeds to step three.see c.
step does the impairment meet or equal one of a list of specific impairments described in the regulations if so,the claimant is disabled and therefore entitled to disability insurance benefits.if the claimant impairment neither meets nor equals one of the impairments listed in the regulations,then the claimant case can not be resolved at step three and the evaluation proceeds to step four.see d.
step is the claimant able to do any work that he or she has done in the past if so,then the claimant is not disabled and is not entitled to disability insurance benefits.if the claimant can not do any work he or she did in the past,then the claimant case can not be resolved at step four and the evaluation proceeds to the fifth and final step.see e.
step is the claimant able to do any other work if not,then the claimant is disabled and therefore entitled to disability insurance benefits.see f.if the claimant is able to do other work,then the commissioner must establish that there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy that claimant can do.there are two ways for the commissioner to meet the burden of showing that there is other work in significant numbers in the national economy that claimant can do by the testimony of a vocational expert,or by reference to the guidelines at pt,subpt.p,app.if the commissioner meets this burden,the claimant is not disabled and therefore not entitled to disability insurance benefits.see f.if the commissioner can not meet this burden,then the claimant is disabled and therefore entitled to disability benefits.

the grids are applied at the fifth step of the analysis under,and present,in table form,a method for determining the availability and numbers of suitable jobs for a claimant.tackett,at.the grids categorize jobs by their requirements,and set forth a table for each category.a claimant placement with the appropriate table is determined by applying a matrix of four factors identified by claimant age,education,previous work experience,and physical ability.for each combination of these factors,they direct a finding of either disabled or not disabled based on the number of jobs in the national economy in that category of requirements.id.if a claimant is found able to work jobs that exist in significant numbers,the claimant is generally considered not disabled.heckler campbell,d.
however,the grids are predicated on a claimant suffering from an impairment which manifests itself by limitations in meeting the strength requirements of jobs exertional limitations they may not be fully applicable where the nature of a claimant impairment does not result in such limitations limitations.part,subpart p,appx.e fed.the reason for this limitation on the grids application is that,despite having the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of unskilled occupations at a given exertional level,a claimant may not be able to adjust to these jobs because of limitations.soc.sec.rul.january.in particular,postural and manipulative limitations such as difficulty reaching,handling,stooping,c
