plaintiff reagan wilson appeals from the judgment in favor of defendant century insurance company after the trial court granted defendant motion for summary judgment in an action for breach of contract and tortious bad faith in adjusting wilson underinsured motorist claim.we reverse.triable issues of fact exist as to whether century failed to thoroughly investigate and evaluate plaintiff claim.furthermore,plaintiff should have the opportunity to conduct discovery into century use of a computer software program known as colossus in the evaluation of bodily injury claims because such discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence on the issues of breach of contract,bad faith and punitive damages.
facts and proceedings below 
in november wilson suffered injuries to her neck and spine in a collision caused by a drunk driver.there was never any question about the other driver full responsibility for the accident.the only issue was the extent of wilson injuries.
the other driver carried bodily injury insurance for but wilson had a policy with century which provided underinsured motorist coverage uim up to.the other driver insurance company paid wilson its policy limit of and wilson requested century to pay the policy limit under her uim coverage wilson accompanied her request with a police report of the accident which attributed fault entirely to the intoxicated driver of the other car,photographs of her demolished vehicle and medical reports from the emergency room and her treating physicians including southern,an orthopedist.wilson attorney advised century we would value the case in the range of to million if a suit were brought against the driver who caused the accident.
initially century rejected wilson policy limit demand.it concluded from the medical reports she submitted and her physical activities following the accident the wilson received from the other party insurer plus the wilson received from century under her medical payments coverage fully compensated for her injuries.
over the next two years doctors retained by wilson examined and evaluated her and arrived at different conclusions.all the doctors agreed wilson had undergone cervical disc changes which they variously described as atypical,slight,very slight,and minimal.the doctors disagreed,however,as to the appropriate course of treatment.one recommended physical therapy,one recommended surgery,one recommended against surgery.the matter was resolved in june when a neurosurgeon retained by century examined wilson and reviewed her medical records.this doctor concluded surgical intervention would be indicated and wilson had an likelihood of obtaining benefit from surgical intervention.less than a month later century paid wilson the remaining amount of her uim coverage.
a month after receiving full payment from century wilson brought this action for breach of contract and bad faith.both causes of action stem from century alleged unreasonable delay in paying the policy limits under wilson uim coverage.wilson attributes this delay to the insurer failure to conduct a prompt,fair,reasonable and adequate investigation of her claim.wilson also contends century acted in bad faith and violated the terms of her policy by initially offsetting the it paid her under her medical payments coverage against her uim coverage.
during the discovery phase of this action wilson learned century had available a software program known as colossus for evaluating bodily injury claims but did not use colossus in evaluating her claim in deposing the claims adjuster who initially handled her uim claim wilson sought to discover whether the adjuster had used colossus in adjusting other claims,how long he had used colossus in adjusting claims and whether he considered colossus to be a tool which would assist you in arriving at a fair and accurate evaluation of somebody claim.counsel for century instructed the adjuster not to answer these or any other questions about the parameters of colossus.wilson moved to compel answers to this and other questions regarding century use of colossus and to vacate the trial date to permit such discovery.the trial court denied these motions.
century moved for summary judgment contending there were no disputed issues of material fact and it was entitled to judgment on both causes of action as a matter of law.the trial court agreed.it granted the motion and subsequently entered judgment for the insurer.wilson filed a timely appeal from the judgment.our review is de novo 
discussion 
triable issues of fact exist as to whether century committed a tortious breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing in adjusting wilson claim to underinsured motorist benefits.
under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing an insurer owes its insured a duty not to withhold unreasonably payments due under a policy.wilson contends century breached this duty by denying her uim claim without conducting a thorough investigation of her injuries,by failing to conduct an objective evaluation of the evidence wilson supplied to it and by unlawfully offsetting benefits under wilson medical payments coverage against the payment due under her underinsured motorist coverage.
triable issues of fact exist as to whether century conducted a thorough investigation of wilson injuries and her need for treatment.
it is undisputed wilson eventually two years full policy limit of her underinsured motorist coverage.the issue is whether century is guilty of bad faith in its initial evaluation and adjustment of her claim unreasonable withholding of benefits encompasses not only the failure to pay full benefits due under the policy but the unreasonable delay in payments 
a n insurer can not reasonably and in good faith deny payments to its insured without thoroughly investigating the foundation for its denial.this rule applies to coverage decisions as well as decisions about the amount of benefits due under the policy 
wilson contends century breached its duty to thoroughly investigate her claim by failing to conduct its own medical evaluation of her injuries to determine whether they were more than mere soft tissue injuries as the initial claims adjuster determined and whether wilson required surgery rather than just physical therapy.
century failure to have wilson examined by a doctor of its choice or to consult with wilson treating physician.
as is well established,when proper adjustment of a claim turns on a medical evaluation of the insured condition an insurer breaches its duty to thoroughly investigate the claim if it fails to have the insured examined by a doctor of its choice or at least to consult with the insured treating physician.
in egan mutual of omaha for example a claims adjuster classified the insured condition as a noncovered illness rather than as a covered injury solely on the basis of the adjuster review of the insured medical records.the adjuster made no effort to discuss the case with the insured attending physicians or to obtain an independent medical evaluation even though the insured stated he was willing to be examined by any doctor the insurer chose.trial testimony established efforts to discuss the case with the insured physicians would ordinarily have been made by a claims adjuster in defining the insurer duty to investigate,the supreme court held it is essential that an insurer fully inquire into possible bases that might support the insured claim.the court concluded,the evidence is undisputed that mutual failed to properly investigate plaintiff claim hence the trial court correctly instructed the jury that a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was established.
similarly,in mariscal old republic life ins.a claims adjuster denied a widow claim for accidental death benefits on the ground her husband death following a car accident was caused by a heart disease not from injuries suffered in the accident.the adjuster based his decision on a report by the attending physician,diaz,attributing the condition directly leading to death to cardiopulmonary arrest with antecedent causes being myocardial and atherosclerotic heart disease.the death certificate also stated the immediate cause of death was heart failure.a jury found the insurer guilty of bad faith and it appealed,arguing it did not breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because it obtained every writing in existence setting forth the insured cause of death and these writings reflect that the cause of death was the insured heart failure and not the injuries he sustained in the automobile accident.the court of appeal rejected this argument because among other things old republic never discussed the matter with doctor diaz and despite the fact the claims adjuster did not understand medical terms or conditions old republic did not consult with its own doctor.when doctor diaz testified at trial,he described what he would have said had the insurance company bothered to ask.he would have explained it is routine medical practice for a physician to identify the immediate cause of death on the death certificate but that the decedent heart failure was not brought on by disease but by trauma to the head which eventually caused ventricular fibrillation and death 
like the insurer in mariscal,century based its initial determination of benefits solely on its own review of wilson medical records without any attempt to consult her treating orthopedist,southern.from that review century concluded wilson sustain ed soft tissue injuries superimposed by a degenerative disc disease.italics added.
century did not have wilson examined by a neurosurgeon before making its initial claims decision although it was a neurosurgeon retained by century who eventually determined surgical intervention would be indicated and wilson had an likelihood of obtaining benefit from surgical intervention.nor did century produce evidence insurers ordinarily do not discuss cases with the insureds treating physicians or make referrals for independent medical evaluations before adjusting claims for physical injury.furthermore,century produced no evidence the claims adjuster and supervisors who initially handled wilson claim understood the numerous medical terms southern used in his reports and it did not explain how they arrived at the conclusion wilson physical damage was nothing more than a soft tissue injury overlaying a disc disease.neither of these findings was expressed in the reports they had before them.six months after the accident wilson told century she was still experiencing pain on a regular basis.southern also reported wilson was suffering pain in her neck and back.there is no evidence century followed up on this information by attempting to determine the level of wilson pain and its expected duration by questioning either wilson or southern.there is no evidence century inquired whether wilson was taking pain medication and whether the medication was effective in relieving her pain.
century willingness to reconsider its decision 
century maintains it acted reasonably because it considered all the evidence supplied by wilson and expressed a willingness to reconsider its decision should wilson wish to forward additional documents to substantiate her claim.as egan and mariscal demonstrate,however,relying solely on the insured to provide evidence to support her claim does not satisfy the insurer duty to thoroughly investigate the claim where,as here,there appear to be obvious avenues of inquiry in support of the claim which the insurer could have pursued but did not.as the court explained in hughes blue cross of northern california,t he covenant of good faith and fair dealing places the burden on the insurer to seek information relevant to the claim.
century genuine dispute of fact defense.
as a further defense to wilson bad faith claim century contends it can not be held liable in the present case because there was a genuine dispute between the parties concerning the value of wilson uim claim century valued the claim at wilson valued it at between and million.in support of this argument century cites chateau chamberay homeowners associated internat.ins.which held an insurer denying or delaying the payment of policy benefits due to the existence of a genuine dispute with its insured as to the existence of coverage liability or the amount of the insured coverage claim is not liable in bad faith even though it might be liable for breach of contract.citation.the key word here is genuine.as the chateau chamberay court recognized,the genuine dispute defense does not apply when the dispute arises because the insurer failed to conduct a thorough investigation.in other words,a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be found even where the insurer harbors actual doubts about the amount of benefits which should be paid on a covered claim if a reasonable investigation would have disclosed information making those doubts no longer tenable.
at trial,of course,wilson will have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that if century initially had conducted a thorough investigation of her claim and otherwise acted reasonably it would have offered her a higher settlement than it did at this stage of the proceedings,however,the issue of causation remains an issue of fact.
century failure to have wilson case evaluated by an attorney competent in the field of personal injury suits.
we asked the parties to brief the question whether,in a case involving underinsured motorist coverage,the insurer duty to fully inquire into possible bases that might support the insured claim requires the insurer to have the insured case evaluated by an attorney experienced in the field of personal injury law,or at least to consult with the insured attorney if she has one,to determine the value of the insured case were it to proceed to trial against the other driver.
under insurance code section,subdivision a,applicable to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage all policies of bodily injury liability insurance sold in california must insure the insured for all sums within the limits that she shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or wrongful death from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.in addition wilson uim coverage states our promise to you we will pay all sums which a person insured shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by a person insured up to the policy limit.the sums which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury are such damages as a california court would award.
thus,in order to reasonably evaluate an insured claim under her underinsured motorist protection,the insurer must determine the probable award the insured would receive from a jury if she were to file a negligence action against the other driver.this evaluation would normally take into consideration such factors as the location of the trial and jury verdicts in similar cases in that location.a reasonable evaluation would also take into account subjective values such as the demeanor of witnesses in depositions,any unusual circumstances surrounding the acts of the defendant that caused the injury,drunk driving and the ability or inability of witnesses to portray their testimony in a convincing and persuasive manner.as the court noted in richardson employers liab.assur,the evidence of the expert witness,an attorney,as to the reasonable settlement value of the claim was clearly relevant to the good faith issue.if this value had approximated the policy limits,the court explained,a jury might have concluded employers acted in bad faith in not settling the claim for the policy limits without arbitration.
we do not believe there should be a per se rule which makes failure to consult a personal injury attorney evidence of bad faith in every underinsured motorist claim.as wilson pointed out at oral argument there are many experienced claims adjusters who can determine the value of a litigated case as well as can an experienced personal injury attorney.we do emphasize,however,the litigation value of the case is a factor to be considered by the insurer in settling a claim for underinsured motorist coverage and valuation by a claims adjuster without input from experienced trial counsel may be insufficient to discharge the insurer duty to perform a complete review of the claim.
triable issues of fact exist as to whether century failed to objectively evaluate wilson claim.
gathering relevant information about the insured claim would be pointless,of course,if the insurer does not objectively evaluate the information it gathers.for example,in mariscal old republic,discussed above,the insurer was guilty of bad faith for failing to thoroughly investigate the insured claim and for ignoring the evidence it did gather which supported the claim 
century failure to objectively evaluate wilson pain and suffering.
century initial adjustment of wilson claim suggests it failed to objectively evaluate her pain and suffering.
as previously noted,the insurer finding wilson was suffering solely from a injury which was does not appear to have a basis in the medical reports submitted by southern.to the contrary a radiology report prepared a week after the accident and submitted to century stated an examination of wilson cervical spine revealed no soft tissue swelling.furthermore,southern report describes wilson condition as degenerative disk changes as a result of occult disk injury at the levels in the neck from her high speed motor vehicle accident.century diagnosis of soft tissue injury seems to have been based on the modest amount of wilson medical bills rather than on the medical evidence.
the attorney representing wilson wrote to century during the initial evaluation stage informing it that despite her continued pain,one of reagan dreams was to study abroad and reagan is now in australia and expected to return in november.in an internal report rejecting wilson claim for the uim policy limit the claims adjuster transformed her study abroad into a vacation in australia.whether this was just an honest mistake or an expression of bias against wilson is a question for a jury to decide.the claims adjuster also expressed his personal opinion,without consulting wilson or southern,anyone on vacation in australia can not be suffering from severe pain.obviously,it is as possible to suffer severe pain in australia as in southern california.
century failure to use colossus to assist in evaluating wilson damages.
wilson contends there may be circumstances in which the way an insurer utilizes colossus or some other computer software program in its claims adjustment practice breaches the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.therefore,she asserts,the trial court erred in denying her motion to compel the adjuster who initially evaluated her claim to answer questions about the use of colossus in century claims practice.
we agree with wilson first contention.however,because there may have been a procedural reason why the trial court denied wilson motion to compel,we can not say the court erred in denying the motion instead,because this cause is being remanded to the trial court for other reasons,we will instruct the court to afford wilson the opportunity to renew her motion,after satisfying statutory requirements.
colossus is the trade name for a software program which provides insurance companies help in assessing damages in personal injury claims each insurer licensing colossus customizes the program to reflect its own settlement philosophies.generally a company will conduct roundtables to assess the claim value factors in an injury claim.the insurance company most skilled and experienced casualty claims professionals come together to evaluate hypothetical injury claims.next,the insurance company may conduct a closed study to compare the baseline values determined by the roundtables to its claims practice history.the insurer uses both the closed claim study and the roundtables to assign values to injury severity.once colossus is programmed to reflect the insurer settlement philosophies its claims adjusters can evaluate an injury.after the adjuster enters all diagnosed and accident related injuries colossus guides the adjuster through a series of questions regarding the treatment,prognosis,conditions,and symptoms of the injury as well as questions about the claimant such as her interests and hobbies and her ability to continue those activities once all the data has been entered colossus assigns severity points to the injury.then,using the insurance company information regarding the value of injuries,colossus recommends a value for the injury claim.the claims adjuster uses this information as a guide in determining the settlement value of the claim 
proponents of colossus stress it is properly used only as a guide to determining the value of a claim it is not a robotic claims adjuster when used as a guide,however,it can help insurance companies avoid bad faith suits by making sure the claims adjuster has performed due diligence in the assessment of the claim proper use of colossus requires the claims adjuster to examine and enter all medical records,the injury prognosis,the type of treatment the claimant has received,the future treatment the claimant will need,the amount of time the claimant will need medical care or living assistance,the claimant economic damages furthermore,by comparing the settlement values suggested by colossus with past and present settlements actually paid company management can assess whether the company is making fair and consistent payments in cases with similar circumstances one insurance industry evaluation of colossus observes its ability to assist the insurer to produce consistent and reasonable evaluations of bodily injury claims is particularly important in the area of uninsured and underinsured motorist claims that tend to draw a significant number of bad faith claims on the basis of the allegation that the claim professional has erroneously undervalued the bodily injury portion of the claim.colossus also helps insurers steer clear of bad faith claims by training new adjusters in the proper techniques for evaluating bodily injury claims.the data input function of colossus forces the trainee to focus on all of the important information necessary to properly evaluate the value of a bodily injury claim.
during the deposition of paul le,the adjuster who first handled wilson claim,counsel for century directed le not to answer any questions about the role colossus plays in century claims practice.he based his objection on the ground le did not use colossus in evaluating wilson claim and therefore questions about colossus were irrelevant and speculative.these objections lacked merit.
deposition questions are not objectionable on the ground the answers might be excluded at trial.under code of civil procedure section a party is entitled to discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.this statute has been liberally construed to mean i n the context of discovery,evidence is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating its case,preparing for trial,or facilitating a settlement.
because this bad faith case turns on whether the insurer failed to reasonably investigate and evaluate the insured claim,the insurer claims handling practices are certainly a matter subject to discovery if good practice points toward the use of colossus in underinsured motorist claims the fact le did not use colossus in evaluating wilson claim does not render irrelevant century guidelines with respect to the use of colossus on the contrary le failure to use colossus may be as important in this case as the dog failure to bark in the famous sherlock holmes case of silver blaze.it would certainly be relevant to know whether le failure to use colossus violated company policy and if so the frequency with which le violated that policy 
century argued in the trial court,as it does on appeal,wilson motion to compel was fatally flawed because she failed to meet and confer with century prior to filing th
