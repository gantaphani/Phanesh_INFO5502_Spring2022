background 
the pertinent facts are either undisputed or are drawn from acceptance complaint at the time of the events giving rise to this suit,acceptance was a insurance holding company.it held three subsidiaries,american growers insurance company american growers acceptance insurance company and american agrisurance,through which it engaged in the crop insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses.american growers,the first of these subsidiaries,was in the business of underwriting insurance policies within the federal crop insurance program.
the federal crop insurance corporation fcic is a wholly owned government corporation within the department of agriculture,established by congress in to regulate the crop insurance industry.under the fcia,congress directed that crop insurance be offered through private insurance providers and be reinsured and regulated by the fcic.the fcic offers standard reinsurance agreements sras to eligible private insurance companies.under sras,the fcic reinsures policies that private insurance companies issue to producers of agricultural commodities.the risk management agency rma is an agency within the department of agriculture whose purpose is to supervise the fcic and to administer all programs authorized pursuant to the fcia.a,b pursuant to d,the fcia provides for jurisdiction in the united states district courts for suits brought by or against the fcic.section d states in pertinent part that t he district courts of the united states shall have exclusive original jurisdiction,without regard to the amount in controversy,of all suits brought by or against the fcic.
on november,acceptance entered into a letter of intent with rain and hail,llc rain and hail,a limited liability company also in the crop insurance business and also regulated by the fcic.the letter of intent detailed the terms of a proposed sale to rain and hail of certain of acceptance crop insurance assets for not less than million.acceptance alleges that,while structured as a sale of assets,the proposed transaction,in fact,was to be a sale by acceptance of american growers.according to acceptance,because the insurance assets to be purchased by rain and hail were reinsured by the fcic and were subject to the fcic general oversight authority over the crop insurance industry,the proposed transaction between acceptance and rain and hail was subject to approval by the rma.compl.acceptance contends that the rma rejected the proposed sale,finding it detrimental to the interests of farmers and taxpayers,and that,as a result,rain and hail and acceptance did not complete the sale.compl.subsequently,on november,the rma ordered american growers to cease and desist from the marketing and selling of any new insurance contracts under its sras with the fcic.it also advised american growers that the fcic would not reinsure for it any new insurance contracts.following the collapse of the proposed sale of assets to rain and hail,and in view of acceptance precarious financial position,the nebraska department of insurance placed american growers business under supervision,and ultimately into liquidation.acceptance contends that this allowed the rma to take control of american growers crop insurance assets,and to ultimately distribute those assets among several crop insurance companies.in short,acceptance alleges that the rma effectively put american growers out of business.compl.
following the events described above,acceptance filed a complaint in the court of federal claims alleging that w hen the rma,acting as an agent of the united states,rejected the proposed rain and transaction in the interests of the american taxpayer,it effected a takings of acceptance property,namely certain of acceptance assets,which were to be sold to rain and hail,for public use.compl.eventually,the government brought a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing,inter alia,that d placed exclusive jurisdiction in federal district court over acceptance takings claim.the court of federal claims denied the motion,holding that this is a claim against the united states alleging a fifth amendment takings.the court of federal claims has jurisdiction to hear and determine takings claims against the united states.acceptance ins.united states acceptance i,slip op.at.the court reasoned that the purpose of the fcia did not appear to be inconsistent with the court of federal claims tucker act jurisdiction to hear takings claims against the united states.id.thus,the court stated,a s the two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.id.quoting blanchette.ins,d.
subsequently,the case was transferred to a different judge within the court of federal claims.in addition,this court issued its opinion in texas peanut farmers united states.in texas peanut farmers,we held that because the true nature of the breach of contract action against the united states was a breach of contract action against the fcic,section d grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the district courts over suits against the fcic meant that the case had to be transferred from the court of federal claims to a district court.in due course,the government renewed its motion to dismiss acceptance suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in light of texas peanut farmers.this time,the court of federal claims granted the motion.in doing so,the court held that the mandatory language of section d left no room for concurrent court of federal claims tucker act jurisdiction over acceptance suit and that exclusive jurisdiction lay in federal district court.acceptance ii.at.the court read texas peanut farmers to support its reading of section d as divesting the court of federal claims of jurisdiction over all suits involving the fcic,including suits involving takings claims.following its decision,the court transferred acceptance suit to the district of nebraska.id.at.
following the transfer,acceptance filed a motion to retransfer the case to the court of federal claims under.the district court denied the motion in acceptance iii.in its decision,the court reiterated the reasoning of the court of federal claims and concluded that because the previous transfer decision was plausible,and therefore not clearly erroneous,its jurisdictional inquiry was at an end.acceptance iii,wl at.acceptance has timely appealed the district court denial of its motion to retransfer.
discussion 
pursuant to d a,we have jurisdiction over an appeal from an interlocutory order of a district court denying a motion to transfer an action to the court of federal claims under.our review of the district court decision granting or denying transfer of an action to the court of federal claims is de novo because the district court underlying determination is one of jurisdiction.see awad united states.the transfer statute provides as follows 
whenever a civil action is filed in a court as defined in section of this title or an appeal,including a petition for review of administrative action,is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed,and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.
thus,to successfully employ section to have a case transferred,a movant must show,inter alia,i that the transferor court lacks jurisdiction and ii that the transferee court has jurisdiction.see also fisherman harvest,pbs j,section requires the transferor court to determine both that it lacks jurisdiction and that the transferee court possesses jurisdiction.
d states in pertinent part that t he district courts of the united states shall have exclusive original jurisdiction,without regard to the amount in controversy,of all suits brought by or against the corporation.in acceptance ii,the court of federal claims read t his mandatory language as leaving no opening for concurrent jurisdiction with the tucker act.the words exclusive and concurrent are antonyms,and the court finds no ambiguity in their meaning.acceptance ii.at.further,the court believed that its reading of section d was supported by texas peanut farmers.there,the sought to avoid the jurisdiction of the district court over their breach of contract claim against the fcic by naming the united states,the rma and its secretary,and the department of agriculture and its secretary,as the defendants and filing suit in the court of federal claims instead of in district court.we concurred with the court of federal claims holding that section d placed exclusive jurisdiction over breach of contract claim in the district court,stating 
argue that their contracts with the government provide for lawsuits to be filed in federal district court but do not prohibit filing in the court of federal claims the tucker act provides jurisdiction in the court of federal claims over their contract claim against the united states therefore the tucker act allows concurrent jurisdiction appellants assertions are unavailing congress may withdraw any grant of tucker act jurisdiction.
peanut farmers,at.in acceptance ii,the court of federal claims reasoned that t here is nothing unique to a breach of contract theory in the logic of the argument rejected by the federal circuit.by substituting takings claim for contract claim in the above passage the result is the same.acceptance ii.at.the court stated that n owhere in its decision did the federal circuit indicate that congress withdrawal of tucker act jurisdiction applied only to contract claims.the grant of exclusive original jurisdiction to the district courts in d is not confined to any particular cause of action.id.footnote omitted.as previously noted,in denying acceptance motion to retransfer,the district court essentially followed the decision of the court of federal claims in acceptance ii.
on appeal,acceptance argues that the court of federal claims erred in transferring its suit because it has exclusive jurisdiction over the case.this is so,urges acceptance,because its complaint alleging a fifth amendment taking properly sued the united states in its sovereign capacity.according to acceptance,the fcia vests exclusive jurisdiction in district courts over claims against the fcic,but its claim was properly brought against the united states.acceptance distinguishes texas peanut farmers by explaining that,in that case,the plaintiffs brought suit naming the united states and others as defendants,but the true nature of the claim was for breach of contract against the fcic.however,in this case,acceptance argues,it has named the united states as the defendant,and the true nature of the claim is a takings claim against the united states.the government does not concede that acceptance claim is a takings claim,and it continues to advance parallel arguments as to why the court of federal claims lacks jurisdiction and why jurisdiction properly lies in the district court pursuant to d.the first argument asserted to the court of federal claims,and ultimately accepted by the court,was that section d expressly grants district courts exclusive jurisdiction over all claims against the fcic,including takings claims.the second argument asserted was that,while acceptance pled its claim as a taking,the true nature of the suit was a contract action,because the specific property interest asserted was governed by the sra between american growers and the fcic.thus,according to the government,prior to bringing suit,acceptance was required to exhaust the fcia mandated administrative remedy of an appeal to the board of contract appeals the government argues that,for these reasons,the district court did not err in denying acceptance transfer motion.
turning first to the nature of acceptance suit,we note that both the court of federal claims and the district court viewed acceptance claim as one for a compensable taking.acceptance iii,wl,at a lthough.peanut farmers concerns a action,there is nothing in the fcia that limits that act to actions.acceptance ii.at there is nothing unique to a breach of contract theory in the logic of the argument rejected by the federal circuit in texas peanut farmers.by substituting takings claim for contract claim in the above passage,the result is the same.nowhere in its decision did the federal circuit indicate that congress withdrawal of tucker act jurisdiction applied only to contract claims.id.at having determined that d divests the court of jurisdiction to hear a takings claim against the fcic,the court proceeded to examine whether that section also applies to actions of the rma acceptance i,slip op.at this claim is against the united states alleging a fifth amendment taking.
a challenge to the court of federal claims jurisdiction may be overcome on the basis of allegations in the complaint.see fisher united states,plaintiff complaint,clearly grounded on a statute that mandates compensation,gives the court of federal claims jurisdiction to address the case on the merits.see also total med.mgmt.united states,although the government argues that jurisdiction is lacking because there was no enforceable contract,the law is clear that,for the court of federal claims to have jurisdiction,a valid contract must only be pleaded,not ultimately proven.this is a reflection of the complaint rule.see aetna health davila,d ordinarily,determining whether a particular case arises under federal law turns on the complaint rule.internal citation omitted christianson colt indus.operating,d under the complaint rule,whether a court has jurisdiction over a claim must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statements of his own claim in the bill or declaration louisville nashville mottley.holding that plaintiff statement of his own cause of action is what determines jurisdiction.on the basis of the allegations in acceptance complaint,we agree with the court of federal claims and the district court that acceptance suit is one for a compensable regulatory taking under the fifth amendment.
we have stated that 
t he federal circuit has developed a test to evaluate claims that a governmental action constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation.first,a court must evaluate whether the claimant has established a property interest for purposes of the fifth amendment.second,once a court has determined that a property interest exists,it must determine whether a taking occurred 
a categorical taking has been defined as one in which all economically viable use,all economic value has been taken by the regulatory imposition.a categorical taking is distinct from a taking that is the consequence of a regulatory imposition that prohibits or restricts only some of the use that would otherwise
