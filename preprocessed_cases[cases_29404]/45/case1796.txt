plaintiff adrienne blatchford suffered serious injuries in a car accident.she received extensive health care services from defendant alaska native tribal health consortium the consortium.pursuant to the indian health care improvement act,stat,the consortium did not charge plaintiff for those services because she is a native american.but the consortium filed a lien under alaska law,alaska statutes,against any money that plaintiff receives from third parties,related to the injuries for which it treated her.the consortium also filed a notice of federal health services lien,citing.
plaintiff received a substantial settlement from her insurer,and her lawyer disbursed all the settlement funds except for the amount subject to the consortium liens.thereafter plaintiff filed an action in alaska state court,seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that the consortium liens are not valid,in whole or in part.the consortium removed the action to federal court and filed a counterclaim asserting that,under,plaintiff must remit the remaining funds to it.the district court granted summary judgment to the consortium because it has a right to recover the money spent on plaintiff medical care under.on de novo review we reverse because does not apply here.
in enacting the indian health care improvement act,congress found that f ederal health services to maintain and improve the health of the indians are consonant with and required by the federal government historical and unique legal relationship with,and resulting responsibility to,the american indian people.congress declares that it is the policy of this nation,in fulfillment of its special trust responsibilities and legal obligations to indians to ensure the highest possible health status for indians and urban indians and to provide all resources necessary to effect that policy id.accordingly,native americans need not pay for health care services that they receive from eligible providers but,pursuant to,those providers can recover certain of their costs from third parties.
we pause to note that,as part of the recent health care overhaul,congress amended in.all the relevant events the car accident,the receipt of health care services,the consortium filing of its liens,plaintiff insurance settlement,and the filing of this litigation occurred before the amendments took effect.but it is possible that congress intended the amendments to have retroactive effect.see,yukon kuskokwim health trust ins.plan for sw.alaska,performing an extensive analysis of the amendments to the statute and concluding that they had retroactive effect.we need not decide,however,whether the version of the statute or the version of the statute applies.in the discussion below,we apply the version of the statute,but we emphasize that the result we reach here would be the same even if congress intended the amendments to have retroactive effect.although the new version of,which appears in an appendix,is longer and more explicit,it changed neither the intended scope of the section nor its relationship to state lien laws.
section provided,in full 
reimbursement from certain third parties of costs of health services.
a right of recovery 
except as provided in subsection f of this section,the united states,an indian tribe,or a tribal organization shall have the right to recover the reasonable expenses incurred by the secretary,an indian tribe,or a tribal organization in providing health services,through the service,an indian tribe,or a tribal organization,to any individual to the same extent that such individual,or any nongovernmental provider of such services,would be eligible to receive reimbursement or indemnification for such expenses if such services had been provided by a nongovernmental provider,and such individual had been required to pay such expenses and did pay such expenses.

f right of recovery for services when selfinsurance plan provides coverage 
the united states shall not have a right of recovery under this section if the injury,illness,or disability for which health services were provided is covered under a plan funded by an indian tribe or tribal organization.
that statute provides a right of recovery only against third parties.two elements of the text make this limitation clear.first,the title of which remains identical after the amendments states reimbursement from certain third parties of costs of health services.id.emphasis added.as the supreme court has held,the title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.almendarez torres united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.second,subsection a,which defines the scope of the right of recovery,allows the provider to recover to the same extent that the native american individual would be eligible to receive reimbursement or indemnification for such expenses.a emphasis added.that wording presupposes that the provider stands in the shoes of the individual who,naturally enough,would not be receiving reimbursement or indemnification from herself 
in addition to limiting the reach of an eligible provider right to the provider relationship to third parties only,and not to the native american who received services,the statute limits the ways in which the provider may enforce its right against third parties.the provider may enforce that right in one of only two ways.congress specified that the provider either may join a civil action filed by the individual or his or her heirs against a third party or,if the individual does not file such an action,may file its own action against a third party.e 
the ordinary workings of this statute are uncomplicated.because a native american need not pay for health care services from eligible providers,she may have a diminished incentive if any incentive at all to seek remuneration from third parties for the provider cost to deliver care.to address that situation,the statute allows the provider to recover its expenses against tortfeasors,relevant insurers,or other third parties by joining in the individual litigation against those third parties,to protect its interest,or by filing its own action.
here,however,the health care provider seeks to enforce a right of recovery against the individual to whom it provided services,at least with respect to the settlement funds.that procedure simply does not fit within the statute,in which the right of recovery that congress granted runs only against
