in this insurance coverage matter,ameron international corporation ameron seeks coverage from insurers collectively respondents for its million settlement of a contract dispute with the federal government and for its related defense costs.the settlement occurred during a protracted administrative hearing before the united states department of interior board of contract appeals ibca.between and,respondents issued a series of primary comprehensive and commercial general liability cgl and policies to ameron.with respect to these policies,ameron contends the trial court too narrowly construed respondents duties to defend and indemnify and,as a result,erroneously granted harbor motion for judgment on the pleadings and sustained the other respondents demurrers,without leave to amend,to ameron operative third amended complaint complaint resolution of this matter requires an analysis of four supreme court decisions issued between and that described the limits of the duties to defend and indemnify an insured for its expenses in complying with environmental agency activity prior to the filing of a complaint.
in,national union fire ins.cal th,d,and powerine i,supra,cal th,d,the court examined several primary cgl policies.in,the court held that the duty to defend a suit seeking damages,where suit was not defined in the policy,was triggered only by a civil action prosecuted in a court of law,at,d.in powerine i,at pages,the court held that in a policy imposing a duty to defend in any suit seeking damages and a duty to indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages,where neither suit nor damages are defined within the policy the duty to indemnify is limited to money ordered by a court and does not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.in powerine oil,superior court cal th,d,powerine ii,the court acknowledged the importance of the precise wording of the policies insuring agreements id.at,d,and concluded that policies which included the word expenses,as well as damages in the insuring agreement provided a duty to indemnify for the cleanup of contaminated sites id.at,d.finally,in a case decided the same day as powerine ii,the court reached the contrary conclusion because the literal insuring language of the policies in that case neither referenced nor incorporated the term expenses.county of san diego ace property casualty ins.cal th,d,ace.
here,the trial court relied on and powerine i and concluded the subject proceeding before the ibca was not a covered suit because a suit means a civil action initiated by a complaint in a court of law and the money paid by ameron to settle the dispute was not covered damages because damages are limited to money ordered by a court.as to those policies before us whose insuring agreements are similar to those construed in and powerine i,and where suit is not defined,we conclude the rule announced by the supreme court in those two decisions is properly applied,despite the significant differences between the ibca proceeding,involved here,and environmental remediation orders.however,as to the policies before us that contain a definition of the term suit,provide indemnity for loss,not damages,there may be a duty on the insurer to indemnify defend.as to those policies,the trial court erred 
procedural and factual 
ameron is a delaware corporation whose principal place of business is pasadena,california.respondents are insurance companies who provided ameron with primary,excess umbrella insurance coverage between and.
beginning in,the united states department of the interior,bureau of reclamation bureau,entered into general contracts with peter kiewit sons company kiewit for the manufacture and installation of concrete siphons to be used in the central arizona project,an aqueduct system.pursuant to a subcontract with kiewit,ameron manufactured the siphons between and.ameron was required by its contracts with kiewit to defend and indemnify kiewit,and kiewit is an insured under ameron insurance policies 
in,defects in the siphons were discovered,requiring their replacement or repair.as a result of the defective siphons,in the central arizona water conservation district filed an action against ameron in federal district court in arizona hereafter the cawd action.ameron provided timely notice of the cawd action to its insurers.the cawd action was dismissed,and an appeal taken to the ninth circuit court of appeals was dismissed in 
in,during the pendency of the cawd action,the bureau contracting officer issued two final decisions finding that kiewit was responsible for defects in the siphons,necessitating their replacement at a cost of approximately million the government sought approximately million in damages from ameron and kiewit.pursuant to their private contractual remedy,ameron and kiewit elected to challenge the decisions of the bureau contracting officer before the ibca.the government asserted that it had acted to prevent a massive explosion resulting from the rupture of the defective siphons.the defects alleged by the government involved continuous and progressive deterioration of the materials used to construct the siphons.
ameron provided timely notice to respondents of the bureau claims and proceedings against ameron and kiewit.after days of trial,on january,ameron and kiewit settled the government claims for million.truck insurance exchange truck one of ameron primary insurers,paid ameron certain sums with respect to the central arizona project litigation.respondents failed or refused to pay for defense costs incurred in the litigation and failed or refused to pay for the settlement with the bureau.
the complaint 
in april,ameron,in its own right and as an assignee of kiewit rights,filed its original complaint against respondents and others for breach of contract and related claims.ameron filed its operative complaint on july,in essence,the complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,declaratory relief,waiver and estoppel and contribution.the thrust of the complaint is that respondents failed or refused to defend ameron or settle the ibca litigation,failed to indemnify ameron for its settlement of the ibca litigation,and failed to investigate the potential of coverage.
insurance coverage 
ameron purchased million in primary insurance coverage between july and march.truck issued primary policies between july,and july,ina issued primary policies between august,and august,and zurich issued primary policies between september,and march.
between july,and august,pacific,puritan,old republic,twin city,transcontinental and great american issued ameron first layer excess insurance policies to truck primary policies.no second layer excess insurance was in effect as to ameron during that period.
for the period april,to july,international issued ameron first layer policies to truck primary policy,and,from july,to july,paul issued a second layer excess policy.for the period august,to august,international issued ameron a first layer policy and paul issued ameron a second layer excess policy overlying an ina primary policy.during the period august,to august,harbor and icsop issued ameron second layer excess policies to the international first layer and ina primary policies.for the period august,to december,icsop provided ameron a first layer policy to the underlying primary policies.
ameron complaint alleged that proceedings before the ibca are civil proceedings in which damages may be awarded for property damage,and that the ibca acts in a judicial capacity when conducting hearings and deciding contested factual issues.ameron also alleged that pursuant to the contract disputes act of the act,it had the choice of challenging the decision of the bureau contracting officer by appealing that decision to the ibca or by bringing an action in the united states court of federal claims.it asserted that the act refers to an action filed in either the ibca or the court of federal claims as a suit,triggering respondents coverage duties.
the waiver and estoppel causes of action alleged that respondents knowingly and intentionally failed to inform ameron that there was no coverage for the ibca proceeding because an ibca proceeding is not a covered suit.ameron alleged that had it been informed by respondents that ibca proceedings are not covered under respondents policies,ameron could have proceeded against the bureau in the court of federal claims rather than before the ibca.
the complaint declaratory relief causes of action alleged that a present and justiciable controversy exists between ameron and respondent excess insurers regarding coverage under respondents policies,and the controversy exists whether or not the underlying primary insurance is exhausted.the declaratory relief cause of action also alleged,alternatively,the underlying insurance will be deemed exhausted if ameron is permitted to select a single year of coverage for the settlement with the bureau.alternatively,the underlying insurance may be deemed inapplicable at some point in this litigation,if the court should determine that certain underlying insurance does not provide coverage,but a respondent excess insurer does so.the court is therefore requested to issue a declaratory judgment which will resolve these disputed issues and determine which policies are liable to provide coverage,and in which order.
in addition,as an assignee of the rights of truck,ameron sought equitable contribution from ina and zurich for the amount paid by truck.
ameron action against respondents was dismissed after the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings to harbor and sustained without leave to amend the demurrers filed by the other respondents to each cause of action.

legal background 
in,the court determined the scope of the duty to defend against administrative actions in standard primary cgl policies.the insured had been ordered by the department of toxic substances control of the california environmental protection agency to undertake certain remediation activities in regard to contamination at a site in coachella,california,supra,cal th at,d.the insured tendered defense of the order to four of its insurers.the cgl policies examined in,with minor nonmaterial differences,stated,the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient id.at,d.the terms suit and claim were not defined in the policies.id.at,d.utilizing a literal meaning approach,the court concluded that the word suit in the duty to defend clause was not ambiguous and denoted court proceedings initiated by the filing of a complaint.id.at,d.the court declined to take either a functional or hybrid approach,rejecting the notion that suit means anything equivalent to a suit.id.at,d.under the policies at issue in,an insurer had the duty to defend a suit,but discretion to investigate and settle a claim.id.at,d.the court concluded that under those policies,the insurer duty to defend a suit seeking damages was limited to defending a civil action prosecuted in a court.id.at,d,see also powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.held that,based on the policy language,the insurer duty to defend did not extend to an administrative agency proceeding pursuant to an environmental statute,which was not a suit,but rather implicated a claim,at,d.
was intended to create a rule that,by clearly delineating the scope of risk,reduce d the need for future litigation,by avoiding the determination whether each new and different letter presenting the claim of an administrative agency is to be deemed the functional equivalent of a suit brought in a court of law.citation.citation.cdm,supra,th at,d.thus,where suit and claim are not defined within the policy,suit in the policies means a civil action commenced by filing a complaint,and a nything short of this is a claim,supra,cal th at,d.
powerine i 
in powerine i,the supreme court considered the reach of the duty to indemnify in a standard primary cgl policy,and held that the insurer duty to indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages under such a policy is limited to money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the duty to indemnify did not extend to all sums,or even any sum,that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay other than as damages.id.at,d.
powerine i based its holding in part on the syllogism the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.the duty to defend is not broad enough to extend beyond a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather is limited thereto.a fortiori,the duty to indemnify is not broad enough to extend beyond damages,money ordered by a court,but rather is limited thereto.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
apart from the syllogism,powerine i explained the term damages,when viewed in either the narrow focus of the policy itself or the wider focus of the policy within the legal and broader culture,is limited to money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.in considering the term damages within the narrow focus of the policy itself,the court noted that the duty to defend and duty to indemnify provisions expressly link damages to a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court.id.at,d.as to the duty to defend,it is in a suit that damages are sought through the court order.as to the duty to indemnify,it is in a suit that damages are fixed in their amount through the court order.ibid.the court stated that when the policy is viewed within the wider legal and broader culture,damages exist traditionally inside of court,whereas harm exists traditionally outside of court.ibid.
powerine i noted that use of the term damages in the insuring agreement of the standard cgl policy precluded a finding that a broad right to indemnification outside the context of a lawsuit was intended under the policy language.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.o ne would not speak of any sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages apart from any order by a court because,as a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay,damages presuppose an institution for their ordering,traditionally a court,albeit no longer exclusively.citations.damages do not constitute a redundancy to a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay,but a limitation thereof.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the supreme court stated that limiting the term damages to money ordered by a court commends itself to society generally as laying down a rule.id.at,d.this has a tendency to promote fairness and efficiency in the judicial sphere,by increasing certainty and decreasing uncertainty about the duty to indemnify.id.at,d.
powerine i acknowledged that although damages traditionally means money ordered by a court,administrative agencies occasionally have the power to order damages.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.however,the court noted that as to the standard cgl policy before it,damages exist solely inside of court,especially in light of their linkage therein to a suit that the court defined as a civil action prosecuted in a court.powerine i,at,d.
powerine i further acknowledged that,while the duty to indemnify may embrace all money ordered by a court,it does not extend to any money in addition to that ordered by a court,expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
as the court of appeal in cdm noted,read together,and powerine i stand for the proposition that the duty to defend a suit seeking damages under cgl policies is restricted to civil actions prosecuted in a court,initiated by the filing of a complaint,and does not include claims,which can denote proceedings conducted by administrative agencies under environmental statutes.likewise,the duty to indemnify for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages citation in the same standard primary policies is limited to money ordered by a court,and does not include expenses such as may be incurred in responding to administrative agency orders.cdm,supra,th at,d.
powerine ii 
in powerine ii,the supreme court considered the extent of the duty to indemnify in standard form policies the central insuring clauses of the policies provided the company hereby agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages,direct or consequential and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence happening anywhere in the world.powerine ii,supra cal th at,d.the policies defined ultimate net loss as the total sum which the insured,or any company as its insurer,or both,become obligated to pay by reason of property damage either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include all sums paid for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits,which are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder id.at,d.
the supreme court focused on each policy central insuring clause and held that this clause extended the insurers indemnification obligation beyond money damages to include expenses incurred in responding to government agency orders administratively imposed outside the context of a lawsuit.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.the court noted that in the central insuring clause of the standard primary cgl policy such as that in powerine i,it is the single word damages that limits the duty to indemnify to money ordered by a court.id.at,d.the court stated that the term damages in the excess policies serves the same purpose it serves in the standard primary cgl policy it extends the indemnity obligation to money ordered by a court in a suit against the insured.id.at,d.however,the central insuring clause of the policies at issue in powerine ii provided indemnification coverage for damages and expenses,thereby extending coverage beyond damages alone and beyond money ordered by a court.id.at,d.
powerine ii noted that the policies central insuring clause further defined the indemnification obligation by incorporating the definition of ultimate net loss,which included sums the insured becomes obligated to pay,through compromise or settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims that do not necessarily reflect an underlying lawsuit.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that where the express insuring language of an policy broadens indemnity coverage for sums paid in furtherance of a compromise or settlement of a claim initiated by an administrative agency for remedial relief pursuant to an environmental statute,the insured liability for such expenses falls within the policy indemnification obligation despite the absence of a lawsuit.id.at,d.
the powerine ii court next considered the policies central insuring provisions in the context of the policies as a whole.although the policies followed the form of underlying standard primary cgl policies like those considered in and powerine i,they also provided that the insurer agreed to pay the excess of the amount of ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence not covered by said underlying insurances,and thus provided umbrella indemnity coverage.that is,the policies provided alternative primary coverage as to losses not covered by the primary policy.citations.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the fact that the policies also provided umbrella indemnity suggests the insured would have expected the policies to provide broader coverage than that provided by the underlying primary policies.id.at,d.
the court rejected the insurers argument that the policies assistance and cooperation clause required an insurer to approve an settlement or compromise as a condition of coverage.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.it made clear that whether the policies afforded coverage for environmental costs ordered outside the context of a lawsuit turns on the literal language of the insuring agreements.ibid.
on the same day it issued powerine ii,the supreme court also issued ace,which considered whether a nonstandard or manuscript form excess third party liability policy afforded indemnity coverage for expenses incurred by the insured county of san diego in responding to an administrative agency environmental remediation order and for sums expended by the insured to settle related third party property damage claims outside the context of a lawsuit.ace,supra,cal th at,d.
the central insuring provision of the ace policy required the insurer to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement arising from damages resulting from the destruction or loss of use of tangible property.ace,supra,cal th at,d.the policy limits of liability provision provided,liability under this policy shall attach to the company only after the named insured has paid or has been liable to pay,the full amount of its respective ultimate net loss liabilities as follows id.at,d.ultimate net loss was defined in the policy as the sum or sums which the assured shall become legally obligated to pay in settlement or satisfaction of claims,suits or judgements includ ing all expenses from the investigation,negotiation and settlement of claims and shall include legal costs.ibid.
this nonstandard excess policy provided the insured with excess liability coverage over and above its retention.because the policy did not contain a duty to defend suits,the court found that the syllogism did not apply.ace,supra,cal th at,d.as in powerine i,the central insuring provision obligated the insurer to indemnify the insured for sums the insured was obligated to pay for damages.in ace,damages was the sole term of limitation in the indemnity agreement ace,at,d,and the term ultimate net loss appeared only in the limits of liability section of the policy id.at,d.
ace distinguished the central insuring provision in the powerine ii policies.that provision expressly contained the term expenses and then incorporated the definition of ultimate net loss.the central insuring provision in the ace policy,however,did not refer to or incorporate either term.ace,supra,cal th at,d.ace explained that including the definition of ultimate net loss in the limits of liability provision merely serves to define the insured total loss that will count toward such policy limits nothing in the limits of liability provision of the ace policy purports to expand ace indemnification obligation,once triggered,to anything other than damages.ibid.
the ace court also noted that unlike the policy in powerine ii,the ace policy contained a no action provision and also provided that the insured shall not,except at its own cost,voluntarily make any payment,assume any obligation or incur any expense other than for such immediate medical and surgical relief to others as shall be imperative at the time of the occurrence.ace,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that these provisions,which usually appear in policies including the duty to defend,are intended to preclude collusion between an insured and a third party claimant,and give the insurer the right to control the defense.these provisions undermine the suggestion that the term damages in the ace policy extends the duty to indemnify to any settlement entered into by the insured.id.at,d.
ace concluded that the insuring clause in the standard cgl policy in powerine i was substantively the same as the insuring clause in the ace nonstandard excess third party liability policy and held that the costs and expenses in responding to administrative agency orders and the settlements negotiated with third party claimants outside the context of a lawsuit were not within the coverage terms of the ace policy insuring agreement.ace,supra,cal th at,d.
lockheed considered whether cgl manuscript policies issued from through required the insurer to defend administrative proceedings before the california regional water quality control board that had not ripened into lawsuits filed in court.the defense clause of the policies provided that the insurer shall defend any suit or action against the insured alleging and seeking damages,but the insurer shall have the right to make such investigation,negotiation and settlement of any claim,suit or action as may be deemed expedient.lockheed,supra,th at,d.
in reliance on powerine i,the insurer in lockheed argued that it had no duty to defend because the phrase any suit or action is linked to the term damages.the court rejected that approach as powerine i recognized,although damages usually refers to money ordered by a court,orders to pay money made by administrative tribunals may also be viewed as damages.citation.lockheed,supra,th at,d.lockheed then analyzed the policies language in the context of the policies as a whole.as the court explained,it was undisputed that suit means lawsuit and claim means something short of a lawsuit,and the issue was whether action means some third thing.as observed in,an administrative order is generally considered to be a claim.therefore,to construe an administrative proceeding as an action would create ambiguity.the court reasoned that the common understanding of both action and suit in the context of the policies means proceedings in court,and held that any suit or action unambiguously applies to proceedings in court and does not encompass administrative proceedings that do not involve a lawsuit.lockheed,at,d.
on remand following powerine ii and ace,cdm considered whether a umbrella cgl policy provided indemnity coverage for environmental response costs incurred pursuant to an administrative order.cdm,supra,th at,fn,d.the central insuring clause in the umbrella policy covered the plaintiffs for the ultimate net loss in excess of the applicable underlying limit which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages.id.at,d.the policy defined ultimate net loss as the sum actually paid or payable in cash in the settlement or satisfaction of any claim or suit for which the insured is liable either by adjudication or settlement with the written consent of the insurer.ibid.
consistent with ace and powerine ii,the court in cdm concluded that although the central insuring clause used the term ultimate net loss,the insured was indemnified only for that portion of the ultimate net loss the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages.cdm,supra,th at,d.cdm noted that the central insuring clause did not contain the term expenses and concluded that this clause was substantively the same as the one in the standard cgl policy construed in powerine both policies contained the damages limitation standing alone,made no reference to expenses and did not purport to further define the scope of indemnity coverage set out in the insuring clause by reference to the definition of ultimate net loss.id.at,d.echoing ace,cdm stated that the term ultimate net loss was used in reference to what amount the insurer will pay after the insurer becomes obligated to pay rather than as a trigger of the insurer obligation to pay.cdm,at,d id.at,d.
discussion 
causes of action against ina 
ina issued ameron four successive primary cgl policies providing coverage between august,and august.the final three policies,from august,to august,contain definitions of the term suit that compel the conclusion that ina may have assumed a duty to indemnify and to defend ameron.thus,the trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer for breach of the duty to defend the ibca litigation,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and contribution causes of action,and.we begin,however,with a discussion of the first ina policy,covering the period from august,to august,though it is not material to a ruling on those causes of action.we do so because our conclusions regarding it are determinative regarding the extent of coverage of policies issued by international and paul which overlie this ina primary policy.
ina policy 
the insuring agreement provides the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient,but the company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit after the applicable limit of the company liability has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.suit and claim are not defined in the policy.
the insuring clause language in this policy is substantively the same as the policy language interpreted by the supreme court in and powerine i as to the duties to defend and indemnify.thus,where as here,suit and claim are not defined within the policy,suit in the policies means a civil action commenced by filing a complaint,and a nything short of this is a claim,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,the duty to indemnify for all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages italics added,provided in this policy,is limited to money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.since the ibca proceeding was not a civil action filed in a court of law,it was a claim,for which ameron could not reasonably expect a duty of defense or indemnity.in addition,an insurer is obligated to settle a case only when the policy indemnifies the insured for liability for the claimant loss.if the policy does not indemnify for the loss,the insurer can not be held liable for failing to settle.see johansen california state auto.bureau cal d.since the policy did not create a duty to indemnify on the part of ina,no cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is stated.
ameron argues,however,that this case is completely outside the scope of,powerine i,powerine ii and ace because those cases dealt exclusively with environmental administrative agencies that issued orders to abate or pollution.there is much to commend in ameron contention that the very different administrative proceeding in this case is a suit.the ibca is a administrative agency board which holds hearings in which it considers and determines appeals from contracting officer decisions relating to contracts made by the department of the interior or any other executive agency.fed.procedure.government contracts.the appeal is commenced by the filing of a notice,and,within days after receipt of notice of docketing of the appeal,the appellant must file a complaint setting forth simple,concise,and direct statements of each claim id.at.the requirement of a filed notice and complaint eliminates one concern expressed in avoidance of a determination whether each new and different letter presenting the claim of an administrative agency is to be deemed the functional equivalent of a suit brought in a court of law,supra,cal th at,d.during the subsequent hearings,the opposing sides may subpoena witnesses,who are sworn and subject to,supra.the admissibility of evidence is governed by the generally accepted rules of evidence applied in the courts of the united states in nonjury trials id.at.the administrative law judge who presides is authorized to grant any relief,including money damages,which would be available to a litigant asserting a contract claim in the court of federal claims.d fed.procedure,supra,at,cherokee nation of leavitt,d.generally,the decision of an agency board of contract appeals such as the ibca is final,subject only to amendment,reconsideration or appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.fed.procedure,supra.

were we writing on a blank slate,we would conclude that a knowledgeable government contractor,like ameron,would reasonably expect the ibca litigation was a suit seeking damages that triggered insurance coverage in a policy worded like the one in.but we are not.in,our high court consciously drew a rule that reduces the need for future litigation,by interpreting suit,in a policy that left the term undefined,as a court proceeding initiated by the filing of a complaint,supra,cal th at,d.normally,a case serves as authority only for those issues framed by its facts.the doctrine of precedent,or stare decisis,extends only to the ratio decidendi of a decision,not to supplementary or explanatory comments which might be included in an opinion.to determine the precedential value of a statement in an opinion,the language of that statement must be compared with the facts of the case and the issues raised.only statements necessary to the decision are binding precedents explanatory observations are not binding precedent.citations.western landscape construction bank of america th,d.because the administrative proceedings in involved a pollution remediation order,we might fairly regard its broad rule as dicta when applied to the very different administrative proceedings in this case.but,e ven if properly characterized as dictum,statements of the supreme court should be considered persuasive.citation.citation.twenty years ago presiding justice otto kaus gave some sage advice to trial judges and intermediate appellate court justices generally speaking,follow dicta from the california supreme court.citation.that was good advice then and good advice now.hubbard superior court th,d accord,people superior court maury th,d.

each policy defines suit as a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged.suit includes an arbitration proceeding alleging such damages to which you must submit or submit with our consent.no relevant definition of damages is provided in the policies.see fn,post.
ameron contends that and powerine i are distinguishable because the standard cgl policies at issue in those cases did not define the term suit.ameron argues that by defining suit as a civil proceeding including arbitration,the ina policies do not restrict defense or indemnity coverage to lawsuits filed in a court.
ina responds that the definition of suit contained within its defense provision is limited to a civil proceeding alleging damages and its indemnity obligation is also limited to damages.ina argues that powerine i and its progeny have unequivocally determined that as a matter of law,damages can only be awarded by a court of law,and,therefore,ina had no obligation to defend or indemnify ameron for the settlement reached in connection with the administrative ibca proceeding.ina also asserts that since its policies deductible endorsements also refer to the insurer obligation to pay damages,the endorsements bolster the parties mutual understanding that ina defense and indemnity obligations are limited to the payment of damages awarded by a court of law.with minor nonmaterial differences,the deductible endorsements provide that ina obligation to pay damages on behalf of the insured under this policy applies only to damages in excess of the amount of the deductibles 
because the ina policies are distinct contractual insurance policies whose wording and provisions were not before the supreme court in,powerine i and ii,and ace,we examine the policies de novo,and consider the definition of suit and damages in the context of each policy as a whole to determine whether the policy provides coverage for the ibca proceeding that the parties agree was not a proceeding in a court of law.
the three ina policies before us define suit as a civil proceeding includ ing an arbitration proceeding alleging damages.the policies contain no definition of the term civil proceeding,so we construe it based on its common usage.there is no dictionary definition for the term.civil,however,is defined as relating to private rights and remedies that are sought by action or suit,as distinct from criminal proceedings.black law dict.ed.proceeding is variously defined as t he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit,including all acts and events between the time of commencement and the entry of judgment,a ny procedural means for seeking redress from a tribunal or agency,and t he business conducted by a court or other official body a hearing.id.at.because civil proceeding is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation,including a hearing before an institution that is not a court,it is ambiguous and must be construed in the light most favorable to the insured.cdm,supra,th at,d.we may reasonably define civil proceeding to encompass a proceeding in which redress is sought from an administrative agency 
the policies also define suit to include arbitration.the term arbitration is not defined within the policy,but is commonly defined as,the hearing and determination of a case in controversy by a person chosen by the parties or appointed under statutory authority.webster new collegiate dict.by definition,arbitration is not a lawsuit commenced by filing a complaint in a court of law it is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to a legal action filed in a court.see madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.
this broad definition of suit within the duty to defend compels an equally broad definition of damages.thus,the promise in these policies to defend an arbitration proceeding alleging damages requires a definition of damages broader than money ordered by a court since damages is not defined within the ina policies,we again look to the plain meaning of that term within the context of the policies as a whole.in aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu,the supreme court considered various lay and legal definitions of the term and concluded,whatever their semantic difference,the statutory and dictionary definitions of damages share several basic concepts.each requires there to be compensation,in money,recovered by a party for loss or detriment it has suffered through the acts of another.id.at,fns.omitted accord golden eagle ins.insurance of the west th,d.the aiu court construed compensation to encompass any remunerative payment made to an aggrieved party.aiu,at,fn.where the cgl policies before us do not compel a more limited definition of damages,we adopt the meaning set forth in aiu.
the indemnity obligation in these ina policies is also limited by the term damages ina will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies caused by an occurrence.italics added.ina argues we should construe damages in the indemnity clause differently,and more narrowly than damages in the defense clause.but accepting this argument would violate the rule of contract interpretation that the same word used in an instrument is generally given the same meaning unless the policy indicates otherwise.citations,zurich american ins.cal th,d.moreover,limiting damages to money ordered by a court for purposes of indemnity,but not for purposes of defense would be nonsensical.while it is true that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,the duty to defend applies only to claims that create a potential for indemnity.ortega,supra,th at,d,italics added.further,the language of these ina policies is consistent with that limitation.giving damages the disparate meanings sought by ina would sever the connection between the duties to defend and indemnify and require the insurer to defend suits before administrative tribunals for which it had no duty to indemnify.we decline ina invitation to create this incongruity.
ina relies on powerine i to argue the existence of a no action clause in its policies requires that the indemnity provision be limited to provide indemnification only for money ordered by a court.the no action clauses in the three ina policies are substantively the same,and state,typically,that n o action shall lie against the insurer unless the insured obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured,the claimant and the insurer.ina argues that ameron has not contended,and can not contend,that an actual trial occurred in the ibca proceeding,and has not pled that any insurer consented to the settlement.ina argument lacks merit.
in powerine i,the supreme court,construing a cgl policy,stated that the reference to a judgment within the policy no action clause implie d that the duty to indemnify is limited to money ordered by a court.powerine i,supra,cal th at,fn,d,ace,supra,cal th at,d,powerine ii,cal th at,d.it is certainly true,for example,that an arbitrator issues an award not a judgment.code civ.applying powerine i implication here,however,would conflict with the insured reasonable expectations generated by the broad definition of suit in the ina policies to include a court action or administrative proceeding as we have discussed,ante.such a conflict must be resolved in favor of the insured.cdm,supra,th at,d.further,the ina no action clauses also provide for recovery against the insurer for certain settlements,and do not suggest that such settlements must follow the filing of a lawsuit.see powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d,sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay through compromise do not necessarily reflect an underlying court suit.thus,these no action clauses do not trump the broad interpretation we have given to the insurer duties in these policies 
we next address whether the ibca proceeding is a civil proceeding,within the ambit of the policies coverage and conclude that it is.like an arbitration,ibca proceedings involve the hearing and determination of a controversy,and like an arbitration,the administrative law judge or board member presiding over an ibca proceeding issues a final decision and may award damages,monetary compensation,to the aggrieved party to the contract.thus,an insured could reasonably expect that the ibca proceeding at issue here was a covered suit under the policies defense provision,and damages awarded in such a proceeding would be reimbursed under the policies indemnity provision.because ameron has adequately pled that ina owed it a duty of coverage under ina policies,the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer in favor of ina on the causes of action for breach of contract based on the duty to defend,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing based on ina failure to defend,indemnify,settle and investigate,and for contribution causes of action.
ii.causes of action against international 
international issued ameron five successive first layer commercial policies between april,and august.the three policies issued for the period august,to august,policy,follow form to the underlying ina policies issued for that period,and,as we discuss,provide coverage to ameron,requiring us to reverse the trial court rulings as to the causes of action against international 
the coverage section of these international policies provides 
coverage a we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages arising out of an occurrence which are in excess of the underlying ina insurance the coverage provisions of the scheduled underlying ina policies are incorporated as part of this policy except for c any duty to investigate or defend any claim,or to pay for any investigation or defense,d the limits of insurance or e any other provision that is not consistent with a provision in this policy.
coverage b with respect to any loss covered by the terms and conditions of this policy,but not covered as warranted by the underlying ina policies,or any other underlying insurance,we will pay on your behalf for loss caused by an occurrence which is in excess of the retained limit for liability imposed on you by law or assumed by you under contract for property damage loss is not defined in the policies.
the defense settlement section of the international policies is identical to the parallel provision in the three ina policies discussed in part,ante 
for damages covered by this policy,but not covered by any other insurance or underlying insurance,we have these obligations a.we will defend any suit seeking damages covered by this policy but we may investigate,negotiate,and settle any claim or suit at our discretion.suit is defined in the definitions section as a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged.suit includes an arbitration proceeding alleging such damages to which you must submit or submit with our consent.damages is not defined in the policy.
a.the duty to defend 
international relies on powerine i and ace to fashion an argument similar to the one advanced by ina in part,ante.international notes the defense settlement provision is limited to damages covered by its policies and refers to the duty to defend any suit seeking damages.international argues that since damages is limited to money ordered by a court,the ibca administrative agency litigation is not a covered suit.however,for the same reasons we rejected ina argument,we conclude that the international policies definition of suit is not limited to an action filed in a court of law,but may include an administrative proceeding.and,as we discussed in part,since the international policies do not limit the definition of suit to an action filed in court,the term damages can not be limited to money ordered by a court.as with the ina policies,we construe the term damages in the international policies to mean money recovered by a party for loss or detriment suffered through the acts of another.neither that definition nor the terms of these international policies limit such damages to money ordered by a court.consequently,an insured could reasonably expect that the ibca proceeding was a covered suit under the international policies defense settlement provision,which may trigger international duty to defend.
b.the duty to indemnify 
the international policy 
ameron argues that since the underlying ina primary policy provides indemnity coverage for the ibca litigation,coverage a of the international policy applies,because it incorporates the indemnity coverage terms of the ina policy.the argument rests on a false premise.as we noted in part,ante,the coverage language of that ina policy provides that ina will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages and ina shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages suit and damages are not defined in that ina policy.as we discussed previously,no duty of defense or indemnity was owed to ameron under the ina policy.consequently,coverage a in the overlying international policy provides no indemnity coverage.
coverage b of the international policy provides that as to any loss covered by the policy,but not covered by the underlying ina policy,we will pay on your behalf for loss caused by an occurrence italics added.thus,coverage b provides umbrella coverage that serves as primary indemnity coverage for claims not covered by the underlying ina policy.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,at.this indemnity obligation is limited by the term loss.since loss is not defined in the policy,we look to its common usage.in the insurance context,loss is defined as t he amount of financial detriment caused by an insured person death or an insured property damage,for which the insurer becomes liable.black law,supra,at.this definition of loss is arguably broader than the common meaning of damages,and is not limited to money ordered by a court.moreover,as we discussed in part,ante,it would be inconsistent with the duty to defend,in general,and the international policy language,in particular,to interpret the policy to provide a defense in extrajudicial civil proceedings,but no indemnity for those same proceedings.construing the ambiguous term loss in the international policy language in favor of the insured,as we must,we conclude that the policy does not limit the insurer indemnity obligations to court actions.an insured could reasonably expect that the financial detriment suffered as a result of the ibca proceeding would be reimbursed under the international policy coverage b indemnity provision.having determined that this policy may impose both a duty to defend and to indemnify upon international,we conclude the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to causes of action for breach of the duty to investigate and defend,breach of the duty to settle,breach of the duty to indemnify,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief causes of action,and.
the international policies 
the coverage language of the international policies is identical to that of the international policy.
coverage a of the international policies incorporates the indemnity coverage of the underlying ina policies and provides indemnity coverage in excess of the underlying ina policies.as we noted in part,ante,the ina policies may provide a duty of indemnity for any damages awarded in the ibca proceeding.thus,the insured could reasonably expect that coverage a of the international policy would apply to provide excess indemnity coverage for such damages.this provides an additional basis for our conclusion that the trial court erred in sustaining international demurrer to causes of action for breach of the duty to investigate and defend,breach of the duty to settle,breach of the duty to indemnify,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief causes of action.
iii.causes of action against twin city 
twin city issued ameron three successive first layer liability policies for the period july,to july.each of the twin city policies overlies a truck primary policy 
the twin city umbrella policy provides under coverage the company will pay on behalf of the insured ultimate net loss in excess of the total applicable limit of underlying truck insurance or the amount of the retention when no underlying insurance applies,because of bodily injury,personal injury,property damage or advertising injury to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence.fn.boldface type omitted.u ltimate net loss is defined as all sums which the insured and his or her insurers shall become legally obligated to pay as damages,whether by final adjudication or settlement with the company written consent,after making proper deduction for all recoveries and salvage collectible.boldface type omitted.
under investigation,defense and settlement,the twin city policy provides with respect to bodily injury,personal injury,property damage or advertising injury covered under this policy whether or not the retention applies and for which no coverage is provided under any underlying insurance or for which the underlying limits of any underlying insurance policy have been exhausted solely by payments of damages because of occurrences during the period of this policy,the company will a defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account thereof but the company may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient b pay all expenses incurred by the company,all costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company boldface type omitted.
the definitions section of the twin city policy provides,suit includes an arbitration proceeding to which the insured is required to submit or to which the insured has submitted with the company consent.boldface type omitted.
in relevant part,the twin city policy contains a broad as underlying endorsement,which provides in the event the insured suffers a loss which is covered under the truck policies of underlying insurance as set out in the schedule attached to this policy,the excess of which would be payable under this policy except for terms and conditions of this policy which are not consistent with the underlying insurance,then notwithstanding anything contained in this policy to the contrary,this policy shall be amended to follow and be subject to the terms and conditions of such underlying truck insurance in respect of such paid loss.the foregoing shall not,however,apply to.any coverage given under the underlying truck insurance for limits less than the full limit of the said underlying policy as stated in the schedule hereto.
a broad as primary endorsement obligates the excess or umbrella insurer to pay for any loss within the scope of the primary policy,despite applicable exclusions in the excess or umbrella policy.housing group california ins.guarantee th,d cornblum,cal.ins.law dict.and desk reference west group.thus,we interpret the twin city broad as primary endorsement to mean that if the insured loss is covered under the truck primary policy but not under the twin city policy,the twin city policy will be amended to follow form to and incorporate the terms of the truck policy which cover the loss.
the truck primary policy is not appended to the complaint.in an action based on a written insurance contract,a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract,rather than its precise language,by alleging the substance of its relevant terms.construction protective services,tig specialty ins.company cal th,d,cps witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.however,here,the complaint does not contain an allegation as to whether or not the truck primary policy provided ameron indemnity defense coverage for the ibca litigation.however,the twin city policy language provides indemnity and defense coverage to ameron whether or not the truck policy provides coverage.thus,as both parties have agreed,we may properly define the scope of the twin city policy coverage,though we lack information about the scope of the truck policy coverage.
though the insuring agreement in this policy is not identical to the ina policies discussed in part,ante,the analysis adopted in part is instructive.like those ina policies,this twin city policy requires the insurer to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages and provides that suit includes an arbitration proceeding.thus,like ina,twin city has agreed to defend an arbitration proceeding seeking damages,which requires a broader definition of damages than simply money ordered by a court.further,twin city has undertaken a duty to indemnify for ultimate net loss and defined that term as all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages,whether by final adjudication or settlement.as we explained in our discussion in part,we apply the same broad definition of damages to the duty to indemnify as to the duty to defend.and,as a consequence,we conclude this twin city policy may provide coverage to ameron for both duties.therefore,the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer in favor of twin city on the causes of action for breach of the duty to investigate and defend,breach of the duty to settle,breach of the duty to indemnify,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief causes of action.
iv.causes of action against transcontinental 
the complaint alleges that the april,to april,transcontinental policy is a first layer policy over an underlying truck primary policy.the complaint alleges the following as to the transcontinental policy no.umb under coverage a,excess liability over underlying truck insurance,the policy provides that transcontinental will pay on your behalf loss in excess of the total applicable limits of liability of the underlying truck insurance stated in the schedule.the provisions of the immediate underlying truck insurance are,with respect to coverage a,incorporated as part of this policy except for the duty to investigate and defend or to pay any costs resulting from such activities under coverage b,excess liability over retained limit,the policy states in part w ith respect to loss which is not covered in whole or in part by underlying truck insurance,but which arises out of an occurrence covered by this policy,we will pay on your behalf for loss which is in excess of the greater of either your retained limit or the underlying limit of liability and which you may become obligated to pay as damages as a result of liability imposed upon you by law or assumed by you under a contract because of personal injury,property damage,or advertising injury caused by an occurrence.the term loss is defined as sums which you are legally obligated to pay as damages.
the complaint does not contain an allegation as to whether or not the truck primary policy provided ameron indemnity defense coverage for the ibca litigation.instead,it alleges,under coverage a and b of the transcontinental policy it must be determined whether there is coverage or not under the underlying truck policy.assuming,arguendo,there is no coverage under the truck policy,then transcontinental must pay for the settlement with the government,since the settlement represents a loss.the transcontinental policy arguably provides under coverage b broader coverage than the truck policy.
ameron concedes that the complaint does not specifically allege the terms of the truck policy for the period,but argues that the truck policies remained the same in all applicable provided a duty to defend a suit,but did not define the term suit.however,on appeal from the sustaining of a demurrer,we review the adequacy of allegations of ameron complaint,not assertions in its appellate briefs.
from the terms of the transcontinental policy alleged in the complaint,it appears that the term loss in coverage b is defined,while that same term in coverage a is not.if this is correct,the extent of transcontinental duty to indemnify may depend upon whether the excess or umbrella provisions apply.however,the complaint allegations do not sufficiently plead the legal effect of the truck policy to make this determination.thus,an opinion as to transcontinental coverage duties would be an impermissible advisory opinion.see younger superior court cal d.
because it can not be determined whether transcontinental policy provides coverage for the ibca litigation,we conclude the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer in favor of transcontinental on the causes of action for breach of the duty to settle,breach of the duty to indemnify,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief causes of action,but erred by denying ameron leave to amend to properly plead the transcontinental policy or the underlying truck policy.
causes of action against icsop 
icsop issued ameron five successive policies between august,and december.
icsop policy 
the august,to august,icsop excess policy is a second layer excess policy that follows form to the underlying international first layer policy.the central insuring provision of the icsop policy provides as respects accidents or occurrences,whichever is applicable,icsop agrees to afford the insured such additional insurance as the issuers of the underlying coverage international would afford the insured by increasing the underlying limit combined provided that it is expressly agreed that liability shall attach to icsop a only after the issuers of the underlying coverage have paid or have been held liable to pay the full amount of the said underlying limit,and b only as respects such additional amounts in excess thereof as would be payable by the issuers of the underlying coverage if the said underlying limit were amended as aforesaid,and c in no greater amount than the limit s set forth under the declarations ultimate net loss as respects each accident or occurrence,which is applicable,taking place during the period of this to the limit s set forth under the declarations ultimate net loss in the aggregate where applicable for each annual period during the currency of this policy.
the central insuring language of the incorporated underlying international policy states,coverage we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages arising out of an occurrence which are in excess of the ina underlying insurance the coverage provisions of the scheduled underlying policies are incorporated as a part of this policy except for c any duty to investigate or defend any claim,or to pay for any investigation or defense coverage with respect to any loss covered by the terms and conditions of this policy,but not covered as warranted by the underlying policies listed on schedule a,or any other underlying insurance,we will pay on your behalf for loss caused by an occurrence which is in excess of the retained limit for liability imposed on you by law the defense settlement section provides we will defend any suit seeking damages covered by this policy but we may investigate,negotiate,and settle any claim or suit at our discretion.suit is defined as a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged.suit includes an arbitration proceeding alleging such damages to which you must submit or submit with our consent.
the limits of insurance of the incorporated underlying international policy states,b.we will pay only that amount of the net final loss that is in excess of the greater of the total applicable limits of the underlying policies listed in schedule a hereof,and any other collectible insurance net final loss is defined as the total of all sums that the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages.this legal obligation may be the decision of a court or the result of a settlement plus all expenses not covered by underlying insurance incurred by or for the insured to investigate,negotiate,settle or defend any claim or suit seeking damages covered by this policy 
the defense settlement provision in the icsop policy is identical to that provision in the international policies discussed in part,ante.as we concluded in part,a reasonable insured would expect that the ibca proceeding was a covered suit under the defense settlement provision,which may trigger icsop duty to defend.
as we discussed in part,coverage a of the international policy incorporates the indemnity coverage of the underlying ina policy and provides indemnity coverage in excess of the underlying ina policy.in that discussion,we concluded that the ina policy may provide a duty of indemnity for any damages awarded in the ibca proceeding,and the insured could reasonably expect that coverage a of the international policy may provide excess indemnity coverage for such damages.because the icsop policy follows form to the underlying international policy,a reasonable insured would expect that this icsop policy provides the same coverage,with higher limits.we conclude,therefore,the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to causes of action for breach of the duty to investigate and defend,breach of the duty to settle,breach of the duty to indemnify,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief causes of action.
icsop policy 
the insuring agreement of the august,to august,icsop umbrella policy provides coverage.the company hereby agrees to indemnify the insured for all sums which the insured shall be legally obligated to pay by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law for damages,direct or consequential,and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence supplemental defense it is agreed that with respect to any occurrence covered only by the terms and conditions of this policy except for the amount of the retention icsop shall defend any suit against the insured alleging liability insured under the provisions of this policy and seeking damages on account thereof,even if such suit is groundless,false or fraudulent but icsop shall have the right to make such investigation,negotiation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient 
the limit of liability section provides icsop shall be liable only for that portion of the ultimate net loss,excess of the insured retained limit defined as t he total of the applicable limits of the underlying policies listed on the schedule of underlying insurance hereof and the applicable limits of any other underlying insurance providing coverage to the insured 
the policy defines ultimate net loss as the amount payable in settlement of the liability of the insured after making deductions for all recoveries for other valid and collectible insurances,excepting however the policy ies of the primary insurer s,and shall exclude all costs,which are paid by icsop in addition to the ultimate net loss.costs is defined as interest accruing after entry of judgment,investigation,adjustment and legal expenses excluding,however,all office expenses of the insured,all expenses for salaried employees of the insured,and general retainer fees for counsel normally paid by the insured.claim and suit are not defined in the policy.
the defense obligation contained within the insuring agreement of this icsop policy is substantively the same as the policy language interpreted by the supreme court in,essentially providing for a duty to defend a suit seeking damages,where suit and damages are not defined within the policy.since suit and claim are not defined within the icsop policy,suit in the policies means a civil action commenced by filing a complaint,and a nything short of this is a claim,supra,cal th at,d.consequently,the trial court correctly ruled that ameron was not entitled to defense coverage under the icsop policy.
icsop concedes that the indemnity language in the insuring agreement in this policy is identical to that in powerine ii.however,it argues that the definition of ultimate net loss contained in the icsop policy differs from that in powerine ii icsop asserts that while the ultimate net loss definition in powerine ii was construed to broaden the insurer indemnity obligation,the ultimate net loss definition in the icsop policy narrows that obligation and compels affirmance of the trial court conclusion that icsop owes no duty to indemnify ameron for the ibca settlement.we disagree.
powerine ii first concluded that,the addition of the term expenses in the central insuring clause extends indemnity coverage beyond the limitation imposed were the term damages used alone,and thereby enlarges the scope of coverage beyond money ordered by a court.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.since the central insuring clause of the icsop policy is identical to that in powerine ii,the term expenses in that clause enlarges the scope of coverage beyond money ordered by a court.
powerine ii also concluded that the definition of ultimate net loss in the policies before it,which included sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay through compromise or the settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims,did not necessarily reflect an underlying court suit.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the court determined that under a literal reading of the policies before it,the indemnification obligation extended beyond money damages to include expenses incurred responding to government agency environmental cleanup costs.id.at,d.like powerine ii,the definition of ultimate net loss in the icsop policy includes amounts payable in settlement of the insured legal liability,and therefore does not necessarily reflect an underlying court suit.
however,unlike the policies in powerine ii,the definition of ultimate net loss in the icsop policies excludes costs paid by icsop,and costs is defined to include legal expenses.icsop construes these policy terms to mean that costs are not included within the policy indemnity obligation,and any expenses related to a claim icsop pays,are within its discretionary right to settle a claim.again,we disagree.we interpret the definitions of ultimate net loss and costs to mean that legal expenses paid by the company are excluded from ultimate net loss,but legal expenses paid by the insured are included within ultimate net loss.thus,nothing in the definition of ultimate net loss narrows the scope of indemnity coverage so as to preclude coverage for ameron ibca settlement or for the expenses it incurred.our interpretation of this icsop policy provides an additional reason to conclude the trial court erred in sustaining icsop demurrer to causes of action,and.
icsop policies,
given our determination the trial court erred in sustaining icsop demurrer,it is not strictly necessary to our resolution of ameron appeal of the trial court ruling in favor of icsop to examine the icsop policies.but we do so for the benefit of the parties and the trial court each of these icsop policies contains an insuring agreement which provides coverage.to pay on behalf of the insured that portion of the ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit as hereinafter defined,which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages to third parties for liability imposed upon the insured by law the insuring agreement also contains the following defense,settlement and supplementary payments provisions should applicable underlying insurance s become exhausted by payment of covered claims,this insurance will continue in force as underlying insurance and shall defend any suit arising out of a covered occurrence as respects occurrences not covered under the underlying insurance s,but covered by this policy,icsop shall likewise defend any suit and will make indemnity payments,including the insured retained limit in addition,icsop shall have the right to investigate,negotiate and settle any claim or suit as it may deem expedient suit and claim are not defined in the policy.
the limit of liability section provides a icsop shall be liable only for that portion of the ultimate net loss,excess of the insured retained limit defined as the total of the applicable limits of the underlying policies listed on the schedule of underlying insurance hereof and the applicable limits of any other underlying insurance providing coverage to the insured 
ultimate net loss is defined as the amount payable in settlement of the liability of the insured after making deductions for all recoveries for other valid and collectible insurances,excepting however the policy ies of the primary insurer s,and shall exclude all costs,which are paid by icsop in addition to ultimate net loss.costs is defined as any expenses incurred for the adjustment of the claim including,but not limited to,defense expenses,investigation expenses,and all expenses described in the defense,settlement and supplementary payments section.
ameron contends that the icsop policies provide the company will indemnify for ultimate net loss,and define ultimate net loss to include payment for settlement and expenses.therefore,ameron argues the icsop policies are similar to the policies at issue in powerine ii,in that indemnity coverage is not restricted to an action filed in court.thus,ameron argues these policies cover the ibca settlement at issue here.
we conclude,however,the indemnity language contained within the icsop policies central insuring clause is substantially the same as that construed in cdm,supra,th,d.the term damages in the insuring clause is the trigger of icsop indemnity obligation,not the phrase ultimate net loss,which appears only in the limits of liability section.therefore,the trial court correctly ruled that ameron was not entitled to indemnity coverage under the icsop policies.
in addition,the defense obligation contained within the insuring clause of the icsop policies is substantively the same as the policy language interpreted by the supreme court in.thus,where as here,suit and claim are not defined within the policy,suit in the policies means a civil action commenced by filing a complaint,and a nything short of this is a claim,supra,cal th at,d.consequently,the trial court correctly ruled that ameron could not reasonably expect defense coverage under the icsop policies,since the ibca litigation is not a suit filed in court.
vi.causes of action against paul 
paul issued ameron second layer excess liability policies for the period july,to july,and august,to august,which overlie international first layer policies for the same period we conclude that the policy no.may provide indemnity coverage to ameron,and the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend to ameron causes of action for breach of the duty to settle,breach of the duty to indemnify,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief causes of action.
the insuring agreement of the paul policy provides coverage to indemnify the insured,in accordance with the applicable provisions of the immediate underlying international policy for the amount of loss which is in excess of the applicable limits of the underlying international insurance the provisions of the immediate underlying international policy are incorporated as part of this policy except for any obligation to investigate or defend and pay for costs and expenses incident to the same,the amount of the limits of liability,any other insurance provision and any other provisions therein which are inconsistent with the provisions of this policy.
the paul policy defines claim as a demand in which damages are alleged,and defines suit as a civil proceeding in which damages are alleged,including but not limited to an arbitration proceeding for such damages to which the insured must submit or submit with paul consent.in an amendatory endorsement to the policy,loss is defined as,the sums paid as damages in settlement of a claim or in satisfaction of a judgment for which the insured is legally liable,after making deductions for all recoveries,salvages and other insurances whether recoverable or not other than the underlying insurance and excess insurance purchased specifically to be in excess of this policy.loss also includes investigation,adjustment,defense or appeal costs and expenses incident to any of the foregoing.damages is not defined in the policy.
in part,ante,we concluded the coverage a indemnity provision in the international policy does not apply in this case,but the policy coverage b indemnity provision does apply,because it provides umbrella coverage for the underlying ina policy and does not limit the insurer indemnity obligations to damages but to loss.since the term loss does not require a court action,the insured could reasonably expect that any damages awarded in the ibca proceeding would be reimbursed under the international policy 
paul relies on its policy action against company condition which provides no action shall lie against paul unless,as a condition precedent thereto,the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this policy.any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured a judgment against the insured shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy.nothing contained in this policy shall give any person or organization any right to join paul as a in any action against the insured to determine the insured liability 
in reliance on hamilton maryland casualty cal th,d,paul then asserts that indemnity pa
