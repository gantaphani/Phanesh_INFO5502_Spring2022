ari and flora bialo appeal from the summary judgment dismissing their insurance case against western mutual insurance company,their homeowner insurer during the northridge earthquake.the case arose from northridge earthquake damage to the bialos home.western obtained summary judgment solely on statute of limitations grounds.specifically,the case involves the applicability of newlyenacted code of civil procedure section stats,which extends the limitations period for some cases.all further undesignated section references are to the code of civil procedure.
the bialos timely submitted a claim for earthquake damage,which western paid.later,the bialos found additional damage.the bialos eventually filed a second claim with western,but not within the reporting period required by their policy.when western rejected the second claim,the bialos brought this case.the bialos filed their case,the summary judgment was issued,and the bialos timely appealed,all before january,section effective date.
section states a notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of the effective date of this section.this subdivision shall only apply to cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurer representative prior to january,regarding potential northridge earthquake damage.
b any action pursuant to this section commenced prior to,or within one year from,the effective date of this section shall not be barred based upon this limitations period.
c nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the applicable limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of the effective date of this section.
d this section shall not apply to either of the following any claim that has been litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to the effective date of this section.any written compromised settlement agreement which has been made between an insurer and its insured where the insured was represented by counsel admitted to the practice of law in california at the time of the settlement,and who signed the agreement.emphasis added.
on appeal,the bialos contend section revives their case by extending the limitations period,because they contacted western about their second claim before january,commenced their case before section s january,effective date,and their case was dismissed solely on limitations grounds.thus,the bialos argue their case expressly satisfies all section requirements.
western responds i section does not alter the requirement that insureds timely report their northridge earthquake damage claims to the insurer within the claim notice period required by the policy.according to western,section does not extend the limitations period for a case in which the insured did not report the damage claim to his insurer within the period required under the policy.essentially,western argues section applies only to cases dismissed on limitations grounds where the limitations bar is based on the untimely filing of the lawsuit,not,as here,on untimely notice of the loss to the insurer.western argues that,if so narrowly construed,section would not unconstitutionally impair contracts.however,western concludes that,if construed to revive cases like the bialos,section would violate the constitutional bar against impairing contractual relationships.
western also claims ii the bialos case was litigated to finality in the trial court before section effective date despite their timely appeal.thus,western concludes section,subdivision d prevents subdivision a from reviving the bialos lawsuit.
not surprisingly,since it had not yet taken effect,neither party litigated the effect of section in the trial court,which obviously did not rule on its applicability.although the issue was not litigated below,no one,including the amici curiae which we permitted to file briefs,objects to our considering and deciding section applicability to this case.normally,we ignore arguments,authority,and facts not presented and litigated in the trial court.generally,issues raised for the first time on appeal which were not litigated in the trial court are waived.doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,fn,see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.however,where,as here,the issue is purely legal and presented to us on undisputed facts,and involves a matter of public interest,we retain discretion to decide it.medical center superior court cal th,d.our considering the issue is particularly appropriate here,because if the bialos are correct,section resurrects their case.thus,we consider this issue,litigated by the parties on appeal.
we permitted the national association of independent insurers and the personal insurance federation of california to file an amicus brief supporting western.we also grant their request to judicially notice section legislative history.in addition to supporting western,the amici raised two new issues not advanced by the parties.first,they claim section is unconstitutional because it violates due process.second,they claim section at most could revive contract,not tort,claims.we also permitted the consumer attorneys of california,united policyholders,the consumer federation of california,the congress of california seniors,the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights,and the california public interest research group to file an amicus brief supporting the bialos.the amici responded to all the arguments raised in the amicus brief.however,we decline to address these new issues raised only by the amicus briefs.costa workers comp.appeals bd.th,d appropriate to decline to consider constitutional challenges to a statute raised only by amicus briefs witkin,cal.procedure,supra.
after briefing was completed,two cases were published,both now final,which resolve most of the issues raised here.in hellinger farmers group,th,d and century ins.superior court th,d,divisions four and three of our district upheld section,rejecting impairment of contract and due process challenges.the cases held the section applies to contractual limitations periods created in insurance policies,and cases pending on appeal on the section effective date.
we conclude i section applies to cases where the otherwise applicable limitations bar is based on either untimely notice to the insurer or untimely filing of the lawsuit,and as so construed does not unconstitutionally impair contracts.we also conclude ii the bialos case will not be litigated to finality until their timely appeal is final.
thus,section revived the bialos lawsuit.we reverse the summary judgment dismissing the case.
the bialos policy required that in the event of a covered loss,they give immediate notice to western or its agent,and submit to western,within days after the loss,their signed,sworn statement of loss.the policy also stated no action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions and the action is started within one year after inception of the loss.
in their separate statements,the parties agreed on the following facts.on january,the bialos home was damaged by the northridge earthquake.a claim was made for known earthquake damage with western.the original claim was paid to the satisfaction of the bialos after consultation with contractors of their choice.after the payment,the bialos became aware of other damages.specifically,the major thing is upstairs bedroom structurally it seems,to be wobbly.these other damages were discovered about to years after the earthquake,or by.the first time the other damages were brought to the attention of western was in a september,letter.the policy provides that a claim must be made within one year after the inception of the loss.
in their separate statement of undisputed facts,the bialos stated.in,the bialos were paid by western mutual the sum of and the claim file was closed by the insurer.at the time payment was made in by western to the bialos,they were of the opinion that the claim had been fully paid.neither ari bialo nor flora bialo are or ever have been engineers or construction professionals.after the receipt of payment in,the bialos were of the opinion that their claim was closed and could not be if additional earthquake damage was believed to have occurred.in or about july,the bialos learned for the first time that they could ask the insurance company to their claim and through legal counsel,asked that western mutual do so.in august,the bialos obtained a repair estimate from jack tracy construction in the sum of approximately.a sworn statement in proof of loss was submitted to western in or about may 
the bialos filed their complaint on september.the complaint alleged causes of action for breach of insurance contract,tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief.
western sought summary judgment,arguing the case was barred by insurance code section limitations period.western argued the bialos failure to timely report the newly discovered losses to western within the period required by their policy barred their case.the bialos opposed the motion on two grounds.first,they claimed their earlier reporting of some losses should toll the limitations period for at least some of their losses.second,they argued the limitations period was tolled because western had not yet formally rejected the later claim.
the parties agreed that retired judge robert london would decide the motion.the motion was argued in may.after the argument,judge london issued an order.the court tentative ruling is to grant the motion for summary judgment on behalf of western.before a final ruling is made,the bialos will be permitted to submit written argument regarding whether the august,estimate prepared by jack tracy construction company evidences any division of damages between those that were discovered by and those that might have been discovered thereafter.
after considering the submitted additional argument and western opposition,judge london granted the motion,stating a the bialos home which was insured by western suffered damages caused by the january,northridge earthquake.a claim was made,adjusted and paid in june.b on september,the bialos made a supplemental claim.c western agreed to investigate the claim without waiving its right to argue that the claim was barred by the suit limitation contained in the policy of insurance.d a proof of loss claim was made on may.e the proof of loss claim was rejected by western on august.the bialos essentially argue that claims of damage can be divisible that the damages discovered by the bialos in are,whereas damages discovered thereafter are not so.such claims are not divisible.these damages should have been discovered and the motion is granted.
based on judge london ruling,the trial court entered judgment for western on november.the bialos timely appealed on november.
on appeal,the bialos do not challenge the trial court rulings on the issues litigated in the trial court.as noted,their only appellate contention is that section revives their case.
discussion 
standard of review 
as noted,the case was dismissed on summary judgment on limitations grounds,although the parties did not litigate the applicability of section.we nonetheless decided to review this purely legal issue on this undisputed factual record.on appeal from a summary judgment,we independently examine the facts and determine their effect as a matter of law.pmc,saban entertainment,th,d.we review the ruling,not the rationale.jacoves united merchandising th,d stratton first nat.life ins.d.
the interpretation of a statute is a question of law california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.interpretation and applicability of a statute or ordinance is clearly a question of law.citation.it is the duty of an appellate court to make the final determination from the undisputed facts and the applicable principles of law.citation.sutco construction modesto high school dist.d.thus,we interpret the challenged statute de novo as a matter of law.
statutory interpretation involves a analysis.first,a court should examine the actual language of the statute.citations.judges,lawyers and laypeople all have far readier access to the actual laws enacted by the legislature than the various and sometimes fragmentary documents shedding light on legislative intent.more significantly,it is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.it is that language which has been lobbied for,lobbied against,studied,proposed,drafted,restudied,redrafted,voted on in committee,amended,reamended,analyzed,reanalyzed,voted on by two houses of the legislature,sent to a conference committee,and,after perhaps more lobbying,debate and analysis,finally signed into law by the governor.the same care and scrutiny does not befall the committee reports,caucus analyses,authors statements,legislative counsel digests and other documents which make up a statute legislative history.in examining the language,the courts should give to the words of the statute their ordinary,everyday meaning citations unless,of course,the statute itself specifically defines those words to give them a special meaning citations.if the meaning is without ambiguity,doubt,or uncertainty,then the language controls.citations.
but if the meaning of the words is not clear,courts must take the second step and refer to the legislative history.citations.the final one which we believe should only be taken when the first two steps have failed to reveal clear to apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.if possible,the words should be interpreted to make them workable and reasonable citations.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.we apply these undisputed rules to the facts and statute before us.

the bialos contend section revives their case by extending the otherwise applicable limitations period.the bialos argue their case meets all section requirements.western responds that section altered only the limitations period applicable to the filing of a lawsuit,and did not change the limitations period applicable to notifying one insurer of a potential claim under the policy.these competing claims require us to construe section.
we note western frames the issue as the bialos failure to comply with an alleged policy requirement that they notify western of the additional damage within a year of its discovery.as indicated,the bialos policy requires that they notify western of a covered loss immediately,file a statement of loss within days of the loss,and start any action within a year of loss inception.if the second earthquake damage is related to the damage reported in,the bialos arguably complied with the policy notice,but not its suit initiation,limitations period.if the earthquake damage was a new covered loss,the bialos failed to comply with either the notification or suit filing policy periods.in either case,the limitations bar is created by the policy.
we begin by repeating section,subdivision a relevant express language notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of january.this subdivision shall only apply to cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurer representative prior to janua
