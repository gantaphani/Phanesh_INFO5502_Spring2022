the plaintiff and appellant,thelma rosenblum,asks us to reverse a summary judgment entered on her amended complaint in favor of the defendant and respondent,safeco insurance company safeco.after negotiating a settlement of her claim and executing a full release upon the payment of the agreed amount by safeco,rosenblum filed this action alleging that she had entered into the settlement under duress and due to the fraudulent misrepresentations of safeco.she further alleged that,in spite of such negotiated settlement,her claim had been revived by the passage of code of civil procedure,section section 
the trial court granted safeco motion for summary judgment on the grounds that rosenblum had not presented evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact on her claims of duress and fraud and section was a revivor statute that served only to overcome any time limitations defense safeco might have had,but it did not operate to revive a claim that had been extinguished by a validly executed release.because we agree with the trial court reasoning and conclusion,we will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on january,a certain residential rental property a triplex located at aloha and tracy in los angeles owned by rosenblum was damaged in the northridge earthquake.on march,rosenblum submitted a claim to safeco,which had issued her a property insurance policy covering the period july,to july.
safeco assigned the claim to an adjuster,who inspected rosenblum property and found damage to the foundation.safeco retained three different engineers,who inspected the damage and prepared a report covering repair guidelines for not only the foundation,but also the floor framing,exterior stucco and interior plaster of the triplex.on november,rosenblum was paid for loss of use.
on november,safeco adjustor calculated the cost of completing the earthquake related repairs at for dwelling repairs and for other structures.rosenblum own contractor was then contacted to see if an agreement could be reached on the scope of repairs and the total cost thereof.
on december,safeco wrote a letter to rosenblum that stated with the one year anniversary of the january,northridge earthquake approaching,we want to point out a policy provision contained in general conditions which reads as follows.suit against us.no action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions and the action is started within one year after the loss or damage.the one year time limitation begins after safeco has completed the adjustment of your claim.your claim is completed when we determine the repair replacement cost of your loss and an actual cash value payment is made.we will send you a letter when we believe we have concluded your claim.italics added.
on january,safeco calculated the amount due rosenblum as follows for dwelling repairs,less in recoverable depreciation and a deductible,for a net amount payable of.for other structures,from which in depreciation and a deductible were taken,for a net amount payable of.these net amounts were paid on january.
on february,rosenblum own contractor confirmed in writing his agreement with safeco repair cost estimate and that it had identified all known and visible damage.he further agreed that the estimated cost was an amount sufficient to complete all listed repairs.on february,safeco paid rosenblum an additional for loss of use.
on april,safeco wrote another letter to rosenblum regarding relevant time limitations applicable to the enforcement of her claim.it stated now that we have reached an agreement on your claim,it is important that you be reminded of a policy condition that affects your rights under the policy contract.this condition is the suit against us clause contained in your policy.section conditions.suit against us.no action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions and the action is started within one year after the loss or damage.should your contractor discover hidden damage not part of this agreed cost of repair,please notify safeco prior to making these repairs to give us the opportunity to inspect the additional damage.safeco believes you have year from february,left under the suit against us clause.thank you for your cooperation in bringing this matter to a conclusion.italics added.
after monitoring repairs made by rosenblum,safeco,on may,paid her in recoverable depreciation.after rosenblum contacted safeco regarding repair of the foundation,safeco wrote to her on january,stating that,t here is no time limit on recovery of the withheld depreciation for the foundation repairs.however,you should be reminded of a policy condition that affects your rights under the policy contract.this is the suit against us clause contained in your policy.this clause was explained to you in a letter from bob garner dated april.i am enclosing a copy of this letter for your information.the limitation expires on february.this would affect any hidden or supplemental damage found after.italics added.
in july,rosenblum contacted safeco and requested payment of the amount withheld for depreciation for repair of the foundation,for repairs to the plumbing,and paid by rosenblum to her tenants for repairs they had made.substantially all of these expenses had been incurred by rosenblum prior to the february,date set out in the safeco letter quoted above safeco responded with a letter dated july,enclosing a proof of loss form for completion and submission by rosenblum 
on july,rosenblum contacted safeco by telephone and complained that it was taking too long to complete the adjustment of her claim.she stated that she did not want to hire an attorney,but demanded that she be reimbursed for all of the disputed expenses.approximately days later,on august,safeco paid her the that had been withheld for depreciation on foundation repair.
following this payment,safeco and rosenblum entered into negotiations regarding the remaining two items of dispute,costs for plumbing and tenant repairs,an amount that totaled.rosenblum initially agreed to settle for,but later changed her mind and demanded.safeco agreed to pay this sum for a full and complete release.the record does not reflect that safeco at any time raised any time limitations objections to rosenblum demands.on august,safeco sent rosenblum a settlement agreement and release.in its cover letter,safeco stated,dear rosenblum this settlement agreement and release is a legal document.it is safeco understanding that you are not represented by an attorney to assist you in understanding the effect of signing a release.the legal effect of signing a release will conclude this claim with final resolution.even if you discover additional issues or new disputes,you will be giving up all rights to make further claims under this particular claim identified as safeco claim.this letter will confirm we have reached an agreement to resolve all disputes between us under the terms outlined in the settlement agreement and release.both parties have reached this agreement by voluntary settlement discussions.italics added.
rosenblum countersigned this letter acknowledging her agreement on august.at the same time she signed and returned the settlement agreement and release safeco paid rosenblum by a check dated august.
on december,over five years after she had settled her claim with safeco rosenblum filed this action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and violation of business and professions code,section.after several law and motion proceedings,safeco filed a motion for summary judgment on april.a detailed summary of the factual showing on which it relied has been set forth above and it was and is safeco contention that rosenblum agreement to a negotiated settlement and release of her claim forecloses her action.safeco has raised no issue with respect to any time limitation defense.
rosenblum responded by arguing that since the settlement agreement and release had not been signed by an attorney admitted in california,it was not binding on her in light of the provisions of section and,in any event,she had been induced to sign that document due to the fraud and duress of safeco.the only evidence that she provided on this point,however,was her own declaration which stated.i am a plaintiff and am trustee of the sidney rosenblum marital trust.without admitting or acknowledging that i signed any release,in july of,i was informed by safeco that the statute of limitations on my claim was january,the year anniversary of the date of loss.the fact that safeco was advising me that my right to enforce performance under the insurance policy had been lost as of january,was very important and material relative to any decision or alleged commitment i made relative to the claim.conversely,safeco did not advise at that point in time that the statute of limitations contained within the insurance policy stopped running while the claim was ongoing.
on october,the trial court concluded that rosenblum had not presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to her claims of fraud and duress,and section had no impact on any defense an insurer might have to an insured claim,except one based on statutory or contractual time limitation since safeco was not relying on such a defense,section did assist rosenblum.the trial court also rejected rosenblum evidentiary objections to safeco factual showing.as already indicated,we find ourselves in agreement with the trial court.
contentions of the parties 
rosenblum argues that section operates to revive her claim since the settlement agreement and release is not valid because it was not signed by a california attorney as required by that statute.she also urges that she was induced to sign it by safeco misrepresentations to her about the viability of her claim thus forcing her to agree to a settlement that would not have otherwise been acceptable.finally,she claims that safeco evidentiary showing is based entirely on records contained in its files that were not properly authenticated as business records and therefore were inadmissible.
safeco disputes each of these arguments and contends that the trial court properly analyzed and ruled on the issues and that its judgment should be affirmed.
discussion 
standard of review 
in this appeal we are first required to construe and apply section.this presents a question of law and our standard of review is de novo.bialo western mutual ins.th,d.with respect to the remainder of rosenblum attack on the judgment,we apply settled principles of summary judgment review.
summary judgment is granted when no triable issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ.proc,subd.c villa mcferren th,d.after examining documents supporting a summary judgment motion in the trial court,this court independently determines their effect as a matter of law.hulett farmers ins.exchange th,d.the moving party bears the burden of establishing,by declarations and evidence,a complete defense to plaintiff action or the absence of an essential element of plaintiff case.westlye look sports,th,d code civ.proc,subd.f.the moving party must demonstrate that under no hypothesis is there a material factual issue requiring a trial.flowmaster,superior court th,d.
when the moving party makes that showing,the burden of proof shifts to the opposing party to show,by responsive separate statement and admissible evidence,that triable issue of fact exist.macelhenny,levy th,d code civ.proc,subd.n.an issue of fact becomes one of law and loses its triable character if the undisputed facts leave no room for a reasonable difference of opinion.preach monter rainbow th,d.
as the party moving for summary judgment,safeco bore an initial burden of production of a prima facie showing that there was no triable issue of material fact in this case and it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.only if safeco carried that burden would rosenblum be faced with a burden of production of her make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.no more is called for.id.at,d.f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof a defendant bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.code civ.proc,subd.o.id.at,d,italics and fns.omitted.
section serves only to eliminate certain time limitation defenses 
section,which became effective on january,revives,subject to certain conditions and limitations,insurance claims arising out of the northridge earthquake of that previously had been barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
rosenblum seeks to rely on section as a basis for relieving her of the burden of the august,settlement agreement and release that she entered into with safeco.specifically,she points to subdivision d of section.it states that the section will not apply to and thus would not revive a claim that had been resolved by a ny written compromised settlement agreement which has been made between an insurer and its insured where the insured was represented by counsel admitted to the practice of law in california at the time of the settlement,and who signed the agreement.simply put,it is rosenblum contention that since the settlement agreement and release with safeco was not signed by california counsel,then section applies to revive her claim and she is not barred by her release of the claim.this argument is not convincing.
what rosenblum overlooks is that section was enacted in order to revive claims that were barred solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired.italics added.as we explained in century,one of the reasons that section did not violate the constitutional proscription on impairment of contracts was that the application of section to settlement agreements entered into without california counsel does not substantially impair such contracts.the statute on its face does not declare the agreements null or void it simply revives time barred claims so that they can be further addressed.indeed,the statute reference to settlement agreements serves only to describe one of the circumstances where section will not apply.the ultimate viability of those settlement agreements is not impaired.century,supra,th at,d.
section did nothing more than reopen the filing window,for a period,to those otherwise viable cases that had become.it did not impact or affect any other defenses that an insurer might have to an insured claim.see hellinger farmers group,th,d bialo western mutual ins,supra,th at,d.indeed,to hold otherwise,as the foregoing authorities make clear,would risk subjecting section to the constitutional infirmity of contractual impairment.
here,safeco has never asserted a time limitation defense and it does not do so in this appeal.the motion for summary judgment was made and granted on the basis of the viability of a negotiated settlement and release of rosenblum claim.the defense of prior settlement and release is not affected by the operation of section.unless the settlement agreement and release was infected with fraud or duress,as rosenblum claims,it is valid and enforceable and is a complete defense to this action even though rosenblum did not have counsel and the written agreement was not signed by california counsel we now turn to that issue.
rosenblum presented no evidence of fraud or duress 
rosenblum argues in her brief that the settlement agreement and release on which safeco relies,and which the trial court enforced,was procured under false pretenses,including a misrepresentation to rosenblum that any legal rights that she had to pursue a breach of contract or bad faith action had expired on january,one year after the date of her loss.this representation,she claims,was contrary to law because it ignored the tolling period that runs during the period from claim filing to claim denial see com.insurance superior court cal d,as well as the effect of relevant regulations of the department of insurance regarding an insurer duty to provide accurate and timely notice to an insured claimant of any applicable time limitation see spray,gould bowers associated internat.ins.th,d.she also claims that she executed the settlement agreement and release under duress because safeco had threatened to cancel her policy and she was never advised as to the legal effect of her execution of that instrument.
rosenblum,however,offers no persuasive evidence to support such claims.the only evidence presented is her short page declaration in which she states that safeco informed her on some undisclosed date s that the statute of limitations on her claim was january,and such representation was very important and material relative to any decision or alleged commitment i made relative to the claim.she also stated that safeco did not advise her that such statute of limitations contained within the insurance policy stopped running while the claim was ongoing.that is it this is the sum total of her evidentiary response to safeco motion.
leaving aside the inadequacy of such showing,the record before us demonstrates that her statements are patently false.an examination of the several letters sent to rosenblum by safeco and described above in our factual summary demonstrates the truth of the matter.rosenblum makes no claim that she did not receive each of these communications.
in the letter dated december,safeco expressly advised rosenblum that the limitation would not begin until safeco has completed the adjustment of your claim.your claim is completed when we determine the repair replacement cost of your loss and an actual cash value payment is made.we will send you a letter when we believe we have concluded your claim.
by february,the cash value payments as opposed to the replacement cost payments to be made after completion of repairs due pursuant to the agreement between safeco and rosenblum contractor,had been made.thus,safeco wrote to rosenblum on april,reminding her again of the limitation and expressing safeco belief that such period commenced to run on february.the cash value payments in fact reflected an agreed resolution of all of rosenblum claims,except for the recoverable depreciation due under the replacement cost provisions of safeco policy and payable after rosenblum had caused the required repairs to be made and had paid for them.
with respect to such depreciation recovery,safeco wrote to rosenblum on january,and advised her that the time limitation did not apply to withheld depreciation.by that time,safeco had already paid to rosenblum depreciation for all repairs except for the foundation.by july,rosenblum complained that the process was taking too long and demanded payment for the foundation depreciation,plus plumbing repairs and repairs made by rosenblum tenants,both matters that had not previously been agreed to but which were costs for matters discovered and repaired prior to the february,deadline.on august,safeco paid the due for withheld depreciation on the foundation.safeco and rosenblum then negotiated with respect to the remaining.rosenblum initially agreed to accept,but later demanded.as already mentioned,safeco paid this amount on august,as part of the consideration for the settlement agreement and release of august.
rosenblum argues that she was not informed by safeco as to the effect of execution of that agreement.this argument is not supported by the record and,indeed,is directly contrary to it.rosenblum not only does not support this claim on her declaration,she does not even dispute that she received safeco cover letter of august,which stated,in relevant part this settlement agreement and release is a legal document.it is safeco understanding that you are not represented by an attorney to assist you in understanding the effect of signing a release.the legal effect of signing a release will conclude this claim with final resolution.even if you discover additional issues or new disputes,you will be giving up all rights to make further claims under this particular claim this letter will confirm we have reached an agreement to resolve all disputes between us under the terms outlined in the settlement agreement and release.both parties have reached this agreement by voluntary settlement discussions.italics added.
similarly,rosenblum argument regarding duress due to a threat of policy cancellation is without merit.the record reflects that safeco did not elect to renew her policy on july.thus,her policy had ended over one full year prior to her negotiation and execution of the settlement agreement and release.obviously,the termination of the policy was no longer a prospective matter in august of and a threat to cancel her policy could not have been the source of any duress to rosenblum.moreover,she said nothing about such claimed duress in her declaration.
from this review of the undisputed facts,it is clear that rosenblum negotiated a settlement and release of her claim with safeco and the matter was finally resolved by safeco full payment of the agreed amount.rosenblum is therefore bound,unless her evidentiary objection to safeco factual presentation has merit.we now briefly discuss that matter.
rosenblum objection to safeco evidentiary showing is without merit 
rosenblum attacks safeco evidentiary presentation in support of its motion for summary judgment on the ground that it constitutes inadmissible hearsay to which she asserted a timely objection.she contends that the declaration of alvena johnston a safeco claims analyst,which described and tendered the several documents,the settlement and release agreement documents,correspondence sent to rosenblum,on which safeco relied,were not properly authenticated and therefore were inadmissible.rosenblum contends that the johnston declaration does not comply with the requirements of evidence code,section 
in her declaration dated april,johnston stated,in part,that she was a claims analyst for safeco and,if called as a witness could competently testify as follows 
i am familiar with the manner and method used by the various safeco insurers in maintaining documents related to insurance claims.i have personally reviewed the file maintained on insured thelma rosenblum claim for benefits arising from the january,northridge earthquake designated as claim no.
the claim file for insured thelma rosenblum was maintained in the ordinary course of business.it is the business practice of all safeco insurers to place all significant correspondence,estimates,and other documents related to a particular claim in the claim file.documents are placed in the claim file at or about the time that the document is received or at the time a correspondence is mailed out.for example,a report or letter is placed in the claim file at or about the time it was received.a correspondence is copied and placed in the claim file at or about the time the correspondence was mailed or received.phone conversations are documented in file memos at or about the time of the call.
employees of all safeco insurers are under a business duty to record significant claim handling events by placing correspondence or reports concerning a claim in the claim file at or about the time the is received or sent and documenting important phone conversations in file memos.
rosenblum argues that these statements do not satisfy the provisions of evidence code,section in that they do not reflect that johnston had any personal knowledge of how safeco maintained documents and records in the period,nothing is said as to how long johnston had been employed by safeco and thus she can not competently testify as to the manner and mode of preparation of the various documents.we need not be long detained by this contention.
first,section requires only that a custodian or other qualified witness identify the documents.second,and
