background 
spangler worked as a lead assistant at lockheed martin government facility in oak ridge,tennessee.as an employee,spangler was eligible for and a participant in lockheed martin employee benefit plan,governed by erisa.lockheed martin is the plan sponsor,and met life is the plan administrator.
in october of,spangler began missing work because of spondylolisthesis when she was not able to return,spangler applied for and received disability benefits for six months.
during these six months,spangler sought treatment with michael mackay,an orthopedic surgeon who diagnosed her with spondylolisthesis.an office note from a january,visit states that spangler 
has not improved with physical therapy.she remains unable to return to work.she continues with significant back pain she wishes to proceed with conservative treatment and elected for a brace.we have discussed cage fusion of the lumbar spine which she will consider doing in february,if she does not respond to the brace.
a february office note states that spangler has just begun wearing her brace for the last few days and feels better with it on but has extreme pain when she removes it.she is neurologically intact.
spangler applied for ltd benefits in february of.in march and april of,met life wrote to mackay and others that spangler identified as her treating physicians and requested her medical records.on june,met life awarded spangler ltd benefits,finding spangler eligible as of april.in the award letter,met life explained that in order to maintain her disabled status,she would have to remain under a doctor care and keep met life informed of her condition to this end,a march office note in spangler file reports that spangler brace helped her mobility but that if spangler did not improve,surgical treatment and fusion techniques would be the next course of treatment.
on july,met life wrote spangler and encouraged her to apply for social security benefits.in the letter,met life instructed spangler to contact an area law firm,to whom met life had already given spangler name,to assist her in the application process.spangler contacted the law firm and applied for social security benefits.in october of,spangler was awarded social security benefits retroactive to april.the law firm representing spangler informed met life of the outcome of spangler social security case in october of.
meanwhile,on september,mackay performed a posterolateral fusion,inserted a brace and a spinal fusion stimulator.on november,mackay reported that spangler could be expected to return to work january.that did not happen,however,and spangler continued to provide met life with documents of her progress.
on february,bruce hunt,one of spangler treating physicians,filled out an attending physician statement,a form from met life.hunt said that spangler could sit for two hours,stand for one hour,walk for zero hours,could not do lifting of any kind,and could not work.
on march,mackay filled out an attending physician statement.he said that spangler could sit for four hours,stand for one hour,walk for one hour,lift up to pounds occasionally,but she could not work and was not expected to improve.a march,office visit note from mackay also reports that spangler is not improved and is not doing well.she is still dependent on a cane.her pain is purely lumbar at this point with minimal leg pains.there is still some tingling and she is still having problems with falling.
on april,mackay wrote to met life stating that spangler pain continued and she is quite disabled by it i do not think that there is any way that she can reasonably go back to work and she will be considered for permanent disability.on april,mackay again wrote to met life stating 
janice spangler is unable to return to work at the anticipated date of january,due to continued severe lower back pain.she is dependent on a walker and cane for ambulation.she has not improved with a spinal fusion.her spondylolisthesis has not progressed as far as i can tell on her.long term management as the pain continues may include a repeat imaging such as a myelogram ct,as well as possible repeat surgery.
a may,entry in met life diary review report states that both ap attending physician rice and mackay indicate that spangler has significant restrictions and will never return to work.the diary review notes that spangler was awarded social security disability benefits.the diary review also indicates that met life will send spangler for a functional capacity examination to identify what limits would prevent spangler from performing her own occupation.
on july,met life scheduled spangler for a whole body functional capacity examination.the functional capacity evaluation summary report,signed by susan ewing,a registered physical therapist for met life,and brian moore,an industrial medicine coordinator,concluded 
this patient demonstrates a functional capacity at the sedentary physical demand level,which does not meet the stated job demands for her previously held position.she scored positively on most psychometric indicators for symptom magnification and a focus on pain.both the examiner and physical therapist were limited in performing a complete evaluation or testing secondary to complaints of pain and inability to assume requested positions for testing.
the testing showed that spangler could sit for minutes,stand for seconds,walk x seconds with quad cane,and climb five steps with assist.the report ultimately found spangler disabled and stated data is available on file which substantiates the findings in this report.
in september,met life asked mackay and spangler primary care physician,mark rice,to provide updated office notes and tests and to complete a physical capacities evaluation,another form provided by met life.on september,mackay filled out the physical capacities evaluation form,which is less detailed than the attending physician statements that mackay had previously submitted to met life.on the form,mackay reported that spangler could sit for six hours,walk for two hours,and lift and carry up to ten pounds occasionally.the report to met life also included mackay office notes.the physical capacities evaluation,unlike the attending physician statement,does not ask whether the patient was capable of working but rather asks only for how long the patient could sit,stand,walk,lift,carry.as noted above,all previous and subsequent reports mackay provided to met life indicated that spangler was totally disabled and was not capable of working.
rice physical capacities evaluation is dated september.rice said that spangler could sit for four hours during an workday but that she could not stand,walk,or drive.notably,rice also wrote i consider this patient low back pain intractable.she also has osteoarthritis of hands.i do foresee return to work.
met life then decided to obtain a transferable skills analysis to determine whether spangler was capable of sedentary work.in doing so,met life forwarded only mackay september,physical capacities evaluation to crawford company healthcare management services crawford,a consulting company,and asked it to determine if spangler was capable of working.one of crawford vocational consultants,greta knaus determined that a person in spangler geographical location with her training and limitations set forth in mackay september,report could be employed in spangler prior job as well as several other comparable sedentary jobs.
on december,met life terminated spangler ltd benefits effective january.the denial letter states in relevant par
