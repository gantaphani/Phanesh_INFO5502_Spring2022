alex thomas company artco appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of artco insurer,respondent mutual service casualty insurance company msi.artco contends msi failed to establish that the sole or efficient proximate cause of artco loss was excluded under the msi policy artco could maintain its causes of action for bad faith and negligence in the absence of coverage and the court erred in refusing to continue the summary judgment proceeding under code of civil procedure section,subdivision h artco contentions are without merit,and we affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
artco is a commercial packer and shipper of pears.its packing facility includes three icehouses used for the cold storage of pears pending packing and shipping.in october,an ammonia leak occurred in an aluminum refrigeration coil in the south icehouse.artco sought compensation under the msi policy for the repair and replacement of the affected portion of its refrigeration system after artco proceeded to repair its refrigeration system,msi denied artco claim.
artco filed a complaint against msi and another of its insurers,pacific indemnity company pic in its first amended complaint,artco asserted causes of action for breach of contract,negligence,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.it also sought an award of punitive damages.
msi summary judgment motion 
msi filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication on each of artco causes of action and its punitive damages claim.msi evidence included the following.
the msi policy no.covered property damage caused by or resulting from a perils insured.in this policy,the perils insured were all risks of direct physical loss,except loss or damage specifically excluded or limited by the policy.the policy exclusions included the following exclusions.we will not pay for physical loss of or damage to property caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.contamination,corrosion,deterioration,fungus,pollution,or rust.italics added.
artco claim for coverage was handled by msi claim representative michael kasel kasel.kasel retained curt hamby hamby,of the independent adjusting company of mclarens toplis north america,to assist in the investigation of artco claim.kasel also retained exponent failure analysis associates exponent to investigate the cause of the ammonia leak.
meanwhile,artco refrigeration contractor and consultant,engineered mechanical systems,ems,investigated the cause of the leak.in november,ems determined there was pitting damage to aluminum coils through much of the middle and south icehouses.ems informed artco that its refrigeration system was susceptible to hazardous ammonia leaks and recommended that approximately percent of the system be replaced.
on december,exponent advised kasel that tests of artco refrigeration system had revealed excessive chlorides and iron in the refrigeration lines.it also advised kasel that artco had discovered pitting elsewhere in the system,and refrigeration cooling units would be replaced.
by letter to artco dated december,msi reserved its rights under the policy pending additional investigation.among other things,the letter recited the exclusion for physical loss of or damage to property caused directly or indirectly by c ontamination,corrosion,deterioration as a potential applicable exclusion.the letter also asserted that no actions by msi would constitute a waiver of its rights under the policy or give rise to an estoppel.
also on december,exponent advised hamby that o ptical and microscopic examination of the pitting,chemical analysis of the tube interior surfaces and metallurgical examination of the aluminum have revealed that the internal pitting may have resulted from impurities within the refrigeration system.exponent proposed additional work at a cost of to further determine the cause of the pitting.on january,hamby wrote kasel and recommended that msi not conduct this further investigation,unless there arose facts that would indicate a reasonable chance of subrogation from a cause of the loss.
in january,artco opted to replace the subject portion of the refrigeration system.
a letter dated february,from msi coverage counsel to exponent,confirmed exponent finding that chloride had caused the corrosion in artco system.exponent had indicated there would be no corrosion present without the chloride,detected no evidence of anything other than chloride corrosive pitting,and found the situation to be a textbook corrosion analysis.msi counsel requested that exponent provide a report giving a technical evaluation and the most likely causes of the condition.
exponent provided the report on march,concluding that the leak in the aluminum evaporator coil was the result of severe interior pitting occurring over a period of time,and the most likely cause of the pitting was corrosion.the report also noted that the source of the chloride impurity had not been ascertained.
on april,msi counsel sent a letter to artco denying coverage for the replacement of the subject portion of artco refrigeration system,on the ground that the loss resulted from corrosion and was thus excluded from coverage under the contamination,corrosion and deterioration exclusion.in denying coverage,msi purportedly relied on exponent report and the decision of a washington trial court,in which msi had obtained summary judgment on similar facts.
further investigation by experts retained by pic disclosed details about the potential source of the chloride contamination.in february,process engineering,process,reported that the most probable source of the chloride contamination was residual refrigerant.similarly,aptech engineering services,aptech,reported the following month that the most likely source of the contaminants was the decomposition of residual refrigerant.
artco opposition to the motion 
in its opposition to the summary judgment motion,artco argued that msi had not disproved other potential causes of the loss,but it did not offer any evidence of such a cause.it also argued that msi denial of coverage was untimely,since it knew artco had to replace the subject portion of the system quickly and knew the likely cause of the loss in december,but did not deny coverage until april.in addition,artco sought a continuance of msi motion pursuant to section,subdivision h,so it could take the depositions of kasel and hamby in regard to its bad faith claim.
c.the trial court rulings 
the trial court granted msi summary judgment and summary adjudication on each of artco causes of action and punitive damage claim.as to coverage,the court concluded that corrosion was the sole cause and the efficient proximate cause of artco loss,and artco had no coverage because loss caused by corrosion was specifically excluded under the policy.the court noted that artco had offered neither evidence of a source of the chloride nor evidence indicating that the cause of the pitting was anything other than the chloride.the court also found that the absence of coverage precluded a finding of bad faith,and the evidence did not support a finding of bad faith or negligence anyway.further,the court ruled,artco failed to demonstrate a need to depose msi claims personnel.
judgment was entered,and artco appealed.
ii.discussion 
in reviewing the grant of summary judgment,we conduct an independent review to determine whether there are triable issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,subd.c buss superior court cal th,d,ochoa pacific gas electric th,d.we construe the moving party evidence strictly,and the party evidence liberally,in determining whether there is a triable issue.see board of medical examiners cal d.
a defendant seeking summary judgment must show that at least one element of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action,subd.o.a defendant insurer,for example,may establish that the insured loss is excluded from coverage.the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show there is a triable issue of material fact on that issue.se
