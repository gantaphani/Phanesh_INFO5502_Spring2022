background 
when the internal revenue service encouraged the electronic filing of federal income tax returns in the late,block developed and offered to its clients an electronic filing service,rapid refund,and soon added the ral program for clients who did not want to wait for their refund checks.rals are loans processed by block,funded by banks,and repaid with the borrower refund proceeds.block processed more than rals from.not surprisingly,this marketing success spawned a flurry of consumer class action lawsuits in state and federal courts,resulting in this coverage dispute.
block professional liability coverages.during the years in question,block and its affiliates obtained in annual primary professional liability insurance coverage from affiliated insurers under four identical claims made policies that were fronted by block,meaning that block and its affiliates administered claims,paid amounts due under the policies,and reinsured the primary insurers for their entire exposure.the policies also required block to pay a retention of per wrongful act,a provision that generated sharp dispute in the district court but is not an issue we need consider on appeal.
on top of this primary coverage,block purchased excess professional liability coverage.evanston insurance company provided in annual excess coverage from august to august.in may,block purchased the two additional layers of excess coverage here at issue.between may and august,aislic provided of excess coverage,and lexington provided of excess coverage.between august and august,aislic provided both the second and excess coverages,again with a total limit.the excess policies followed form,meaning that the coverages and exclusions were the same as those in the primary policies 
the primary and excess policies were claims made policies.they covered errors,omissions or negligent acts referred to as wrongful acts committed in the conduct of block specified operations,which were defined as t he performance of tax services,including,but not limited to processing applications for refund anticipation loans.the policies basic coverage was for claims first made while this policy is in effect based on a wrongful act that occurred while this policy was in effect,provided block notified the primary insurer of the claim while this policy is in effect.by contrast,occurrence policies generally provide coverage for an event that occurs during the policy period,regardless of when a claim is asserted.wittner,poger,rosenblum spewak,bar plan mut.ins,banc.
relevant to this appeal are two provisions that extended this basic coverage to include prior acts claims based on a wrongful act that occurred before the policy effective date,provided that block had no knowledge of the prior wrongful act on the effective date of this policy,nor any reasonable way to foresee that a claim might be brought,and reported acts claims first made after the policy period ended provided block has reasonable knowledge that a wrongful act occurred and a claim might be made,and reported t he suspected wrongful act and what loss or damage may result during the policy period.
the class action litigation.the first class action complaint on behalf of ral program clients was filed in.when block purchased second and excess coverages from aislic and lexington in may,eleven class action lawsuits had been filed in various state and federal courts across the nation,asserting a variety of statutory and common law damage claims based on allegations that block failed to adequately disclose finance charges,charged usurious and unconscionable interest rates,failed to disclose it received kickbacks from the lending banks,misled clients as to the nature of the ral loans,and breached a fiduciary duty to its clients by peddling imprudent,loans.one recent case was a nationwide class action filed in the western district of missouri in november asserting causes of action under the federal truth in lending act,state statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and practices,state usury statutes,and common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation.no class had been certified,two complaints had been dismissed with prejudice,one case settled for,another settled for,and the rest were still pending.block disclosed all this litigation to aislic and lexington before they issued excess professional liability policies in may.
eleven more class actions were filed in federal and state courts between may and august,when the aislic and lexington excess policies were in effect.the fact allegations and legal theories in these suits mirrored those of the prior suits.by far the most significant was a class action filed in a texas state court in august.more than six years later,when the trial judge certified a class and ruled that block had intentionally violated a fiduciary duty to all class members,block settled the case by giving each participating class member discount coupons on future block services and paying to plaintiffs attorneys.other class action cases filed during the policy periods settled for million,and.
procedural history.block primary had no financial stake in the with block that the class action lawsuits filed between may and august were covered by the primary policies.block received in primary policy proceeds for each annual policy period.applying the same coverage provisions in the primary policies,the excess liability,aislic,and additional coverage on multiple grounds.block then commenced this diversity action seeking a declaratory judgment that the insurers must defend and indemnify block up to the excess policies limits for ral suits filed during the applicable policy periods.after two years of discovery,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on various issues.
applying the prior acts coverage provision,the district court ruled in an interlocutory order that the aislic and lexington excess policies provided no coverage for ral class action claims based on wrongful acts committed before the effective date of the policies because in may,when the first two policies began,at least four class action complaints had been filed.the court explained 
the primary policies provided coverage for claims based on wrongful acts occurring before the effective date of the policy if block both lacked knowledge of the wrongful action and lacked a reasonable way to foresee that a claim might be brought.the clause does not require block to know the identity of the person s presenting the claim.on this record block had reason to know that additional claims would be filed by somebody when it obtained coverage.
the court did not apply this reasoning to block claims against evanston because it began providing excess liability coverage in.the court also ruled that the excess insurers have no duty to defend,only to reimburse block for costs incurred in defending covered claims,subject to the policy limits an issue block concedes.the court did not issue a final judgment,commenting the parties have more work to do.after evanston and block entered into a separate settlement,aislic and lexington renewed their summary judgment motions,which the district court granted on the basis of its prior construction of the prior acts provision.this appeal followed.
