this case involves an insurance policy that covers injury resulting from an accident.after an assault and battery by the insured,the injured party sued the insured,alleging that the insured had acted under the unreasonable belief of having to defend himself,an act that according to the injured party fell within the policy coverage of an accident.does the insurance company have a duty to defend that action the answer is no.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal,which had reversed the trial court.
interinsurance exchange of the automobile club of southern california acsc issued to craig reid a homeowner insurance policy providing liability coverage for up to.on november,while the policy was in effect,insured reid hit and kicked jonathan delgado.
in march,delgado sued reid.the complaint alleged two causes of action.the first alleged an intentional tort in that reid in an unprovoked fashion and without any justification physically struck,battered and kicked delgado.the second cause of action alleged that reid negligently and unreasonably believed he was engaging in and unreasonably acted in self defense when reid negligently and unreasonably physically and violently struck and kicked minor jonathan delgado repeatedly causing serious and permanent injuries.
reid tendered to acsc the defense of delgado lawsuit.acsc denied coverage and refused to provide reid a defense.acsc asserted that the assault was not covered because it was not an occurrence,which was defined in the policy as an accident,and that the complaint allegations arose out of reid intentional acts,which came within the policy intentional acts exclusion.
in january,the trial court,at delgado request,dismissed the intentional tort claim.delgado and reid then settled the action by stipulating that reid use of force occurred because he negligently believed he was acting in,and by stipulating to entry of a judgment against reid.later,reid agreed to pay delgado and he assigned to delgado reid claims against his insurer,acsc delgado in turn agreed to give reid a partial satisfaction of judgment and a covenant not to execute on the remainder of the judgment.
delgado then brought this action against acsc.the trial court sustained acsc demurrer on the ground that no facts were pled to establish coverage under the policy,but the court allowed delgado leave to amend the complaint.delgado then filed a first amended complaint alleging,on information and belief,that at the time of the incident the insured,reid,acted without intent to injure delgado but with intent to defend himself and his family from what reid perceived was an imminent threat of harm it further alleged that reid reaction to what he perceived was an imminent threat of harm was an overreaction,was not willful or malicious,and was an accident within the meaning of reid insurance policy.
the first amended complaint alleged two causes of action seeking declarations from the trial court that acsc had a duty to defend and indemnify its insured,reid,in the underlying lawsuit brought by delgado one cause of action brought under insurance code section,subdivision b,in which delgado sought to recover from acsc as a judgment creditor of acsc insured,reid and three causes of action alleging bad for failure to defend,one for refusal to indemnify,and one for failure to pay medical benefits.
acsc demurred to the first amended complaint.at the hearing on the demurrer,the trial court asked delgado counsel what facts were alleged regarding the events that led insured reid to think he was acting in.counsel responded we ca allege facts leading up to what happened when my client was ultimately struck.we ca allege those facts.
the trial court sustained acsc demurrer without leave to amend,finding that the settlement and stipulated judgment between reid and delgado were contrived to expose acsc to liability,that it was disingenuous at best to characterize insured reid assault and battery as an accident,and that there were no facts alleged to support delgado claim that reid believed he was acting in.
the court of appeal reversed.after stating that allegations of harmful acts done with an unreasonable belief in describe conduct that is properly characterized as nonintentional tortious conduct,the court of appeal concluded that delgado first amended complaint alleged acts by insured reid that potentially were an accident covered by the policy.
we granted acsc petition for review.
as mentioned earlier,in this case the trial court sustained acsc demurrer to delgado complaint without leave to amend.in reviewing the ensuing judgment of dismissal,we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.city of dinuba county of tulare cal th,d.
at issue here is whether the insurer had a duty to defend its insured in an action brought by a third party to prevail in an action seeking declaratory relief on the question of the duty to defend,the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage,while the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.in other words,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.montrose chemical superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the duty to defend exists if the insurer becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.we look first to the terms of the policy.ibid.
acsc policy provides liability coverage for bodily injury caused by an occurrence,which the policy defines as an accident which,during the policy period,results in bodily injury in the context of liability insurance,an accident is an unexpected,unforeseen,or undesigned happening or consequence from either a known or an unknown cause.geddes smith,paul mercury indemnity cal d,geddes accord,hogan midland national ins.cal d.this common law construction of the term accident becomes part of the policy and precludes any assertion that the term is ambiguous.collin american empire ins.th,d see bartlome state farm fire casualty d.
here,injured party delgado contends that because insured reid assault and battery was motivated by an unreasonable belief in the need for,the act fell within the policy definition of an accident,because from the perspective of the injured party the assault was unexpected,unforeseen,and undesigned.we disagree that whether there was an accident within the policy language must be determined from the injured party perspective.
in support of his contention,delgado points to certain language by this court in geddes,supra,cal d at page.this court there stated no definition of the word accident can be given.it has been defined as a out of the usual course of events and which happens suddenly and unexpectedly and without design of the person injured.geddes went on to state that the term accident includes any event which takes place without the foresight or expectation of the person acted upon or affected by the event.ibid.it is this italicized sentence on which delgado relies.but that language should be read in context,not in isolation,as delgado does.geddes quoted several sources that had defined accident.the italicized sentence on which delgado relies is only one of those definitions.immediately after the sentence in question,geddes quoted this definition of accident accident,as a source and cause of damage to property,within the terms of an accident policy,is an unexpected,unforeseen,or undesigned happening or consequence from either a known or an unknown cause.id.at.notably,this quoted definition lacks any mention of the need to consider the perspective of the injured party.and it was this definition of accident that this court in geddes applied to the case before it.as geddes pointed out,it is the unexpected,undesigned,and unforeseen nature of the event that determines whether there is an accident within the policy coverage.id.at.
similarly misplaced is delgado reliance on this court later decision in hogan midland national ins,supra,cal d.hogan held that to the extent the property damage that the injured party incurred there was the result of the injured party deliberate acts,no accident occurred within the geddes definition.id.at.hogan did not hold that whether an event is an accident is,as delgado would have us conclude,to be determined from the perspective of the injured party independent of the insured intention.indeed,hogan concluded that a deliberate act causing an injury is not an accident.ibid.
delgado contention does find support in some language from maxon security ins.d.maxon.the court of appeal there held that an insurance company was not obligated to defend its insured against a claim of malicious prosecution by a third party.id.at.although unnecessary to its decision,maxon nevertheless discussed whether malicious prosecution was an accident within the coverage of the insurance policy there in issue.in the course of that discussion,maxon quoted the same language from this court decision in geddes,supra,cal d at page,on which delgado relies accident includes any event which takes place without the foresight or expectation of the person acted upon or affected by the event.based on that language from geddes,maxon stated that the third party claim against the insured for malicious prosecution was based on an accident,reasoning that the arrest and prosecution of a person who is innocent and has no reason to expect an arrest is,as to such person,an accident.maxon,supra,at.maxon reliance on the geddes language was wrong.as we explained earlier,that language played no role in the holding that geddes ultimately reached that the injury there was caused by an accident because it was unexpected,undesigned,and unforeseen geddes,supra,cal d at,and not because the injury was unexpected by the injured party.
were we to accept delgado argument that any interpretation of the policy term accident should be based solely on whether the event was expected,foreseen,or designed by the injured party,then intentional acts that by no stretch could be considered accidental nevertheless would fall within the policy coverage of an accident.under delgado reasoning,even child molestation could be considered an accident within the policy coverage,because presumably the child neither expected nor intended the molestation to occur.see penney casualty ins.cal d,fn,t he very notion of accidental child molestation is implausible.other examples that come to mind are arson,robbery,and premeditated murder,which are acts that do not fit the common understanding of the word accident because they involve acts intentionally done with the intent to cause harm.
delgado contends that acsc could have included in the policy coverage of an accident the phrase from the standpoint of the insured,if the insurer intent was to have the word accident defined from the perspective of the insured as opposed to that of the injured party.in support,he points out that earlier standard comprehensive general liability policies defined the word occurrence as an accident which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.
we are not persuaded that because the coverage clause of acsc policy does not use the words neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured,the word accident as used in the policy means that whether an event is an accident must be determined from the injured party viewpoint.the phrase neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured in earlier comprehensive general liability policies has been construed as modifying the policy term injury and damages,not accident.see city of south el monte southern cal.joint powers ins.authority th,d united pacific ins.mcguire d.commercial union ins.superior court d.we note that in that phrase was deleted from the standard comprehensive general liability policy coverage clauses because of conflicting judicial interpretations of the phrase.some courts had conflated the concept of an accident with the phrase neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.this led those courts to conclud e that an accident refers to an unexpected or unintended injury.new appleman,insurance law practice guide.other courts,however,concluding that the terms are different and have their own meanings,held that the occurrence definition is limited to events that are accidental in nature,and the rest of the definition merely confirms that expected or intended injuries are not accidental.ibid.
under california law,the word accident in the coverage clause of a liability policy refers to the conduct of the insured for which liability is sought to be imposed on the insured.quan truck ins.exchange th,d collin american empire ins,supra,th at,d.this view is consistent with the purpose of liability insurance.generally,liability insurance is a contract between the insured and the insurance company to provide the insured,in return for the payment of premiums,protection against liability for risks that are within the scope of the policy coverage.insurance policies are read in light of the parties reasonable expectations and,when ambiguous,are interpreted to protect the reasonable expectations of the insured.state of california allstate ins.cal th,d.therefore,the appropriate inquiry here is not,as delgado would have it,confined to viewing the pertinent event from the perspective of the injured party.
delgado insists that an insured unreasonable,subjective belief in the need for converts into an accident an act that is purposeful and intended to inflict injury.we disagree.
we begin by noting that an event is not an accident within the policy coverage language when all of the acts,the manner in which they were done,and the objective accomplished occurred as intended by the actor.hogan midland national ins,supra,cal d at,stellar state farm general ins.th,d merced mutual ins.mendez d.here,insured reid assault and battery on delgado were acts done with the intent to cause injury there is no allegation in the complaint that the acts themselves were merely shielding or the result of a reflex action.therefore,the injuries were not as a matter of law accidental,and consequently there is no potential for coverage under the policy.scottsdale ins.mv transportation cal th,d.
we also note that in a number of contexts other than those involving claims pertaining to assault and battery,which is the conduct at issue here,courts have in insurance cases rejected the notion that an insured mistake of fact or law transforms a knowingly and purposefully inflicted harm into an accidental injury,merced mutual ins.mendez,supra,d.oral copulation and attempted oral copulation not an accident notwithstanding insured mistaken belief that victim consented collin american empire ins,supra,th,d misunderstanding of legal rights did not turn conversion of property into an accident quan truck ins.exchange,supra,th,d rape not transformed into an accident notwithstanding insured mistaken belief that victim consented swain california casualty ins.th,d mistaken belief that acts were lawful did not render wrongful eviction of tenant an accident lyons fire ins.exchange th,d insured subjective miscalculation of victim state of mind did not make sexual attack an accident see penney casualty ins,supra,cal d,homeowner policy as a matter of law did not provide coverage for child molestation regardless of lack of intent to harm.
here,injured party delgado advances two different arguments to support his claim that,unlike the decisions pertaining to oral copulation,conversion,rape,wrongful eviction,and child molestation,an actor unreasonable belief in the need for converts an assault and battery into an unintentional act and therefore is an accident within the policy coverage.we reject these contentions.
delgado first argument relies on a statement by this court in gray zurich insurance cal d,gray.the issue there was whether an insurance company had a duty to defend an action alleging that the insured had willfully,maliciously,brutally and intentionally assaulted the plaintiff.id.at.unl
