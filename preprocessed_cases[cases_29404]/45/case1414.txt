neuma,neuma filed this suit against amp,amp.it alleged four causes of action arising from amp failure to maintain group life insurance benefits for stanley larsen,a former amp employee larsen previously had assigned all of the rights to his life insurance benefits to neuma.the district court rejected neuma claim for benefits under section a b,a b,of the employee retirement income security act,et,erisa,because it found that amp actions were justified based on an unambiguous provision of the summary plan description that governed larsen life insurance policy.the court also denied neuma claim under section c of erisa,c,which alleged that amp had failed to provide documents relating to an employee welfare benefit plan within a required statutory period.it found that neuma was not entitled to the documents because it did not have a colorable claim for the life insurance benefits at issue.the court also dismissed neuma state law negligent misrepresentation claim without prejudice to its right to refile in state court.the district court refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over this claim because it had dismissed all federal claims.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court regarding neuma claim for benefits under section a b.we reverse and remand with respect to the claim that amp failed to provide plan documents in a timely manner under section c.lastly,we also reverse the district court dismissal of the negligent misrepresentation claim and remand that claim to the district court for further proceedings.
backgrounda.facts 
on march,larsen was hired by amp to work in its amp circuits division.amp provides its workers with benefits that include medical,dental and life insurance coverage.during and,the life insurance coverage that amp provided for its employees was issued by provident life accident insurance company provident and was funded through group policy no.the policy or the provident policy.on january,larsen enrolled in amp life insurance program for benefits in the amount of.the contours of these life insurance benefits were described in greater detail in a booklet provided to amp employees,entitled group benefits program for employees of amp circuits,an amp division,ex.this booklet the summary plan description contained the following clause pertaining to disabled employees the disability clause 
insurance during disability before age 
if you become disabled before age,and while insured,amp will keep your life insurance in force by paying the appropriate premium as long as you are disabled,provided proofs of disability are furnished as required.in no event,however,will such insurance be continued beyond the date the life insurance provisions of the plan terminate.
id.at emphasis added.another provision in the summary plan description gave amp the right to terminate,suspend,withdraw,amend or modify the plan at any time.id.at.
on march,larsen was placed on disability status by amp.at some point thereafter,neuma began negotiating with larsen to purchase the rights to his group life insurance benefits.as a part of this process,neuma requested and received some basic information from amp regarding the details of larsen life insurance coverage.on september,larsen assigned all of his rights,title and interest in his group life insurance coverage to neuma,an assignment acknowledged and accepted by amp.then,on march,one year after larsen became disabled,he was terminated by amp pursuant to company policy.
by the end of,amp had decided to change its group life insurer.on december,amp cancelled the provident policy and purchased group life insurance with metlife insurance company metlife that went into effect on january.the life insurance coverage provided in the metlife policy was identical to that provided by provident in all material respects.amp did not enroll larsen for coverage under the metlife policy.when the provident policy was discontinued,larsen group life insurance coverage with amp was terminated.
on august,neuma requested that amp provide it with copies of various documents relating to the provident policy and any larger employee benefit plan of which the policy was a part,pursuant to b of erisa.on october,neuma filed suit against the defendants,seeking penalties under erisa section c for amp failure to respond to this document request and seeking a declaratory judgment to declare the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policy.amp did not reply to neuma request for plan information until december,when it provided neuma with a copy of what neuma claims was an outdated version of the summary plan description.on february,amp,through its attorneys,provided more information regarding larsen group life insurance benefits to neuma,including an updated version of the summary plan description in force at the time when larsen coverage was ended.
on january,neuma filed a first amended complaint the complaint against the defendants,alleging four causes of action relating to amp failure to maintain group life insurance benefits for larsen after the provident policy was terminated on december.count i of the complaint sought,pursuant to erisa section a b,the full recovery of larsen life insurance benefits in the amount of if larsen was deceased,or,if larsen was living,an order for amp to purchase and maintain a policy in that amount on his life.neuma alleged that amp should not have discontinued these benefits under the terms of the summary plan description.count ii alleged an illinois state law cause of negligent misrepresentation,due to alleged omissions and false statements of fact made by amp during its correspondence with neuma prior to neuma purchase of larsen benefits.neuma claimed that these misrepresentations caused it to suffer damages by purchasing benefits that were less valuable than what it had anticipated.count iv of the complaint again alleged a claim under section c of erisa,based on amp failure to respond to neuma requests for plan documents within the time limit mandated by that section of the act 
district court proceedings 
on january,neuma filed a motion for summary judgment as to count i of its complaint.in response,amp filed a for summary judgment on that count,as well as a motion for summary judgment on the other remaining counts.
in its order of may,the district court ruled on these motions.with respect to count i,neuma request to recover benefits,the court found in favor of amp.amp had argued that any dispute on this point was resolved by the language of the disability clause in the summary plan description,which stated that i n no event will life insurance for disabled employees be continued beyond the date the life insurance provisions of the plan terminate,ex at.amp claimed that the language of the summary plan description clearly identified the plan as the provident policy,and that because it had the right to and did terminate that policy on december,it no longer had any obligation to pay larsen life insurance premiums after that date.in contrast,neuma maintained that amp life insurance program was one part of a more comprehensive employee benefit plan that also included medical and dental insurance the benefit plan.it contended that,when the disability clause referred to the plan,this reference was not to the provident policy,but to a larger benefit plan as a whole,and it claimed that extrinsic evidence it presented had established that fact conclusively.therefore,because amp continued to provide some form of life insurance to its employees through the metlife policy after it cancelled the provident policy,neuma argued that the life insurance provisions of the plan had not terminated when the provident policy was cancelled and that amp should have continued to pay larsen premiums after that date.in ruling for amp on this issue,the district court held that the unambiguous language of the summary plan description showed that the plan referred to in the disability clause was the provident policy,not a more comprehensive benefit plan run by amp.the key piece of evidence for the district court was that,at the beginning of the summary plan description,it explicitly stated that any usage of the term plan in that document referred to provident policy no.the court then found that,because the summary plan description allowed amp to terminate the plan at any time,and,because the disability clause explained that disabled employees will not continue to receive life insurance benefits after the life insurance provisions of the plan terminate,amp obligation to pay larsen life insurance premiums ended when the provident policy was cancelled.therefore,amp motion for summary judgment on count i was granted 
as to count iv,neuma allegation that amp did not respond in the proper time period to its request for plan documents,the court also granted summary judgment for amp.it held that,when neuma made its request for information,neuma was not a plan beneficiary entitled to those documents under erisa,because it did not have a colorable claim that it would prevail in a suit for benefits.in the court view,the clear language of the summary plan description explained that amp obligation to pay larsen life insurance premiums ended on december,the date amp discontinued the provident policy.
lastly,with regard to count ii state law negligent misrepresentation claim,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction because it had dismissed all of the federal claims in the lawsuit.accordingly,it dismissed count ii without prejudice to neuma refiling the claim in state court.
discussiona.
neuma contends that the district court erred in its disposition of counts i,ii and iv.as to count i,it submits that the district court interpretation of the word plan in the disability clause was incorrect.in neuma view,the language of the summary plan description is at least ambiguous in this regard,and,indeed,suggests strongly the opposite conclusion that the word plan means the comprehensive amp benefit plan covering medical,dental and life insurance.neuma contends that it has provided,but the district court disregarded,extrinsic evidence that supports such an interpretation.second,neuma claims that the district court erred in its ruling on count iv.it contends that it is certainly a beneficiary under the meaning of erisa and therefore is entitled to invoke the provisions of section c because it has at least a colorable claim for benefits under erisa.neuma points out that,even if it did not ultimately succeed,its claim was at least colorable because it had an arguable chance of success and was not frivolous.lastly,neuma maintains that the district court erred in dismissing count ii negligent misrepresentation claim because the district court had diversity jurisdiction,not supplemental jurisdiction,over that claim.
the district court disposed of counts i and iv by granting summary judgment to amp.we apply a de novo standard of review to the district court decision.see thomas pearle vision,cir.summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see adickes kress,d grun pneumo abex,cir,cert.denied,d.this court has noted that cases involving the interpretation of contractual documents are particularly to disposition on summary judgment.see grun,at ryan chromalloy am,cir.
with respect to count ii,we review a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see labonte united states,cir haven polska,cir,cert.denied,haven republic of poland,d.
recovery of benefits under section a b of erisa 
we first examine neuma allegation that amp improperly discontinued larsen group life insurance benefits after it cancelled the provident policy at the end of.as an initial matter,both parties agree that the amp life insurance program that larsen enrolled in is an employee welfare benefit plan as defined by erisa.erisa defines such plans as any plan,fund,or program established or maintained by an employer for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,or death.a.amp contends that this life insurance program constitutes an entire benefit plan unto itself.neuma,however,claims that the life insurance program was but one part of a larger benefit plan provided by amp,entitled the amp akzo corporation medical,dental,life insurance plan,which also included medical and dental insurance 
erisa plans are governed by written documents that define their scope the statute requires that e very employee benefit plan be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.a.through those instruments,the parties are free to subject such welfare benefits to vesting requirements not provided by erisa,or they may reserve the power to terminate such plans.ryan,at.erisa requires that employers provide these documents to their employees to protect their interests as participants in employee welfare plans.see panaras liquid carbonic indus,cir citing b.
although they dispute the nature of the erisa plan at issue,the parties agree that the plan document that describes the contours of larsen life insurance benefits is the summary plan description.apparently,there are no other existing plan documents that relate to the group life insurance benefits at issue in this litigation.the disagreement between the parties centers on a key provision of that summary plan description,the disability clause.this clause explains amp responsibilities to employees such as larsen who become disabled before age,with regard to the payment of life insurance premiums.it states that,if a policyholder becomes disabled,amp will keep his life insurance in force by paying the appropriate premium as long as he is disabled,ex at.yet,it further states that i n no event,however,will such insurance be continued beyond the date the life insurance provisions of the plan terminate.id.the meaning of the word plan in the clause is crucial.
neuma claims that plan refers to a larger medical,dental and life insurance plan that amp provided to its employees,of which the provident policy was merely a part.under this interpretation,amp was obligated to continue paying larsen life insurance premiums as long as the life insurance provisions of that larger benefit plan remained in effect.therefore,because amp continued to provide life insurance coverage to its employees through metlife after it cancelled the provident policy,it should have continued to provide coverage to larsen under the disability clause even after the provident policy was replaced by the metlife policy.amp counters that,in the summary plan description,plan clearly refers to the provident policy,and that,when that policy was cancelled,its obligation to provide group life insurance benefits to larsen also ended.
in interpreting the language of the disability clause,we must apply federal common law rules of contract interpretation.see,grun,at brewer protexall,cir.those rules direct us to interpret erisa plans in an ordinary and popular sense as would a person of average intelligence and experience.brewer,at citation and quotation marks omitted.in attempting to interpret such plans,our first task is to determine if the contract at issue is ambiguous or unambiguous.see grun,at ryan,at.contract language is ambiguous if it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.see grun,at brewer,at.if a district court determines that the provision is without ambiguity,we have noted that it need not consider extrinsic evidence and should proceed to declare the meaning of the provision.ryan,at see also moriarty svec,cir swaback am.info.techs,cir.thus,if a document governing an erisa plan is unambiguous,this court will not look beyond its four corners in interpreting its meaning.mathews sears pension plan,cir.
in reviewing the summary plan description,we believe that the document unambiguously equates the term plan with the provident policy.the disability clause therefore absolved amp of the responsibility to continue to pay larsen life insurance premiums after it discontinued that policy.
the most compelling passage from the plan in this regard,which the district court highlighted prominently in its opinion,is located on page of the summary plan description,before any of the substantive provisions of that document.it appears in a letter from provident president and chief executive officer that specifies the following 
life and accident 
insurance company 
chattanooga,tennessee 
herein called the provident 
certifies that it has issued group policy no.n herein called the plan to 
amp circuits,an amp division herein called the policyholder 
the plan provides the benefits described on the following pages for certain employees covered under the plan.this booklet gives the principal provisions of the plan.the plan alone constitutes the entire contract between the provident and the policyholder.
employees become covered under the plan as provided on a following page.this booklet becomes the employee certificate of coverage while covered under the plan.
the benefits and provisions described on the following pages are subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the plan.
president and chief executive officer provident life and accident 
insurance company 
ex at emphasis added.this portion of the summary plan description clearly states that group policy no,which all parties agree is the provident policy that covered larsen,will be herein called the plan in the remainder of the summary plan description.id.it then notes that the provident policy provides the benefits described on the following pages for employees covered under that policy.id.moreover,the statement itself is signed by provident president,which suggests that the document that contains it refers exclusively to a product.these statements provide direct and unambiguous evidence that the use of the term plan in the summary plan description including the disability clause refers to the provident policy.
other textual passages in the summary plan description support the same conclusion.on the cover of the booklet,along with its title group benefits program for employees of amp circuits,an amp division,is a logo that reads provident life and accident insurance company.id.moreover,the booklet itself has many provisions relating to life insurance and provident,but it provides no direct reference to any other type of insurance or to a more comprehensive benefit plan.additionally,a number of times in the document the word plan is referred to in a way that appears to relate directly to a life insurance policy provided by provident.page notes that certain representations made to the employee by the policyholder about being covered for benefits under this plan shall a not be considered as representations or statements made by,or on behalf of,the provident and b not bind the provident for benefits under the plan.id.at emphasis in original.on page,the text explains that t he provident will pay to you the amount shown if the dependant dies while covered under the plan.id.at.and on page the document states that c laims for benefits under the plan are to be submitted to provident and that p ayment of claims under the plan will be made by the provident.id.at.
neuma points to several other passages in the document to demonstrate ambiguity regarding the meaning of the word plan,but its arguments are not persuasive.first,it notes that the document refers to the title of the plan in a few different ways on page,it refers to it as the life insurance plan on page letter from provident president,the plan is called group policy no.and on page,the document states that t he name of the plan is the employees group life benefit program.id.at.neuma submits that,because they use different titles for the plan,these examples create confusion as to what that term means.we can not accept this argument.indeed,this argument supports amp interpretation of plan,not neuma.each of these titles indicates a connection to a life insurance policy alone,such as the provident policy none suggests a reference to a more comprehensive benefit plan containing medical,dental and life insurance plans.
second,neuma points to the disability clause itself,which states that amp will not keep a disabled employee life insurance benefits in force beyond the date that the life insurance provisions of the plan terminate.id.at.neuma maintains that the only logical reading of this phrase suggests that the plan must have provisions other than those relating to life insurance,because,if it did not,the phrase would be redundant.therefore,it claims that,because the provident policy solely refers to life insurance coverage,to give effect to each word of the disability clause,the term plan must identify a larger benefit plan that contains the policy along with many other components.however,the passage in question must be read within the context of the entire document,including the specific provisions that we previously have noted.when evaluated in this context,the phrase highlighted by neuma does not cause the term plan to be susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.see grun,at.as we noted earlier,in many instances the summary plan description either specifically equates the plan with the provident policy or references the word in a way that can seemingly point to nothing other than the policy.at no point does the document explicitly mention the more comprehensive benefit plan that neuma refers to,or any form of medical or dental insurance.read in this context,the disability clause reference to the life insurance provisions of the plan appear to be simply the result of cautious drafting designed to distinguish those provisions of the provident policy from others concerned with administrative detail 
neuma notes that,even if we find that the term plan is unambiguous,in limited circumstances parties may present objective extrinsic evidence to demonstrate that,although a contract appears unambiguous,a disputed term actually means something different from what it appears to mean on its face.see rossetto pabst brewing,cir,cert.denied,d mathews,at.this type of ambiguity is often referred to as latent or extrinsic ambiguity.see rossetto,at distinguishing latent ambiguity from patent ambiguity,which is ambiguity that is clear from the reading of a contract language stone container hartford steam boiler inspection ins,cir same.neuma claims that the term plan is,at the least,latently ambiguous,even if it is not ambiguous on its face.to support this assertion,it puts forward two pieces of extrinsic evidence.
neuma first refers us to a separate summary plan description for the metlife insurance policy that replaced the provident policy in providing life insurance coverage to amp employees.it notes that this document shows that,although the metlife policy has a different policy number than the provident policy,it identifies a plan identification number of,the same identification number as that located in the provident policy summary plan description,ex d at.neuma then assumes that this number must refer to the larger benefit plan and that its presence in the provident summary plan description demonstrates that the plan referenced in that document must be the benefit plan.second,neuma refers to the and form annual of employee benefit plan the form submitted by amp to the irs in those years.these documents each appear to identify a benefit plan entitled the amp akzo corporation medical,dental,life insurance plan,which includes a life insurance policy and a health maintenance organization hmo policy that provides medical and dental coverage to amp employees,and state that this plan was not terminated in or,respectively neuma then claims that,because these documents identify a more comprehensive benefit plan than one that simply included a life insurance policy,the plan referenced in the summary plan description must also equate to a larger amp benefit plan.
with respect to the identification number,it is unclear as to what this number actually refers.neuma has not put forward any evidence linking the number to a benefit plan that provides medical,dental and life insurance.by contrast,when neuma attorney asked jacqueline mooneyhan,a human resources manager at amp,about the fact that this same number was listed as an identification number in both the provident and metlife summary plan descriptions,she replied that this number was issued by the government and referred not to a larger benefit plan but only to amp life insurance plan 
as for the form,the district court questioned their accuracy,noting that the form incorrectly listed provident as the life insurance carrier for that year,when in fact metlife provided life insurance coverage for amp employees at that time.see at noting that it may be that other aspects of these forms are incorrect as well.regardless,even if the form do reference a larger benefit plan,they can not bring serious dispute to the fact that the word plan in the summary plan description refers to the provident policy.
we agree with the district court determination that the disability clause reference to the plan clearly equated it with the provident policy.therefore,because the disability clause specifically stated that amp was responsible for paying larsen life insurance premiums only until the life insurance provisions of the plan terminate,amp obligation to pay those premiums ended on december.as a result,the court was correct in granting summary judgment to amp on count 
failure to produce documents under section c of erisa 
in count iv of its complaint,neuma sought to recover penalties under section c of erisa,which requires plan administrators to provide information requested by plan participants or beneficiaries within thirty days of such a request,or face a statutory fine.see c b neuma had made this request to amp by letter on august,when it asked to be provided with a copy of the master provident insurance policy,plan document and related amendments thereto,summary plan description and all other documents constituting the benefit plan and insurance policy under which the policy was maintained.this request was made pursuant to b,one of erisa disclosure provisions,which requires that 
the administrator shall,upon written request of any participant or beneficiary,furnish a copy of the latest updated summary plan description,plan description,and the latest annual report,any terminal report,the bargaining agreement,trust agreement,contract,or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.
amp claimed that it did not receive this request until december,on that date,mooneyhan sent a copy of what she claimed was the relevant summary plan description to neuma,and stated that she was not in possession of the master insurance policy,plan document and related amendments.neuma claims that the summary plan description provided by mooneyhan at that time was outdated because it had been superceded by the summary plan description described in this opinion on july.on february,amp,through its attorneys,sent other documents to neuma regarding the provident policy,including the updated summary plan description and unsigned copies of other provident group policy documents.on april,amp attorneys provided neuma with signed copies of those provident group policy documents.
under erisa,only a participant or a beneficiary is entitled to request such plan documents and seek penalties for the failure of their production.b c b.neuma claims that it was a beneficiary,defined by erisa as a person designated by a participant,or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.the parties do not dispute that larsen designated neuma as the recipient of his life insurance benefits.however,a party such as neuma can demonstrate that it may become entitled to a benefit,and therefore be considered a beneficiary for jurisdictional purposes,only if it can show that at the time it filed suit it had a colorable claim to vested benefits.see riordan commonwealth edison,cir kennedy.life ins,cir citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d the district court held that neuma had not made a colorable claim that it was due benefits because the summary plan description unambiguously equates the provident policy with the plan therefore,neuma claim for benefits was not subject to reasonable debate.at.
we have noted that t he requirement of a colorable claim is not a stringent one.panaras,at.a plaintiff achieves status as a beneficiary if they have even an arguable claim o nly if the language of the plan is so clear that any claim as an assignee must be frivolous is jurisdiction lacking.kennedy,at see also panaras,at.even in cases where a plaintiff claim ultimately failed,the possibility of success was sufficient to establish participant or beneficiary status.kennedy,at see also jackson brach,cir riordan,at panaras,at.a determination regarding the relative strength of that claim has often been deemed to go to the merits,not to whether standing as a participant or beneficiary was demonstrated.see riordan,at kennedy,at 
with this minimal standard in mind,we must respectfully disagree with the district court conclusion that neuma claim was not colorable under erisa.the parties do not dispute that larsen properly assigned his right to benefits to neuma,and neuma claimed that the language of the plan documents required amp to continue to pay larsen life insurance premiums.this legal argument is not so bizarre or so out of line with existing precedent that neuma has failed to meet the low threshold of the colorable requirement.panaras,at quoting andre salem technical,internal quotation marks omitted.after reviewing the merits of neuma claim,we have found that the language of the summary plan description does not afford neuma the relief it seeks.however,the claim had at least an arguable chance of success,and we do not believe that in hindsight it should be deemed so obviously lacking in any legal merit as to be characterized as frivolous.
accordingly,we reverse the district court decision on this issue.in doing so,we note that a determination as to whether penalties should be awarded under section c is a matter left to the discretion of the district court,see c,and we express no opinion as to whether any penalty would be appropriate in this case.
negligent misrepresentation claim 
count ii of neuma complaint is styled as a state law,negligent misrepresentation claim against amp.it notes that,before neuma purchased the rights to larsen group life insurance benefits,it requested information from amp regarding the contours of those benefits.a few days after receiving that information,neuma purchased the rights in question.now,in count ii,neuma alleges that the information provided by amp omitted material facts and contained false statements of material facts concerning the operation of the plan as applied to larsen.at.neuma claims that,in its response,amp negligently stated incorrectly the amount of larsen life insurance coverage provided incorrect information regarding how the amount of that insurance could decrease in the future and omitted important information about the extent to which conversion to an individual policy of insurance was available,in the event that amp terminated larsen coverage.more generally,neuma claims that it suffered damages by paying valuable consideration for an amount of life insurance benefits that amp now claims are not provided under the terms of the plan.id.at.among other relief,neuma sought compensatory damages in the amount of,the full amount of the life insurance benefits for which larsen enrolled while working at amp.
having dismissed the federal erisa claims in the suit,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and dismissed count ii without prejudice,so that it could be filed in state court.neuma submits that the district court chose the wrong course because it had diversity jurisdiction over this claim and should have retained the claim on that basis.amp counters by arguing that diversity jurisdiction does not exist because th
