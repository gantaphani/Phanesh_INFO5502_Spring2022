this diversity action stems from a dispute involving the contamination of over eight million pounds of mozzarella cheese manufactured by leprino foods company resulting in damages of.leprino sought coverage under an insurance policy issued by factory mutual insurance company fm,which denied the claim,citing the fm policy contamination exclusion.leprino argued first,that the insured cheese was covered under the express terms of the fm policy,and second,that leprino had a reasonable expectation of coverage under the fm policy such that it had coverage for all changes in flavor for its cheese.
the district court disagreed as to the first claim,granting partial summary judgment because the cheese was clearly contaminated.it submitted the reasonable expectations question to the jury.the jury found that leprino expectation of coverage was not reasonable.
leprino appeals the grant of partial summary judgment,the jury verdict and the district court denial of its motion for a new trial.fm,arguing that the district court erred when it submitted the doctrine of reasonable expectations to the jury.for the reasons given below,we reverse the grant of partial summary judgment and remand for a new trial.
background 
factual background 
leprino,a colorado corporation,specializes in manufacturing mozzarella cheese and is the largest manufacturer of mozzarella cheese in the united states.leprino stores vast amounts of cheese in warehouses before shipment,sometimes reaching an inventory of forty million pounds at one time.
in,leprino sought a property insurance policy to cover risks related to its products,plants,and equipment.leprino entered negotiations with arkwright insurance,a predecessor company to fm.arkwright issued an policy,effective until november,covering all risk of physical damage except where specifically excluded.the proposed arkwright policy contained an exclusion exclusion stating 
this policy does not insure against contamination including but not limited to pollution shrinkage or change in color,flavor,texture or finish all unless such damage directly results from other physical damage not excluded by this policy.
aplt app.vol.v,at emphasis added.
leprino sought to delete the language regarding change in color,flavor,texture or finish,noting that to leave such language in the exclusion effectively negated any coverage for the product while it was being stored or otherwise.id.vol.iv,at.after arkwright completed a risk analysis regarding the implications of this request,it was agreeable to deleting this exclusionary language.id.at.on december,arkwright issued an endorsement stating 
exclusion is replaced by the following 
contamination including but not limited to pollution or shrinkage all unless such damages directly results from other physical damage not excluded by this policy.
id.vol.v,at emphasis added.
the next year,arkwright merged into allendale mutual insurance company and became fm.fm informed leprino that,although the name of the insurer had changed,leprino policy rights and obligations and those of the insurer have not been altered or changed in any way.id.vol.iv,at.fm sent leprino the fm policy as a replacement for the arkwright policy.the original fm policy contained exclusionary language nearly identical to that deleted from the arkwright policy the year before 
d.this policy excludes the following unless directly resulting from other physical damage not excluded by this policy 
contamination including but not limited to the presence of pollution or hazardous material.
changes in color,flavor,texture or finish.
id.at exclusion d emphasis added.
once again,leprino demanded that the third clause changes in color,flavor,texture or finish be removed,and fm agreed.fm issued a formal endorsement that deleted this clause.
in october,after receiving complaints about an in both raw and cooked cheeses,leprino traced the cheese to a warehouse in scranton,pennsylvania.leprino recalled the cheese and delivered replacement shipments to its customers.leprino executives investigated and noted a strong odor and an objectionable in the cheese stored in the pennsylvania warehouse.also noted in the warehouse were spills of fruit juice concentrate on the sides of juice concentrate barrels,on the floor,and on pallets on which food was stored,and generally all over the warehouse.numerous popsicle products appeared to have been smashed by forklifts in the warehouse.leprino employees testified that they noted stagnant air and a strong odor in the warehouse.
on october,leprino notified fm of the possible loss.testing on the leprino cheese from the pennsylvania warehouse indicated that a number of chemicals had contaminated the cheese,including toluene,ethyl benzene,trimethylbenzene,ir.and limonene.aplt app.vol.v,at.leprino determined that the cheese was not usable even as salvage for feed to animals,and it disposed of all pounds of the cheese in a landfill.
in july,fm denied the claim under the fm policy.fm noted that contamination of the cheese resulted from exposure to limonene,and fm maintained that the damage was not due to other physical damage.thus,fm applied exclusion d to preclude coverage of leprino claim.
procedural history 
leprino filed a complaint against fm alleging breach of contract against fm as a result of fm denial of leprino claim for damages seeking declaratory judgment regarding the existence of coverage for the same,and seeking coverage under the reasonable expectations doctrine.in its answer,fm admitted that the loss to leprino cheese was caused by contamination from limonene,a chemical found in fruit concentrate also stored at the facility in pennsylvania.the limonene contamination altered the flavor and aroma of the cheese.aplt app.vol.i,at see also id.at final pretrial order,filed,same emphasis added.therefore,according to fm,the contamination was excluded.
the parties filed for summary judgment.leprino contended its loss was covered under the fm policy because it fell within the other physical damage exception to the exclusion,because the other physical damage exception is ambiguous,leprino prevails under the reasonable expectations doctrine.fm countered,arguing the damage to the cheese fell squarely within the contamination exclusion.the district court initially denied both motions,noting that the question of whether contamination occurred in this case or whether there was a change of flavor without contamination is a mixed question of law and fact requiring participation by the jury.id.at.
in april,fm filed motions in limine to exclude certain proposed expert witness testimony about how the cheese became contaminated leprino sought to present expert testimony regarding its investigation of the damaged cheese,the effect of spills at the pennsylvania warehouse,and the results of testing samples of the damaged cheese.at a hearing on may,the district court concluded that this expert testimony was irrelevant because the cheese was indisputedly contaminated.id.vol.iii,at.there no question here that the flavor of this cheese has been altered as a result of some chemical,we do know what chemical it is,for sure,or where it came from,but it changed.id.at.whether that change in flavor from contamination is within the policy as a result of the objective expectations of the plaintiff here is a matter for the jury to decide.that what we going to trial on.id.the district court thus precluded the introduction of evidence regarding the cause of the damage to the cheese.
leprino experts proffered testimony about whether the other physical damage exception to exclusion d caused the damage to the cheese.fm challenged leprino proffer of evidence regarding spillage in the warehouse as speculation and conjecture.id.vol.iv,at.the court reiterated that it was not necessary for the insured to prove what specifically happened that contaminated this cheese.id.at.the court stated it did not see that spillage is something we need to concern ourselves about.id.the court emphasized that the parties should focus only on the reasonable expectation and not on the exception.id.emphasis added.
at the same hearing,the district court clarified its earlier r
