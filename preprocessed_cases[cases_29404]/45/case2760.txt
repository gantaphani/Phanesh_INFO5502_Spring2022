carpet companies sued the manufacturers of a latex mix used in carpet backing.the manufacturers tendered the claims to their insurers that provided products liability coverage.one insurance company provided coverage.the other did not.after the underlying cases were resolved,the two insurance companies engaged one another in a lawsuit involving the intricacies of the relationship of policy exclusions.
travelers casualty and surety company travelers appeals from a judgment in its equitable contribution action against employers insurance of wausau wausau applying exclusions for operations coverage and premises coverage.we conclude that an exclusion in the wausau policy pertaining to coverage involving the claim of western dyeing and finishing corporation western does not apply to damages arising under the operations coverage,and therefore wausau had a duty to defend until that action was concluded.accordingly,we will reverse a portion of the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.
background 
this appeal concerns insurance coverage for two lawsuits filed against mydrin,mydrin,and its predecessor,r d latex,r d,manufacturers of liquid latex.both suits were filed by carpet manufacturers that had purchased latex carpet backing that proved to be defective and resulted in complaints from the customers of the carpet manufacturers.the uncertainty as to insurance coverage and the meaning of certain coverage exclusions is related to a series of corporate combinations culminating in the merger of r d and mydrin in august of.consideration of the issues involves an understanding of the nature of the insurance coverage provided by wausau and the application of specific exclusions.
acquisition of r d and insurance coverage 
on may,btp acquisition,a california subsidiary of btp plc united kingdom btp,acquired all of the shares of stock of r two mergers ensued,concluding in the august,merger of r d into a subsidiary of btp,named backings.at the time of the merger,backings,changed its name to mydrin,and r d ceased to exist.
prior to the acquisition and mergers,travelers insured r d,located at telegraph road,in commerce,california,under a commercial property and commercial general liability cgl policy from february,to february.
after the second merger and name change to mydrin were complete,wausau issued cgl policies to btp holding company,for the period from october,to march,the wausau policies contained two exclusions relating to r d that formed the basis for wausau later denial of coverage 
wausau investigation of the underlying complaints 
on november,royalty carpet mills,royalty filed a complaint naming r d and mydrin as defendants and alleging breach of contract and breach of implied and express warranties.the complaint alleged that starting in,royalty purchased latex mix from r d for use as a backing in carpet manufactured by royalty.royalty alleged that changes in the latex mix caused failure of the carpets and complaints from royalty customers beginning in late.the complaint alleged that royalty stopped doing business with r d in october of.the complaint also alleged on information and belief that mydrin merged with r d on august.royalty alleged that it has received and continues to receive claims of defective carpets attributable to the latex mix.royalty filed an amended complaint on march,containing no alterations relevant to this case.
western also experienced problems with the latex mix and sent a claim to mydrin.
mydrin tendered the royalty complaint and information regarding the claim but not the complaint of western to travelers and wausau in late.travelers agreed to defend mydrin in both actions.
donna biller initially handled the claim for wausau.on march,biller wrote to mydrin counsel acknowledging receipt of the royalty summons and complaint and denying coverage.in a detailed letter,biller stated that it was questionable whether property damage was caused by an occurrence during the policy period.she also cited a number of exclusions that wausau does not currently rely on to support the denial of coverage.
biller also stated further,endorsement number in the policy and endorsement number in the policy exclude coverage for liability arising out of products manufactured by r d latex.based on facts we have to date,the only reason mydrin,is named in this suit is as a direct result of the products manufactured by r d latex.therefore,no coverage is provided for mydrin.she also stated that wausau would not participate in the defense of the action.
although both policies also contained exclusions from the general liability premises and operations coverage for r d,biller did not mention those exclusions in her denial letter.regarding the western claim,biller stated that the occurrence fell outside the policy period and noted that mydrin had not yet sought a defense of that claim.nevertheless,she denied coverage and a defense for the same reasons as she had given for the royalty action.
on or about may,western filed a complaint for breach of contract and breach of express and implied warranties naming only mydrin as a defendant.the western complaint alleged that it purchased defective latex compound from mydrin from approximately may,through and including january of.mydrin tendered the complaint to wausau in june of.
on september,biller wrote to mydrin attorney,raymond riley,acknowledging receipt of the complaint in the western case.she requested information regarding which entity manufactured the product in question in this litigation as well as when the product was manufactured and under what company name it was manufactured and distributed.she sent copies of the policies to riley.
riley reviewed the policies and responded on october.he objected to the denial of a defense in the royalty claim and enclosed royalty first amended complaint.he also pointed out that western alleged that it received defective latex from mydrin from to january of.riley told biller that it was not clear whether or not some of the defective latex was manufactured by mydrin as well as r d.he asked biller to participate with the other insurers of r d and mydrin.
on october,wausau claims specialist donald smith took over handling of the royalty and western cases.smith attended a meeting with mydrin counsel and other insurance carriers in early november of,where he explained the exclusion in the wausau policies for r d products.in a letter dated november,mydrin counsel told smith that the issues in the western action involved allegations that the defective latex was manufactured and supplied by mydrin itself,and that r d was not a defendant in that action.
smith reviewed documents produced by western during discovery that included invoices for the defective latex.some of the invoices were from r d and some were from mydrin.smith understanding was that the latex at issue was manufactured at the former r d latex plant in commerce,california.he believed that any product coming from the commerce plant was excluded from all coverage.
on april,smith attended a meeting with the other insurance carriers.at that time,he argued that because the birmingham and c i policies provided coverage concurrent with wausau policies,neither the policyholder nor wausau intended that wausau coverage would extend to r d products,even if the products were manufactured after mydrin acquisition of r d latex.smith concluded that because the other carriers did not argue to the contrary,they were all convinced of the validity of his argument and that wausau no longer needed to monitor the case unless mydrin filed an action for bad faith.
smith did not reject mydrin tender of the western complaint in writing.in march of,when mydrin counsel requested a written response from wausau,smith merely sent a copy of biller march,denial of coverage,issued before the western complaint had been filed.wausau closed its file in march of.
the western action settled in early.the parties settled the royalty action in november of.
travelers contribution action 
on september,travelers filed this action against wausau seeking equitable contribution for amounts it expended in the defense and indemnification of mydrin in the royalty and western actions.both parties moved for summary adjudication of the issues of wausau duties to defend and indemnify mydrin in the royalty and western actions.
in its motion,wausau argued that a second exclusion in its policies exempted liability for any postmerger product distributed from or produced at the former r d plant in commerce,california.travelers argued that wausau duty to defend began at the time of tender by mydrin and that no exclusion conclusively eliminated the potential for coverage.
the trial court granted wausau motion on the issue of wausau duty to defend mydrin in the royalty action.as to the western action,the court granted travelers motion in part,finding that wausau raised triable issues of material fact as to a part of that claim.the court explained that the duty to defend on the western claim was triggered by tender of the original complaint,no later than september.the court stated that it did not have sufficient undisputed facts to determine whether or not the duty to defend terminated at the april,meeting of insurers,or at some later time and ordered a trial on that issue.
in march of,the court held a bench trial.the court determined that two wausau policy exclusions precluded coverage,not only for products manufactured by r d,but for any products originating from the former r d facility,regardless of whether the product was manufactured by mydrin or by r d.the court found the wausau policy provisions were ambiguous and relied on its analysis of the reasonable expectations of the insured,as evidenced by wausau calculation of premiums on locations other than the commerce facility and the existence of other insurance coverage for mydrin california operations.the court entered judgment in favor of travelers for the costs of the defense in the western case only for the period of september,to april,and against travelers on the royalty claim.
judgment was entered in the amount of to travelers for the specified portion of the western action.travelers filed a notice of appeal on february.the judgment was amended in march of to include costs in favor of wausau in the amount of.
discussion 
the essential facts underlying this case are not disputed.travelers insured r d from february,to february.r d merged with mydrin in august of and mydrin was the surviving corporation.wausau insured only mydrin from october,to march.the royalty action alleged damages caused by defective latex purchased from r d during a business relationship with r d from until october of.the western action alleged damages from defective latex purchased from mydrin from may,through january of.travelers defended the actions for part of the time and wausau did not 
whether or not wausau owed a duty to defend indemnify mydrin that would entitle travelers to equitable contribution turns on an interpretation of the wausau policies and exclusions.
based on our reading of the terms of the wausau policies,we will affirm the judgment as to the royalty claim,but reverse in part as to the western claim.the evidence established that the western complaint was tendered to wausau in june of.the matters alleged in the western complaint triggered wausau duty to defend mydrin.wausau failed to present evidence to establish there was no potential for coverage.therefore,wausau duty continued until the underlying suit was concluded.
an insurer right to equitable contribution 
in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.low golden eagle ins.th,d.where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk,each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d fireman fund hartford casualty ins.travelers indemnity th,d.
the right to contribution arises,not from the insurance contract itself,but from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden.as these principles do not stem from agreement between the insurers,their application is not controlled by the language of their contracts with the respective policy holders.citations.even so,absent compelling equitable reasons,courts should not impose an obligation on an insurer that contravenes a provision in its insurance policy.citation.truck ins.exchange unigard ins.th,d.courts should consider the nature of the claim,the relation of the insured to the insurers,the particulars of each policy and any other equitable considerations.citation.ibid.
in light of the essentially undisputed facts underlying this case,we look to the policy provisions,the nature of the claims made and other equitable concerns that may be applicable in evaluating travelers claim.
the duty to defend 
it is by now a familiar principle that a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.citation.as we said in gray,gray zurich insurance cal d,the carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.citation.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.citation.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d.
the defense duty is a continuing one,arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded citation,or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose.
wausau duty in the royalty action 
wausau policies were occurrence policies,applicable to covered losses that occurred during the policy period.label transamerica ins.th,d occurrence policy covers losses so long as damage occurs during policy period.travelers argues that the royalty complaint alleged that carpets manufactured with r d latex continued to fail into the wausau policy period.it also contends that royalty sued mydrin for its own negligence in providing technical advice and services in response to customer complaints.
the royalty action alleged damages caused solely by products supplied by r d before the merger with mydrin.the wausau policy exclusion for r d products precluded any possibility of coverage for these claims and the trial court correctly entered judgment for wausau on the royalty claim.
factual background 
the original and first amended complaints alleged that royalty stopped buying latex from r d about october of.the company named mydrin did not exist until the merger in august of.no additional facts were presented that indicated mydrin itself manufactured,sold,handled,distributed or disposed of the defective product.
the first two royalty complaints alleged the august date of the merger and did not allege facts regarding negligent advice by mydrin regarding the r d product.it was apparently not until the fourth amended complaint that royalty added general allegations that r d and mydrin both failed to provide meaningful technical advice to mitigate the problems caused by the defective latex.the fourth amended complaint also contradicted the prior factual allegations by alleging that the merger of mydrin and r d took place in may of.
even if the additional allegations would have triggered wausau duty to defend,mydrin never tendered the later complaint to wausau.an insurer has no duty to continue to investigate the potential for coverage after it makes an informed decision on coverage at the time of tender.gunderson fire ins.exchange th,d.once it determined on the basis of the lawsuit itself and the facts known to it at that time that there was no potential for coverage,the insurer did not have a continuing duty to investigate or monitor the lawsuit to see if the third party later made some new claim,not found in the original lawsuit.id.at,d.
mydrin potential liability in the royalty action could only have resulted from its legal responsibility for r d products.this possibility was foreclosed by a wausau policy exclusion.even if we considered the later allegations of mydrin own negligent advice and service,the applicable exclusion still precludes liability,as we now explain.
application of the r d exclusion 
the basic definition of your product in the wausau policy was any goods or products,other than real property,manufactured,sold,handled,distributed or disposed of by you others trading under your name or a person or organization whose business or assets you have acquired the policy definition of your product also included a warranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness,quality,durability,performance or use of your product,and b the providing of or failure to provide warnings or instructions.
wausau exclusion number in the policy and number in the policy were headed,exclusion products,and provided this endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following coverage parts commercial general liability coverage part operations liability coverage part this insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage included in the operations hazard and arising out of any of your products designated in the schedule.the schedule referred,inter alia,to a ll products manufactured by r and d latex.
the plain meaning of this policy endorsement is that it excludes coverage for damage arising out of r d products,which are defined to include warnings,representations,instructions or lack of instructions regarding the products of r because no products were purchased after october of,only r d products were implicated by the royalty complaint and those products and any representations or instructions given by mydrin relating to the r d products are clearly within the exclusion.r d products were excluded under any circumstance.in light of these facts,the royalty complaint was not a suit that even potentially sought damages covered by the wausau policies.wausau had no duty to defend or to indemnify and therefore owes no duty of equitable contribution to travelers for its defense of its own insured.the court correctly entered judgment in favor of wausau as to the royalty action.
wausau duty in the western action 
the western action,unlike the royalty action,named only mydrin as a defendant.the complaint alleged that western purchased defective latex compound from mydrin after the merger through and including january of.although these facts were sufficient to trigger wausau duty to defend its insured,wausau denied coverage before the complaint was filed and relied on the same denial letter after mydrin tendered the complaint and throughout the course of this litigation.
the western action concerned not only premerger products supplied by r d and therefore subject to the r d products exclusion,but also alleged that mydrin itself supplied some of the defective latex.as the trial court determined,these allegations are not disposed of by the r d products exclusion.we part company with the trial court decision because we also determine that the plain language of the r d premises exclusion does not preclude the potential for coverage for wausau insured.
factual background 
at the trial,don smith of wausau admitted that mydrin attorney had informed him that some of the defective latex was manufactured by mydrin itself.when smith received discovery documents from the western litigation,he reviewed invoices for the latex product and saw that some invoices were from r d and some were from mydrin.smith understanding was that all of the latex at issue in the western action,whether it was manufactured by r d or by mydrin,came from the former r d plant in commerce,california.in smith opinion,the policy exclusion from the premises and operations coverage applied if mydrin manufactured the latex at the commerce,california plant.
in ruling on the motions for summary adjudication,the trial court determined that the complaint was tendered to wausau no later than september,and that the tender triggered wausau duty to defend the court explained that resolution of the issue of when wausau duty ended would involve consideration of the meaning of the premises and operations exclusion relating to r d.after the trial,the court issued a statement of decision in which it concluded that wausau performed an appropriate investigation and correctly concluded at the april,meeting,that the source of the products sold to western was the commerce facility,which was excluded from coverage.the court found the exclusion ambiguous because it failed to specify the address of the included premises.
application of the r d exclusion 
although we agree with the trial court observation that the r d premises and operations exclusion failed to specify the commerce location,we do not agree that omission renders the exclusion ambiguous when it is viewed in the context of the entire policy.when interpreting an insurance policy,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.aiu ins.superior court cal d.
rather than begin our analysis with the language of the exclusions,we first review the coverage provisions of the wausau policy.the insurance contracts at issue are cgl policies.the declarations page of the wausau policy lists the applicable coverages with separate limits for the general aggregate limit other than operations,the operations aggregate limit,the personal and advertising injury limit and per occurrence,fire and medical expense limits.
the policy defines the operations coverage as including all bodily injury and property damage occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of your product or your work except products that are still in your physical possession or work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.italics added.wausau exclusion number in the policy and number in the policy expressly modified only the operations liability coverage and excluded from that coverage bodily injury or property damage arising out of a ll products manufactured by r and d latex,by its terms,this exclusion applies to liability arising out of r d products that cause injury or damage after they have left the insured hands.fibreboard hartford accident indemnity th,d fibreboard.
the second exclusion number in the and policies modified only the general liability coverage and not the operations coverage.the exclusion was headed,exclusion premises or operations,and provided t his endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following commercial general liability coverage.directly below was a schedule stating description of premises or operation r and d latex,that exclusion states that the specified coverage,does not apply to bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury arising out of the premises or operations described in the schedule.the schedule states only r and d latex,this exclusion is the one that wausau and the trial court relied on to deny any duty,either to defend or indemnify mydrin for its defective products because it manufactured and distributed them from the former r d facility.but the exclusion does not reach that far,and in any event,is not applicable to the western case,which implicates only the operations coverage.
the court in fibreboard described the two aspects of coverage,explaining that the operations coverage applies to defects in merchandise or improper workmanship after the product has been completed and distributed.the complimentary hazard is covered under the general liability aspect of the policy and applies to an injury or loss that results prior to completion of the product and during the manufacturing process w
