this dispute arises out of a claim by a mentally disabled person,jeremy dymowski,against rocky mountain job opportunity brigade rmjob,which had engaged him on a church crew.after he was injured at work,dymowski,rather than bringing a workers compensation claim,sued rmjob in tort.plaintiff carolina casualty insurance was rmjob general liability insurer.it settled with dymowski,but only after rmjob had unsuccessfully requested its workers compensation carrier,defendant pinnacol assurance,to participate in the settlement negotiations.
in one of the communications between rmjob and pinnacol,pinnacol lawyer wrote that dymowski lacked the mental capacity to enter into a contract of employment and hence could not be an employee under the pinnacol insurance policy.carolina and plaintiff denver fox,president of rmjob,claim that by refusing to pay on this ground,pinnacol discriminated against them on the basis of their association with a mentally disabled person in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,g.carolina also asserts its entitlement on contract and grounds to reimbursement for its defense and settlement of dymowski suit.
we exercise jurisdiction under and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for pinnacol.before addressing the merits,we reject pinnacol contention that carolina lacks constitutional standing.on the merits we hold that pinnacol owed rmjob no duty to defend dymowski lawsuit or contribute to the settlement.plaintiffs concede that the absence of such duties would foreclose their claims.because our decision on the merits with respect to carolina claims would also defeat fox claims,we need not address whether fox has standing.
background 
rmjob trains and pays mentally disabled people to perform useful services.on february,dymowski was part of an rmjob work crew cleaning a church.during a break he attacked another worker when he was restrained by an rmjob supervisor,he suffered a broken arm.
on february martha dymowski,dymowski stepmother and guardian,asked rmjob to file a workers compensation claim on dymowski behalf.on february rmjob reported the injury to pinnacol then known as the colorado compensation insurance authority,but on february dymowski withdrew the claim.
eight months later,on november,dymowski sued rmjob in colorado state court.he asserted negligence and claims,a state statutory claim on the ground that rmjob had misrepresented its work environment as safe and appropriate for mentally disabled persons such as him,and a state statutory claim for violation of regulatory standards promulgated under the colorado care and treatment of the developmentally disabled act.et.this was the suit that carolina defended and settled.
ordinarily a worker has no right to sue his employer in tort.if the worker is an employee and is injured while performing service arising out of and in the course of the employee employment,he or she is entitled to benefits under the workers compensation system.see.the benefits are available regardless of fault,see.springs disposal indus.claims appeals office of,but they are example,punitive damages and damages are not included,see.et reliance ins.blackford,damages not available and other claims against the employer ordinarily are not permitted,see.horodyskyj karanian,en banc but recognizing exception for claim.although the availability of benefits regardless of fault makes workers compensation attractive to employees,the limitations on damages may encourage a worker to assert that he was not an employee or that the injury occurred outside the course of employment,in which case a tort claim is not barred.see horodyskyj,at.
the question whether an injury comes under the workers compensation statute can be important to insurance companies as well as workers,because typically,as in this case,different policies cover workers compensation liability and general tort liability.as a result,the insurer under one policy may seek either directly or through the enterprise insured by both policies assistance from the other insurer when workers compensation coverage is debatable.that occurred here.
while the suit was pending,rmjob repeatedly asked pinnacol to participate in its defense and settlement.pinnacol refused.in an april,letter,pinnacol which in february had responded to the original report filed by rmjob by contending that the injury was not,at stated that it had several defenses,namely,that dymowski may not have been an employee,has never filed a claim for compensation,and was not within the building maintenance and light janitorial job classifications covered by the policy.id.at.in a letter the next day pinnacol withdrew the defense but reasserted that dymowski was neither an employee n or injured within the course and scope of his employment.id.at.on june,pinnacol sent rmjob a letter declining to participate in a settlement conference on the ground that dymowski injury is not compensable under the workers compensation act.id.at.finally,in a july,letter pinnacol claimed that its duty to defend and indemnify rmjob did not extend to dymowski claim because his mental disability prevented him from contracting for employment,and thus from being an employee within the meaning of rmjob pinnacol policy.
it was the july letter that landed pinnacol in federal court.in their november,second amended complaint,carolina and fox claim that pinnacol refusal to defend rmjob and indemnify carolina was on account of their association with the mentally disabled dymowski,and hence a violation of the ada.see g carolina also brought two claims as rmjob subrogee.first,it contended that pinnacol had breached its insurance contract with rmjob.second,it contended that pinnacol is estopped to deny that its policy covered dymowski as an employee because pinnacol had promised to provide coverage for disabled employees and rmjob had paid premiums in reliance on the promise.
the district court granted summary judgment for pinnacol on each of carolina claims.it held that pinnacol was not obliged by its workers compensation policy to defend or indemnify rmjob.it further reasoned that because pinnacol owed no duty under the workers compensation policy,the and claims failed,and the refusal to perform an act that it had no contractual obligation to perform could not be an adverse action under the ada.
plaintiffs appeal the grant of summary judgment.but they stated in their reply brief that they agree that if pinnacol had no duty to provide coverage,then their claims fail,aplt.br.at,and they repeated this concession at oral argument.thus,just as it did in the view of the district court,this case turns on whether pinnacol owed rmjob a duty to defend or indemnify in connection with dymowski suit.if pinnacol owed neither duty,then,by plaintiffs concession,we must affirm the judgment.
in addition to claiming no duty,pinnacol contends that plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to assert any of their claims and statutory standing to assert their ada claim.for the reasons that follow,we hold that carolina has constitutional standing and need not address the other standing issues.
ii.standing 
article iii,section of the united states constitution extends the judicial power only to cases or controversies.a dispute is an article iii case or controversy only if the plaintiff can establish what is known as constitutional standing.constitutional standing is present if the plaintiff 
show s that it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw env.services toc,d see unified school dist,cir cetacean comm.bush,cir distinguishing constitutional from statutory standing.
congress may extend the right to sue under a statute to any plaintiff that has constitutional standing.it may also,however,place additional restrictions on who can sue,imposing requirements of statutory standing.cetacean,at.
because constitutional standing is necessary to the court jurisdiction,as a general rule it must be addressed before proceeding to the merits.see steel citizens for a better environment,d noting,however,that court can dismiss claim for lack of statutory standing without first addressing constitutional standing.to say what the law is without establishing that we have authority to do so would carr y us beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offend fundamental principles of separation of powers.id.at.
on the other hand,statutory standing need not be addressed if the court determines that the plaintiff loses on the merits anyway.as the supreme court observed,
the question whether this plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute,and the question whether any plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute are closely,depending upon the asserted basis for lack of statutory standing,they are sometimes identical,so that it would be exceedingly artificial to draw a distinction between the two.
id.at.resolving the merits without first deciding statutory standing 
does not take us into vast,uncharted realms of judicial opinion giving,whereas the proposition that the court can reach a merits question when there is no article iii jurisdiction opens the door to all sorts of generalized grievances that the constitution leaves for resolution through the political process.

carolina constitutional standing 
constitutional standing,because it is jurisdictional,may be raised at any stage of the proceeding.see steel,at.to establish standing 
e ach element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice in response to a summary judgment motion,however,the plaintiff can no longer rest on such mere allegations,but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts.
lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.carolina appeals a grant of summary judgment.thus,it must show each element of constitutional standing by affidavit or other evidence tending to establish specific facts.id.at.
pinnacol rightly does not challenge actual injury carolina paid for the defense and settlement of dymowski suit and redressability damages would make carolina more whole.moreover,carolina is asserting its and claims as rmjob subrogee,and therefore can rely on the injury that rmjob would have suffered had carolina not agreed to defend and settle dymowski suit.see vermont agency of res.united states ex rel.stevens,d subrogee has standing to assert subrogor actual injury.pinnacol contests only the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,at.it argues that t here is no causal connection between the actual injury suffered by carolina casualty,payment of the defense and settlement of the state court lawsuit,and the actions of pinnacol,which had no responsibility to defend the state court lawsuit.aplee.br.at.
the trouble with this contention is that pinnacol duty responsibility is irrelevant to constitutional standing.causation is established by showing that carolina was injured by pinnacol failure to defend or contribute to the it plainly was,because it paid and pinnacol did not.the injury is thereby traced to the challenged action of the defendant.friends of the earth,at.whether this failure to defend or indemnify violated a duty owed by pinnacol is then a matter for the merits hearing,not for a standing inquiry.see steel,at.whether cause of action exists is merits question,not jurisdictional one.we hold that carolina has constitutional standing.
carolina statutory standing 
pinnacol further contends that carolina lacks standing under the ada.unlike constitutional standing,however,statutory standing need not be resolved before consideration of the merits.as explained above,if carolina loses on the merits,the issue of statutory standing becomes moot and need not be addressed.as explained below,that is the situation here.
fox standing 
under the doctrine set forth in steel,ordinarily we could not address the merits of fox claim without first determining that he had article iii standing.but steel general rule that the court must first address a plaintiff constitutional standing has a natural exception when the merits have been resolved with respect to a separate claim for which the plaintiff likely,a different plaintiff has such standing.
an example of such a circumstance is norton mathews,d.the supreme court in norton found it unnecessary to decide the jurisdictional issue before it because,as steel explained,the merits question was decided against the plaintiff in a companion case.steel,at.thus,norton did not use the pretermission of the jurisdictional question as a device for reaching a question of law that otherwise would have gone unaddressed.id.the norton exception to the general ban on assumed jurisdiction does not enable a court to resolve contested questions of law when its jurisdiction is in doubt and thus does not produce an advisory opinion that infringes on the separation of powers.id.at.
in this case we affirm the judgment against carolina on a ground that would also require affirmance of the judgment against fox.affirming the judgment against fox would therefore not require an advisory opinion.thus,as we understand steel,we can affirm the judgment against fox without first determining that he has article iii standing.other circuits have expressed a similar understanding of steel.see seale ins,cir binding precedent foreordains the outcome on the merits here center for reprod.law policy bush,cir same see also century telesis joint venture fcc,williams,dissenting in part resolution of one issue between the parties totally resolves the merits of a second issue,so unnecessary to determine jurisdiction over second issue united states.tech,cir questioning scope of holding in steel.indeed,when the merits are otherwise resolved,it is the adjudication of the standing issue that resembles an advisory opinion.bush,at.
we now explain our ruling on the merits.
iii.duties to defend and indemnify 
rmjob pinnacol policy contains two parts workers compensation insurance and employers liability insurance.because plaintiffs did not rely on the employers liability part of the pinnacol policy in district court,they may not do so on appeal.see laurino tate,cir.we therefore address only the workers compensation part of the policy,which states 
we will pay 
we will pay promptly when due the benefits required of you by the workers compensation law.
we will defend 
we have the right and duty to defend at our expense any claim,proceeding or suit against you for benefits payable by this insurance.we have the right to investigate and settle these claims,proceedings or suits.we have no duty to defend a claim,proceeding or suit that is not covered by this insurance.
the duties to defend and indemnify are integrally related.under colorado law when an insurer provides coverage both to defend and to indemnify against certain types of claims,the insurer ordinarily has no duty to defend a claim against the insured absent a possibility that the claim will result in a judgment for which the insurer has a duty to indemnify.see cyprus amax minerals lexington ins,en banc to avoid duty to defend,insurer must prove that claim can not fall within policy.here,plaintiffs contend that the suit by dymowski against rmjob raises a claim for which pinnacol had a duty to indemnify because the historical facts alleged in dymowski complaint,particularly as those facts were fleshed out in litigation,would establish that he would be entitled to relief under the workers compensation act.the facts alleged in a complaint,not the complaint legal characterization of those facts,ordinarily control coverage.see cyprus,at resolving duty to defend on any facts or claims alleged in the complaint mutual ben.ins.haver,paul ins.dep t of.consequently,plaintiffs argue,pinnacol should have provided a def
