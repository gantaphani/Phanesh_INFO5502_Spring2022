in february,plaintiff katherine tsoulas tsoulas became an employee of medaphis corporation medaphis as a manager of educational services.a benefit of her employment was insurance coverage under a group disability policy the plan provided by liberty life assurance company of boston liberty.liberty is both the insurer for the plan and the claims fiduciary tsoulas applied for and received disability benefits beginning on september,because symptoms of multiple sclerosis ms had rendered her unable to work.in march,she applied for and received disability benefits until liberty discontinued them on march.
tsoulas filed this action in maine superior court against defendant liberty,alleging the wrongful termination of her benefits under,the civil enforcement section of the employee retirement income security act erisa.liberty removed the action to federal court on november.the united states district court for the district of maine granted liberty motion for judgment on the stipulated record on october.tsoulas now appeals.
we describe the stipulated facts of record.in april,kathryn isaac isaac,a staff physician in the department of neurosciences at the stanford university medical center,performed the first neurological evaluation of tsoulas.isaac evaluation revealed that tsoulas was experiencing worsening tremors and blackouts.other symptoms included numbness down the right leg and arm and fatigue.isaac reported that tsoulas tremor appears to be psychogenic and opined that she would clearly need psychiatric consultation as well.magnetic resonance imaging mri scans from and exhibited two to three brain lesions of unclear etiology.isaac reviewed them with a,who concluded that the lesions were not completely typical for multiple sclerosis.isaac concluded that she did not believe tsoulas symptoms were consistent with a diagnosis of 
leslie dorfman dorfman,professor of neurology and director of the ms clinic at the stanford university medical center,examined tsoulas in may of and concluded that a lthough the diagnosis is not completely certain,i think it is likely on the basis of the clinical history and the mri findings that this woman has relatively mild multiple sclerosis,form.in addition,dorfman determined that tsoulas was suffering from an anxiety disorder,and that some of the symptoms which are currently most troublesome to her are related to this,rather than to her dorfman recommended by a neurologist for ms,potential use of corticosteroids for ms exacerbations,and ongoing concurrent treatment for her anxiety disorder.
in september of,tsoulas saw annette,acting director of stanford university medical center ms clinic.concluded that although she clearly has multiple sclerosis,she also has a psychiatric condition for which she needs to continue seeking treatment.initially she refused to do this and vehemently denied that she had any psychological problems.one month later in a visit,wrote that tsoulas was suffering from ms and a conversion disorder although tsoulas was clearly under tremendous psychological stress,told her it was appropriate for her to return to work on a basis.tsoulas responded that she had discussed the possibility of work with her employer and that it was not an option.
based on her physicians recommendations,tsoulas saw joyce brothers kart,kart for psychotherapy on four occasions beginning in january and ending in march.kart observed that i t has been extremely difficult for her to function normally it is very unclear when she will be able to resume active employment due to her symptoms.there is no evidence that kart or any other mental health professional has evaluated tsoulas since march.
in july,cathleen miller miller examined tsoulas and concluded that tsoulas had multiple sclerosis,but that tsoulas was alert and attentive with normal speech and language,and no gross cognitive deficits.her symptoms included episodic worsening of her tremulousness associated with heightened anxiety and bowel incontinence as well as fatigue and impaired balance.miller observed that her current tremor is difficult to characterize,and there is a degree of embellishment noted on examination today.nevertheless,miller wrote to tsoulas primary care physician,leslie finder finder,that tsoulas was greatly disabled at this time of our first meeting.
in october,liberty sent a questionnaire to finder seeking information about tsoulas disability.finder reported that tsoulas primary diagnosis was ms,and that he expected that she would never regain either full or modified function.in february,liberty sent a nurse,christine entrekin nurse entrekin,to conduct a home visit with tsoulas to assess her ongoing disability.nurse entrekin observed that tsoulas was significantly impaired due to physical limitations as well as tsoulas own assertions of deteriorating mental status.prognosis for recovery does not appear favorable.
in august,tsoulas began to receive chiropractic care from deborah baker baker.baker placed some restrictions on tsoulas ability to reach,grasp,pull,push,climb,kneel,bend,squat,walk,stand,conduct repetitive motions,and lift between ten and forty pounds.the only complete restriction she imposed was against lifting forty or more pounds.
in october,susan connor,a surgeon,examined tsoulas in connection with a palpable abnormality of her left breast.removed the abnormality on october,and the diagnosis of breast cancer was confirmed.after the third and final checkup on august,reported that tsoulas no longer had any physical restrictions in connection with her breast cancer diagnosis.
as part of its ongoing review of tsoulas claim for continued disability benefits,liberty began planning to conduct surveillance in january.byers confidential investigations bci conducted the first surveillance on five consecutive days from february through february.on february,while the bci surveillance was ongoing,tsoulas submitted responses to a routine activities questionnaire indicating the following she was completely unable to walk or stand without the assistance of a cane,a wheelchair,or a scooter she spent fourteen to eighteen hours in bed each day she was able to drive a car only very little she left the house zero to one times per week she never left the house on weekends she never went shopping at the mall and she accomplished grocery shopping only with the aid of her son.
the surveillance videos revealed that between february and,tsoulas drove her car unassisted walked without the aid of a cane,wheelchair,or scooter completed errands by herself and without any assistive devices walked down a few steps conducted banking activities without any assistance shopped at the mall and the video store and went grocery shopping,pushed a grocery cart,and loaded and unloaded groceries.
because there appeared to be significant discrepancies between tsoulas limitations and the video footage,liberty determined that additional surveillance was necessary.omega insurance services omega conducted surveillance from march to march.omega report revealed tsoulas traveling to a tanning salon,a bank,a donut shop,a nail salon,and back to her residence in a single day walking,driving,entering and exiting a car,and entering and exiting various establishments without the assistance of any braces,supports,or other devices traveling to a hotel,a parking garage,a restaurant,a comedy club,a night club,and back to the hotel on a single day traveling to a restaurant,a furniture store,various gift shops,a coffee shop,and a residence in a single day.
after omega surveillance was completed,liberty referred tsoulas file to independent consulting physician john holbrook holbrook,who concluded,based on his examination of her clinical file and the surveillance information,that the diagnosis of ms had not been conclusively established and that the majority of tsoulas symptoms were either,unwitnessed,or unable to be objectively validated.he stated that although she might have undergone a period of psychological stress between and,recent evidence suggested that she had recovered sufficient functional capacity to be capable of at least light work.
in march of,liberty wrote a letter to tsoulas,terminating her disability benefits,effective march.the letter detailed the discrepancies between tsoulas limitations and her actual abilities,as captured by the surveillance videos.the letter also summarized holbrook findings.
on april,tsoulas appealed the termination of her benefits and submitted new material to liberty to bolster her claim.liberty then forwarded tsoulas file to a second independent consulting physician,eric erlbaum erlbaum.erlbaum reviewed the file and the surveillance videos,concluding that the primary diagnosis is most likely psychiatric in nature and the second diagnosis is a mild form of multiple sclerosis.erlbaum opined further that the surveillance video would suggest that the claimant is available for full time work of her choosing and that her physical condition appears to play a very small role,if any,in limiting her physical capacity.in a letter dated august,liberty denied tsoulas appeal of its termination of her disability benefits.liberty pointed out that although tsoulas might have significant psychiatric issues,she had not presented a psychiatric record and she was not claiming a disability based on a psychiatric impairment.without such a record,liberty was unable to determine whether she had a psychiatric impairment preventing her from meeting her responsibilities as an manager at medaphis.
ii.analysis 
tsoulas claims that the district court erred by granting judgment for liberty on the stipulated record.first,she maintains that the district court applied the wrong standard of review to liberty termination of her benefits.second,she argues that liberty decision to terminate her benefits was not supported by substantial evidence.we will address each argument separately.

arbitrary and capricious standard 
when a denial of insurance benefits is challenged under erisa,courts review the insurer decision de novo unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.firestone tire and rubber bruch,d.where,as here,the plan confers such authority upon the fiduciary,the decision is upheld unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.wright donnelley sons.group benefits plan,cir quoting doyle paul revere life ins,cir.
tsoulas claims that the district court improperly applied the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard to liberty termination of her benefits.specifically,tsoulas argues that because liberty is both the insurer and the claims any finding of eligibility means liberty will need to pay benefits out of its own decision was compromised by an inherent conflict of interest.citing wright,tsoulas alleges that liberty decision should have been subject to a heightened standard of review because,if a court concludes there is an improper motivation amounting to a conflict of interest,the court may cede a diminished degree of no deference at the administrator determinations.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we have held that no automatic conflict of interest arises to elevate the standard of review where,as here,a finding of eligibility means that the insurer will have to pay benefits out of its own pocket.itt hartford life and acc.ins,cir.instead,under such circumstances,courts should apply the arbitrary and capricious principle,with special emphasis on reasonableness,but with the burden on the claimant to show that the insurer decision was improperly motivated.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
tsoulas asserts two separate arguments to demonstrate that liberty was improperly motivated.first,she alleges that liberty undertook the surveillance for the purpose of terminating her benefits.second,she claims that liberty engaged in a selective review of the administrative record to the exclusion of other evidence.
tsoulas claims that because there was no change in her condition that could have given rise to suspicion,liberty must have undertaken the surveillance efforts for the purpose of terminating her benefits.liberty in turn points out it has made consistent and continued efforts to obtain objective evidence of tsoulas functional limitations in light of the fact that tsoulas own medical providers have repeatedly made contradictory findings regarding her condition.liberty claim examiner suggested surveillance as early as september to either confirm or call into question tsoulas condition,and liberty claim file contains several other references to the need for further information regarding tsoulas condition.further,in its letter to tsoulas terminating her benefits,liberty explained that it initiated surveillance her need for a cane and her alleged memory and concentration appeared in a january newspaper photograph standing unaided by a cane and she wrote and submitted an article to the national ms society website.the district court dismissed tsoulas allegation that liberty initiated surveillance with an improper motive as being without merit,finding that it was equally,if not more likely that liberty initiated surveillance to objectively document whatever her activity level turned out to be.we agree.there is no indication that liberty undertook the surveillance with the intention of terminating her benefits.
tsoulas next claims that liberty engaged in a selective review of the medical evidence and the administrative record to the exclusion of other evidence.she claims that liberty ignored the pattern of deterioration and glossed over her own doctors opinions of her disability.this argument is unavailing.the supreme court has held that n othing in erisa suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.black decker disability plan nord,d.further,it is not for a court to determine precisely how much weight an insurer should have accorded a particular piece of evidence in its overall decision.gannon metro.life ins,cir.
tsoulas next claims that liberty failed to share with erlbaum the supplemental materials she submitted to liberty after the termination of her benefits.this allegation appears to be totally baseless.in fact,erlbaum report specifically mentions at least two of the supplementary pieces of evidence in question a brain mri report from august and a report from neurologist edward collins.the district court inferred from these references that liberty had sent the entire file to erlbaum for review,and we find no error.
tsoulas also alleges that liberty itself did not engage in any substantive review of that supplemental evidence,an argument that appears similarly meritless.liberty extended the deadline to permit tsoulas to submit additional information to support her appeal,at one point noting that t o date tsoulas has forwarded one medical report and several letters from various persons describing her physical impairmen
