in the united states congress established medicaid,a cooperative program to provide health care services to the poor.title xix of the social security act,codified at et the federal government partially reimburses a state for medical assistance provided to eligible persons as long as the state abides by the requirement of the social security act to qualify for medicaid funds.california participates in the medicaid program through the california medical assistance program.welf,et.
congress enabled states to recover the costs for medical services from the estate of the former recipient.b b.according to federal law,the term estate,with respect to a deceased individual,a shall include all real and personal property and other assets included within the individual estate,as defined for purposes of state probate law and b may include,at the option of the state any other real and personal property and other assets in which the individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death to the extent of such interest,including such assets conveyed to a survivor,heir,or assign of the deceased individual through joint tenancy,tenancy in common,survivorship,life estate,living trust,or other arrangement.b.
pursuant to the federal enabling statute,california enacted a mandatory estate recovery program.section of the welfare and institutions code states in relevant part t he department of health services shall claim against the estate of the decedent,or against any recipient of the property of that decedent by distribution or survival an amount equal to the payments for the health care services received or the value of the property received by any recipient from the decedent by distribution or survival,whichever is less.welf,subd.a.
california utilizes the federal definition of estate.the regulations for the estate recovery program define estate as all real and personal property and other assets in which the individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death to the extent of such interest,including assets conveyed to a dependent,survivor,heir or assignee of the deceased individual through joint tenancy,tenancy in common,survivorship,life estate,living trust,or other arrangement,tit,subd.b.
in belsh√© hope th,d hope,the court of appeal considered whether property passing by way of a revocable inter vivos trust was part of the estate of the decedent for purposes of recovery of benefits.the beneficiaries of myrtle hope trust contended that section of the welfare and institutions code impermissibly enlarged the scope of recovery allowed under federal law by allowing recovery from outside the estate.hope,supra,th at,d.the court analyzed whether the federal statute,which before did not define estate,included nonprobate transfers on death.
there had been a vociferous debate on the scope of an estate prior to.the court in hope was part of that debate.in its attempt to decipher congressional intent,the court examined the purpose of the medicaid act.one of the express purposes of the medicaid act is to enable each state,as far as practicable under the conditions in such state,to furnish medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of aged,blind,or disabled individuals,whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.citation.allowing states to recover from the estates of persons who previously received assistance furthers the broad purpose of providing for the medical care of the needy the greater amount recovered by the state allows the state to have more funds to provide future services.furthermore,if a person has assets available to pay for the benefits,then the state should be allowed to recover from those assets because that person was not fully entitled to all benefits.hope,supra,th at,d.
the court found the term estate ambiguous because it could mean probate estate or taxable estate.turning to the internal revenue code,wherein congress included revocable transfers in the value of the gross estate for federal taxes,the court concluded that congress intended the term estate to be broader than the probate estate.according to the court in hope,if congress had intended such a narrow definition,it would have said so.hope,supra,th at,d.
the court rejected the beneficiaries argument that the amendment defining estate was compelling evidence that congress had intended to broaden the definition,and therefore,a estate must be limited to the common law definition.because the amendment did not merely define estate but contained major substantive changes and additions,the court concluded that congress was merely clarifying the original intent by expressly declaring the meaning of the words used in the act.we find congress intended the term estate to have a broad meaning.by including probate and nonprobate transfers on death in the estate,the purposes of the act will be better achieved and the broad definition will ensure that assets of a recipient are used for the cost of care rather than given away.hope,supra,th at,d.
two federal cases concluded otherwise.in citizens action league kizer cir kizer and bucholtz belshe cir belshe,the ninth circuit held that the term estate as used in section prior to the october,amendment was limited to the common law definition.consequently,neither property passing to a joint tenant by right of survivorship kizer nor property passing to a beneficiary of a revocable inter vivos trust belshe was part of a decedent estate under the medicaid act.in kizer,judge canby registered a dissent later embraced by the court in hope.kizer,supra,at.we need not weigh in on this debate.hope,kizer,and belshe turned on an assessment of congressional intent in the absence of an express definition of estate.congress has now provided a definition and california has incorporated it into its recovery program.we turn then to the words of the relevant statutes and regulation.
the california estate recovery program mandates the department to claim against the estate of the decedent,or against any recipient of the property of that decedent by distribution or survival welf,subd.a.moreover,the definition of estate under the federal statute and the state regulation includes,in relevant part,real property in which the individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death to the extent of such interest,including such assets conveyed to a survivor,heir,or assign of the deceased individual through joint tenancy,tenancy in common,survivorship,life estate,living trust,or other arrangement.b,tit,subd.b.
in granting burke and osborn motion for summary judgment,the trial court stated the law is clear that the fact that the grant of the fee simple interest was revocable does not change the fact that defendants received a vested interest by the transfer.citation.the property interest held by decedent heirs was granted to them in.the subject property did not pass to them by distribution or survival.the court recognized that hope expanded the d
