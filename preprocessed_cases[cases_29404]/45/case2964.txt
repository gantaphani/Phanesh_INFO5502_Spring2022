this case presents the question whether an insurer,golden eagle insurance corporation,had a duty to defend its insureds,rocky cola café,and several of its employees,in a lawsuit brought by krista bollman,a waitress formerly employed by rocky cola café.bollman suit included claims for sexual harassment and defamation,among other causes of action.the insurance policy covered rocky cola liability for personal injury caused by an offense,including defamation,arising out of rocky cola business,but specifically excluded coverage for personal injury arising out of any defamation.we conclude that the defamation alleged in bollman complaint was not within the meaning of the exclusion,and that golden eagle therefore had a duty to defend its insureds in the bollman lawsuit.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying lawsuit 
krista bollman sued rocky cola café,wally curry,a partner in the business,and shift managers christopher vitolo and angela henderson.her complaint asserted causes of action for sexual harassment,retaliation for reporting sexual harassment,intentional infliction of emotional distress,defamation,wrongful termination,and negligent hiring and supervision.
the complaint alleged that a sexual relationship developed between bollman and her supervisor,defendant christopher vitolo.a month or so later,bollman told vitolo she no longer wished to have sexual relations with him.vitolo then began to make insulting comments and engage in unwelcome touching of bollman body.the complaint alleges that,by abuse of his supervisorial position and by verbal and physical abuse,vitolo coerced bollman into engaging in sporadic sexual activity with him,including sex on the jobsite.bollman eventually resigned.the complaint included allegations that,after bollman informed vitolo she would no longer have sex with him,he followed her to a gym and in the presence of others humiliated her with coarse and abusive remarks about her body.
bollman cause of action for defamation included allegations that vitolo communicated to numerous other persons words to the effect that bollman was a sexually promiscuous and calculating bitch who had,by use of sexually aggressive tactics,maneuvered him into an unwanted sexual relationship in order to obtain favors from him.the complaint also alleged that vitolo false statements were adopted and republished by all of the remaining defendants,for the intent of unlawfully exculpating themselves from liability for bollman injuries.
on november,rocky cola and its officers and employees tendered the defense of the bollman lawsuit to golden eagle insurance corporation,which provided rocky cola commercial general liability insurance coverage.golden eagle initially rejected the tender by letter dated december.golden eagle asserted that its coverages for bodily injury and personal injury were subject to exclusions for practices,policies,acts and omissions,so that there was no coverage under the policy.
rocky cola counsel wrote to golden eagle on march,challenging its refusal to defend.counsel pointed out that bollman claim for defamation fell within the scope of the policy personal injury coverage,and that vitolo alleged defamatory statement that bollman was a sexually promiscuous and calculating bitch was not an practice within the meaning of the exclusion.counsel cited case precedent supporting a narrow interpretation of the practices exclusion,and pointed out that since applicability of the exclusion was doubtful at best,the potential for coverage required golden eagle to defend.
golden eagle reconsidered its position and on april,agreed to defend rocky cola café,curry and henderson under a reservation of rights golden eagle declined to defend or indemnify vitolo on several grounds,including that he was not an insured because his conduct fell outside the scope of his employment for rocky cola café.in december,the bollman suit was concluded with a judgment against bollman and in favor of rocky cola café and all the other defendants.
this lawsuit 
meanwhile,on june,while the bollman suit was still pending,golden eagle filed a complaint for declaratory relief.golden eagle sought a declaration that it had no duty to defend rocky cola,curry or henderson in the bollman action,and sought reimbursement of attorneys fees and costs paid in defense of that lawsuit.
both rocky cola and golden eagle filed motions for summary judgment.the trial court concluded that bollman complaint alleged facts within the coverage of golden eagle policy,and that the employment practices exclusion did not apply as a matter of law to eliminate golden eagle duty to defend.the court accordingly granted rocky cola motion for summary judgment and denied golden eagle motion for summary adjudication of issues.
discussion 
the controlling legal principles applicable to an insurer duties under standard commercial general liability insurance policies are.the policies,including the policy at issue,provide that the insurer has a duty to indemnify the insured for sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages for any covered claim.buss superior court cal th,d.the policies likewise provide that the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in any action brought against the insured seeking damages for any covered claim.id.at,d.the duty to indemnify runs to claims that are actually covered,in light of the facts proved.id.at,d.the duty to defend,however,is broader than the duty to indemnify.the duty to defend runs to claims that are merely potentially covered,in light of facts alleged or otherwise disclosed.ibid.in a mixed action,where some claims are potentially covered and others are not,the insurer has a duty imposed by law to defend the action in its entirety,because t o defend meaningfully,the insurer must defend immediately,and t o defend immediately,it must defend entirely.id.at,d.
golden eagle admits certain aspects of bollman defamation claim fall within the coverage of the policy indeed,golden eagle points out that the policy covers damages caused by a defamatory statement arising out of rocky cola business,and that bollman claim was based on a supervisor defamatory statements regarding an employee.golden eagle argues,however,that the same facts which place the claim within the insuring,that bollman injury was caused by an offense arising out of rocky cola business also trigger the operation of the acts exclusion.on this point golden eagle is mistaken 
the exclusion in question provides that the insurance does not apply to personal injury to a person arising out of any e practices,policies,acts or omissions,such as coercion,demotion,evaluation,reassignment,discipline,defamation,harassment,humiliation or discrimination directed at that person however,the fact that the defamatory statement in question aris es out of rocky cola business does not necessarily mean it is an act within the meaning of the exclusion.see state farm mut.auto.ins.partridge cal d,w hereas coverage clauses are interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured citations,exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer.indeed,it is difficult to see how vitolo alleged statement that bollman was a sexually promiscuous and calculating bitch is employment related.legal precedents,including the cases cited by golden eagle,confirm that the practices exclusion is not interpreted so broadly.
the applicable principle was enunciated in frank and freedus allstate ins.th,d.in that case,which involved an practices exclusion similar to this one,a former employee of frank and freedus sued the law firm,alleging it improperly terminated him because he was gay and had tested positive for hiv.the suit also included a cause of action for defamation based on statements made by a partner after the employee had been fired.the partner,in response to concerns expressed by the office administrator about staff morale after the termination,said the was likely gay and probably has aids.the partner then instructed the office administrator to inform the staff that the real reason the employee was fired was failure to perform and develop as an associate.th at,d.the employee alleged the italicized language defamed him.allstate refused to defend,asserting that coverage for personal injuries due to termination of employment or practices was excluded.
the court in frank and freedus affirmed the trial court conclusion that allstate had no duty to defend,rejecting the contention that the exclusionary specifically the term was ambiguous.the court said the term is used in its ordinary sense,related to employment,and that it modifies the specified acts including defamation as well as the terms practices,policies,acts or omissions.th at,d.the court continued 
the defamation here was clearly.the statement was made in the context of the employee employment and its content is directed to the employee performance during employment.thus,the defamation falls within subdivision termination of employment of the exclusion.the defamation is also encompassed within subdivision of the exclusion,a personal injury defamation arising out of termination of employment the statement was made in the context of and related to the employee termination of employment.id.at,d.
accordingly,to fall within the scope of the practices exclusion,a defamatory statement must,at a minimum,be made in the context of the person employment.see also loyola marymount university hartford accident indemnity d.defamation claims occurring as part and parcel of allegedly wrongful termination of the plaintiffs employment plainly were directly related to their employment and clearly within the language of an exclusion for personal injury sustained as a result of an offense directly or indirectly related to the employment of the person by the insured.
the point was confirmed in hs services,nationwide mutual ins.cir.the court,applying california law,concluded the practices exclusion in the policy did not apply because the defamatory statements were not made in the context of the underlying plaintiff employment 
in hs services,the plaintiff in the underlying suit,steven cade,was fired as president of company,and sued for wrongful termination.the company learned that cade had told vendors that the company was a candidate for bankruptcy.to counteract cade statements in the marketplace,circulated a memo informing its sales representatives to respond to inquiries with a statement saying that the company was financially sound and cade was terminated for acts involving dishonesty.cade then amended his wrongful termination complaint to include a defamation claim based on those statements.insurer refused to defend and denied coverage.the insurer argued the policy practices exclusion excluded cade defamation claim from coverage because it arose out of the employment relationship.the trial court granted summary judgment to the insurer,but the ninth circuit reversed.
the court held that the defamation was not clearly because although its content is directed to cade employment,the statements were not made in the context of cade employment.at.while it may be literally true that the remarks related to cade employment,that relationship was too indirect and attenuated to qualify under the exclusion.ibid.the court held that for an act or omission to be,the relationship must be direct and proximate this limitation of the exclusion is consistent with the context required by frank and freedus,and the part and parcel requirement of loyola marymount.any broader interpretation of the exclusion would defeat the reasonable expectation of the insured.at.
we conclude that,as in hs services and unlike the statement in frank and freedus,the defamatory statement that bollman was a sexually promiscuous and calculating bitch was not made in the context of bollman employment.nor was the content of the remark directed to her performance during employment or to anything else relating to her employment the alleged defamation was therefore outside the scope of the exclusion,and was potentially covered by the policy the trial court therefore correctly concluded golden eagle had a duty to defend against bollman suit,and properly granted summary judgment in favor of rocky cola café,curry and henderson.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.rocky cola café is to recover its costs on appeal.
golden eagle letter to rocky cola counsel stated that damages for sexual harassment,unlawful employment practices,intentional infliction of emotional distress,wrongful termination of employment,and negligent hiring and supervision were not covered by the policy.golden eagle also reserved its rights with regard to cause of action number,defamation of character.the letter further stated that golden eagle insurance corporation reserves its full rights to be reimbursed an allocation of attorney fees and expenses in this action for causes of action that are not potentially covered under the policy.these causes of action are as follows sexual harassment unlawful employment practices intentional infliction of emotional distress defamation of character wrongful termination of employment and negligent hiring and supervision.counsel is required to keep detailed records allocating time between potentially covered and claims.golden eagle also reserved the right to later seek reimbursement of defense costs in circumstances when no duty to defend exists or indemnity payments it makes on behalf of rocky cola café,wally curry,or angela henderson should it later be determined that the above claims in this litigation are excluded from coverage.
the duty to defend arises when a tender is made and is discharged when the action is concluded.the duty may be extinguished earlier,if it is shown that no claim can in fact be covered,but it is extinguished only prospectively and not retroactively.buss superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
in a mixed action,the insurer may not seek reimbursement from the insured for defense costs of those claims that are at least potentially covered,unless the policy itself,or a separate contract supported by separate consideration,provides for reimbursement.the insurer may,however,seek reimbursement from the insured for defense costs of claims that are not even potentially covered by the policy.buss superior court,supra,cal th at,d.reimbursement may be obtained only for defense costs that can be allocated solely to the claims that are not even potentially covered.id.at,d.
the insuring agreement,as to personal injury liability,provides as follows we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for personal injury to which this insurance does not apply.we may,at our discretion,investigate any occurrence or offense and settle any claim or suit that may result.the insurance applies to personal injury caused by an offense arising out of your business,excluding advertising,publishing,broadcasting or telecasting done by or for you but only if the offense was committed in the coverage territory during the policy period.personal injury is defined to mean injury,other than bodily injury,arising out of one or more of the following offenses oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services or oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy.
rocky cola also contends that bollman complaint alleged she was touched and physically abused,and therefore sufficiently asserted claims within the policy coverage for bodily injury.the insurer coverage for bodily injury liability was also subject to an exclusion for bodily injury arising out of practices and acts,including harassment.in light of our conclusion that golden eagle had a duty to defend the lawsuit because of the potential for coverage of the defamation claim,we need not consider whether there was any duty to defend under the bodily injury coverage.
the full text of the exclusion is as follows this insurance does not apply to personal injury to a person ar
