introduction 
this case asks us to determine the contractual obligations of an excess insurer that has notice of competing claims that may exceed the policy limits of the excess insurance coverage.in that situation,the question is whether the excess insurer may pay full benefits to the first insured who has exhausted the limits of the primary insurance coverage,or whether the insurer has a duty to protect the interests of the other insured who has not exhausted the primary insurance and is not yet entitled to claim excess insurance benefits.
we conclude that an excess insurer,with notice of potentially competing claims that exceed policy limits,has an obligation to treat both insureds fairly.that obligation encompasses the duty to refrain from favoring one insured over the other and from impairing either insured right to benefits.evidence that the excess insurer paid full benefits to one insured with knowledge of the other insured competing claim to the same pool of funds may establish a breach of that duty,precluding summary judgment for the insurer.
background and procedural history 
in july,appellants andrew schwartz and amy schwartz,together with elliot and linda weinstein,were riding in the schwartzes limousine when it collided with a vehicle driven by an uninsured motorist.both andrew schwartz and elliot weinstein were injured in the collision.
the schwartzes had two insurance policies containing uninsured motorist coverage.the first was a primary policy with united services automobile association usaa providing uninsured motorist coverage limits of per person and per accident.the second was an umbrella policy with respondent state farm fire and casualty company providing excess uninsured motorist coverage limits of.both policies extended coverage to the weinsteins as passengers in the schwartz vehicle.the state farm excess policy applied only when there is payment by your underlying coverage.
both the schwartzes and the weinsteins submitted claims under the uninsured motorist provisions of both policies.the schwartzes made a demand for arbitration on both carriers in june.state farm participated in discovery and attended every deposition.the weinsteins agreed to arbitrate their claims before retired superior court judge james kolts,and the schwartzes agreed to arbitrate their claims before a different arbitrator.
the weinsteins obtained full payment of insurance benefits from the primary insurer,usaa,on april.when advised that usaa had paid its policy limits to the weinsteins,the schwartzes counsel wrote his counterpart for state farm in may and june reminding state farm that his clients had already made policy limits demands on both carriers,and stating his belief that state farm must either reserve funds to fully compensate the schwartzes up to policy limits or interplead that amount to permit division of funds between the competing claimants.
the weinsteins and state farm arbitrated the value of the weinsteins claim in august and september arbitrator kolts awarded the weinsteins on september.state farm paid the full amount in october.the schwartzes counsel states that the first notice his office received about state farm conducting the arbitration and award to the weinsteins was after state farm paid it.
on december,usaa paid the schwartzes the policy limits on their primary policy.on january,the schwartzes provided state farm with documentation that usaa had exhausted its policy limits in making partial payment to the schwartzes.three weeks later,state farm paid the schwartzes the amount remaining under the excess policy.
the schwartzes sued,alleging that before arbitrating the weinsteins claim and paying the arbitration award,state farm knew to a reasonable degree of certainty that the combined claims of the schwartzes and weinsteins would exceed the available limits under both primary and excess policies.state farm nevertheless took no steps to reserve a proportionate share of the excess policy benefits in anticipation of the schwartzes claim or to advise them before disbursing benefits to the weinsteins.the schwartzes asserted this conduct constituted a breach of the insurance contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress,and sought a declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the policy,general and special damages,attorney fees and punitive damages.
state farm moved for summary judgment.state farm argued that its duty to pay the weinsteins arose before its duty to pay the schwartzes that it had no duty to interplead and no valid basis for interpleading funds available under the policy and that it did not withhold any benefits due,which is a necessary element of a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the trial court granted summary adjudication to state farm on all causes of action,concluding that state farm properly paid out policy limits as claims became payable and had no other contractual obligations to its insured.it ruled that state farm knowledge that the schwartzes claim might exceed policy limits was irrelevant because state farm had no obligation to the schwartzes until their primary insurance was exhausted.the court also observed that the schwartzes were aware that the state farm policy could be depleted by the weinsteins claim,yet failed to file suit against state farm for apportionment of the policy limits or other declaratory relief.
this appeal was timely filed after entry of judgment.
discussion 
the question whether an excess insurer has any duty to its insured before its obligation to cover the insured claim actually matures implicates several legal principles.the first is the fundamental principle of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in every insurance contract that neither party will do anything to injure the other right to receive benefits under the agreement.gruenberg aetna ins.cal d.the second is the principle,stated in numerous cases,that breach of that covenant can not occur if no benefits are due under the policy.love fire ins.exchange d.the third is that no benefits are due under an excess policy unless and until the underlying primary coverage is exhausted.see phoenix ins.united states fire ins.d.generally an excess liability insurer has no duty to participate in insured defense or contribute to a settlement on its behalf until primary coverages are exhausted.
from these principles and the cases establishing them,we conclude in summary that 
an excess insurer implied covenant not to injure an insured right to receive the benefits of the insurance contract exists from the inception of the agreement with the insured,and an excess insurer has the same obligation as a primary insurer to refrain from favoring the interests of one insured over the other,so long as a potential for coverage under the insurance contract exists.
the legal principle that a breach of the implied covenant can not occur unless policy benefits are due refers to whether the policy will eventually cover the claim,and does not depend on when such coverage finally attaches.
therefore,payment of full benefits to one insured,with knowledge of the other insured competing claim to the same limited pool of insurance funds,may breach the insurer implied covenant not to impair its other insured right to receive benefits under the contract,and summary judgment for state farm was inappropriate.
because an excess insurer implied covenant not to frustrate its insured right to receive the benefits of the insurance contract exists from the inception of the agreement,the trial court erred in concluding state farm had no duty to the schwartzes until their primary insurance was exhausted.
the schwartzes brought claims for breach of the insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that inheres in every contract.the same conduct by state farm was alleged in support of both claims that state farm paid full benefits to the weinsteins without regard for the interests of its other insured,the schwartzes,in the same pool of benefits.as a result,the schwartzes did not receive the benefits to which they were entitled under the policy 
the trial court concluded that state farm complied with all of its contractual obligations as they arose,and had no duty to the schwartzes until they exhausted their primary insurance,including no obligation to ensure an equitable distribution of funds to its insureds.we disagree with this conclusion,because an excess insurer duty not to impair its insured right to benefits under the contract exists throughout the contractual relationship.
it has long been settled that an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing exists in every insurance contract that neither party will do anything to injure the right of the other to receive benefits under the agreement.comunale traders general ins.cal d.that covenant is implied as a supplement to the express contractual covenants,to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct that frustrates the other party rights to the benefits of the agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the precise nature and extent of the duty imposed by the implied promise will depend on the contractual purposes.egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d.and,to fulfill its obligation not to impair the insured right to receive the benefits of the agreement,the insurer must give at least as much consideration to the insured interests as it does to its own.id.at.
we conclude that the duty applies to an excess insurer,just as it does to a primary insurer.we reject the notion that,simply because a condition precedent to a particular obligation to not yet occurred,the insurer is relieved from the implied covenants that inhere in every contract.state farm and the schwartzes had an insurance contract for which the schwartzes paid premiums,and state farm necessarily had contractual obligations to them,albeit contingent on future events,from the moment the parties entered into the contract the implied duty not to impair the insured right to benefits arises from the contractual relationship existing between the parties,and indeed is unconditional and independent of the performance of the insured contractual obligations.gruenberg aetna ins,supra,cal d.the schwartzes had a reasonable expectation that if their injuries exceeded the limits of their primary policy,coverage would be provided under their excess policy.state farm plainly had an contractual obligation to the well as to the to injure their right to receive benefits under the agreement 
b.an insurer who favors the interests of one insured over those of the other violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the duty imposed by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing includes the duty not to favor the interest of one of its insureds over the interests of the other.that duty has been clearly stated in the context of third party liability insurance for example,in shell oil national union fire ins.th,d,the court held that a liability insurer payment of the entire million policy limits on behalf of one coinsured did not discharge its obligation to the other insured,but rather constituted an actionable breach of those duties.similarly,in strauss farmers ins.exchange th,d,the court held that the insurer had no duty to accept a settlement offer exhausting the policy in exchange for the release of only one of its three insureds.the court said that the insurer duty extended to all of its insureds,and that acceptance of a settlement offer leaving two of them bereft of coverage would have breached the insurer implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at,d see also lehto allstate ins.th,d insurer owes duty of good faith and fair dealing to each of its insureds,and can not favor the interests of one insured over the other.
we see no reason why the obligation of an insurer not to favor the interests of one insured over the other should not apply to excess insurers.state farm argues that shell oil and strauss are inapposite,because the insurers in those cases had concurrent obligations to protect more than one insured against liability to a claimant,whereas,in contrast,state farm had no current obligation to the schwartzes when it paid the weinsteins.for the reasons already stated,we disagree.state farm clearly had no duty to pay the schwartzes at the time it paid the weinsteins,because the primary usaa policy was not exhausted.however,it does not follow that state farm had no duty to treat the schwartzes fairly.the schwartzes had already made a demand under the policy.indeed,they were required by the terms of the excess policy to notify state farm promptly if something happens that might involve this policy.
in short,state farm was placed on notice of the schwartzes potential interest in the benefits of their excess policy.the insurer duty not to favor the interests of one insured over the other necessarily applies to require an excess insurer to consider the interests of all of its its named the limited policy proceeds,whether or not that interest has matured to the point of requiring payment.to conclude otherwise would require insureds to engage in a race to exhaust the available primary insurance,with no right to information from the excess insurer about the amount or status of the competing claim,and with no control over actions of the primary insurer.that would be entirely contrary to the insurer obligation to give at least as much consideration to the insured interests as it does to its own.egan mutual of omaha ins,supra,cal d.
c.there is no merit to state farm argument that no breach of the implied covenant can occur if there is no breach of an express contractual provision.
state farm argues that since it had no express contractual duty to the schwartzes when it paid the weinsteins,it necessarily could have no duty under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,since no breach of the covenant can occur in the absence of a breach of the contract.that argument is specious.it is that a breach of the implied covenant of good faith is a breach of the contract careau security pac.business credit,supra,d at,and that breach of a specific provision of the contract is not a necessary prerequisite to a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,d,commercial lease case dealing with covenant of good faith in traditional contract sense and not as a tort see comunale traders general ins,supra,cal d,implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing requires the insurer to settle in an appropriate case although the express terms of the policy do not impose such a duty.similarly,even an insurer that pays the full limits of its policy may be liable for breach of the implied covenant,if improper claims handling causes detriment to the insured.fleming safeco ins.d.
d.the principle that no breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can occur if no benefits are due under the policy applies only when no potential for coverage exists under the policy.
as state farm points out,cases say there can be no breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing if no benefits are due under the policy.those cases,however,show that the principle has been applied only when there is no coverage,and no potential coverage,under the policy.
in bernstein consolidated american ins.th,d summary adjudication was upheld because a prerequisite to an actionable breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is the denial of benefits due under the policy citing cases but that holding was premised on the conclusion that there was no potential for coverage under the bernsteins insurance policy.consequently,the insurer owed no duty to defend its insured and did not breach the insurance contract by refusing to do so.th at,d.a similar conclusion may be drawn from the cases cited by bernstein.in love fire ins.exchange,supra,d,the court held that to establish a breach of the implied covenant,benefits due under the policy must have been withheld and the reason for withholding benefits must have been unreasonable or without proper cause.but in love,no benefits were due because the loves claim to benefits was.id.at.
