fulbright mcneill,fmi appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of phl variable insurance company phl.fmi was the beneficiary of a life insurance policy issued by phl to keith mcneill.after mcneill death,phl sued fmi seeking rescission and cancellation of the policy,arguing that mcneill misrepresented the state of his health when he applied for insurance.the district court found that mcneill made a material misrepresentation and granted summary judgment in favor of phl.we affirm.
background 
in february,after an annual physical exam,mcneill personal physician pronounced mcneill healthy.on february,mcneill completed and signed an application for life insurance from phl.the beneficiary of the policy was fmi,a rubber product manufacturing company located in wynne,arkansas in which mcneill owned a interest.the dispute arises from the interpretation of two relevant policy clauses.first,under the heading limits on our rights to contest this policy,the policy stated 
we rely on all statements made by or for the insured in the written application or in any supplemental application for reinstatement.these statements are considered to be representations and not warranties.we can contest the validity of this policy for any material representation of fact.however,the misrepresentation must be contained in the written application and a copy of the application must be attached to this policy when issued.
second,policy modifications had to be approved by phl.according to the policy terms,a ny change in the provisions of this policy must be signed by one of phl executive officers to be in effect.
on march,mcneill underwent a paramedic examination and completed and signed part ii of the phl life insurance policy application.based on the examination,the paramedic examiner also considered mcneill to be in good health and without heart problems.phl relied upon the information and answers to the questions in part ii of the application in issuing the mcneill policy.
on april,mcneill voluntarily submitted to a coronary test with a different physician.this test revealed mcneill total coronary artery calcium score to be,placing him at a likelihood of having a heart attack and a high risk of cardiovascular disease.mcneill was personally contacted by the doctor and informed of the results of his testing.also,the hospital sent a letter with the results to mcneill on april.
on or shortly after june,phl printed and issued the mcneill policy with an issue date of june.on july,the policy was delivered to mcneill.craig campbell,phl insurance agent,told mcneill that he need not read the acceptance form because the form merely confirmed delivery of the policy.campbell,however,was wrong.the policy acceptance form actually contained an express affirmation that mcneill representations regarding his health condition remained unchanged since he completed part ii of the application.the form also acknowledged that the policy acceptance had been incorporated into the policy application and the insurance contract.mcneill signed the acceptance form but did not disclose to phl the results of the coronary test,which showed his high risk for cardiovascular disease.
mcneill died of a heart attack in january.fmi filed a claim with phl for payment of the death benefits under the mcneill policy.after reviewing the claim,phl refused to pay on the ground that mcneill had made a misrepresentation in his application for the insurance by not disclosing the results of his cardiac tests taken after submission of the insurance application.
phl filed this declaratory judgment action seeking rescission and cancellation of the policy.following discovery,both phl and fmi filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to phl concluding that mcneill misrepresented a material fact in his application for insurance that prohibited recovery under the policy.
ii.discussion 
fmi appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of phl and argues that there was no material misrepresentation in the policy application.first,fmi argues that mcneill had no duty,either by operation of arkansas law or under the language of the policy,to inform phl of the results of his second medical examination therefore,his failure to do so can not be a basis to deny fmi benefits.second,fmi asserts three reasons why phl can not rely on mcneill statements in the policy application to avoid paying fmi claim for benefits.these include mcneill signature was procured by fraud the acceptance form is not a part of the policy application as it was not properly incorporated under the terms of the contract and the application was not attached to the policy when it was issued.upon review,we conclude that mcneill had a duty to inform phl of the substantial change in his health condition assessment that occurred after he completed the march application.furthermore,we hold that mcneill failure to inform phl of the results of the new coronary test resulted in a material misrepresentation of fact in the written application at the time the policy was issued therefore,the district court properly granted phl motion for summary judgment.

under arkansas law,when interpreting the language of an insurance policy,provisions contained in a policy of insurance must be construed most strongly against the insurance company which prepared it,and if a reasonable construction may be given to the contract which would justify recovery,it would be the duty of the court to do so.fidelity guar.continental cas.
the policy issued to mcneill authorizes phl to contest the validity of this policy for any material representation of fact as long as it is contained in the written application.it is undisputed that mcneill did not inform phl of the substantial change in the assessment of his heart condition.nor is it disputed that phl willingness to insure mcneill life relied on medical opinion that mcneill had no heart condition.mcneill failure to inform phl of the results of his april heart exam constituted a material representation in the policy application and is a sufficient ground on which to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
