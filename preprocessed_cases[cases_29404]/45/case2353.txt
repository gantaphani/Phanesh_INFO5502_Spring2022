baccouche lawsuit 
on january,baccouche filed a verified complaint alleging causes of action for trespass to real property and trees,abatement of private nuisance,declaratory relief,and for quiet title.the complaint alleged that baccouche and plaintiff owned adjacent parcels of land which were subject to a reciprocal roadway easement providing both parcels and another parcel not at issue here,belonging to another landowner access to the main public road.plaintiff erected a permanent fence over a portion of the roadway easement,which also intruded onto baccouche parcel.the fence enclosed a square foot portion of baccouche land,which included a grove of nine mature olive trees.the trees had full,substantial canopies that provided privacy,enhanced the value of baccouche property and defined the space,and provided environmental services as well.to baccouche surprise,shock,disgust and anger,his trees had been severely damaged by plaintiff presumably by her agents,servants,employees or independent contractors,whose actions in hacking,cutting and pruning the trees reduced them to a pitiable state.the complaint further alleged that plaintiff willfully and maliciously damaged nine mature olive trees on baccouche property by severely hacking cutting and pruning those trees so as to greatly reduce their canopies,foliage,limbs,without permission the severe damage to the trees greatly diminished the aesthetic and monetary value of those trees the complaint sought treble damages under civil code sections and.
baccouche later filed a first amended complaint,newly alleging a cause of action for negligent damage to his trees.the amended complaint included new allegations that plaintiff negligently cut and damaged baccouche olive trees by failing to ascertain that said trees were on baccouche property and that such cutting was in breach of the standard of care prescribed by any law or regulation that might be applicable to the trimming of trees for fire protection purposes in that the scope of the cutting and damaging of said trees far exceeded any legal requirements.plaintiff had a duty to refrain from cutting and damaging baccouche olive trees and in so cutting said trees,not to exceed any legal requirements for fire protection purposes.
a second amended complaint,with substantially similar allegations,was filed on august.
defendant investigation and denial of plaintiff claim 
in january,after plaintiff was served with baccouche complaint,she forwarded a copy of the complaint to defendant.on january,plaintiff provided a recorded statement concerning her claim to defendant.in the recorded statement,plaintiff asserted that the fence she erected was within her property line.plaintiff did not believe any of her fencing encompassed baccouche property.as to the trees at issue in baccouche complaint,plaintiff asserted that the trees were boundary trees and that the trunks of the trees essentially straddled the property line between baccouche and plaintiff properties.plaintiff told defendant that since she purchased her lot,she has been notified by the los angeles fire department to clear the area where the trees were located,as it was within feet of her residence.she trimmed these same trees year after year,and baccouche never told her not to,or that the trees belonged to him.plaintiff believed in good faith that the trees were hers,and that she was required to trim them.
on may,field claims manager kristin ferren denied plaintiff claim,asserting that the allegations in both the initial and first amended complaint do not meet the definition of occurrence resulting in bodily injury or property damage as defined by your policy.ferren based her determination on the allegations in the pleadings,plaintiff recorded statement,and the terms of the policy.ferren also concluded that plaintiff claim was barred by the exemption for intentional acts in the policy.notwithstanding defendant denial of coverage,ferren encouraged plaintiff to forward to defendant any pertinent information that might affect its coverage determination.
on september,plaintiff forwarded a copy of the second amended complaint to defendant,with an email that stated that the trees were on the boundary line between her property and baccouche property,and that i was noticed continually since purchasing the property in by the fire dept.to trim the trees annually per brush clearance requirements.because these trees are in essence mutually owned by both of us,it constitutes property covered under my policy.accordingly,defendant has an obligation under my policy of insurance to tender a defense on my behalf.baccouche entire complaint is false and outrageous the trespass claim is ridiculous in those boundary trees were enclosed by me,prior to any survey being done,based on a good faith belief that property encompassing the trees was mine no intentional tort will lie.the email also contended defendant decision to deny her claim was clea
