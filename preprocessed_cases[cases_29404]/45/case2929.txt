this is an action for declaratory relief and equitable contribution between insurance carriers for a common insured.after a bench trial the court determined that plaintiff scottsdale insurance company scottsdale properly paid to settle claims made against the mutual insured,james conrad construction,arising from the construction of a house purchased by robert opera and his wife sandra opera.the trial court required defendant essex insurance company essex to reimburse scottsdale in the amount of.essex appeals,arguing the trial court misapplied the law of equitable contribution and erroneously found the claim covered by its policy and gave scottsdale an excessive judgment.
background 
a.the house 
james conrad,a licensed architect and general contractor,built a large home in laguna beach.conrad financial partner in the project was robert boris.title to the property to be developed was held in boris name.the application for the building permit identified boris as the owner and conrad as the builder.boris was not involved with the physical construction of the home.the final inspection was completed in april.the operas purchased the house in october.the limited warranty provided for the house was signed by conrad and boris.
b.the problem 
within months of the purchase,water infiltration problems began and continued.in a sewage pump failed,spilling sewage in and under the house.at that time inspection of the house disclosed a large mold build up resulting from the continuing water leaks.the operas were advised to move out of the house pending clean up and repairs.concerned that their young son chronic asthma condition might be related to the mold,the operas moved out.nine months later after completion of repairs and clean up they moved back.
c.the reaction 
in august,robert opera,an attorney,made a written claim to conrad,citing the significant water damage to his home and the resulting health issues.conrad contacted his insurance agent who in turn referred the claim to alpine insurance company.alpine,like scottsdale and essex,insured conrad during the relevant period alpine hired consultants who thoroughly investigated the claim and the cost of repairs.in october,scottsdale and essex were given notice of the claim.scottsdale agreed to share in the cost of alpine investigation and obtained all the materials generated.
essex investigated its coverage obligations and denied the claim.
at first scottsdale also denied the claim but offered to settle the matter.scottsdale,however,reconsidered its decision and eventually settled with the operas for.
scottsdale action against essex 
essex provided conrad comprehensive general liability insurance from february,through march.scottsdale provided conrad that coverage from march,through april.
scottsdale sued essex,seeking declaratory relief and equitable contribution.essex defended,arguing the opera house was constructed as a joint venture between conrad and boris and the essex policy did not cover claims arising from such associations.essex also noted a provision of its contract with conrad making it a condition of coverage that he obtain both certificates of insurance from all subcontractors and hold harmless agreements from all subcontractors indemnifying him against all losses for work performed and that he be named an additional insured on all subcontractor general liability policies.
the trial court found the opera claim was covered under scottsdale policy and that its settlement was reasonable.as to essex policy the trial court found no credible evidence of a joint venture between conrad and boris.in any event the trial court,citing maryland casualty reeder d,found that the joint venture provision of the policy only excluded coverage if essex proved that form of doing business materially altered the insurer risk.the court noted essex undertook to insure conrad contracting business.the policy applied to injury or damage arising from such activity.the opera claim involved damage and injury resulting from claimed faulty construction by conrad.the fact that conrad and boris were involved in a joint venture did not materially alter essex risk and the joint venture exclusion could not be asserted as a basis for rejecting coverage.the court also found that the endorsement regarding subcontractors did not preclude coverage.specifically,the court found if the condition was enforced the policy was illusory,the condition was analogous to an escape clause and thus unenforceable,the condition was ambiguous,the condition conflicted with the other insurance clause in the policy,essex was not prejudiced by lack of compliance with the condition,the condition would violate the spirit of the policy since conrad obtained other insurance to cover the loss and the rights of the insurers were controlled by equitable principles and not contract language.
the court found that an allocation based on each carrier risk was proper.
discussion 
joint venture coverage 
essex notes that both its and scottsdale policy did not apply to injury or damage arising from any joint venture not designated in the policy as a named insured.essex argues the only reasonable conclusion based on the evidence is that the operas damages arose from a joint venture it was,therefore,not obligated to cover such damage and the trial court erred in requiring it make an equitable contribution to scottsdale settlement.scottsdale replies conrad and boris were not engaged in a joint venture.it argues in any event that the joint venture exclusion is inapplicable since whatever the business relationship between conrad and boris,it did not materially alter essex risk.
equitable contribution 
in the context of insurance law,the doctrine of equitable contribution may be simply stated.w here two or more insurers independently provide primary insurance on the same risk for which they are both liable for any loss to the same insured,the insurance carrier who pays the loss or defends a lawsuit against the insured is entitled to equitable contribution from the other insurer or insurers citation.american continental ins.american casualty th,d.
one of the firm principles undergirding the doctrine of equitable contribution is that two or more insurers share an obligation to the common insured.every california case of which we are aware has enforced an insurer contribution claim only where the other insurer was also obligated to pay on the claim.see,fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d and cases cited thereat american continental ins.american casualty th,d american continental california fire ins.exch.american states ins.th,d continental casualty zurich ins.cal d.on the other hand,where there is no common obligation that is legally due from multiple insurers,then no basis for contribution exists.see old republic ins.superior court th,d,disapproved on another ground in vandenberg superior court cal th,fn,d,loss paid by plaintiff insurer not covered under policy of defendant insurer great american west,safeco ins.d.loss payment was made to insured by plaintiff insurer more than four years after the expiration of the time limit in defendant insurer policy thus,any claim under defendant policy was unenforceable united pacific ins.hanover ins.d.even though paid by plaintiff insurer,the loss was not covered under any of the policies issued by the multiple insurers involved.american continental ins.american casualty,supra,th at,d.
joint venture 
there are three basic elements of a joint venture the members must have joint control over the venture even though they may delegate it,they must share the profits of the undertaking,and the members must each have an ownership interest in the enterprise.orosco sun diamond th,d.a joint venture may be formed by parol agreement or may be assumed as a reasonable deduction from the acts and declarations of the parties.ibid.
discussion 
scottsdale argues the trial court finding that the building of the opera house was not a joint venture of conrad and boris is not supported by substantial evidence.we agree.however,we conclude the trial court alternative finding correct that if conrad and boris were involved in a joint venture,it
