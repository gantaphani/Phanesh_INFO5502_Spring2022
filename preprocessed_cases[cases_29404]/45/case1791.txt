ii factual and procedural background 
du personal injury lawsuit against kim 
on june,joon hak kim was involved in an accident when his car collided with another vehicle.all four occupants of the second vehicle appellant yan fang du,li jie wang,wan hai feng,and shuo feng sustained injuries.kim insurance policy issued by appellee deerbrook had a liability limit of for each individual claim,with an aggregate maximum of for any one accident.
over the next several months deerbrook corresponded with a number of lawyers who in succession represented du.deerbrook attempted to obtain medical documentation from du and a statement from kim but was not successful.notwithstanding the lack of cooperation by du and kim in providing the documentation requested,deerbrook eventually evaluated the claim file on february.deerbrook was aware that there was a claim of serious injury by du and accepted kim liability.
no settlement demands or offers were made until june,when marc katzman,du lawyer,submitted a global demand for all four plaintiffs.for the first time,du documented her medical costs at.the demand also listed medical costs to wan hai feng at,shuo feng at,and li jie wang at.
anna harcharik,deerbrook adjuster,told katzman there was insufficient information about wan hai feng,shuo feng,and li jie wang and suggested settling du claim separately.katzman rejected the suggestion and indicated that deerbrook had to pay the full policy limit and settle all claims.in august,katzman rejected deerbrook settlement offer to du as too little too late.
on october,du filed a personal injury lawsuit against kim,and received a jury verdict of.deerbrook paid the available under kim liability coverage to partially satisfy the judgment.kim then assigned his bad faith claim to du in exchange for a covenant not to execute.
du claim against deerbrook 
in september,du,exercising the assignment of kim bad faith claim,filed suit against allstate insurance company and deerbrook,alleging that deerbrook breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing owed to kim.du alleged that deerbrook breached the implied covenant when deerbrook failed to affirmatively settle du claim within kim policy limits even after kim liability for a judgment in excess of the policy limits became clear on february.
at trial,du proposed the following jury instruction based on the judicial council of california civil jury instruction caci violation of insurance regulation or industry practice 
in determining whether deerbrook insurance company breached the obligation of good faith and fair dealing owed to kim,you may consider whether the defendant did not attempt in good faith to reach a prompt,fair,and equitable settlement of yan fang du claim after liability of its insured kim had become reasonably clear.
the presence or absence of this factor alone is not enough to determine whether deerbrook insurance company conduct breached the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.you must consider deerbrook insurance company conduct as a whole in making this determination.
the district court rejected this proposed jury instruction it concluded that an insurer has no duty to initiate settlement discussions in the absence of a settlement demand from the claimant.the district court also ruled that there was no factual foundation for the instruction,as the issue of settlement was broached at a sufficiently early time in the litigation that it vitiates any claim or effective claim insofar as a failure to initiate a settlement discussion.
at trial,the district court gave modified forms of caci and.both of these instructions made clear that breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing could be found only if deerbrook had failed to accept a reasonable settlement demand,not for failing affirmatively to effectuate a settlement 
likewise,the jury verdict form asked.did deerbrook unreasonably or without proper cause,fail to accept a reasonable settlement demand for an amount within policy limits the jury answered no.the district court then entered judgment in favor of deerbrook.
this timely appeal followed.

iv.discussion 
du appeal raises this central legal issue does an insurer have a duty,after liability of the insured has become reasonably clear,to attempt to effectuate a settlement in the absence of a demand from the claimant du contends that the district court erred when it refused her proposed instruction permitting such liability.
deerbrook counters that,under california law,an insurer does not have a duty proactively to extend a settlement offer of its own and that the duty of good faith is breached only if the insurer fails to accept a reasonable policy limits demand.deerbrook also argues that california law on the insurer duty to settle is at best unsettled,and thus deerbrook should not be held liable under the genuine dispute doctrine.finally,deerbrook argues that,even if an insurer had a duty proactively to attempt to settle,there was no evidentiary foundation for such an instruction in the instant case and that any error was harmless.
because the district court ruling below evidences potential confusion as to the scope of insurers duty to settle,we take this opportunity to address the issue.we hold that,under california law,an insurer has a duty to effectuate settlement where liability is reasonably clear,even in the absence of a settlement demand.however,in the context of this case,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding there was no evidentiary basis for du proposed jury instruction.
