hartford accident indemnity company and certain of its numerous affiliates collectively hartford appeal from two orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,judge,dated january,and march,respectively,granting in part and denying in part hartford motion to compel arbitration of claims against defendant appellee swiss reinsurance america corporation sra pursuant to the terms of a series of blanket casualty treaty reinsurance contracts between the parties and the federal arbitration act,et the faa see hartford accident indem.swiss reinsurance am,d.because we conclude that all of hartford claims fall within the scope of the applicable arbitration clauses and that sra has consented to consolidation of certain claims before a single arbitration panel,we hold that the district court should have compelled arbitration of all of hartford claims in the manner delineated below.
background 
hartford,an insurance company,commenced this action to compel arbitration of claims against sra,a reinsurance company.the claims arise out of a series of blanket casualty treaty contracts the blanket contracts covering the period through,under which sra agreed to reinsure hartford for certain liabilities.the liabilities at issue in the instant litigation concern sums paid by hartford to its various insureds for environmental pollution claims.
dispute resolution history 
after negotiations failed to resolve the parties dispute over whether and to what extent sra owed reimbursement to hartford,both sides demanded arbitration pursuant to mandatory arbitration clauses in each of the blanket contracts.hartford demanded arbitration to resolve the disputes over numerous unpaid claims by contrast,sra demanded arbitration of only one claim,which involved reimbursement to hartford for amounts paid to reichhold chemicals.hartford and sra refused to participate in the arbitration demanded by the other,and each party filed an action in the southern district of new york to compel arbitration under its own terms.the parties eventually settled that action pursuant to an agreement the agreement,which resolved certain claims and provided a framework for negotiations over an alternative dispute resolution procedure for resolving the pollution claims.the agreement also provided that if such negotiations were unsuccessful,then either party could demand arbitration in accordance with the written arbitration agreements contained in the blanket contracts.
in march,the parties exchanged renewed arbitration demands,but each refused again to participate in the arbitration demanded by the other.on september,the parties filed the instant civil actions below,which the district court consolidated.
in its action,hartford sought,inter alia,to compel arbitration of the following 
count a difference or dispute has arisen between the parties regarding the manner in which the blanket contracts respond to environmental claims.this difference or dispute is raised with respect to numerous environmental claims,including but not limited to the claims identified in counts and.
hartford will ask the panel to decide and declare whether an environmental claim that is allocated by hartford to two or more underlying hartford policy periods must be allocated and billed to the blanket contracts on the basis of one limit and retention per occurrence for each such underlying policy period,one limit and retention per occurrence for all such underlying policy periods,or on some other basis.
count hartford has presented to sra billings under the blanket contracts for payments in connection with environmental claims which sra has not paid,including but not limited to billings for payments made in connection with insureds hartford seeks to recover the sums it has billed sra on these claims,or such other amounts as are owed as a result of the arbitration panel decision on count.hartford specifically reserves the right to supplement the list of claims under this count and the amounts billed on these claims.
count as a result of hartford position on the difference or dispute identified in count,certain environmental claim payments it has made have not resulted in a billing to sra,including but not limited to payments made in connection with insureds to the extent the arbitration panel determination under count as to how environmental claims should be allocated to the blanket contracts results in such claims being billable to sra,hartford will seek payment on such claims in the arbitration.hartford specifically reserves the right to supplement the list of claims under this count.
hartford elaborated further that b ecause count potentially implicates many,if not all,environmental claims under the blanket contracts,hartford will seek a bifurcated proceeding in which count is resolved in the first phase of the arbitration and counts and are resolved in the second phase.
in its action,sra sought,inter alia,to compel arbitration of a claim hartford billed to sra concerning sums hartford had paid to reichhold chemical company the reichhold claim,a claim also falling within hartford count.
as noted by the district court,
t he central dispute underlying these lawsuits is over whether each of hartford pending claims for reimbursement by sra is subject to separate arbitration or whether the arbitration panel must first decide a calculation issue that hartford contends is common to all such claims,both pending and prospective.
hartford,d at.the allegedly common calculation issue concerns whether hartford may bill sra in a manner that corresponds to the way in which hartford paid the pollution claims of its insureds.apparently,hartford paid the pollution claims of its insureds by allocating the damage over multiple years because the injury or damage incurred by its insureds allegedly occurred over multiple policy years.according to hartford,sra has rejected hartford allocation of claims to multiple years and,instead,insisted that each claim be aggregated into a single year.because the reinsurance provided by sra is subject to deductibles called retentions and or limitations,the manner in which claims are billable and payable is critical.the parties also dispute whether hartford count is arbitrable under the governing documents because hartford has not yet billed and sra has not rejected the claims identified in count,which hartford asserts would be billable to and payable by sra if the blanket agreements are determined to provide for the aggregate billing method allegedly advanced by sra.
b.the arbitration provisions 
although numerous blanket contracts exist,the parties and the district court agree that the contracts contain very similar,and in many cases identical,arbitration provisions.see hartford,d at.each of these agreements contains one of the following provisions,or wording to the same effect 
i n the event of any difference arising between the contracting parties it shall be submitted to arbitration 
i f any dispute shall arise between hartford and sra with reference to the interpretation of this agreement or their rights with respect to any transaction involved,such dispute,upon the written request of either party,shall be submitted to arbitration 
the agreement provides,in relevant part,that either hartford or sra may submit disputed environmental reinsurance claims to arbitration in accordance with the written arbitration agreements contained in the blanket contracts.the agreement states further that t he parties expressly reserve their respective positions and rights with respect to all issues relating to environmental reinsurance claims that are not expressly addressed in this paragraph or elsewhere in this agreement.the agreement defines environmental reinsurance claims as all claims asserted by hartford against sra under the blanket contracts for loss,claim expenses,and declaratory judgment expenses arising from environmental claims paid by hartford.finally,in a paragraph entitled arbitration of disputes,the agreement provides that a ny and all disputes arising under this agreement shall be deemed to be disputes arising under the blanket contracts and shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provisions of the blanket contracts.
c.the proceedings below 
after consolidation of the two civil actions,the district court held that it could only compel arbitration of count of hartford demand which includes the reichhold claim 
the court need not resolve the parties competing arguments over the merit to arbitrating first the calculation dispute as set forth in hartford count because whatever abstract merit there might be to having the arbitrators make a global determination of the allegedly common calculation issue,this is not what sra agreed to when it entered into the blanket contracts and the settlement agreement.rather,the parties simply agreed that if a dispute arose with respect to a given pending claim,that particular dispute regarding that particular claim would be submitted to arbitration.
hartford,d at.in so holding,the district court acknowledged that some of the blanket contracts contain arbitration clauses that state in general terms that in the event of any difference arising between the contracting parties it shall be submitted to arbitration,but found that the potentially broad scope of these clauses was implicitly limited by the fact that sra obligation to make payment to hartford under any of these contracts is not triggered until hartford,having paid the underlying insured,bills sra for its claimed portion.id.
the court provided three reasons for its construction.first,the court believed that absent such billing and rejection,the arbitrators would be placed in the strange and difficult position of having to decide in the abstract a hypothetical dispute regarding some prospective claim that had not yet ripened and might never do exceedingly unlikely arrangement for the parties to agree to.id.second,the court interpreted the second type of arbitration clause to limit the scope of arbitration to individual transactions,billings rejected by sra.although the court did not explicitly state the basis for this construction,the court appears to have read the phrase with respect to any transaction to modify both the interpretation of this agreement and their rights.see id.third,the court found that any ambiguity in the arbitration provisions of the blanket contracts was resolved by the agreement,which the court construed to limit arbitration to claims actually billed.id.consequently,in the court view,none of the arbitration provisions contained the slightest suggestion that the parties have agreed to have the arbitrators decide abstract disputes without reference to an actual,specific claim or transaction.id.
consistent with its interpretation,the court 
denied arbitration of the global calculation issue allegedly common to all of its claims both pending and prospective against sra count one of hartford demand 
granted that portion of hartford demand as sought to compel arbitration of those claims actually billed to sra count two,as well as sra demand for arbitration of the reichhold chemical claim and 
denied arbitration of all aspects of certain prospective claims not yet billed to sra count three.
id.at footnote omitted.clarifying its initial order requiring that the arbitrations are to proceed before the panel,the court held that although the law did not require consolidated arbitration of the individual pollution claims constituting count,on the parties consent,the arbitration panel may consolidate as many pending claims as it chooses,provided that it does not thereupon undertake to decide any issues with reference to any other claims,pending or prospective,that are not before the panel.id.footnote omitted.
ii.discussion 
this appeal raises three issues.first,whether the blanket contracts and the agreement permit hartford to obtain an arbitral opinion as to the proper billing method for pollution claims count one.second,whether the blanket contracts and the agreement permit hartford to invoke arbitration for claims not yet billed to nor rejected by sra on the ground that such claims are payable under the billing method allegedly advanced by sra count three.third,whether the arbitration panel must proceed as originally ordered by the district court.
given the broad scope of the arbitration clauses,we hold that count billing method and count unbilled claims are arbitrable.furthermore,in light of sra consent to consolidation and resolution of multiple billed claims before a single arbitration panel,we order the count claims consolidated before the arbitration panel for a threshold determination of the billing method issue posed by count.we hold further that if such determination causes the unbilled claims contained in count to become billable,then the arbitration panel should proceed to determine the amounts due hartford under all pertinent claims,whether billed or unbilled.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a b,as this is an appeal from an order denying in part hartford motion to compel arbitration under the faa.we review de novo the district court determination of the arbitrability of hartford claims.see oldroyd elmira sav.bank,fsb,cir.
a.the differences or disputes between the parties 
in seeking to compel arbitration,hartford advanced three substantive counts billing calculation method claims billed under the calculation method and rejected by sra and claims hartford asserts would be billable to sra under the alternative aggregate calculation billing method.the district court found the first count to pose a hypothetical question that falls beyond the scope of the arbitration clauses the second count arbitrable and the third count to be unripe because it consists of claims that have neither been billed to nor rejected by sra.
on appeal hartford argues that count properly seeks a declaration by the arbitration panel as to an issue common to all pending and potential pollution claims and count represents claims properly billable to sra if the arbitration panel concludes that claims should be calculated according to the aggregate method.sra responds that count improperly seeks an advisory opinion that can not be rendered because the question turns not on general issues of contract interpretation but instead on complex facts and the application of the contract terms to those facts.with respect to count,sra contends simply that no difference or dispute exists because hartford has not yet billed,and therefore sra has not rejected,any claims encompassed within that count.we hold that the district court erred in holding that counts and do not constitute differences or disputes between the parties within the meaning of the arbitration clauses in the blanket contracts.
count does not constitute a hypothetical question.hartford asserts that as a matter of contract interpretation pollution claims are properly billable pursuant to its billing method.sra counters that the billing method for any particular claim is and,therefore,can not be resolved as a single question.sra further argues that count constitutes an impermissible request for an advisory opinion.clearly,a difference or dispute exists over the construction of the blanket contracts and their application to billed and unbilled pollution claims.the resolution of this difference or dispute,however,requires an analysis of the merits,which exceeds the scope of the district court jurisdiction.see at t,communications workers of,d i n deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular claim to arbitration,a court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.at its essence,sra a declaration is not possible because the billing method depends on the particularities of each an alternative construction of the blanket contracts,which may be raised as a defense before the arbitration panel.thus,count encompasses a difference or dispute between the parties concerning the billed and unbilled claims comprising counts and and potentially the continuing course of dealing between the parties under the blanket contracts.
count also constitutes a difference or dispute between the parties.although the unbilled claims comprising count have not been rejected by sra,collectively they represent a
