in this lawsuit,national union sought to recover the costs of defending the daer action as well as the it paid on behalf of costco to settle that lawsuit.national union,as subrogee of costco,sought recovery against yokohama based on an express indemnity provision in the supplier agreement between the two companies,as well as an alleged breach of yokohama contractual insurance obligations.in addition,it sued tokio marine for indemnity on its own behalf and as subrogee of costco and contribution on its own behalf.finally,national union sued tokio marine on a theory of equitable subrogation for their bad faith refusal to defend costco in the underlying lawsuit.the latter cause of action was dismissed on demurrer.
the trial court ruled in limine that national union proof of a tire defect would be limited to the opinions of the expert designated by daer in the underlying case.national union retained expert could not opine,based solely on the opinions of daer expert,that the tire contained a defect in design or manufacture which caused daer injuries.consequently,after national union made its opening statement in a bifurcated proceeding to determine whether a defect in the yokohama tire was a cause of daer accident,the trial court entered a judgment of nonsuit on national union express indemnity claim.having determined that the tire was not defective,the trial court granted summary adjudication as to the causes of action based on tokio marine refusal to defend costco in the daer action,as well as the claim that yokohama breached its insurance obligations under its supplier agreement with costco.the trial court then awarded yokohama in attorney fees as the prevailing party on the contractual indemnity claim.
national union challenges these rulings on appeal we conclude that the trial court erred in excluding relevant and material expert evidence on a matter properly subject to expert opinion.as a result of this evidentiary ruling,we reverse the judgment entered in favor of yokohama and tokio marine on the causes of action of the operative pleading.finally,we conclude that the trial court properly sustained tokio marine demurrer to a bad faith cause of action contained in an earlier pleading.consequently,we affirm the dismissal of the bad faith cause of action,but reverse the judgment,and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in,yokohama and costco predecessor in interest entered into a private label agreement the supplier agreement pursuant to which yokohama agreed to manufacture tires for distribution and sale by costco.among the provisions of the supplier agreement relevant to this lawsuit were the requirement that yokohama indemnify costco for defects in design,materials and workmanship of the tires manufactured and sold under the agreement,and that it maintain products liability insurance coverage naming costco as an additional insured during the term of the agreement.
pursuant to the terms of the supplier agreement,yokohama maintained products liability insurance with tokio marine the insurance policy,and secured a vendor endorsement which named costco as an additional insured under the insurance policy.
costco terminated yokohama as a vendor in by delivery of a formal termination letter and phase out schedule.costco ceased all purchases from yokohama in september.
jack daer purchased tires manufactured by yokohama for use on his ford explorer at an arizona costco store in.the costco store regularly serviced daer explorer,including the tires.in february,daer took the car to costco to be serviced.five weeks later,the left rear tire on the explorer failed,causing daer to lose control.the vehicle rolled over,and daer sustained quadriplegic injuries.
daer filed two lawsuits in arizona against yokohama,costco,ford motor,and others.the first suit was filed in federal court in may.it was abandoned and replaced two years later by a state court suit filed in march.
in the state court action,daer alleged a products liability claim against yokohama for tire defects,a derivative products liability claim against costco as seller of a defective tire,a negligence claim against costco for selling him the wrong size and type of tire for his vehicle,and another negligence claim based on costco servicing of the tire.as to the latter claim,daer alleged that costco failed to take an obviously distressed and worn tire out of service,and that the company failed to detect an existing screw puncture when it rotated and balanced daer tires five weeks and miles before the accident.
costco tendered defense of the daer action to yokohama.costco also tendered its defense to tokio marine,as an additional insured under the insurance policy.respondents did not accept these tenders.consequently,costco defended itself against all the allegations made in the daer lawsuits.
daer designated robert ochs as his tire defect expert at trial.ochs had opined in his reports and his deposition testimony that there were three defects in the tire evidence of porosity in the shoulder area of the tire which he claimed showed the presence of contaminants in the manufacturing process the presence of strings or cords in the tire carcass which he claimed were either a contaminant or a design defect and evidence of liner pattern marks which he claimed evidence insufficient adhesion in the tire elements.
in its defense,yokohama maintained that the tire was not defective.its position was that the tire had an unrepaired screw puncture and had been run underinflated for many miles causing it to overheat,and that these conditions caused the tire to fail.
daer also offered expert testimony from bill haggerty regarding the service store negligence of costco.haggerty opined that costco was negligent in the training of its tire technicians and in failing to inspect the tires on the daer vehicle that its negligent inspection failed to detect an unrepaired puncture and large bulge or bald area and that,based on the worn condition and treadwear,the tire clearly should have been replaced by costco in the service visit five weeks before the accident.
in the federal case,daer had at various times identified three different tire experts smith,carlson,and augier.reports produced by these experts identified multiple defects in the failed tire.however,these experts were apparently never deposed in the federal case,and were deposed in the state court case only regarding a spoliation claim.they were never designated in the state court case,and did not offer expert opinions in the depositions given in the state court case.daer identified ochs as his sole tire defect expert in the state court case.
as noted above,on the first day of trial,july,costco and yokohama each separately settled with daer.
national union filed this lawsuit on october,to recover the costs of defense of,and the settlement it paid in,the daer action.in its sixth amended complaint,the operative pleading,national union asserted the following causes of action for indemnity against tokio marine under the insurance policy,on its own behalf and as subrogee of costco for contribution against tokio marine under the insurance policy,on its own behalf for express contractual indemnity against yokohama under the indemnity provision of the supplier agreement,as subrogee of costco and for breach of contract against yokohama under the insurance provisions of the supplier agreement,as subrogee of costco 
in january,the trial court ordered bifurcation of the fourth cause of action,the contractual indemnity claim,finding that resolution of issues in that cause of action would resolve most,if not all,of the other claims in the case.in ordering bifurcation,the trial court stated the pound gorilla in this thing is what caused this incident,and as a result,i believe that defendants counsel argument,despite what i had said all along before,has persuaded me that we just going to have to bite the bullet and have a jury trial on that issue,the express indemnity issue.let decide that.because i do think any other way,and i looked through plaintiffs counsel stuff and i thought about it and i thought about what i said before and then how maybe some sort of a court trial would resolve matters,i do think it will.i think the only way we going to resolve this matter is to find out exactly what have a jury give us an answer as to what happened the tire and who responsible for that.so my ruling would be that we will sever the matter have a jury trial on the indemnity claim,express indemnity claim,which i guess is the fourth cause of action,on the date we had already set in may.
troy cottles,national union tire defect expert,was deposed in august.cottles testified that the yokohama tire contained eight discrete defects,all of which together caused the tire to fail.cottles theory of why the tire failed was thus substantially different from the theory proffered by ochs,daer tire expert.
the trial of the contractual indemnity claim commenced in september.that trial was further bifurcated into a bench trial phrase to determine the correct interpretation of the supplier agreement and the parties respective burdens of proof.the bench trial was to be followed by a jury trial to determine if the daer tire was defective,if costco was negligent,and the allocation of liability between costco and yokohama.
preliminary to the start of the bench trial,the parties filed motions in limine as to various evidentiary issues expected in both phases of the trial.in defense motions in limine and,yokohama sought to exclude testimony relating to certain theories of tire defect asserted by cottles,national union tire expert,which had not been raised in the underlying litigation.yokohama argued that because national union settled the daer case based on the evidence daer was prepared to present at trial,defect theories asserted by cottles which were not shared by daer expert were not relevant to national union indemnity claim.
the trial court agreed with yokohama position and ruled cottles new defect theories inadmissible.said the court look,the claim stops when the daer case settled.right there,indemnity is set.plaintiff is suing for.whatever there no doubt about that number.the number ca go up,ca go down.that the number.everything stopped at that point as far as i concerned factually,you have cases going all over the place because it all depends when these cases settled.but this one did indeed settle on the courthouse steps.so we know exactly pretty much what was going to be tried,and so in my opinion,i think that where we put an end to things.that the be all and end all of what the knowledge was.and,indeed,if you going to talk about the reasonableness of the settlement,i think national union would even agree that the time when you look at it from the standpoint of when the matter was settled,not after the fact.you could have learned all kinds of things after the fact so,no.it stops right then and there.i do believe that national union can cottles can come up with new theories that were raised by daer at the time of the settlement.
in response to the above ruling,national union counsel admitted that ochs theories were extremely weak,stating that on a scale of to,ochs theories were about a three.the trial court then further stated as follows had this been done in the normal course,went to trial,an answer would have been made,percentage of fault would have been determined,and your clients would have resolved it there at the trial.you did.sorry.but that kind of the end of it as far as i concerned.the fact that it now taken three,four,five years to resolve the issue is neither here nor there,quite frankly.i do think anybody should benefit by that,and if anybody charged with any problems as a result,i think they go to the party who brought this action.
in its closing trial brief,national union asserted that the indemnity provision of the supplier agreement required yokohama to indemnify costco for the latter negligence.national union also maintained that,because yokohama refused costco tender of its defense in the daer case,national union was entitled to a presumption that the tire was defective,and was therefore entitled to recover all of its settlement payments from yokohama.
on october,the trial court issued a statement of decision regarding the interpretation of the supplier agreement and the burden of proof issues.the court determined that yokohama indemnity obligation was only for liability for tire defects and it did not extend to costco negligence.the court also concluded that,under controlling law,national union had the burden of proving yokohama actual liability to daer and the allocation of liability as between the concurrent causes of daer harm.
on december,national union moved for reconsideration of the trial court september ruling excluding cottles new defect theories.the grounds for this motion were that daer federal court experts,who had not been designated as trial experts in either the daer action or this case,had shared some of cottles excluded theories.the trial court denied the motion,reiterating its belief that tire defect theories not asserted by daer were irrelevant to the claim to recoup the settlement payment because such theories could not have formed the basis for that settlement.
having secured the ruling that cottles could not offer tire defect theories other than those held by ochs,and based on cottles testimony that in his expert opinion all eight of the defects which he identified acted together to cause the tire to fail,yokohama moved in limine to exclude cottles from testifying.national union argued that daer earlier experts had offered the excluded defect theories upon which cottles relied,and were therefore present in the lawsuit at the time of the settlement.the court granted yokohama motion in limine.
in its opening statement,national union conceded that cottles could not testify that the two defects identified by ochs caused the tire to fail thus it failed to identify any evidence of tire defect.yokohama moved for nonsuit because tire defect liability was an element of the indemnity claim.the trial court granted nonsuit on the fourth cause of action for contractual indemnity under the supplier agreement.the court rejected national union effort to present additional evidence of a tire defect,concluding that its ruling on the nonsuit was law of the case,and that national union could not relitigate the issue.
the court entered judgment against national union on july.national union moved for a new trial,which motion was denied on october.national union timely filed its notice of appeal on november.
contentions 
in this appeal,national union assigns four errors to the trial court which it contends require reversal of the judgment the exclusion of the testimony of its tire expert,troy cottles the erroneous interpretation and application of the indemnity provisions of the supplier agreement the granting of respondents motions for nonsuit and summary adjudication,which were based on the court erroneous rulings on the burden of proof,the exclusion of cottles testimony and the failure to address tokio marine duty to defend and the sustaining of tokio marine demurrer to national union bad faith claim.we consider each contention in turn.
discussion 
exclusion of testimony of national union tire expert 
national union contends that the trial court erred in granting yokohama motions in limine disallowing cottles to opine on tire defects which daer expert,ochs,did not share.broadly speaking,an appellate court reviews any ruling by a tr
