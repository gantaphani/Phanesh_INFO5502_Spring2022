factual summary 
this case concerns whether universal had a duty to defend cunningham in an action brought by steven beus and his limited liability company collectively beus.beus complaint alleged the following 
in april,beus met with a real estate agent representing cunningham regarding potential sites for an isuzu dealership.the agent showed beus property owned by cunningham located on johnson avenue in el cajon the johnson property.the johnson property consisted of a front lot and a rear lot.the rear lot was improved with dilapidated and unsightly buildings.the front lot was improved with structures appropriate for use as an automobile dealership.cunningham real estate agent told beus that the tenant on the front lot,holland motor homes,would vacate the premises in late november or early december.
in september,beus and cunningham entered into a written lease agreement pertaining to the johnson property.although the agreement specifically provided that the january,lease commencement date was subject to holland vacating the premises,beus alleged that the true intent of the parties was that the lease commencement date could be made earlier,but not later,than january.
in reliance on representations that holland would be vacating the property no later than january,beus expended funds to open the dealership on that date,including entering into agreements with the local redevelopment agency,obtaining loans from isuzu,and paying for the demolition of the buildings on the rear lot.beus also ordered an inventory of new isuzu vehicles to be delivered to the new dealership.
while waiting to occupy the main portion of the lot,beus moved into the vacant back lot,and stored the new isuzu vehicles at this lot.on december,beus representatives attempted to take possession of the front portion of the lot.but holland representatives said that holland would not vacate the premises for another two weeks.in the succeeding six weeks,beus made numerous demands for possession of the front portion of the johnson property,receiving in return a series of promises and representations from cunningham and others that holland would vacate the premises by certain dates.meanwhile,beus attempted to operate out of a damp,tin building remaining on the rear lot portion of the premises with no phones,no electricity,and no plumbing.because of its inability to move into the front lot,beus was unable to obtain a sales license from the department of motor vehicles,and thus was unable to generate any revenue.
six weeks later,on february,holland finally vacated the johnson property,and cunningham delivered full possession of the premises to beus.during the next year,beus remained in possession of the property and operated the dealership.
in february,approximately one year after opening the dealership,beus was forced to close the doors of the business and move out of the property.beus then sued cunningham and several others,alleging that cunningham late delivery of the premises caused the dealership to fail to be profitable.beus claimed the late delivery caused substantial additional losses,including the inability to take full advantage of the dealership incentive programs,interest charges on the new vehicle credit line,six weeks in salary paid to employees who could not productively perform their services,lease payments on the computer system,and loss of good will,new and used car sales,and working capital.beus asserted five substantive causes of action breach of contract intentional misrepresentation negligent misrepresentation intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and intentional interference with contractual relations.
cunningham tendered the defense to universal,which denied the tender.cunningham eventually settled the action with beus for.cunningham then brought an action against universal,alleging that universal had a duty to defend because there was potential coverage under the policy personal injury wrongful eviction coverage and property damage coverage.both parties filed summary judgment motions.the trial court entered judgment in cunningham favor,determining there was a potential for coverage under the personal injury provision of universal insurance policy,and universal was thus responsible for reflecting cunningham underlying defense costs and reflecting the underlying settlement amount.
discussion 
generally applicable legal principles 
a party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.in a duty to defend case,an insurer moving for summary judgment must establish the absence of any potential for coverage,that the underlying complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose.in contrast,to prevail on its summary judgment motion,the insured need only show the existence of a potential for coverage,that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage.ibid.
although the insurer burden in moving for summary judgment is greater than the insured burden in bringing its own affirmative motion,this disparity merely reflects the substantive law.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.a n insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.citations.this duty,which applies even to claims that are groundless,false,or fraudulent,is separate from and broader than the insurer duty to indemnify.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.t he determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.ibid.but w hether a particular claim falls within the coverage afforded by a liability policy is not affected by the form of the legal proceeding or the legal theory asserted by the injured party.vandenberg superior court cal th,d.the scope of the duty does not depend on the labels given to the causes of action in the third party complaint instead it rests on whether the alleged facts or known extrinsic facts reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.see hurley construction state farm fire casualty th,d.in determining the existence of a duty to defend on a summary judgment motion,we conduct a de novo review.lomes hartford financial services group,th,d.
ii.universal summary judgment motion 
in moving for summary judgment,universal argued the undisputed facts established there was no potential for coverage under the two types of coverage relied upon by cunningham personal injury coverage and property damage coverage.with respect to each type of coverage,we begin by examining the language of the insurance policy,and then we determine whether the allegations of beus complaint and any relevant extrinsic evidence show a potential for coverage under the relevant policy provisions.
personal injury coverage 
the personal injury coverage under cunningham policy states that universal will pay all sums that cunningham is required to pay as damages because of injury.the policy defines injury to include false arrest,false imprisonment,wrongful eviction,wrongful detention,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,defamation of character,private nuisance except pollution,and invasion of rights of privacy or possession of personal property.italics added.as with most forms of personal injury liability insurance,the coverage does not require an accidental occurrence,and instead is triggered by one of the offenses listed in the policy.citation.although the offenses enumerated in a policy are construed broadly when they are defined in generic terms,they encompass specific torts which reasonably could fall within the general category.citation.zelda,northland ins.th,d fibreboard hartford accident indemnity th,d.
tendering the defense of the beus action,cunningham claimed it was potentially covered under the wrongful eviction category of personal injury.in its summary judgment motion,universal argued that wrongful eviction presupposes the injured party was removed or ousted from real property,and there was nothing in beus complaint or the extrinsic facts to show a removal or ouster allegedly occurred in this case.cunningham countered that a wrongful eviction claim within the meaning of the policy includes not only a removal from real property but also encompasses other forms of interference with a party present or future right to use the property.the trial court adopted this definition.
in resolving these conflicting interpretations of the phrase wrongful eviction,we apply settled rules of insurance policy construction.as with any contract,the goal of insurance policy interpretation is to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.safeco ins.robert cal th,d.in so doing,we must look first to the language of the insurance policy in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.if the policy provision is unambiguous,has only one reasonable construction,it must be interpreted according to this plain meaning.ray valley forge ins.th,d.but if a policy provision is ambiguous,the ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds favor,consistent with the insureds reasonable expectations.safeco ins.robert,supra,cal th at,d.
under these principles,we look first at the plain meaning of a wrongful eviction.the term evict means t o expel by legal process put out t o force out eject dispossess t o recover property,for example by a superior claim or legal process.am.heritage dict.new college ed.these dictionary definitions comport with the commonly understood meaning of the eviction requires that a person first be in actual possession of real property,and then be removed from that property.see zelda,northland ins,supra,th at,d an eviction,popularly understood,is necessarily from somewhere.the legal definition of an eviction is the same an eviction is t he act or process of legally dispossessing a person of land or rental property.black law dict.ed.a wrongful eviction thus occurs when the person recovering the property had no right to dispossess the other party from the property.
applying this plain meaning of the policy language,beus claims against cunningham do not reasonably fall within the category of a wrongful eviction.the undisputed facts show that beus claims against cunningham centered solely on beus inability to take possession of the front portion of the johnson property.there was nothing in the complaint or the extrinsic evidence supporting a claim or the possibility of a claim that cunningham removed or expelled beus from any portion of the property.on this record,there was no potential for personal injury coverage under cunningham policy.
cunningham arguments to the contrary are unavailing.
cunningham first argues that courts have expanded the phrase wrongful eviction beyond its commonly understood meaning to include any claims of disturbance with the tenant potential right of possession.we agree that if an insurance policy term has been judicially construed,this construction should be read into the policy unless the parties express a contrary intent.see bartlome state farm fire casualty d.but the predicate of cunningham argument is missing.cunningham has not cited,and our independent research has not disclosed,any reported decision that has interpreted the language of the wrongful eviction provision in the policy before us to encompass claims for interference with future or existing property rights.
to show courts have interpreted the wrongful eviction phrase beyond its commonly understood meaning,cunningham relies on general accident ins.west american ins.th,d general accident.in that case,the underlying plaintiff managed an insurance agency and leased the premises occupied by the agency.id.at,d.after the partnership entities the insureds terminated his contract and ousted him from the premises,the plaintiff sued the insureds alleging wrongful termination,breach of contract,and tortious interference.id.at,d.the insureds tendered the claim under two insurance policies.id.at,d.the first policy provided coverage for injury arising out of wrongful entry or eviction,or other invasion of the right of private occupancy committed in the conduct of the insured business.id.at,d,italics added.the general accident court found there was coverage under this provision because the insured invaded the injured party right of private occupancy.id.at,d.in so concluding,the court noted in dicta that the phrase other invasion of the right of private occupancy did not require a physical invasion of an interest in real property,italics added.the second insurance policy provided coverage for personal injury arising out of w rongful entry into,or eviction of a person from,a room,dwelling or premises that the person occupies general accident,supra,th at,d.stating that this provision narrows the definition of this particular offense to some physical act of eviction or entry upon premises,the court found a potential for coverage under this policy,emphasizing that the third party plaintiff complaint alleged that the insured entities had ousted him from the property and interfered with his right to occupy the premises.id.at,d.
general accident does not support an expanded definition of the phrase wrongful eviction in the policy before us.the first general accident insurance policy contained the additional or other invasion of the right of private occupancy phrase that is not included in the universal policy.general accident,supra,th at,d,italics added.the universal policy instead specifically limits the invasion of property rights coverage to personal property interests,which are necessarily limited to claims such as conversion or damage to personal property.see ante,at.although the second general accident insurance policy contained policy language that was closer to universal policy language because it did not include the other invasion of the right to private occupancy phrase,the court analysis is inapplicable here because the insured in that case had physically ousted the underlying plaintiff from his business premises.see group,home indemnity th,d in general accident,we found a potential for coverage,and thus a duty to defend,based on the underlying plaintiff claims that he was ousted and ejected from the business premises,which was leased in his name as an individual.here,there were no similar facts showing cunningham made any attempt to oust or eject beus from any portion of the property.
cunningham alternatively attempts to show a broad judicial construction by directing us to the line of cases holding a wrongful eviction in a cgl policy includes a constructive eviction.see legarra federated mutual ins.th,d giraud milovich d.this argument is not helpful because even if universal policy personal injury coverage could be construed to include this legal meaning of a wrongful eviction,there are no facts showing the possibility of a constructive eviction claim in this case.
an eviction is actual when a landlord takes direct action to physically expel the tenant from the premises.an eviction is constructive if the landlord engages in acts that render the premises unfit for occupancy for the purpose for which it was leased,or depriv
