the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act,et cercla,establishes a retroactive strict liability regime that imposes joint and several liability upon past and current landowners or operators of properties or facilities from which hazardous substances have been released or disposed into the environment.plaintiff appellee anderson brothers,anderson received two letters from the environmental protection agency epa notifying anderson of its potential liability under cercla for environmental contamination of the portland harbor superfund site.the first letter required anderson to submit an extremely detailed response to a questionnaire about its activities at its properties,under threat of severe civil penalties.the questionnaire required anderson to respond to questions that necessarily established its liability under cercla.the second formally identified anderson as a potentially responsible party prp and encourage d it to participate in settlement negotiations with other prps.
anderson general liability insurer,defendant appellant paul fire and marine insurance,declined to provide anderson with a legal defense.under the comprehensive general liability policies in question,paul has a duty to defend anderson against suits for activities covered by the comprehensive general liability policies.paul did not consider the letters sent to anderson to be suits because they were not filed in a court of law.in light of cercla unique liability regime,which is designed to promote settlement with the epa instead of litigation,the district court held that both letters were suits.
anderson is an oregon corporation that owned and leased property,falling within the boundaries of the portland harbor federal superfund site the site.paul issued two comprehensive general liability policies the policies to anderson providing coverage for damages arising from occurrences that happened between january and january,respectively.paul relevant obligations under the policies,which include a duty to defend anderson,are as follows 
the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence,and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such property damage,even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false or fraudulent,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient 
emphasis added.
the epa listed the site as a superfund site in december see.on or around january,anderson received a letter from the epa,issued pursuant to section e of cercla,e the e letter.the e letter stated that the epa seeks anderson cooperation in its investigation of the release of hazardous substances at the site,and explained that epa was seeking information from current and past landowners,tenants,and other entities believed to have information about activities that may have resulted in releases or potential threats of releases of hazardous substances to the site.the e letter enclosed an extensive question information request seeking,inter alia information about anderson ownership of and operations at any property within the site specific physical,environmental,and structural descriptions of each property anderson leased or owned within the site and detailed descriptions of anderson current and former activities at the site,including its use of drainage and sewage lines,its handling and disposal of any hazardous substances and soils,and its use of groundwater.the e letter also informed anderson that w hile epa seeks your voluntary cooperation compliance with the information request is required by law and failure to respond could result in an enforcement action and civil penalties of per day of noncompliance.
anderson tendered the e letter to paul,and requested that paul provide a legal defense and indemnity pursuant to its contractual duty to defend.paul declined to provide a defense.
in november,anderson received a second letter from the epa entitled general notice letter for the portland harbor superfund site the general notice letter.the general notice letter explained that under sections and of cercla,parties identified by the epa as prps may be required to take action to clean up environmental contamination as ordered by the epa,to reimburse the epa for its own expenditures in cleaning up the site,and to pay damages for any harm to natural resources caused by contamination at the site.it continued 
epa has evaluated information in connection with the investigation of the site performed to date and believes that anderson brothers,and specialty truck parts may be a prp with respect to the site epa has reason to believe that hazardous substances have been or are being released from the facility ies located at properties owned and leased by anderson in portland,oregon,into the study area for the site 
the general notice letter also encourage d communication between anderson,other prps,and epa and enclosed a list of prps identified to date for the site.the letter urged anderson to communicate with a convening group in which prps work together to allocate the cleanup costs and work through issues to prepare for future negotiations with epa for performance of the cleanup and reimbursement of response costs after epa has issued its record of decision for the site.participation in the convening group will avoid litigation and significant transaction costs to you and your company.the general notice letter was a form letter,identical to the one sent out to all prps at the site.
anderson tendered the general notice letter to paul,again requesting that paul provide a legal defense under its contractual duty to defend.paul again refused to provide a defense.
anderson sued paul in district court,alleging that paul breached its duty to defend under the policies by refusing to provide anderson with a legal defense in response to each of the two letters.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the state of oregon intervened on anderson behalf in order to defend the constitutionality of the oregon environmental cleanup assistance act,which provides a definition of suit in comprehensive general liability policies,as discussed below.
the district judge granted anderson motion for partial summary judgment from the bench,concluding that both letters triggered paul duty to defend.the parties stipulated to the resulting damages in order to obtain a final judgment.paul appealed.
anderson then moved for attorney fees pursuant to.the district court granted anderson motion in part,awarding slightly less fees than it had requested.paul filed a timely notice of appeal of the attorney fee award,acknowledging that the award should be reversed only in the event that this court were to reverse the district court judgment on the merits.we consolidated the appeals.
the primary question before us is whether the e letter and the general notice letter are suits under oregon law within the meaning of the policies duty to defend.if either letter was a suit,paul had a duty to defend anderson,although that duty would be invoked later if only the second letter caused it to commence.otherwise,paul acted within its rights in refusing to provide anderson with a defense.
the policies here are comprehensive general liability policies.see susan miller philip lefebvre,miller standard insurance policies annotated supp.replicating the standard form comprehensive general liability policy that was in use when the policies were issued.identical policies were issued by insurers nationwide at the time the policies were purchased.because the epa is engaged in superfund remediation projects across the nation,it comes as no surprise that the question whether a letter from the epa initiating proceedings under cercla constitutes a suit has been widely litigated.this question has divided state courts as well as federal courts applying contract law of the several states.
although the legal question here is one of state contract law,the nature of the federal cercla regime is relevant to the contractual interpretation issues.cercla imposes strict liability on all entities that have owned or operated facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed.see carson harbor village,unocal,cir en banc see also,defining disposal.the current owner of any facility at the time of cleanup is also strictly liable for any release of hazardous substances from the facility,see defining release broadly,unless the owner satisfies the narrowly applicable innocent landowner defense,carson harbor,at see,a b.
once an entity is identified as a prp,the epa has broad authority to compel it to clean up a contaminated area or reimburse the government for its past and future response costs.burlington northern sante fe ry.united states,see also pakootas teck cominco metals,cir summarizing the various tools at the epa disposal to arrange for a contaminated site to be cleaned up at prps ultimate expense.a prp failure to cooperate with any reasonable order from the epa at a contaminated site can result in significant civil liability.see pakootas,at.these broad powers give the epa strong leverage to compel prps to settle.indeed,encourag ing early settlement between prps and environmental regulators is one of cercla central purposes.california dep t of toxic substances hearthside residential,cir see also interim guidance.at.
it is vital for a prp to participate in settlement talks at the earliest possible opportunity because n prps may be held jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of response costs minus the amount of the settlement.united states aerojet,cir.furthermore,prps may not file a contribution action against settling prps regarding matters addressed in the settlement.f.for this reason,the epa sends general notice letters to prps as early in the process as possible e arly receipt of the general notice will ensure that prps have adequate knowledge of their potential liability as well as a realistic opportunity to participate in settlement negotiations.interim guidance.at.
in light of the effect on a prp of failing to voluntarily participate in cercla settlement negotiations,it is perhaps not surprising that the huge majority of courts hold that a policyholder receipt of a prp notice from the epa is the functional equivalent of a suit.land,employers mut.ins.of,d,quoting tod zuckerman mark raskoff,environmental insurance litigation law and practice see also id.at nn.collecting state supreme court decisions holding that prp letters trigger suits and state supreme courts holding to the contrary.indeed,this court was one of the first courts to adopt that view.see aetna cas.sur.pintlar,cir applying idaho law.
in pintlar,we held,under idaho contract law,that a prp notice is the effective commencement of a suit necessitating a legal defense.id.we explained that once the epa has identified a possible prp,i n order to influence the nature and costs of the environmental studies and cleanup measures,the prp must get involved from the outset.id.failure to cooperate with any requests by the epa may expose the insured,and potentially its insurers,to much greater liability,including the epa litigation costs.id.accordingly,we held that insurance coverage should not depend on whether the epa may choose to proceed with its administrative remedies or go directly to litigation.id.
with these observations in mind,we turn to the immediate questions before us,whether there is any reason to reach a different result under oregon law than the one we reached in pintlar,and,if so,whether the same conclusion is justified with respect to the e letter as well 
in,the oregon legislature enacted the oregon environmental cleanup assistance act.oecaa oecaa provides a definition for the term suit,and instructs courts to apply that definition when interpreting comprehensive general liability policies in cases involving administrative actions by the epa.oecaa defines suit as follows 
any action or agreement by the epa against or with an insured in which the 
epa in writing directs,requests or agrees that an insured take action with respect to contamination within the state of oregon is equivalent to a suit or lawsuit as those terms are used in any general liability insurance policy.
b.oecaa savings clause,states that the definition of suit applies unless the intent of the parties is shown to be contrary to the definition provided by the statute.because oecaa statutory definition of suit does not apply if that definition is contrary to the parties intent,we first determine whether the policies demonstrate the parties intended meaning of suit,and whether any such intent is contrary to the oecaa definition.
how to determine the meaning of a disputed term in a particular insurance policy is a question of state law.like most states,oregon determines the intent of parties to an insurance contract by looking first to the plain meaning of any disputed terms and then to the structure and context of the policy as a whole.see gonzales farmers ins.of,or hoffman constr.of alaska fred james,or.if the parties intent can not be determined by doing so,the policy is construed against the insurer,because any reasonable doubt as to the intended meaning of an ambiguous term will be resolved against the insurance company and in favor of extending coverage to the insured.pac.ins.hamilton,or quotation marks omitted accord hoffman,at.
fortunately,our task is made relatively simple by two decisions of oregon intermediate appellate court that hold the term suit ambiguous as used in comprehensive general liability policies not materially distinguishable from the ones at issue here.see underwriters at lloyd london excess ins.bonding ins,denied,or schnitzer inv.certain underwriters at lloyd of london,aff on other grounds,or 
although one definition of suit is that the term refers to a lawsuit,schnitzer recognized that o ne of the ordinary meanings of the word suit is the attempt to gain an end by any legal process.at quoting webster third new international dictionary unabridged ed see also school dist,multnomah cnty.mission ins,using the latter definition and referring to the edition of webster new international dictionary.presumably because oregon courts are obligated to interpret a policy in the policyholder favor when neither the plain language nor the structure and content of the policy evince any specific intended meaning by the parties,schnitzer relied on the broader meaning of suit.at.applying that definition,schnitzer held that the policyholder had been subjected to an environmental suit because communications between itself and oregon department of environmental quality described the factual basis on which the agency sought to hold plaintiff liable for the cost of the environmental cleanup.at.
massachusetts bonding reaffirmed schnitzer,holding that 
l ike the policies at issue in schnitzer investment and mccormick baxter creosoting,the policies here do not define suit.nor are we persuaded that any of the other terms of the policies provide sufficiently clear contextual guidance regarding the parties intended meaning.accordingly,we see no reason to reach a different interpretation of the term suit than we reached in our previous cases.
the teaching of massachusetts bonding and schnitzer is that under oregon law,at least in environmental cases,the word suit is ordinarily ambiguous.therefore,such a policy necessarily does not demonstrate any intent of the parties that would be contrary to oecaa statutory definition of the term.we see no reason to believe that the oregon supreme court would hold otherwise accordingly,we apply oecaa definition of suit here 
paul offers two arguments against our applying oecaa definition of suit.neither is persuasive.first,paul argues that the two letters at issue here are less coercive than the communications in schnitzer and massachusetts bonding,and,therefore,they do not fit within the range of permissible meanings of the term suit developed in those cases.this argument misses the point of schnitzer and massachusetts bonding.as we explained,these two cases establish that the term suit is ambiguous and can reasonably be interpreted to include any attempt to gain an end by any legal process.schnitzer,at.the communications from oregon department of environmental quality were not interpreted as triggering suits because of their particularly coercive nature,but,rather,because they initiated the legal process provided under oregon law for compelling a landowner to either clean up a hazardous waste site or pay for others to undertake efforts.see schnitzer,at see also mccormick baxter,at holding that a suit was triggered where communications established the agency view that u nder the statutes governing cleanup of environmental damage,the insured was going to have to pay.
similarly,both the e letter and the general notice letter at issue here were attempts by epa to gain an end by a legal process and,therefore,were within the scope of ambiguity of the term suit.the e letter compelled anderson to respond to an intrusive questionnaire the answers to which exposed it to extensive liability plainly an end obtained through legal process.as to the general notice letter,by specifically alleging that epa has reason to believe that hazardous substances have been or are being released and encourag ing anderson to communicate with other prps in order to avoid litigation and significant transaction costs,it left little doubt that epa was seeking to obtain anderson cooperation through the legal process of identifying anderson as a prp in light of the unique role settlement and coercive information demands play in cercla,there is little doubt that each letter was an attempt to gain an end through legal process.
second,paul points out that the policies duty to defend clauses distinguish between suits which insurers must defend and claims which insurers may investigate and settle,but need not necessarily defend.it argues that interpreting the letters at issue here as having triggered a suit effectively writes the word claim out of the policy because,in paul view,the letters at issue here are,at most,demand letters,and the word claim refers to communications such as demand letters.see,foster gardner,nat.union fire ins,cal accepting this argument under california law lapham hickey steel protection mut.ins,same under illinois law.
we agree with paul that a claim can include any communication that is a demand of a right or supposed right or a demand for compensation,benefits,or payment,webster third international dictionary ed,and therefore includes most demand letters sent by a third party to a policyholder.paul errs,however,when it suggests that classifying the two letters as suits rather than mere claims would render the term claim nugatory.the letters here are not normal demand letters.they are formal steps in a legal process administered by the epa that inexorably leads to the epa seeking to hold property owners strictly liable for environmental contamination.therefore,treating the letters as suits does not diminish the meaning of the term claim as it is used in the policies claim continues to refer to normal demand letters.
unlike a normal demand letter,neither letter made a demand that anderson was free to ignore.with respect to the general notice letter,as we explained in pintlar 
unlike the garden variety demand letter,which only exposes one to a potential threat of future litigation,a prp notice carries with it immediate and severe implications.generally,a party asserting a claim can do nothing between the occurrence of the tort and the filing of the complaint that can adversely affect the insureds rights.however,in a cercla case,the prp substantive rights and ultimate liability are affected from the start of the administrative process.
pintlar,at.similarly,anderson could not disregard the e letter.that letter expressly warns anderson that its failure to respond or its submission of an incomplete,ambiguous or evasive response could result in a fine of up to per day.no garden variety demand letter that is a mere claim could impose such a requirement upon the recipient accordingly,the policies claim or suit language does not demand the narrow interpretation of suit that paul urges.
having concluded that anderson and paul did not express an intent contrary to the oecaa definition,we now apply the oecaa definition to that term.under section b of oecaa,a particular communication between epa and an insured entity is a suit if it is an action or agreement by the epa that is against or with the insured in which the epa in writing directs,requests or agrees that the insured take action and that such action be with respect to contamination within the state of oregon.b.we analyze each element in turn.
first,the epa sending of each letter constituted action.the word action has both an informal and a more formal,legalistic meaning.see webster third new international dictionary unabridged ed see also black law dictionary ed.it is clear that the oregon legislature intended that,in the context of oecaa,the term action have its less formal definition.section b refers to actions or agreements in which the epa directs,requests or agrees that the insured entity take action.b emphasis added.a formal legal proceeding would not result in a request by the epa that the insured act in a particular fashion.the statute use of the verb request makes sense only if action has its less legalistic meaning.in addition,the use of the term action elsewhere in the statute proves that action does not mean formal legal proceeding.section a expressly treats as separate categories formal judicial proceedings and administrative proceedings and actions taken under federal law.emphasis added.thus,we construe the term action broadly in b as well.applying a broad definition of action,we have no trouble concluding that the epa sending of both the e letter and the general notice were actions.
second,both letters are actions by the epa against anderson.against means in opposition or hostility to.webster third new international dictionary unabridged ed.there is no question that each letter is hostile to anderson and in opposition to its interests.
third,each letter also directs or requests that anderson take action.while one might dispute whether the letters direct that anderson do anything,there is no question that they request that it do so.the e letter is explicit y ou are hereby requested to respond to the information request attached to this letter.emphasis added.the general notice letter is slightly more circumspect it encourage s anderson to contact other prps to participate in settlement discussions.nonetheless,the epa threat that participation in the convening group is necessary to avoid litigation and significant transaction costs to you and your company leaves little question that the general notice letter is at least a request that anderson take action.see pintlar,at noting that l ack of cooperation with a prp letter may expose the insured,and potentially its insurers,to much greater liability,including the epa litigation costs.
fourth,the actions requested by the epa in the two letters are plainly with respect to contamination in the state of oregon.they concern nothing but contamination at the site,anderson potential liability for such contamination,and epa efforts to clean up the contamination.
accordingly,we hold that both the e letter and the general notice letter constitute suits within the meaning of oecaa.
finally,paul argues that applying oecaa definition of suit would violate the contracts clauses of the united states and oregon constitutions because the statutory definition would alter its contractual commitments under the policies.as we have stated,however,under oregon common law,if a contractual term is found to be ambiguous,it is generally interpreted against the insurer.see hamilton,at hoffman,at.because oecaa definition of suit applies only when the parties did not have any intent with respect to the meaning of the word suit,or when their expressed intent was not contrary to the oecaa definition,we reject paul argument that oecaa,as applied,violates the united states and oregon constitutions contracts clauses.absent oecaa,we would simply construe the policies against paul as required by oregon common law
