facts background 
before the events giving rise to this action,manganella was the president and sole shareholder of jasmine,a clothing retailer that he founded in the.donna burgess,whose sexual harassment allegations form the underlying claims here,was jasmine human resources manager from to.
in,a former jasmine employee,sonia bawa,filed claims of sexual harassment against jasmine based on manganella conduct.soon thereafter,jasmine purchased from evanston the employment practices liability insurance policy at issue here the policy.jasmine coverage from evanston under the policy consisted of a series of annually renewed installments running from april through april.the policy covers damages including monetary settlements which jasmine shall become legally obligated to pay as a result of timely made claims,by reason of any wrongful employment practice.a claim is a written charge or lawsuit seeking damages or other relief for a wrongful employment practice.a wrongful employment practice includes,as relevant here,conduct of an insured with respect to an employee that allegedly culminated in violation of any state,federal or local civil rights or law fair employment practices law.importantly,for a resulting claim to be covered,a wrongful employment practice must have happened in its entirety during the policy period or after the retroactive date here,april.
in july,manganella sold jasmine to lerner new york,for approximately million.manganella and lerner executed a stock purchase agreement to effectuate the sale and an employment agreement under which manganella would remain jasmine president for three years.under the stock purchase agreement,million of the purchase price was placed in escrow,as security in the event of certain types of misconduct by manganella.a few months after the sale was completed,jasmine cancelled the final installment of the policy but purchased an extended reporting period,which allowed for coverage of claims made and reported during the months following the cancellation.
in may,further allegations of sexual harassment by manganella prompted jasmine to hire an outside investigator,stier anderson llc,which interviewed several employees,including burgess she recounted inappropriate comments that manganella had made in the past.on june,as a result of conduct revealed by the investigation,manganella was fired.in a letter to manganella,lerner accused him of sexually harassing four female employees and downloading sexually explicit images on company computers,all in violation of lerner corporate code of conduct.a subsequent arbitration between lerner and manganella confirmed that he had violated the code of conduct by harassing several female employees.see manganella,wl,at describing the arbitration.
on march,burgess filed a charge of discrimination against manganella,lerner,and jasmine with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad.burgess mcad charge alleged that,t hroughout her employment with jasmine,manganella subjected burgess to nearly constant physical and verbal sexual harassment,including inappropriate comments about burgess body,inappropriate touching,and,eventually,coerced sexual activity on five separate occasions.manganella also threatened burgess and others with physical violence.
ten days after burgess filed the mcad charge,manganella notified evanston of her claims and requested coverage.less than two weeks later,evanston sent a letter to jasmine,denying coverage for burgess claims on the ground that it was apparent that the harassment alleged by burgess in the mcad charge did not happen in its entirety subsequent to the retroactive date,which is april,as required for coverage.
in april,jasmine settled the mcad charge with burgess for.as part of the settlement,burgess provided jasmine with an affidavit the affidavit stating that the conduct and actions by manganella that formed the basis of my allegations of sexual harassment did not begin until in or about october,and then continued throughout my employment.burgess claims against manganella were settled separately at a later date.
manganella filed this action against evanston in july,seeking among other things a ruling that evanston was required under the policy to defend and indemnify manganella against burgess mcad charge.two months later,evanston filed an answer and a complaint against manganella and jasmine,asserting that it had no duty to defend or indemnify either manganella or jasmine for burgess claims 
after discovery,manganella and evanston for summary judgment on manganella coverage claims.the district court held that evanston should have at least investigated the mcad charge before denying coverage,given that it was aware of certain facts including an affidavit that burgess filed in bawa harassment case suggesting that manganella unlawful conduct may not have begun prior to the policy retroactive date.manganella evanston ins,d.the court also concluded,however,that the arbitration between lerner and manganella had conclusively established that burgess mcad charge fell within the policy exclusion of claims based on conduct committed with wanton,willful,reckless or intentional disregard for the laws underlying those claims.see id.at.the district court thus found that the doctrine of issue preclusion barred manganella from relitigating that question,and granted summary judgment for evanston.id.at.we recently affirmed that ruling.see manganella,wl,at.
in a subsequent summary judgment opinion,the district court addressed evanston claims against jasmine.manganella evanston ins,cv rgs,wl.the court reiterated its earlier holding that evanston had a duty to at least investigate the mcad charge before denying coverage.id.at.because evanston had breached the duty to defend,it had the burden of proving that burgess claim was not within its policy coverage.id.at quoting polaroid travelers indem,internal quotation mark omitted.evanston failed to carry that burden.addressing the issues as framed by the parties,the district court found no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the conduct underlying burgess mcad charge had begun prior to the policy retroactive date of april.see id.at.in the district court view,evanston had at most produced a shard of allegedly contradictory evidence in the form of an interview memorandum and interrogatory answers filed in connection with the mcad proceeding,in which burgess characterized some of manganella remarks as offensive in hindsight.id.at.the district court did not consider these statements sufficient to create a factual dispute as to the scope of burgess harassment claims.the court thus determined that evanston is liable under the policy for the costs of defending and settling the burgess claim,and granted summary judgment for jasmine.id.at,evanston now appeals the ruling that summary judgment was properly entered against it,and that in consequence it must reimburse jasmine for the settlement with burgess but not the holding that it must cover jasmine defense
