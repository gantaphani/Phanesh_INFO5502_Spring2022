plaintiffs appellants are fireman fund insurance company,one beacon insurance company,national liability and fire insurance company,and qbe marine energy syndicate collectively fireman fund,insurance companies that provided marine general liability and marine excess liability policies to defendant appellant signal international,llc signal fireman fund and signal appealed from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york oetken,granting summary judgment to defendants appellees great american insurance company of new york great american and max specialty insurance company msi.
fireman fund,great american,and msi issued insurance policies that provided various coverages for a dry dock in port arthur,texas owned by signal.after the dry dock sank in,signal and fireman fund sought contributions from great american and msi for the loss of the dry dock and resulting environmental cleanup costs.the district court ruled in adjudicating a number of summary judgment motions that the great american and msi policies were void in light of signal failure to disclose when it applied for those policies that the dry dock had significantly deteriorated and that repairs recommended by a number of consultants and engineers over several years had not been made.
after submission of this appeal,msi and signal reached a settlement and obtained a dismissal of the case between them.therefore,signal no longer appeals the grant of summary judgment to msi.nonetheless,fireman fund asserts that it may still pursue appeal of the issues relating to the policy issued to signal by msi based on our decision in maryland cas.grace.see,cir t he contract of settlement an insurer enters into with the insured can not affect the rights of another insurer who is not a party to it.instead,whatever obligations or rights to contribution may exist between two or more insurers of the same event flow from equitable principles.fireman fund was granted summary judgment below against msi on a contribution claim based on msi policy,and we assume without deciding that fireman fund is correct that it may pursue this appeal of the district court decision finding the msi policy void,based on fireman fund interest in the unappealed summary judgment decision on contribution.
we agree with the district court orders.we hold that the great american policy was a marine insurance contract subject to the doctrine of uberrimae fidei and that signal nondisclosure violated its duty under that doctrine,permitting great american to void the policy.we further hold that msi policy was governed by mississippi law that,under that law,signal materially misrepresented the dry dock condition and that msi was entitled to void the policy on that basis.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
factual backgrounda.the operation and loss of the dry dock 
signal is a marine construction firm involved principally in building and repairing structures such as offshore drilling rigs,platforms,and barges.in,signal purchased six facilities two in mississippi and four in texas for use in its business of repairing,upgrading,and converting offshore drilling rigs one of the texas facilities was a dockyard in port arthur,texas.in acquiring that facility,signal assumed an existing lease of a dry dock the dry dock located along the sabine neches waterway near the gulf of mexico the dry dock was built in at the direction of the united states navy to repair navy ships.in early,signal accepted an offer from the lessor to purchase the dry dock,which signal had been using in its operations since it assumed the lease.
throughout its lease and ownership of the dry dock,signal received a number of reports on the dry dock deteriorated condition.these included the following 
the heger reports the dry dock engineering firm heger dry dock,heger of holliston,massachusetts,periodically inspected the dry dock between and.in,freide goldman offshore the operator of the dry dock before signal asked heger to inspect the dry dock in order to provide an estimate of its fair market value in a december appraisal,heger described the dry dock as being in fair to good condition,with the exception of the pontoon deck,which was in poor condition and should be replaced,and section h,which showed markedly more corrosion internally.heger estimated that the dry dock would have years of remaining useful life if the pontoon deck was completely repaired,but the costs of making these extensive repairs in the united states rendered the dry dock value below zero.in a series of subsequent reports from through commissioned by signal to assist it in prolonging the existing life of the dry dock,heger found that the dry dock had continued to deteriorate and that repairs had not been made.instead,signal had simply patched damaged areas with doublers.heger provided recommendations for extensive repairs that would be required for the dry dock to continue to operate safely.however,heger repeatedly advised that the expected life extension for the dock would only be a few years and therefore the cost,time and effort to perform this work was not economically justifiable.heger also provided signal with plans for converting the dry dock to a configuration by removing pontoon h but warned that the dry dock structure should be satisfactorily restored before using the dock or proceeding with any modifications.
the abs audits auditor abs consulting abs of houston,texas,a maritime risk management firm,was designated by the port of port arthur to review and report on signal maintenance and repair programs at the dry dock.in,abs observed the rapidly increasing rate of overall deterioration of the dry dock,which was largely due to the drydock age,and lack of adequate maintenance repair.abs noted that,although it had notified the dry dock owners and operators in january of the advanced state of deterioration,they had made no apparent efforts to implement abs recommended repairs.instead,more than a hundred doubler plates ha d been welded over severely platings.six months later,abs reported that pontoon h was leaking severely,and pontoons e and g were leaking significantly as well.abs concluded that it appeared that unsafe drydock operations were being conducted and recommended that additional drydockings not be conducted until substantial hull repairs were made to h pontoon and the repairs were verified.emphases omitted.
internal staff study in april,signal conducted an internal staff study to determine whether to purchase the leased dry dock from the port commission of port arthur.the study found that,without major renewal costs,the dry dock remaining useful life was only to years.the study concluded that it would cost million to extend the life of the dry dock pontoons for maybe to years.the study ultimately advised against purchasing the dry dock in light of its relatively short remaining useful life and extreme costs of extension.
the dls surveys the marine appraiser,surveyor,and consulting firm dufour,laskay strouse,dls of houston,louisiana,and florida was hired to inspect and appraise signal texas and mississippi facilities for the purpose of asset allocation and financial review by ge commercial finance,signal financing company.between and,dls observed that the dry dock had significant water in most compartments that require d pumping and trimming every four hours,which was indicative of some wastage holes in the bottom,see also.each year,dls noted that t he deck plating ha d significant doubler plates where plating ha d either wasted or separated from internal framing and that there was a long tear in the plating extending along a transverse frame that reportedly w ould be fitted with a proper doubler in the near future.in,dls concluded that the dry dock was in fair to good condition but recommended that its pontoons be and repaired a s soon as practical within the succeeding eighteen months to render it in good stable operating condition and provide a life extension.
the heller property risk assessment report stephen heller associates heller of houston a loss prevention consulting firm was hired by signal in to conduct a risk review of signal mississippi and texas facilities in order to assist insurance underwriters in evaluating the exposures,operations,and loss prevention for those facilities.in a january report,heller rated the mississippi and texas facilities o verall as above average,meaning that they met a cceptable standards including some industry best practices.heller found that t he maximum foreseeable loss mfl or worst case scenario for these facilities included a sinking or structural collapse of the dry dock at port arthur.the maximum foreseeable loss was described as one of extremely low probability and frequency based on previous industry experience.
signal never replaced the dry dock pontoons or pontoon decks.instead,signal continued to use inserts and doublers to patch holes in the decks.
in,signal decided to implement the configuration by removing pontoon on august,it attempted to remove that pontoon,but during that procedure the entire dry dock sank.
shortly after the sinking,signal notified the texas general land office glo,which regulates pollution affecting texas shoreline waters,about what had occurred.in september,the glo advised signal to initiate immediate action to recover the dry dock from texas coastal waters.in june,signal hired weeks marine,to manage removal of the sunken dry dock and cleanup of the site.removal and cleanup efforts were not completed until march and resulted in in costs.
b.the insurance policies covering the dry dock 
signal had obtained five insurance policies that insured against risks related to the dry dock at the time of its sinking a marine general liability policy issued by fireman fund a marine excess liability policy issued by fireman fund a pollution policy issued by great american the pollution policy a primary property insurance policy the ppi policy issued by westchester surplus lines insurance company westchester and an excess property insurance policy issued by msi,which provided coverage in excess of the ppi policy the epi policy.only the great american pollution policy and the msi epi policy are at issue here.
great american first underwrote the pollution policy in and renewed it annually through.to obtain the renewal of the policy for,signal completed and submitted great american standard vessel pollution liability application along with a schedule of vessels,which included the dry dock and approximately tugboats and barges owned by signal.the pollution policy insured signal against losses of up to million for each property in the schedule resulting from pollution discharges into navigable waters.the policy specifically insured against claims under the oil pollution act of,et opa,the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act,et cercla,and the federal water pollution control act amendments of,et fwpca,and the costs of removal of materials of a and nature which has been mandated by an authorized public authority and was the result of a defined single,sudden and accidental event.an endorsement to the policy also extended coverage to all vessels while under repair,alteration,construction,conversion or rebuilding within miles of the port arthur dockyard.
msi underwrote the epi policy in january.to apply for the policy,signal submitted its property insurance submission.this document included a statement of values that described the dry dock value as million and the heller report,but it did not include other information such as the heger reports,the abs audits,or the dls surveys suggesting that the dry dock was in need of repair.the epi policy insured against loss of or damage to properties listed in the statement of values,as well as business interruption costs and e xtra e xpense s associated with the loss of those properties.the policy provided million coverage for losses in excess of the underlying ppi policy,which covered losses up to million.
post loss insurance claims 
in january,westchester paid signal its total coverage amount of million pursuant to the ppi policy for losses related to the dry dock.msi paid signal million of its total coverage amount of million under the epi policy based on the million value of the dry dock,as represented in the statement of values.great american refused to make any payments under its pollution policy.
in meetings between signal and its insurers in early,msi and great american argued that their policies did not cover the costs of removing the dry dock from the sabine neches waterway and cleaning up the site.fireman fund agreed to fund signal removal and cleanup efforts but reserved its right to seek reimbursement later from msi and great american.
ii.procedural background 
on march,fireman fund commenced this action against signal,great american,and msi,seeking a declaration as to the obligations of signal and its insurers for losses associated with the sinking of the dry dock.msi asserted against signal for the million it had paid,and also sought to void the epi policy on the ground of misrepresentation after discovery revealed the various reports on the dry dock poor condition that signal had not provided to msi when applying for the policy.signal against msi for cleanup and removal costs and additional damages.great american filed claims against signal and fireman fund,seeking a declaration that the pollution policy was void under the maritime doctrine of uberrimae fidei,which imposes a duty of utmost good faith on the insured or alternatively under the policy misrepresentation clause 
on october,signal assigned to fireman fund its rights under the great american pollution policy,and fireman fund continued to pursue coverage against great american.both signal and fireman fund maintained their claims against msi signal opposed msi efforts to obtain from signal the million it had already paid,and both signal and fireman fund sought additional payments from msi under its epi policy.
this appeal arises out of eight motions that were filed after the close of discovery.fireman fund,signal,great american,and msi moved or on the coverage issues for the pollution policy and epi policy 
on march,the district court granted partial summary judgment,holding that under the epi policy,msi was required to contribute to the payments that fireman fund had made to signal.fireman fund ins.great am.ins.of new york,civ.jpo,wl,at.however,on march,the district court ruled also on summary judgment that the great american pollution policy and the msi epi policy were void ab initio because of signal failure to disclose the dry dock deteriorated state.see fireman fund ins.great am.ins.of new york,d.the court concluded that the great american pollution policy was a marine insurance contract subject to the doctrine of uberrimae fidei and that signal had breached its duty of utmost good faith to great american by withholding material information about the dry dock condition when it applied for coverage.see id.the district court also held that the epi policy was void under mississippi law because signal had materially misrepresented the dry dock condition in its property insurance submission.id.at.the court therefore denied fireman fund and signal motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment,granted msi and great american motions for summary judgment declaring the policies void,and denied the remaining motions,including msi motion for reconsideration of the march,decision on contribution.id.at.fireman fund and signal appealed.
after submission of this appeal,msi and signal reached a settlement and obtained dismissal of the case between them.we still must address the validity of the epi policy,however,because,notwithstanding the recent settlement between fireman fund and signal,the epi policy is still the basis for fireman fund claim for contribution against msi.
discussion 
great american pollution policy 
fireman fund argues that great american pollution policy is not subject to the doctrine of uberrimae fidei.it further argues that,even if the doctrine applies,signal did not breach its duty to great american because it provided all information that great american requested about the dry dock on its insurance application.
admiralty jurisdiction and the doctrine of uberrimae fidei 
great american argues and the district court concluded that the pollution policy is void under the maritime doctrine of uberrimae fidei.for the doctrine to apply,fireman fund suit against great american must be sustainable under the court admiralty jurisdiction.norfolk ry.kirby,d emphasis omitted.this is because federal courts authority to make decisional law for the interpretation of maritime contracts stems from the constitution grant of admiralty jurisdiction to federal courts.see const.art.iii,cl.providing that the federal judicial power shall extend to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.thus,the grant of admiralty jurisdiction and the power to make admiralty law are mutually dependent.kirby,at.

t here are few clean lines between maritime and contracts.folksamerica reinsurance clean water of,cir quoting kirby,at.the boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts are conceptual rather than spatial,and defined by the purpose of the jurisdictional grant to protect maritime commerce.id.citations omitted.w hether a contract is a maritime one depends upon the nature and character of the contract,and the true criterion is whether it has reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.kirby,at ellipsis omitted quoting pac.hall.marine ry.shipbuilding.our inquiry focuses on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce.id.at.therefore,the contract subject matter must be our focal point.folksamerica,at.
a dmiralty jurisdiction will exist over an insurance contract where the primary or principal objective of the contract is the establishment of policies of marine insurance.id.at quoting ins.dunham,wall.w hether an insurance policy is marine insurance depends on whether the insurer assumes risks which are marine risks.id.at quoting jeffcott aetna ins,cir.a n insurance policy predominant purpose,as measured by the dimensions of the contingency insured against and the risk assumed,determines the nature of the insurance.id.at quoting acadia ins.mcneil,cir.thus,u ltimately,coverage determines whether a policy is marine insurance,and coverage is a function of the terms of the insurance contract and the nature of the business insured.id.
the question of whether an insurance contract is subject to the court admiralty jurisdiction ha s implications beyond conferring federal jurisdiction.id.at.in particular,w hen a contract is a maritime one,and the dispute is not inherently local,federal law controls the contract interpretation.kirby,at.
under federal law,a marine insurance contract is subject to the federal maritime doctrine of uberrimae fide,or utmost good faith.folksamerica,at see also knight fire ins,cir t he substantive law governing marine insurance includes the principle that under the doctrine of uberrimae fidei the parties to a marine insurance policy must accord each other the highest degree of good faith.the doctrine is a recognition that the insured is more likely to be aware of information that materially affects the risk being insured,marine ins.tradeline,cir,and that o ften the insurer lacks the practicable means to verify the accuracy or sufficiency of facts provided by the insured for purposes of establishing the contractual terms,thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed.for example,the vessel to be insured may be at some great distance on the high seas,impossible to inspect at the time the application for insurance is filed.see warren marwedel stephanie espinoza,dagger,shield,or double edged sword the reciprocal nature of the doctrine of uberrimae fidei,tul.
accordingly,under the doctrine,the party seeking insurance is required to disclose all circumstances known to it which materially affect the risk.folksamerica,at quoting atl.mut.ins.balfour maclaine int l in re balfour maclaine int l,cir see also knight,at since the insured is in the best position to know of any circumstances material to the risk,he must reveal those facts to the underwriter,rather than wait for the underwriter to inquire.if the insured acquires material information after having applied for insurance,he is required to communicate that information to the proposed insurer as well.puritan ins.eagle,cir.thus,t he insured is bound,although no inquiry be made,to disclose every fact within his knowledge that is material to the risk.schoenbaum,supra,at.the standard for disclosure is an objective one,that is,whether a reasonable person in the insured position would know that the particular fact is material.knight,at.
failure by the insured to disclose all available information will allow the insurer to avoid the policy,regardless of whether such omission is intentional or results from mistake,accident,forgetfulness,or inadvertence.schoenbaum,supra,at see sun mut.ins.ocean ins.the concealment,whether intentional or inadvertent,avoids the policy in respect to the duty of disclosing all material facts,t he obligation is one uberrimae fidei.the duty of communication,indeed,is independent of the intention,and is violated by the fact of concealment even where there is no design to deceive.puritan ins,at see also catlin syndicate at lloyd san juan towing marine,cir under uberrimae fidei,when the marine insured fails to disclose to the marine insurer all circumstances known to it and unknown to the insurer which materially affect the insurer risk,the insurer may void the marine insurance policy at its option.emphasis in original quoting windsor mount joy mut.ins.giragosian,cir.however,t he principle of uberrimae fidei does not require the voiding of the contract unless the undisclosed facts were material and relied upon.puritan,at.
b.the pollution policy is a marine insurance contract 
the threshold inquiry the maritime nature of the dispute 
in determining whether a contractual dispute falls within our admiralty jurisdiction,s everal of our cases have require d that,prior to inquiring into the subject matter of the contract,we first make a threshold inquiry into the subject matter of the dispute.folksamerica,at.those cases hold that a federal court must initially determine whether the subject matter of the dispute is so attenuated from the business of maritime commerce that it does not implicate the concerns underlying admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.id.quoting balfour,at.
s ome uncertainty exists as to the extent to which this court threshold inquiry test survives the supreme court decision in kirby where,f ocusing on the contract subject matter,the kirby court found admiralty jurisdiction.id.at.t he absence of any discussion by the supreme court in kirby of a threshold inquiry akin to that found in our precedents is notable.id.at.
however,we need not resolve that uncertainty here.assuming the continued vitality of the threshold inquiry into the subject matter of the dispute,this case survives it.the dispute over the pollution policy concerns insurance coverage for the costs of removing the dry dock and the pollutants it produced upon sinking in navigable waters.the sinking of the dry dock created potential dangers to public health and safety and the environment matters that would directly impact those who conducted maritime commerce in those waters.
moreover,the parties dispute here concerns information provided to an insurer for pollution coverage for a structure used in vessel repair and maintenance.these questions directly implicate the business of maritime commerce.see folksamerica,at the business of ship maintenance has long been recognized as maritime id.at pollution coverage is widely recognized as marine in nature.sirius ins.uk collins,cir there are few objects perhaps none more essentially related to maritime commerce than vessels.
thus,the insurance claim here has more than a speculative and attenuated connection with maritime commerce.folksamerica,at quoting balfour,at.assuming that the threshold inquiry survives kirby,the dispute here is sufficiently maritime in nature to withstand that inquiry.
the maritime nature of the pollution policy 
our next inquiry is whether the pollution policy itself is sufficiently marine to warrant application of federal maritime law,including the doctrine of uberrimae fidei.
fireman fund urges us to consider only the policy coverage of the dry dock in determining whether the contract is marine insurance.it maintains that such a fixed structure drydock is not a vessel,and thus pollution coverage for the dry dock is not subject to maritime jurisdiction.fireman fund br.at.fireman fund argues that this coverage is severable from the policy coverage of other structures and vessels,as evidenced by the fact that each object listed in the policy schedule of vessels is subject to a separate premium.
prior to kirby,this court had held that admiralty jurisdiction was limited to contracts,claims,and services that were purely maritime.folksamerica,at quoting rea v.the eclipse.a mixed contract,a contract that contain ed both admiralty and obligations was,therefore,usually not within admiralty jurisdiction.transatlantic marine claims agency,ace shipping,cir.t he general rule that mixed contracts f e ll outside admiralty jurisdiction was subject to two exceptions cases where the claim arose from a breach of maritime obligations that were severable from the obligations of the contract the severability exception,and cases where the elements of a contract were merely incidental to the maritime ones the incidental exception.folksamerica,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
after kirby,however,we amended our jurisprudence on maritime contracts.williamson recovery,cir.we held that i n applying what we have previously called the incidental exception,we should focus on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce,rather than on whether the components are properly characterized as more than incidental or merely incidental to the contract.folksamerica,at citation omitted quoting kirby,at.
we have not yet addressed the impact of kirby on the severability exception the ninth circuit has held that the exception collapses in the wake of the kirby court primary objective test.sentry select ins.royal ins.of,cir.we need not to resolve the issue here,however.assuming arguendo that the pollution policy is severable and that its coverage of the dry dock should be viewed in isolation,we nonetheless find that the policy is a maritime contract.
to reach this conclusion,we consider whether the primary or principal objective of the pollution policy dry dock coverage is the establishment of policies of marine insurance,which depends on whether the insurer assumes risks which are marine risks.folksamerica,at,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.this requires consideration of the terms of the insurance contract and the nature of the business insured.id.at.
as it pertains to the dry dock,the pollution policy insures against liability for accidental discharge or substantial threat of a discharge from the dry dock into the navigable waters of the united states.coverage includes liability arising under the and the fwpca statutes that hold parties responsible for the release of pollutants into navigable waters.see b,a.it also extends to the removal of materials as mandated by an authorized public authority.
in addition to emissions from the dry dock itself,the policy insures against liability for emissions from all vessels while under repair within a nautical mile radius of the port arthur dockyard.thus,the policy provides coverage for vessels located at the dry dock in connection with signal repair business the type of business which has long been recognized as maritime.folksamerica,at.there is no indication that coverage for vessels located at the dry dock was obtained through the payment of separate premiums.rather,coverage for such vessels is an extension of the policy coverage of the dry dock.see sirius,at noting that the existence of separately calculated premiums is relevant in determining severability of insurance contract provisions.we therefore can not agree with fireman fund that the policy provisions related to the dry dock did not provide coverage for any potential liabilities associated with the actual repair or maintenance of vessels.fireman fund br.
we conclude that the primary object of the pollution policy coverage of the dry dock was to insure against the risk of liability for pollutants emitted during signal ship repair and maintenance operations there.insurance policies protecting against such risks have long been considered marine in nature.see folksamerica,at finding pollution coverage provisions to be marine,given that p ollution coverage is widely recognized as marine in nature,marine insurance contracts often include pollution coverage,and t he insured business operations in oil and cargo transportation render ed pollution coverage potentially significant see also certain underwriters at lloyds inlet fisheries,cir one type of insurance typifying marine insurance is protection and indemnity p i insurance p i insurance historically included pollution liability vessel pollution policies mirror p i policies in their general terms,but cover liability under the opa and other environmental statutes.that vessel pollution insurance covers new statutory liabilities does not alter the fact that the risks of incurring that liability stem from the same vagaries of marine life that have shaped maritime insurance law for centuries.citation omitted.we hold that the pollution policy is a marine insurance policy,subject to our admiralty jurisdiction and federal maritime law,including the doctrine of uberrimae fidei 
signal violated its duty of utmost good faith by failing to disclose the dry dock condition 
we turn next to the questions of whether signal violated its duty of utmost good faith under the doctrine of uberrimae fidei and whether this breach permits great american to void the pollution policy.under the doctrine,signal was bound,although no inquiry be made,to disclose every fact within its knowledge that was material to the risk insured against.schoenbaum,supra,at see puritan,at.
we have held that the doctrine does not require the voiding of the contract unless the undisclosed facts were material and relied upon.puritan,at.while both parties acknowledge the materiality requirement,they disagree as to whether reliance is an independent requirement and whether that requirement should apply here.great american notes that reliance has not been widely discussed in this circuit since puritan.it also contends that,to the extent reliance may be required in some circumstances,it should not be required here,because this case involves a complete,as opposed to a partial,misleading disclosure.cv dkt.
citing our decision in puritan,the eighth circuit recently held that materiality and reliance are distinct elements,both of which must be proven for the doctrine to apply.see paul fire marine ins.abhe svoboda,cir.m ateriality examines whether a fact would have influenced the judgment of a reasonable and prudent underwriter,in deciding whether to insure at all or at a particular premium,tradeline,at see also sun mut.ins,at holding that nondisclosure permitted avoidance of the contract where,h ad the undisclosed information been known,it was reasonable to believe that a prudent underwriter would not have accepted the proposal as made.reliance,however according to the eighth circuit requires a causal connection between the misrepresentation or concealment of that material fact and the actual underwriter decision to issue the policy.paul fire,at see puritan,at a marine insurance policy can not be voided for misrepresentation where the alleged misrepresentation was not relied upon and did not in any way mislead the insurer.quoting rose lucy,resolute ins.
we need not decide here whether subjective reliance is required in all cases in order for the doctrine to apply.even assuming that it is,we find that signal breached its duty to great american and that no genuine disputes of fact exist as to either the materiality of signal or great american reliance.
in applying for the pollution policy,signal insurance broker submitted only great american standard vessel pollution liability application along with a schedule of vessels,which listed the dry dock.it appears that the only information in those materials related to the dry dock condition was that it was built in,that it was constructed from steel,and that its gross tonnage was less than tons neither signal nor fireman fund has argued otherwise.signal did not provide any surveys to great american when it applied for coverage for the dry dock.
notwithstanding the paucity of relevant information furnished by signal to great american,it is undisputed that by signal had in its possession numerous surveys and reports concluding that the dry dock had substantially deteriorated and that necessary repairs were not being made.at least one survey estimated that the dry dock value was below zero.signal own internal documents and communications with the heger engineering firm demonstrate its awareness of these concerns.nevertheless,signal did not disclose this information to great american.
this undisclosed information was clearly material that is,it would have influenced the judgment of a reasonable and prudent underwriter.paul fire,at emphasis omitted.that multiple engineers and signal own internal staff study described considerable deterioration of the dry dock and signal failure to make recommended repairs over several years was precisely the type of information that would have affected a reasonable insurer decision to insure the dry dock at all or at least at a particular premium.tradeline,at.if disclosed,this information would have raised significant concerns about the likelihood of pollutant emissions from the dry dock.given the nature and abundance of this information and the high likelihood that it would have impacted coverage,there can be no genuine dispute that a reasonable person in signal position would have know n that these particular fact s were material and that signal therefore had a duty to disclose them.knight,at see catlin,at a hull inspector who surveyed the drydock testified that he found heavy wastage in the drydock hull during an inspection the insured failure to disclose the drydock level of deterioration when it applied for insurance is a material fact,the nondisclosure of which violates uberrimae fidei.
there is also no genuine dispute that in decid ing to issue the policy,paul fire,at,the underwriters at great american in fact relied upon the absence of this undisclosed information from signal application materials.cindy stringer,the great american underwriter who evaluated the pollution policy applications from to testified at her deposition that,had i been able to read the undisclosed surveys,i definitely would have been concerned if i had known the dry dock was in bad shape,and signal told me they were going to fix it up,more than likely,i would have told them i did want to cover that vessel until they completed all the recommendations.she further stated that,i f i knew that the wing walls were in poor condition,i definitely would have want ed to know what was being done about it.
stringer testimony also established that,in agreeing to underwrite the policy,she was acting on the understanding that signal was complying with its duty of utmost good faith.she testified as follows 
if the insured had information that could materially affect our policy,it would be their obligation to furnish us with that information f or example,if you were to read a survey that said that you had a vessel that was about ready to collapse or something like that,that would be something that you should bring to the attention of your broker,who would then bring it to our attention.
she also opined that it would be common sense if you had a vessel that was about ready to collapse or in danger of sinking or something like that,you would definitely want to let somebody know about it,because if a prudent insured is aware of a condition that would put a vessel in jeopardy,they owe the duty to let underwriters know of that condition.
reese lever,an underwriter who worked with stringer on the renewal of the pollution policy similarly testified that,if signal was doing repairs on a vessel,if they major repairs,it something we want to know about,and that it common sense you want to let your insurers know that you repairing these vessels.lever explained that,in his view,it goes back to the duty of utmost good faith.if there are vessels that have problems,the underwriter should be aware of it.
fireman fund argues that signal did not have an obligation to provide the undisclosed information because great american did not request surveys or additional information about the dry dock condition as part of its underwriting criteria or application.however,under the doctrine of uberrimae fidei,great american was not obligated to request such information.see knight,at since the insured is in the best position to know of any circumstances material to the risk,he must reveal those facts to the underwriter,rather than wait for the underwriter to inquire.emphasis added.instead,great american was entitled make its decision to underwrite the policy based on the information that signal provided,secure in the knowledge that signal was under a duty of utmost good faith that required it to disclose all information material to the risk insured against.see tradeline,at schoenbaum,supra,at.
fireman fund also argues that a genuine dispute exists as to whether the undisclosed information was material because great american agreed to insure another dry dock owned by signal the bender dry dock under the pollution policy after the port arthur dry dock sank,despite receiving a survey that raised concerns about the bender dry dock condition.for several reasons,we are not persuaded.first,although lever testified that he considered several points in the bender dry dock survey significant to his underwriting analysis none of those conditions rose to the level of extensive dilapidation described in the undisclosed reports regarding the port arthur dry dock.moreover,unlike the bender dry dock,the available information regarding the port arthur dry dock condition was not limited to an isolated survey.rather,the undisclosed information at issue here consisted of reports by multiple engineers and risk management professionals and signal itself over a period of more than seven years that contained corroborating accounts of extensive dry dock deterioration and signal continued failure to make recommended repairs.in light of these significant distinctions,great american decision to insure the bender dry dock does not raise any genuine dispute as to whether the undisclosed information regarding the port arthur dry dock was material and relied upon.
we conclude that signal breached its duty of utmost good faith by failing to disclose information about the dry dock condition to great american.because this information was both material and relied upon,great american is entitled to void the pollution policy.see puritan,at see also catlin,at t he evidence conclusively shows that the insured failed to disclose material information about the dry dock actual value and preexisting deteriorated condition prior to the insurer determining whether it would accept the risk.the insurer was free,therefore,to void the policy.we affirm the district court grant of great american motion for summary judgment and its denial of fireman fund and signal.
ii.msi excess property insurance policy 
we next consider the epi policy issued by msi.the district court held that the epi policy was not a maritime contract,fireman fund ins.great am.ins.of new york,civ.jpo,wl,at,a conclusion that is not challenged on appeal nevertheless,the court found that the policy was void under mississippi law for material misrepresentation.fireman fund,d at.
fireman fund argues that the district court erred in holding that the epi policy was governed by mississippi law rather than texas law.alternatively,it contends that,even if mississippi law applies,the court erred in its application of that state law.for the reasons below,we reject both arguments.

where a choice of law clause is not dispositive,t he first step is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the jurisdictions involved.in re allstate ins.stolarz,see glen banks,new york practice series new york contract law if the contract has no clause and the laws of different jurisdictions could apply,new york courts may undertake a analysis.the first step in any case presenting a potential issue is to determine whether there is an actual conflict between the laws of the jurisdictions involved.if an actual conflict exists,new york applies t he center of gravity or grouping of contacts choice of law theory.stolarz,at.
a pplication of the grouping of contacts theory to disputes gives the place having the most interest in the problem paramount control over the legal issues arising out of a particular factual context,thus allowing the forum to apply the policy of the jurisdiction most intimately concerned with the outcome of the particular litigation.
in re liquidation of midland ins,quoting auten auten.b y stressing the significant contacts,this analysis enables the court,not only to reflect the relative interests of the several jurisdictions involved,but also to give effect to the probable intention of the parties and consideration to whether one rule or the other produces the best practical result.auten,at citations omitted quoting swift bankers trust.
under this approach,the spectrum of significant contacts rather than a single possibly fortuitous event may be considered.stolarz,at citation omitted.t he new york court of appeals has endorsed the following factors identified in the restatement second of conflict of laws the places of negotiation and performance the location of the subject matter and the domicile or place of business of the contracting parties.schwartz liberty mut.ins,cir quoting zurich ins.shearson lehman hutton.
critical to a sound analysis,however,is selecting the contacts that obtain significance in the particular contract dispute.stolarz,at.the new york appellate divisions have repeatedly recognized that where the insured risk is scattered throughout multiple states,new york courts deem the risk to be located principally in one state,namely,in the state of the insured domicile at the time the policy was issued,and thus have held that the state of the insured domicile should be regarded as a proxy for the principal location of the insured risk.certain underwriters at lloyd foster wheeler,app.div.dep t emphasis added quoting.cas.cont l cas,cir,aff,these courts have noted that t he state of the insured domicile is a fact known to the parties at the time of contracting,and application of the law of that state is most likely to conform to their expectations.id.at.
choice of law governing the epi policy 
fireman fund argues that the district court erred by treating the state of the insured domicile as determinative of the choice of law analysis,fireman fund,d at,and by alternatively holding that the analysis favors application of mississippi law over texas law 
as a preliminary matter,we must determine if the district court looked to the wrong insured in its choice of law analysis.signal claimed that its subsidiary,signal international texas signal texas,which is domiciled in texas,owned and operated the dry dock,so the relevant domicile of the insured is therefore texas.
however,contrary to this claim,there is no genuine dispute that signal international,llc,was the relevant insured under the epi policy.signal consultant and former senior vice president of texas operations,john haley,stated in his affidavit that signal international,was the owner and operator of the afdb drydock.furthermore,the epi policy itself names signal international,llc as the insured,with an address in pascagoula,mississippi.although the ppi policy identifies t he first named insured as signal international,llc and any owned subsidiary,the ppi policy identifies only signal international,llc,by name and lists a mississippi address for the first named insured.both the epi policy and the ppi policy therefore evince the parties understanding that the insured was signal international,llc,which was domiciled in mississippi.
moreover,an analysis that would look to a subsidiary of the insured based on the particular loss that triggered coverage would be at odds with new york choice of law rules.under new york law,barring extraordinary circumstances,only one state law should govern an insurance agreement.cas,at.new york courts have declined to look to the location of an insured subsidiaries in determining choice of law,because applying multiple states laws to the enforcement of a single insurance policy defies the law as well as the traditional concerns of judicial economy and uniformity.see fc bruckner,fireman fund ins,app.div.dep t ellipses omitted quoting wausau bus.ins.horizon admin.servs.llc,d.
we therefore conclude that,in determining what law governs the epi policy,the relevant insured is signal international llc,and its domicile is mississippi 
fireman fund argues that the district court erred by treating the insured domicile as dispositive of the choice of law analysis.to the contrary,though,under new york law,the law of signal domicile governs the epi policy since the policy covers risks spread across multiple states.see,lapolla,app x at foster wheeler,at midland,at.
nevertheless,even if the totality of the relevant contacts is considered,the result is the same.the epi policy declarations page states that t his insurance policy is issued pursuant to mississippi law covering surplus lines insurance.the same page contains information specific to the signal policy,including the insured,the covered property,and the policy premium signal property insurance submission also listed mississippi as the choice of law for the property policies.in addition,in its preliminary claim statement for coverage after the dry dock sank,signal stated that the epi policy was issued to a mississippi insured,delivered to signal offices in mississippi,and subject to mississippi law and jurisdiction.these documents demonstrate the parties understanding that mississippi law would apply to the policy.
the balance of the other choice of law factors does not clearly favor the law of one state over another.the epi policy was negotiated in virginia and new york.performance of the contract was to take place in texas and mississippi,and the value of the assets insured by the epi policy was split almost evenly between those two states.signal is domiciled in mississippi,and msi is domiciled in virginia.
the mere presence of the dry dock in texas does not give texas an overriding interest in having its law govern the policy.t his is merely a dispute over who the insured or the insurer must bear the cost s related to the loss of the dry dock.cas,at.t he interest of a state in which a covered item is located diminishes when the question is not whether someone will or can pay for the cleanup but rather who will pay.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
because the parties understanding and the insured domicile favor application of mississippi law,while the other choice of law factors do not favor the law of any one particular state,mississippi has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties,such that mississippi law governs the epi policy.midland,at quoting zurich ins,at.
msi was entitled to void the epi policy under mississippi law 
fireman fund next argues that,even if mississippi law govern
