civil code section section was enacted through passage of proposition in the november,general election.known as the personal responsibility act of,proposition sought to restrict the ability of uninsured motorists,convicted drunk drivers,and convicted felons to recover for losses suffered in accidents.
in this case,an uninsured motorcyclist was injured in a accident while turning across an unmarked elevated bus pad on a public roadway.we shall address whether section bars the motorcyclist from recovering noneconomic losses in his premises liability action against the private construction company that maintained control over the roadway at the time of the accident.we conclude that it does.
factual and procedural background 
the city of los angeles the city hired contracting company as the prime contractor for certain road construction work,including street widening and the installation of concrete bus pads on the road at bus stop locations,in turn,subcontracted with daniel lopez concrete construction lopez construction to construct the bus pads.retained responsibility for providing traffic control at the construction sites,which entailed the installation and maintenance of road barriers and delineators to warn motorists and others of ditches and uneven road surfaces.
one of the bus pads constructed by lopez construction was not level with the asphalt surface of the street it rose three inches above the street surface in some places.on the night of august,there were no barricades or delineators marking the differentiated height of the pad when dacus wade allen allen,who was driving his motorcycle,attempted to make a turn across the pad.allen tire caught on the elevated lip of the pad and his motorcycle fell,causing injuries to his knee.
allen brought a negligence and premises liability action against the city,and lopez construction.on the day scheduled for trial,defendants moved to preclude the introduction of evidence of allen noneconomic damages based on allen admission that he did not have liability insurance for his motorcycle at the time of the accident.the trial court granted the motion,finding the action subject to the restrictions of section.
at the close of allen case,the trial court granted a nonsuit in favor of lopez construction.subsequently,the jury found,by special verdict,that the public property in question was in a dangerous condition at the time of allen accident.although the jury found that the city was not liable because it had no actual or constructive notice of the condition,it evidently accepted allen theory that was negligent in failing to install barriers or delineators to warn of the elevated nature of the bus pad.allen was not assessed with any comparative negligence.the jury awarded allen in economic damages for his medical expenses and lost earnings.the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict and denied allen motion for a new trial.
the court of appeal reversed and remanded for a new trial.relying on hodges superior court cal th,d,hodges,the appellate court concluded that section does not apply in an action for premises liability against a private entity.
we granted review and held the matter pending our decision in day city of fontana cal th,d,day,which involved the question whether section applied in an action against two local public entities for nuisance and dangerous condition of property.
after we decided day,we ordered briefing limited to the issue whether section bars recovery of noneconomic losses in this premises liability action against a private construction company.
discussion 
section provides in pertinent part a i n any action to recover damages arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle,a person shall not recover losses to compensate for pain,suffering,inconvenience,physical impairment,disfigurement,and other nonpecuniary damages if any of the following applies the injured person was the owner of a vehicle involved in the accident and the vehicle was not insured as required by the financial responsibility laws of this state.the injured person was the operator of a vehicle involved in the accident and the operator can not establish his or her financial responsibility as required by the financial responsibility laws of this state.
in this case,the question is whether an action to recover damages arising out of a motor vehicle accident caused by a private construction company negligent creation or maintenance of a dangerous road condition is an action to recover damages arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle within the meaning of section,subdivision a.
where,as here,the issue presented is one of statutory construction,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.day,supra,cal th at,d,see people trevino cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language because it generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.people trevino,supra,cal th at,d.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.day,supra,cal th at,d.if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.ibid.ultimately we choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.any interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences is to be avoided.ibid.
applying these rules of statutory construction,we conclude that allen action falls squarely within the terms of section.first,allen did not have liability insurance on his motorcycle at the time of the accident.second,his action seeks to recover for damages that occurred when the tire of the uninsured motorcycle he was operating caught on an uneven street surface,causing his motorcycle to fall.the factual circumstances here raise no ambiguity or uncertainty as to the application of the statute,which precludes recovery of noneconomic damages in any action to recover damages arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle,subd.a,if the injured person was not insured as the owner or operator of the vehicle involved in the accident,subd.a.accordingly,allen shall not recover losses to compensate for pain,suffering,inconvenience,physical impairment,disfigurement,and other nonpecuniary damages,subd.a.
we compare the instant action with the one at issue in day,supra,cal th,d,which involved an uninsured motorcyclist who was struck by a car in an intersection.in that case,the jury determined that overgrown vegetation on public property surrounding the intersection had obstructed the motorists views and contributed to the accident.since such facts demonstrated a necessary and causal relationship between the plaintiff operation of his motorcycle and the accident for which he claimed the public entities were responsible,day concluded that the plaintiff action sought to recover damages arising out of the operation or use of that motor vehicle within the contemplation of section.day,supra,cal th at,d.
as in day,the facts here establish a necessary and causal relationship between allen operation of his uninsured motorcycle and the accident for which he claims was responsible by virtue of its negligence in creating or maintaining a dangerous road condition.just as in day,then,allen may recover for his economic losses,but he is statutorily barred from seeking noneconomic recovery.
contrary to the assertions of allen and the dissenting justices,neither hodges,supra,cal th,d,nor horwich superior court cal th,d,compels a different construction.in both cases,we found the language of section,subdivision a ambiguous with respect to the particular factual circumstances before us.hodges,supra,cal th at,d,horwich superior court,supra,cal th at,d.in hodges,which involved an uninsured plaintiff action against the manufacturer of a defective vehicle,there was no necessary connection between the plaintiff operation or use of a vehicle and the injuries he suffered.in horwich superior court,recovery of noneconomic damages was sought by a person who was not the uninsured owner or operator of the vehicle involved in the accident.since the facts in those cases raised uncertainty as to the statute application,we consulted the ballot materials accompanying proposition to determine whether section was intended to restrict the subject actions.see day,supra,cal th at,d.review of such materials led us to conclude the statute was inapplicable on the facts presented.
as explained in day,supra,cal th,d,actions seeking damages for vehicular accidents caused by dangerous road conditions are an entirely different matter.in such actions,a necessary and causal relationship generally exists between the uninsured motorist use or operation of a vehicle and the accident that occurs.see day,supra,cal th at,d.not only do actions of this sort fall squarely within a fair and objective reading of section terms,but allowing such actions advances,rather than defeats,the legislation declared purpose to change the system that rewards individuals who fail to take essential personal responsibility and to restore balance to our justice system.day,supra,cal th at,d.
and as day emphasized,nothing in hodges implied the contrary.day,supra,cal th at,d.thus,while hodges observed that a primary aim of proposition was to limit automobile insurance claims by uninsured motorists against insured motorists,that decision did not suggest it was the initiative exclusive aim.day,supra,cal th at,d.
allen points out that in day,we observed in a footnote that some of the plaintiff arguments in the case had assumed that section did not apply to premises liability actions against owners of private property.day,supra,cal th at,fn,d.but because day did not involve the liability of a private property owner,we declined to address such arguments or the possibility that other concerns may justify a different result in the case of private owners.ibid.
seizing on that footnote,allen contends there are several distinctions between his action against and the action in day.first,he argues,the fact that negligence in maintaining the construction site was the sole legal cause of his accident distinguishes his action from the one in day,wherein liability for the plaintiff damages was apportioned between a second motorist percent and the two public entities responsible for the nuisance and dangerous condition percent,cumulatively.see day,supra,cal th at,d.second,the legislative history of section,he claims,offers no basis for concluding that the statute encompasses actions involving injury caused by the ownership,occupation,or maintenance of private,as opposed to public,property 
upon careful review of day and the statutory language and history,we perceive no legitimate basis for distinguishing allen action from the action in day in assessing section application.day holding did not turn upon the factual circumstance that a second motorist was partly at fault.rather,its analysis focused on the particular action against the public entity defendants and determined that the action,which sought recovery under the theories of nuisance and dangerous condition of public property,was reasonably viewed as having arisen out of the plaintiff operation or use of his uninsured motorcycle.day,supra,cal th at,d.
more importantly,we find no evidence of legislative intent supporting allen proposal to carve out a private entity or private property exception to section application.the statutory language makes no distinction between public entity and private entity defendants in precluding recovery for noneconomic losses.to the contrary,section explicitly bars recovery of such losses in any action to recover damages arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle,subd.a,italics added,where the injured person was the owner of an uninsured vehicle involved in the accident or was the vehicle operator and can not properly establish his or her financial responsibility,subd.a.
likewise,nothing in the legislative history of the provision,as reflected in the ballot materials accompanying proposition,suggests an intent to differentiate between public defendants and private defendants,or between dangerous conditions on public property and private property.although allen correctly notes that the ballot materials contained a specific reference to the initiative impact upon public entities ballot,legis.analyst analysis of,the broad statutory language in any action leaves no doubt that section applies in all actions where the statutory prerequisites are met,including those actions brought against private persons and entities,subd.a.conversely,the implication of allen alternative construction is that the phrase in any action to recover damages arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle ibid.would have one meaning for the public entity that owned the uneven roadway and a different meaning for the private contractor that exercised control over it.such an illogical and inconsistent reading of the statute can not be what the voters intended.
in the final analysis,allen stands in the same position as the plaintiff in day.he drove his motorcycle in violation of the state financial responsibility law and got into an accident because of a roadway condition.he seeks to hold another financially responsible for his economic and noneconomic damages,even though he himself,as an uninsured motorist,could have avoided financial responsibility for any damages had he caused an accident while on the road.even if did not own the property where the elevated bus pad was situated,but merely occupied it,construing section to apply in circumstances such as these substantially advances,rather than defeats,the statute general purpose to restore balance to the justice system with respect to violators of the financial responsibility law.see day,supra,cal th at,d.
disposition 
we conclude that section bars allen from recovering noneconomic damages in his action against.the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
civil code section,an initiative measure that the voters passed in,precludes uninsured motorists who are injured in accidents from recovering noneconomic damages for their pain and suffering in day city of fontana cal th,d,day,a majority of this court applied that provision against two public entities that failed to correct or warn of a dangerous condition on public land.i disagreed and joined justice stanley mosk dissent.today,relying on day,the majority applies section in an action against private contractors responsible for a dangerous property condition.again,i dissent.
the front tire of plaintiff motorcycle caught on a high elevated lip of a bus pad defendants built on bundy drive at santa monica boulevard for the city of los angeles.the motorcycle slipped and plaintiff fell on his kneecap.the majority bars recovery for the pain and suffering plaintiff experienced from the injury.but as justice mosk pointed out in day,the voters who enacted section did not intend to limit damages for injuries to motorists based on a dangerous condition of property day,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of mosk.
drawing on this court earlier decision in hodges superior court cal th,d,justice mosk explained in day that the voters intent in enacting section was to resolve inequities involving the allocation of costs between motorists who carry automobile liability insurance and motorists who do not.day,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of mosk.the uninsured held accountable as both a punishment and incentive by the limitation on damages the who obey the financial responsibility the beneficiaries because they are relieved of paying noneconomic damages for injuries to uninsured motorists.ibid.justice mosk also noted that in hodges this court found nothing in section ballot materials suggesting that such punishment or incentive was also should be benefit other defendants not reasonably included among those who play by the rules or take personal responsibility or pick up the tab for the skyrocket ing costs of automobile insurance.day,supra,at,d,dis.opn.of mosk.
i agreed with justice mosk dissent in day that it follow ed ineluctably from our analysis in hodges that liability for a dangerous condition on public property did not come within the purview of civil code section.day,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of mosk.public entities that fail to maintain a safe roadway and do not contribute to the relevant insurance pool are not among those who play by the rules or take personal responsibility or pick up the tab for skyrocketing automobile insurance costs.ibid.justice mosk also stressed that public policy was better served by fully c ompensating the victims of injuries caused by unsafe design or maintenance of public streets because doing so would operate as a strong incentive for cities and counties to prevent or abate dangerous conditions,thus minimizing risks to the public.day,supra,cal th at,d.
so too in this case in which the duty to prevent or abate a dangerous condition on property fell to private contractors rather than public entities.the majority holding here weakens the incentive for such contractors to protect the motoring public from dangerous roadway conditions that the contractors themselves have created.furthermore,the majority holding is contrary to the voters intent in enacting section limitation on damages.accordingly,i dissent.
the majority expansive interpretation of proposition,enacted as civil code section section,produces a result that surely was not contemplated by the voters who passed this initiative.according to the majority,a private contractor that maintains a dangerous condition on property is excused from bearing the cost of injuries caused by its negligent behavior when the injured party happens to be an uninsured motorist.because there is no suggestion in either the language or the legislative history of section that it was intended to apply in the case of a negligent private contractor,i respectfully dissent.
the majority reaches its conclusion by relying on our decision in day fontana cal th,d,day,where we held that under section,an uninsured motorist is precluded from recovering noneconomic damages in an action against a public entity.i disagree for three reasons.first,i question the day majority broad reading of proposition,given our previous discussion of this initiative in hodges superior court cal th,d,hodges and horwich superior court cal th,d,horwich.instead,i agree with the dissent in day that the intent of the voters in passing proposition was to benefit motorists who obey the financial responsibility laws and not to insulate negligent public entities from liability.day,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of mosk.second,i believe that day is distinguishable from the present case.the position of the negligent private contractor in this case is more similar to that of an automobile manufacturer,which in hodges we found was not protected by section,than to a public entity,which in day we determined was protected by the provisions of section.third,i find that the majority decision implicates serious public policy concerns that should preclude the extension of our holding in day to insulate a private contractor from liability for noneconomic damages.for these reasons,i conclude that section does not prevent an uninsured motorist from recovering noneconomic damages from a negligent private contractor.
on august,dacus wade allen was injured in a accident as he attempted to make a right turn across an elevated concrete bus pad,which was under construction.the front tire of his motorcycle caught on a raised lip of the concrete pad.allen motorcycle slipped from under him and fell onto his knee,injuring him.
the city of los angeles had awarded contracting company a contract to perform certain road construction work at the site of allen accident.had entered into a subcontract with daniel lopez concrete construction lopez construction to provide concrete work,including the construction of bus pads,as the prime contractor,was responsible for traffic control,including the installation and maintenance of road barriers to mark uneven road surfaces to protect both motorists and pedestrians from injury.prior to the accident in this case,the city of los angeles project inspector had issued three written warnings to regarding deficiencies in its traffic control plan,including the lack of barriers necessary to protect vehicular and pedestrian traffic.on august,the date of the accident in this case,the disparity in height between the road surface and the bus pad had existed for at least days.
allen brought a personal injury and premises liability action against,lopez construction,and the city of los angeles.on the day of trial,defendants sought an order barring allen from presenting evidence of general damages based on his admission that he did not have automobile liability insurance at the time of the accident.the trial court granted defendants motion and,at the close of allen evidence,granted a nonsuit in favor of lopez construction.the jury returned a defense verdict in favor of the city of los angeles,but it found liable,and awarded allen in medical expenses and in lost earnings.the jury found that allen was not comparatively negligent.the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict.
the court of appeal reversed and remanded for a new trial,to permit allen to present evidence of his noneconomic damages.in a decision filed before we issued our opinion in day,the court of appeal applied our analysis of section in hodges.the court of appeal determined there is no indication either the electorate or the sponsors of proposition intended to protect from premises liability claims road construction companies who do not contribute to the automobile insurance pool and whose other insurance rates are not affected by the existence of uninsured motorists.thus,the court of appeal concluded that section did not preclude allen from recovering noneconomic damages from a private contractor.
i disagree with the majority determination that the present action falls squarely within the language of section.instead,as we have previously concluded in both hodges,supra,cal th,d,and horwich,supra,cal th,d,the statutory language is ambiguous therefore,we must look to the legislative history to determine whether proposition was intended to apply to a premises liability action against a private contractor.
in hodges,the first case in which we interpreted section,we found that the language of section,specifically the phrase any action to recover damages arising out of the operation or use of a motor vehicle,was not pellucid.hodges,supra,cal th at,d.the majority in the present case contends that in hodges we found the statutory language of section,subdivision a ambiguous only with respect to a products liability action against an automobile manufacturer.i disagree.while in hodges the statutory ambiguity revealed itself in the context of a products liability action against a manufacturer,it was the language itself,specifically the phrases arising out of and operation or use,that we found to be unclear.hodges,at,d,nor,as we have previously observed,is the sense of the phrase arising out of transparent.given this ambiguity,we looked to the legislative history to discern whether the voters intended proposition to apply in the case of an action against an automobile manufacturer.hodges,at,d.
in horwich,we again determined that the language in section was not pellucid,this time with respect to the words person and injured person.horwich,supra,cal th at,d.we further stated that i t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.citations.id.at,d.as in hodges,it was the vagueness of the language itself,rather than the facts of the case,that made us look beyond the words of the provision to the legislative history in order to determine its intended scope.horwich,at,d.
in day,a majority of this court found that the action in that case,in which an uninsured motorist sought to re
