for a second time this case comes to us on appeal.see ferrara dimercurio paul mercury ins,cir hereinafter ferrara i.the facts have not changed.
background 
on july,the commercial fishing vessel two friends was destroyed by a fire.ferrara dimercurio,owner of the vessel,sought to recover insurance under a hull policy issued by paul mercury insurance company paul.paul denied coverage after its investigation ended with a determination of arson,which it understood to be excluded from coverage under the policy.thereafter,brought an action in the district court claiming that paul refusal to pay was a breach of the insurance contract and constituted bad faith in violation of massachusetts general laws ch.after a first trial ended in a hung jury,a second trial ended with the court directing a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.
at the time the district court directed a plaintiff verdict,the court accepted that paul would not be liable could it prove its affirmative defense that the fire was deliberately set by the insured.but the court ruled that the evidence put forward was legally insufficient for a jury to find that plaintiff had deliberately set its boat on fire.paul had also asserted that it would be exempt from liability were the fire found to have been deliberately set by an unknown third party,relying upon the language of an exclusion for malicious acts found in the strikes,riots,and civil commotions clause.however,the court construed that provision as excluding from coverage only those fires deliberately set by third parties in the context of civil unrest,a setting absent here.
on appeal,this court disagreed with the district court rulings,reversing and remanding the case for a third trial.we held that the clause excluded from coverage all fires whether or not arising in the context of civil unrest that were deliberately set by third parties.see ferrara i,at.notwithstanding the clause title strikes,riots and civil commotions we stated 
malicious acts is set forth in the clause as a separate,unmodified exclusion from coverage n othing in the plain language and grammar of the clause supports the district court constriction of excludable malicious acts to only those acts perpetrated within the context of one or more of the other events.nor,in our view,would an objectively reasonable insured interpret the malicious acts exclusion so narrowly.
hence,to limit the phrase,malicious acts,to just those activities related to the former categories would be to render the malicious acts provision redundant,an interpretation running counter to the customary assumption that all words within a clause serve some purpose 
here,the malicious acts in question are not,as a practical matter,arson by the owner or its agents,which are actions separately excluded from coverage by law,but the rarer acts of by vandals or other malicious individuals.such acts fall within the general category of intentional violence which can be said to be a principal overall theme of the clause.the malicious acts category serves the relevant purpose of excluding destructive acts not public or tumultuous enough to be considered a riot or civil commotion.in sum,the clause unambiguously excludes from coverage losses caused by malicious acts,including arson,whether or not the malicious acts occur in the context of one or more of the other events listed in the clause.thus,on remand,the jury should be permitted to determine whether the fire on july,was deliberately set by third parties.should the jury answer that question in the affirmative,paul would not be liable under the hull policy.
id.at citations and quotation marks omitted.
having reversed the district court holding that arson by a third party was only a defense when occurring during civil unrest,this court also reversed the district court other conclusion that the evidence at trial was legally insufficient to support the insurer defense.we determined that evidence in the record of motive and opportunity on the part of to commit arson was such that reasonable jurors could determine that plaintiff deliberately set fire to the two friends in order to fraudulently obtain the proceeds of the insurance policy.id.at.
the parties returned to district court to prepare for a third trial,this time before yet a third judge,judge harrington.based upon their mutual understanding of this court decision in ferrara i,both parties agreed that the following single question would be submitted to the jury to be answered yes or no do you find that the defendant,paul mercury insurance company,has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the fire was of an incendiary nature or deliberately set.this question was apparently meant to incorporate both holdings of ferrara i,entitling paul to the defense of arson by third parties as well as to the defense of.the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant paul,answering yes to the special verdict.appeals.
unlike in ferrara i,when we were faced with,among other issues,the task of construing somewhat unusual language in the insurance policy,this time the issues presented are more commonplace.claims reversible error on the basis of certain evidentiary rulings,any one of which,argues,entitles it to a fourth trial.we disagree.also appeals from the district court denial of plaintiff motion for sanctions.for the reasons that follow,we affirm all of the rulings below.
ii.legal analyses of evidentiary issues 
having recited the facts in our first opinion,we need not repeat all of them here.for a more complete account,we refer the reader to ferrara i,at.we report here only those facts that are relevant to the three evidentiary issues raised on this appeal.the three evidentiary issues are as a the propriety of allowing the jury to hear evidence of the principal shareholders alleged motive and opportunity to burn their own boat b the propriety of admitting into evidence against the expert testimony of john malcolm regarding the cause and origin of the fire c the effectiveness of the district court curative instruction to the jury to strike and disregard an answer provided on by john malcolm regarding information that was subject to a protective order.we discuss each of these issues in turn below.
motive and opportunity evidence to burn the two friends 
prior to trial,the district court engaged in an extended colloquy with both parties over the relevance and potential prejudice of defendant proffer to present evidence of financial hardship,a proffer,defendant argued,that would tend to prove that had a motive,in addition to the opportunity,to burn their boat,the two friends.plaintiff objected to this evidence on the ground that it was irrelevant.all parties having agreed that the sole question put to the jury would be do you find that the defendant,paul mercury insurance company,has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the fire was of an incendiary nature or deliberately set,plaintiff sought to persuade judge harrington that evidence of either motive or opportunity to commit arson would be irrelevant to a determination of the ultimate issue.then,as now,plaintiff argued that evidence of motive and opportunity to start a fire aboard the two friends was irrelevant to the only explicit question to be answered by the whether or not the fire aboard the two friends was intentional.as an alternative,plaintiff argued that the prejudicial effect of evidence that shareholders had a motive and opportunity to burn their boat substantially outweighed its probative value.
at various times during the conference,judge harrington pressed plaintiff counsel for a persuasive explanation of why evidence of motive and opportunity was irrelevant to the ultimate issue of incendiarism.like judge harrington,we are puzzled by plaintiff constricted interpretation of relevance as defined by federal rule of evidence.consider the evidence that ultimately came out at the trial 
the two friends was locked at the time the fire started.no sign of forced entry into the vessel was found.as both parties experts agreed that the fire began inside the vessel,paul was faced with the obstacle of explaining,in order to establish that the fire was deliberately set,how an arsonist be it the insured or a third party gained access to the vessel.this goes to opportunity.
as it turned out,there were four keys to the two friends,three in the hands of the and one hanging in a warehouse adjacent to where the boat was moored.the undisputed testimony was that all four keys were in their expected places shortly after the fire.the owner of the warehouse testified that access to the key hanging in the warehouse was not closely guarded,however,and that it was possible that before july,somebody could have illicitly taken the key from the warehouse and made a copy of it.no evidence was put before the jury of anyone being seen near the boat between the hours of on july,when leo ferrara locked the boat after a fishing trip,and the following morning,when the gloucester fire department responded to the fire after a lengthy investigation that led paul investigators to the conclusion that,due to the burn patterns inside the vessel,the fire had been deliberately set,paul set out to investigate why someone who might have access to the two friends would wish to destroy it.this goes to motive.
evidence was presented that the plaintiff company,along with its principle shareholders various members of the family,was in dire financial trouble.the company,organized as a commercial fishing venture in,was losing money and was unable to meet its mortgage payments on the vessel to gloucester bank trust company.in fact,had operated at a loss since its inception.as the company fell further behind in its payments,the bank threatened to foreclose not only on the boat mortgage,but on the collateral that was pledged on the loan for the two friends,such as the personal homes of the individual shareholders.
despite successfully negotiating various repayment plans,continued to have difficulties making timely payments to the bank.so,in april,in an effort to quell those financial troubles,and gloucester bank trust company agreed that would attempt to sell the two friends for,a sum that was less than the price paid for the vessel in and significantly less than the outstanding balance of the debts owing,which totaled more than.the jury heard testimony that the boat was insured for under a hull policy issued to in by paul,a sum which if collected by might have protected the homes of the ferraras and dimercurios from foreclosure.
the standard for admissibility under federal rule of evidence is a liberal one.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without that evidence.we think the existence of a motive and an opportunity to burn an undisputedly locked boat from the tends to make the disputed the fire aboard the two friends was an act of probable,especially in light of the conflicting expert testimony as to incendiarism.see part infra.given especially the nisi prius court superior vantage point for discerning relevance and the broad discretion accorded to it in doing so,see,united states tierney,cir,we can find no error in judge harrington determination of relevance.
unpersuaded,as are we,by plaintiff argument under,judge harrington pushed plaintiff to move forward,on to the balancing required by federal rule of evidence as with rule,the district courts have considerable discretion in calibrating the rule scales.united states griffin,cir.this is primarily because rule balancing is a quintessentially enterprise and the trial judge is in the best position to make such assessments.udemba nicoli,cir.only in extraordinarily compelling we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.id.citing freeman package machinery,cir.
after a lengthy discussion,judge harrington took the matter of rule balancing under advisement.two weeks later,on the first day of trial but before jury empaneling began,judge harrington informed counsel that he would allow defendant to proffer evidence of motive and opportunity as he determined that such evidence probative value outweighs any prejudice to the plaintiff.
plaintiff arguments to the contrary,it is not the case that judge harrington decision was arbitrary or unfounded or that he failed to provide a reasoned decision for admitting the evidence despite its prejudicial effect.see brief for the appellants at.the colloquy during which the district court explained its difficulties with plaintiff position provides ample support for the district court ruling allowing defendant to put before the jury evidence of plaintiff motive and opportunity to burn its own boat.the matter of the admissibility of this evidence and its prejudicial effect was debated at length,with due consideration to the rulings we made in ferrara i and the nature of the evidence as a whole.
judge harrington correctly isolated the issue as one of balancing prejudice against the demonstrably probative value of the motive and opportunity proffer.as we have said in the past,
the fact that a piece of evidence hurts a party chances does not mean it should automatically be excluded.if that were true,there would be precious little left in the way of probative evidence in any case.the question is one of unfair of prejudice alone.
onujiogu united states,cir quotation marks omitted.see also dollar long manufacturing,cir virtually all evidence is prejudicial or it is material.the prejudice must be unfair,cert.denied,d.although evidence of motive and opportunity would plainly further defendant case at the plaintiff expense,plaintiff failed to show unfair prejudice.given this,and the obvious relevance of the evidence to the defendant affirmative defense,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied motion to exclude.
john malcolm expert testimony as to cause and origin 
much of the trial before judge harrington was a battle between the experts concerning whether the fire was accidental or of incendiary origin.defendant expert,john malcolm,concluded that the fire on the two friends had three points of origin and was deliberately set.plaintiff expert,paul sullivan,testified that an accidental electrical fire started in the lower electrical panel and exploded in a igniting everything in the compartments of the vessel.
beyond the conflicting expert opinions,the battle also raged over whether john malcolm should be allowed to testify as paul expert.it is on this issue that appeals.contends that john malcolm should not have been permitted to render an expert opinion as to cause and origin because his opinion was based on unreliable data,viz,data not collected by him personally and paul failed to supplement its expert disclosures to include malcolm testimony regarding cause and origin.before going into the merits of these arguments,we recount the history of malcolm involvement in this case.
as soon as four days after the fire,paul had hired fred as its expert to investigate the origin and cause of the fire.fred then hired john malcolm as an electrical systems expert to assist him in that investigation.on july,the two men began their investigation on site in gloucester where the boat remained moored.
and malcolm worked closely with each other.malcolm testified that together,sometimes with malcolm holding the measuring tape for,the two took measurements of the vessel in preparation for producing scale drawings to assist in the investigation and their report.although malcolm job for which had retained him was to pay close attention to the boat electrical system,the two men worked in tandem,often each other observations and analyses by calling each other over to various burn sites on the vessel to coordinate their data collection and inquiries.
during the first two trials,and malcolm both testified as experts,as to the fire cause and origin and malcolm as to related but narrower questions concerning the fire and the boat electrical system.unfortunately,however,between the first appeal and the third trial,died.for the third trial,then,instead of replacing with an outside expert,defendant decided that malcolm would testify as paul only fire expert,providing opinions on both cause and origin and the vessel electrical system.this decision is the source of objection regarding the admissibility of malcolm testimony.argued to the district court,as it does to us now,that malcolm was not competent to testify as to cause and origin as his testimony was principally based not on his own observations but on those made by.also argues that designating malcolm as a expert so close to trial unduly prejudiced their case against paul.at least,contends,paul should have supplemented its interrogatory answers and expert reports to include malcolm anticipated expanded testimony.
to the extent,if at all,that is complaining that malcolm lacked qualifications sufficient for the court to permit him to testify as a expert,that complaint is unavailing.after considering malcolm training and experience,the district court,acting pursuant to federal rule of evidence,ruled that malcolm was qualified.that ruling fell within the broad purview of the trial court discretion.see diefenbach sheridan,cir it is that trial judges have broad discretionary powers in determining the qualification,and thus,admissibility,of expert witnesses.citing richmond steel puerto rican am.ins,cir.malcolm qualifications as a fire analyst are,in fact,considerable.he has master and journeyman electrical licenses from massachusetts and new hampshire he has been consulting as a fire investigator since and,in,he was qualified as a certified fire investigator by the international association of arson investigators.malcolm had been qualified twice before as an expert in this case to render an opinion regarding the electrical system contribution to the fire aboard the vessel after hearing malcolm testimony regarding his knowledge,skill,experience and training in fire analysis,judge harrington exercised sound discretion in concluding that malcolm was qualified to render an expert opinion on cause and origin as well as on the vessel electrical system.see richmond steel,at.
rule objection 
next objection,although not crafted as such,is essentially a rule objection.claims that malcolm opinion as to cause and origin was based on unreliable data,viz,data provided by the late fred and not that which was collected through malcolm own personal observation.
a major problem with this argument is that malcolm himself had visited the fire scene and examined the evidence there side by side with.besides looking at burn patterns and studying the electrical system,he took measurements and photographs and wrote his own report.he also interviewed the vessel engineer.many photographs of evidence at the scene were entered into evidence by stipulation.hence,it is simply not the case that malcolm opinion rested mainly upon investigations.
to be sure,malcolm opinion coincided with and he testified that he read report in preparation for his expert testimony,along with the report of the local fire department.but the opinion he rendered was his own,and,as said,he had knowledge of the fire scene and the observable facts there upon which to base that opinion.federal rule of evidence allows malcolm to have taken report and opinion into account when forming his own expert opinion.so long as the basis of malcolm opinion did not extend beyond facts or data of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.we think a expert like malcolm could be expected to examine the report of another expert like as well as the fire department report in the course of forming his own opinion derived from a variety of sources,including his own knowledge of the primary evidence at the fire scene.see almonte national union fire ins,cir.
this court has said that when an expert relies on the opinion of another,such reliance goes to the weight,not to the admissibility of the expert opinion.see forrestal magendantz,cir.see also newell puerto rico,rubbermaid,cir when the factual underpinning of an expert opinion is weak,it is a matter affecting the weight and credibility of the question to be resolved by the jury.in the present case,the jury understood that malcolm observations coincided with those of the deceased expert hired by defendant and that,until recently,malcolm only job was to advise and supplement conclusions as to the cause and origin of the fire with his own opinion concerning the role of the vessel electrical system in the fire.thus,in weighing and evaluating malcolm opinion,the jury was able to determine whether it was in some way weakened by reliance upon.
we find no error in the district court ruling that malcolm opinion as to cause and origin was properly admitted.
no prejudice in expert designation 
next objection to malcolm testimony is that was prejudiced by malcolm tardy designation as the expert.on june,at the first conference before judge harrington following the mandate from this court,paul informed both and the district court of its decision to proceed without a replacement for and with malcolm as both its expert and its electrical systems expert.the trial was set for october,more than three months later.contends that three months before the trial was too late to be designating a new expert.furthermore,contends that had paul wished to avoid the prejudice of such a tardy expert designation,paul should have supplemented its answers to interrogatories naming malcolm as the substitute expert for the late and disclosing the content of his expanded testimony.
at a final conference on october,judge harrington heard arguments and informed both parties that as long as defendant could qualify malcolm as an expert on cause and origin,his testimony as to cause and origin would be admitted.also at that conference,judge harrington allowed plaintiff to add an expert to its witness list paul sullivan under the condition that defendant be given the opportunity to depose the additional expert before the trial.plaintiff did not request additional time to depose malcolm,however,presumably because malcolm had testified previously as an electrical expert at both trials and because paul represented that malcolm testimony as to cause and origin would be substantially similar to the late testimony on cause and origin.
we find no merit in argument that june,was too late to designate a new expert.itself designated a replacement expert less than two weeks before trial.however,rightly objects to paul failure to supplement its interrogatory answers or its expert reports naming malcolm as the substitute expert for the late and adding malcolm expanded testimony pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see.e requiring a party to supplement its answers to interrogatories in order to inform another party of a material change in or addition to information contained in an expert report.as we have stated,t his supplementation requirement increases the quality and fairness of the trial by narrowing the issues and eliminat ing surprise.licciardi tig ins.group,cir alterations in original quotation marks and citations omitted.the question here is whether paul failure to adhere strictly to the requirements of rule e failing to substitute malcolm for as its expert in their expert the reason for the rule and materially prejudiced in its efforts to present its case.
a careful review of the record convinces us that suffered no actual prejudice.first,in fact had notice of malcolm designation as the expert as early as june,more than three months before the trial date.see newell puerto rico,at.moved neither to redepose malcolm as paul did of newly designated expert paul sullivan nor for a continuance of the trial.
second,there was no meaningful change in the testimony presented by paul regarding cause and origin from the first trial to the third.the only consequential change to which objects was that testimony was replaced by similar testimony from malcolm.yet not only was malcolm testimony similar to,malcolm himself was not an unknown quantity to.he had testified as an expert witness in the two previous trials and had made clear as early as in
