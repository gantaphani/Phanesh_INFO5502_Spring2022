in this case,the petitioner,western heritage insurance company western heritage provided a defense to its insured,a commercial provider of home healthcare services,in an action for damages resulting from an automobile accident.the claim arose from an accident in which the insured employee drove in an allegedly negligent manner and the plaintiffs decedent,her passenger,was injured.in addition to allegations that the insured employee negligently caused the accident,it is also claimed that she failed to seek or obtain medical treatment for the decedent following the accident and he later died from his injuries.the claim against the insured was based on the allegation that the employee had been acting in the course and scope of her employment.thus,the insured alleged liability was vicarious in nature.
western heritage provided a defense to not only the insured,but also to the employee.it did so under a reservation of rights to dispute coverage under the general liability policy that it had previously issued to the insured.see fn,post.during proceedings,the employee failed to provide verified discovery responses or appear for her deposition,all in violation of the trial court orders.at this point,it was disclosed that western heritage had filed an answer on the employee behalf without having been in contact with her.as a result,her answer was stricken and her default was entered.western heritage,in order to protect its own interests,timely moved to intervene in the action.the trial court granted that motion but,at the request of the plaintiffs,subsequently ordered that western heritage could only dispute damages,not the liability of the employee 
western heritage filed a petition for a writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause and a stay of further trial court proceedings.after a review of the record and the relevant case law,we have concluded that the trial court order was erroneous.western heritage,as an intervenor,has the right to assert,on its own behalf,all defenses that otherwise would be available to the insured parties whether as to liability or damages.we will therefore grant the requested writ relief.
factual and procedural background 
this action was filed on may,by the plaintiffs and real parties in interest herein,william parks and paula parks the parks and the estate of george brooks parks decedent the parks are the adult children of decedent who died following an automobile accident which occurred on september.the decedent had been a passenger in a vehicle being driven by julia reyes reyes which,due at least in part to her alleged negligence,collided with another vehicle.at the time of the accident,reyes was acting in the course and scope of her employment by gratefull home care,ghc.both reyes and ghc were named as defendants in plaintiffs complaint plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on or about november,and alleged seven causes of action,including vehicular negligence wrongful death and general negligence negligent hiring wrongful death 
allegations of plaintiffs complaint 
on or about august,ghc and decedent entered into a contract pursuant to which ghc agreed to provide decedent with home healthcare services.in order to induce the execution of the healthcare agreement,ghc had made certain representations to the parks as to the quality of the healthcare services that would be provided to the decedent as well as to the competence of the caregiver employee who would be assigned by ghc to provide those services to decedent.
on september,such agreement was in full force and effect and reyes was the assigned caregiver.at on that date,reyes was acting in the course and scope of her employment by ghc and was driving her own vehicle in which decedent was a passenger.at the intersection of wilshire boulevard and stanley avenue in the city of los angeles,reyes was attempting to make a left turn when her vehicle was struck by the castellon vehicle.the collision was due to the negligence of both reyes and the driver of the castellon vehicle.
after the accident,decedent,who suffered from dementia,complained of head pain.reyes did not seek or obtain medical treatment for him,but simply took him home,gave him his dementia medication,and put him to bed.the next morning,decedent was found dead.the cause of death was a brain injury that decedent had suffered as a result of the accident.
in addition to the alleged negligence of reyes in operating her vehicle and failing to obtain medical care,plaintiffs also allege that ghc had represented that reyes was an experienced and competent caregiver and that she had cleared a background check.such representations were false and,in fact,ghc had not even required reyes to fill out an application for her employment as a caregiver,had never verified her experience,had never determined her level of competence and had never completed a background check on her 
western heritage provides a defense 
western heritage had issued a general liability policy to ghc on january,which policy was in effect on the date of the accident.the defense of this action was tendered to western heritage on or about may,and the insurer agreed to provide a defense to both ghc and reyes subject to a reservation of rights in discharge of such defense responsibility,western heritage retained counsel to represent ghc and reyes.an answer to plaintiffs complaint was timely filed on behalf of both.
reyes default is entered 
subsequent to the filing of reyes answer,plaintiffs made requests for discovery from reyes.in addition,they noticed her deposition.despite multiple court orders requiring her to do so,reyes failed to provide verified responses to such discovery requests and failed to appear for her deposition on april,pursuant to the request of plaintiffs,reyes answer was stricken and her default was entered by the trial court clerk.however,no default judgment was ever requested or entered.
western heritage is permitted to intervene 
on june,western heritage filed an ex parte motion seeking leave to file a complaint in intervention in order to protect its own interests in light of the striking of reyes answer and the entering of her default.western heritage claimed that it had a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and its ultimate outcome in light of the provisions of insurance code,section,subdivision b it expressly sought leave to intervene in order to dispute the issues of liability and damages against reyes.italics added.the trial court,on july,granted western heritage intervention motion.
the scope of western heritage role at trial is limited 
at the time that western heritage filed its motion to intervene,plaintiffs motions in limine were pending.one such motion sought to preclude defendants from disputing reyes liability on her behalf because she is in default and she is not represented.the motion was granted however,as the motion was made prior to western heritage motion to intervene,western heritage never had an opportunity to oppose it.a dispute subsequently arose as to whether western heritage would be permitted to litigate the issue of reyes liability at trial.
on january,at a hearing intended to resolve the issue of how western heritage would be identified at trial plaintiffs counsel argued that western heritage should be identified as an insurer for the defaulted reyes,present only to dispute the amount of damages.counsel for apollo couriers joined this argument,stating that because reyes had defaulted,she could not contest her liability the other driver,and that,as western heritage was stepping into her shoes,it could not do so either.the trial court agreed,and concluded that western heritage could litigate only damages.
thereafter,western heritage filed a formal motion in limine,in an effort to persuade the trial court to change its ruling.on april,the trial court reaffirmed its earlier ruling and held that western heritage had no greater rights to litigate liability than its insured would have had.as its insured reyes had defaulted,western heritage could not litigate liability the trial court expressly relied on the case of kaufman broad communities,performance plastering,th,kaufman broad as the basis for its ruling.
western heritage filed a timely petition for writ relief in this court.we issued an order to show cause and stayed further trial court proceedings.
contentions 
western heritage argues that as an intervening party,its right to litigate all issues can not be abridged denial of the right of an intervening insurer to contest liability of a defaulted insured as well as the issue of damages would undermine and defeat the whole purpose of the intervention right and an intervening insurer is not subrogated and thus limited to the rights of its insured,but rather has rights independent of the insured.in opposition,plaintiffs do not attempt to justify the trial court ruling on the bases on which it was obtained.instead,they argue,for the first time,that the trial court ruling can be upheld due to the facts that western heritage never filed a formal motion to vacate reyes default and western heritage was providing a defense to ghc and reyes under a reservation of rights.
as we explain,we believe that western heritage has the better of the argument.as an intervening insurer,its rights do not depend on,nor are they limited by,the rights of the defaulted insured.thus,it is irrelevant that western heritage made no formal set aside motion nor does it matter that it was providing a defense under a reservation of rights.we will therefore grant western heritage petition for writ relief and will remand with directions.
discussion 
general principles relating to insurer intervention in third party action against its insured 
as already noted see fn,ante,section b provides insurance policies issued in california shall either contain the following provision or shall be construed as if this provision is in the policy a provision that whenever judgment is secured against the insured or the executor or administrator of a deceased insured in an action based upon bodily injury,death,or property damage,then an action may be brought against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment.thus,a judgment creditor who has prevailed in a lawsuit against an insured party may bring a direct action against the insurer subject to the terms and limitations of the policy.citation.kaufman broad,supra,th at.
this exposure to such direct liability has been repeatedly held sufficient to create a basis for insurer intervention in a third party action against the insured intervention may be allowed in the insurance context,where third party claimants are involved,when the insurer is allowed to take over in litigation if its insured is not defending an action,to avoid harm to the insurer.royal indemnity united enterprises,th.
thus,for example,insurers have been permitted to intervene when the third party has obtained a default against the insured.clemmer hartford insurance cal d,clemmer nasongkhla gonzalez th supp,nasongkhla.similarly,an insurer may intervene when its insured answer has been stricken because its corporate status has been suspended.reliance ins.superior court th,reliance.as the reliance court explained,intervention by an insurer is permitted where the insurer remains liable for any default judgment against the insured,and it has no means other than intervention to litigate liability or damage issues.reliance,supra,th at.
thus,it is apparent that the trial court did not err in granting western heritage motion to intervene.western heritage had provided a defense to its insured ghc and its insured employee reyes.when that employee defaulted,there was a risk that western heritage could be liable for any judgment entered against reyes under section b.therefore,western heritage had a sufficient interest to justify intervention.
the trial court erroneously limited western heritage intervention rights to damage issues 
there are three bases on which western heritage contends the trial court limitation of its intervention right was erroneous a the trial court misperceived the scope of intervention b the entire purpose of allowing an insurer to intervene in an underlying action is to permit it to litigate liability and damages issues its insured is barred from litigating and c the trial court erroneously treated western heritage as subrogated to,and thus limited by,reyes rights.we discuss each of these arguments separately.
a.an intervening party is not bound by another party procedural defaults 
a n intervener becomes an actual party to the suit by virtue of the order authorizing him to intervene.deutschmann sears,roebuck d,deutschmann.indeed,the complaint in should not only set forth the grounds upon which the intervention rests,it should also comply with the rules applicable to pleadings generally weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
an intervener is not limited by every procedural decision made by a party with which it is aligned.deutschmann,supra,d at.in deutschmann,the court considered the situation of an insurer which intervened in an action brought by its insured against a third party for damages caused by a fire.the insurer had paid for repairs to the property and was subrogated in interest to its insured.after the insurer intervened,the trial court dismissed the complaint of the insured,on the basis that the insured failed to timely file proof of service of the summons.the trial court also dismissed the complaint in intervention of the insurer,on the basis that its interest was subrogated to that of the insured id.at.on appeal,the dismissal of the insurer complaint in intervention was reversed,as the lack of prosecution on the part of the plaintiff did not deprive the intervener of its cause of action.id.at.
although,in deutschmann,the insurer claim was based on its right of subrogation,the court reasoning has equal application in this case.just as a plaintiff procedural default does not bar the claim of an intervening party aligned with the plaintiff,a defendant procedural default does not bar the defense of an intervening party aligned with the defendant.a party permitted to intervene is permitted to do so in order to pursue its own interests.once permitted to intervene,it is a party to the action not bound by other parties procedural defaults.
cases permitting insurers to intervene do so in order to allow the insurers to litigate liability and damages issues their insureds are prevented from litigating 
as we discussed above,case authority is in agreement that insurers may intervene in third party actions brought against their insureds in order to protect their own interests when their insureds are unable to defend.while no case expressly considers whether the intervening insurers are then entitled to litigate liability and damages issues that their insureds are barred from litigating,this conclusion necessarily follows.indeed,there would be no purpose in allowing an insurer to intervene in order to protect its own interests but then limit scope of the insurer defense to those issues to which its insured,because of the default,is limited to pursuing.
this is reflected in the language of the cases.in reliance,supra,th,the trial court denied the insurer permission to intervene to represent its own interests when its insured could not defend because its corporate status had been suspended.in reversing this order as an abuse of discretion,the reliance court stated that intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case,since the insurer almost certainly will assert the same defenses which would have been asserted by its insured if its insured s corporate status had not been suspended.id.at.similarly,in nasongkhla,the trial court erred in denying an insurer motion to intervene in an action in which the insured default had been entered.the reviewing court stated,unless the insurer is allowed to intervene,it may have no other opportunity to litigate fault or damage issues in any action brought by plaintiff on its judgment under insurance code section.nasongkhla,supra,th at supp.
it is therefore apparent that an intervening insurer is not limited to those defenses to which its insured might be restricted due to the procedural default.the entire purpose of the intervention is to permit the insurer to pursue its own interests,which necessarily include the litigation of defenses its insured is procedurally barred from pursuing.
limitations purportedly imposed when an insurer claim is based on subrogation have no application in this case 
using an argument they no longer pursue in this writ proceeding,plaintiffs convinced the trial court that western heritage must stand in the defaulted shoes of reyes,by relying on language from kaufman broad,which states that,i n asserting a subrogation claim,the insurer stands in the shoes of its insured,and has no greater rights than its insured.citation.because the insured can not pursue its rights in litigation,the insurer can not do what its insured can not do and is similarly barred.kaufman broad,supra,th at.there are two reasons why this language is inapplicable to the instant case,and does not limit the arguments that western heritage may pursue.
first,western heritage is not here pursuing a subrogation claim.western heritage seeks to defend an action against its procedurally defaulted insured,in order to protect its own interests,which are implicated due to section b.thus,any law relating to subrogation simply does not apply.
second,it is not true that insurers pursuing subrogation claims stand in the shoes of their insureds at all times.the language quoted from kaufman broad stating that subrogated insurers stand in the shoes of their insureds was not part of its holding,but was part of its discussion of the law of an earlier case.truck,supra,th.truck,in turn,discussed subrogation only in dicta,as truck was concerned with a claim for equitable contribution.in truck,two insurers of a suspended corporation sued their insured to rescind their policies.as the insured was suspended,it could present no defense.a third insurer,which had a potential claim for equitable contribution against the two plaintiff insurers,sought to intervene on behalf of the common insured in order to oppose the plaintiff insurers attempt to rescind their policies.id.at.the truck court held that intervention was proper.the court,in dicta,distinguished the situation of an insurer pursuing a subrogation claim,rather than a claim in equitable contribution,on the basis that an insurer with a subrogation claim has no greater rights than its insured.id.at.the kaufman broad court discussed this language from truck because,subsequent to truck,the legislature amended the revenue and taxation code in order to provide that,although a corporation suspended for nonpayment of taxes may not defend an action,the corporation insurer may provide such a defense,and prosecute any related subrogation rights.kaufman broad,supra,th at.thereafter,the kaufman broad court held that an insurer could not pursue these rights by simply litigating in the name of its suspended insured if the insurer wanted to continue to defend the action against its suspended insured and pursue its subrogation rights in that action,it was required to intervene.id.at.moreover,while kaufman broad concluded that the amended statute permitted intervention to pursue a subrogation claim with respect to a suspended corporate insured in certain circumstances,deutschmann had previously concluded that an intervening insurer could pursue a subrogation claim on the part of a procedurally defaulted insured.deutschmann,supra,d at.thus,while an insurer subrogation claim would be bound by a decision on the merits in the insured action,id.at,certain procedural bars to the insured action would not bar an insurer subrogation claim.the language in kaufman broad quoted out of context by plaintiffs simply does not support plaintiffs argument.
western heritage was not required to vacate the default entered against reyes 
having concluded that the trial court order can not be upheld on any basis on which it was entered,we now turn to the arguments raised by plaintiffs for the first time in this writ proceeding.plaintiffs first such argument is that since western heritage did not seek to set aside the default entered against reyes,it has no basis to complain about the trial court intervention limitation order.we reject this argument.
the seeds of plaintiffs argument were planted in clemmer.in clemmer,the third party obtained a default judgment against the insured,then brought a direct action against the insurer under section b.clemmer,supra,cal d at.the insurer argued that it should not be bound by the amount of the default judgment because it did not have an opportunity to defend.id.at.the clemmer court disagreed,noting that,although the insurer might have received notice of the pendency of the action too late for it to bring a motion to intervene,it could have moved to set aside the default judgment entered against the insured.id.at.the clemmer court held that an insurer which might be required to satisfy a default judgment against its insured had a sufficient interest to give it standing to bring a motion to set aside that default judgment.id.at.thus,clemmer held that an insurer seeking to protect its interests when its insured could not defend could either intervene in the action or have the default judgment set aside.id.at belz clarendon america ins.th,reliance,supra,th at.
as a general rule,the choice between whether to seek intervention or move to set the default judgment aside will be determined by the stage the proceedings have reached when the insurer seeks to become involved.an insurer can move to intervene prior to the entry of judgment,or move to set aside the default judgment if that judgment has already been entered reliance,supra,th at.
some confusion has entered the law as the result of a case in which an insurer sought permission to both intervene in an action and vacate the default judgment entered against its insured.jade viguri d jade.the trial court granted permission to intervene,but denied the motion to vacate.id.at.the court of appeal reversed,concluding the trial court should have granted the insurer relief by vacating the default judgment.id.at.
thereafter,the superior court appellate division cited jade for the proposition that a n insured may,in some circumstances,intervene and set aside a default against its insured as to itself.nasongkhla,supra,th at supp.but jade was not concerned with a default,but a default judgment thus,the jade court never considered whether an insurer that had become a party by intervention would,in the absence of a motion to vacate,nonetheless be bound by a default entered against its insured.
as discussed above,we have concluded that an intervening insurer is not bound by a default taken against its insured.it is an established principle of law that admissions implied from the default of one defendant ordinarily are not binding upon a codefendant who,by answering,expressly denies and places in issue the truth of the allegations thus admitted by the absent party.taylor socony mobil oil d,see also morehouse wanzo d,an employer liable under respondeat superior may take advantage of any favorable elements of the judgment against the employee,but he is not bound by the issues resolved against the employee by the latter default.
it makes no logical difference whether the nondefaulting codefendant was originally named as a defendant or joined the action,as in this case,by subsequent intervention.a party default does not bind nondefaulting codefendants,even when the basis for the action against the codefendants is vicarious liability arising from the acts of the defaulting defendant.thus,an insurer intervening in an action to pursue its own interests after its insured has defaulted is not required to move to vacate the insured default as to itself the insured default simply has no effect on the insurer to the extent the language in nasongkhla impliedly states otherwise,we disagree and decline to follow it.
western heritage reservation of its right to dispute coverage has no impact on the scope of its intervention right 
as their second and final argument in this proceeding,plaintiffs attempt to justify the trial court order on the basis that western heritage was defending r
