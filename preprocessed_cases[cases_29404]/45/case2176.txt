goldome credit corporation and the fdic appeal from the district court order holding them liable to indemnify daiwa finance corporation for its attorneys fees incurred in defending itself against the claims in castleberry goldome credit.daiwa indemnity claim against goldome was based on a loan portfolio sale agreement in which daiwa bought a portfolio of loans from goldome and goldome agreed to indemnify and defend daiwa against any claim arising out of the origination of loans within the loan portfolio and filed within three years of the sale.the fdic guaranteed goldome indemnity obligation.the district court interpreted the indemnity and guarantee as insurance contracts and held that,because a conflict of interest arose between goldome and daiwa,the contracts contained an implied obligation on the part of goldome to pay for counsel of daiwa choosing.the district court entered summary judgment for daiwa.we hold that the loan portfolio sale agreement is not a contract of insurance and,goldome having offered to provide a defense,the agreement does not further obligate goldome or the fdic to pay for counsel hired by daiwa.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
the underlying claim in this lawsuit alleged fraud and lending law violations by goldome in connection with a home mortgage loan to william and gladdean castleberry.the suit sought class relief for other similarly situated consumers.the castleberrys named daiwa finance as a defendant,alleging that daiwa was a successor in interest to goldome and that it ratified and joined in goldome fraud by taking assignment of the loans it bought from goldome without disclosing the alleged fraud and lending law violations.daiwa against goldome,seeking contractual indemnity for any liability daiwa might incur to the castleberrys or any other member of the class,as well as for attorneys fees,expenses,and costs daiwa would incur in defending against the castleberry suit.daiwa also joined the fdic in its capacity as receiver for goldome parent corporation and in its corporate capacity,in which the fdic executed an agreement guaranteeing goldome contractual obligation to indemnify daiwa for claims arising out of the origination of the loans.
on january,daiwa bought from goldome a loan portfolio amounting to more than million in face value,which included the castleberry loan.at the time daiwa purchased the portfolio,there was already litigation pending alleging that goldome had perpetrated fraud in connection with the origination of home mortgage loans goldome informed daiwa of such litigation,and,in particular of the anderson class action.the agreement governing the loan portfolio sale included an undertaking by goldome to indemnify daiwa for any suits arising out of the origination of the loans that might be filed against daiwa within three years of the loan portfolio sale.
the castleberrys filed suit against goldome on january,in state court in alabama.they amended their complaint in april to add daiwa as a defendant.on april,daiwa made demand on goldome for indemnification and defense of the castleberrys claim,and goldome agreed to defend daiwa.goldome retained the law firm of johnson,barton,proctor,swedlaw and naff to represent daiwa in the castleberry case.johnson,barton represented goldome in that litigation as well.the johnson,barton firm wrote daiwa a letter undertaking to defend it,subject to a reservation of rights in the event goldome later determined that the claim did not fall within the scope of the indemnification provisions of the loan portfolio sale agreement.
the castleberrys moved for certification of a class,and goldome opposed the motion.the state trial court conditionally certified the class,and goldome moved for reconsideration.daiwa wrote to the johnson,barton firm,seeking assurance that,in the event the class were decertified and former class members filed new suits after the anniversary of the loan portfolio sale which was the limitations period set out in the sale agreement,goldome would still indemnify daiwa.daiwa pointed out that,unless goldome were willing to waive the time limit for such suits,it would be in daiwa best interests to support class certification accordingly,there would be a conflict of interest between goldome and daiwa that would preclude the same lawyers from representing them both in the castleberry litigation.goldome responded that it had no obligation to indemnify daiwa for any suits filed after the anniversary of the loan portfolio sale.but,in response to the acknowledged conflict of interest,goldome proposed to substitute new counsel to represent daiwa under the control of goldome.daiwa refused to accede to such an arrangement instead,daiwa hired its own independent counsel.daiwa filed a against goldome and a complaint against the fdic in the castleberry case for indemnification and attorneys fees and costs.the fdic removed the case to the middle district of alabama.the federal district court then decertified the class.
the district court entered summary judgment for the defendants against the castleberrys on may.
on march,the district court took up daiwa motion for summary judgment on its against goldome and its complaint against the fdic.the court held that daiwa claim for indemnification was moot in light of the judgment against the castleberrys,and the court declined to resolve daiwa claim for a declaration about any duty of goldome to defend daiwa in possible suits brought in the future by former members of the decertified class.
the district court granted summary judgment to daiwa on its claim against goldome seeking a declaration that goldome owed daiwa a duty to defend it against the castleberrys claim the court reasoned that the castleberrys claims fell within the indemnity clause of the loan portfolio sale agreement.the court also granted summary judgment to daiwa on its claim for the fees and expenses daiwa incurred in hiring its own counsel to defend it against the castleberrys.the court reasoned that because the indemnification provisions of the loan portfolio sale agreement serve the same function as an insurance policy in which goldome was the insurer and daiwa is the insured,the court should apply the principles of insurance law governing the duty of an insurance company to defend its insured.slip op.at.the court held that new york law governed both the loan portfolio sale agreement and the guarantee.under new york law,when an insurer is obliged to defend its insured and a conflict of interest arises between the two,the insured has a right to obtain counsel of its own choice to be paid by the insurer.slip op.at quoting penn aluminum,aetna cas.sur.accordingly,the court held that goldome was obliged to pay for independent counsel to represent daiwa.slip op.at.
the court further entered judgment in favor of all remaining defendants,including daiwa,against the castleberrys.the court retained jurisdiction to decide the amount of the fee award,but certified the entry of summary judgment for immediate appeal under federal rule of civil procedure b.slip op.at.
on appeal,goldome argues that the district court erred in applying insurance law to the indemnity provisions of the loan portfolio sale agreement and the guarantee.goldome argues that if ordinary,contract law were applied,goldome would not have been held liable to pay for counsel hired by daiwa.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.penalty kick mgmt.coca cola,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
new york law has a specific rule,developed in insurance cases,governing the way in which an insurer must discharge its duty to defend its insured.new york cases state a rule that where an insurer is obliged to supply the insured with a defense,
i f a conflict of interest arises the selection of the attorneys to represent the assureds should be made by them rather than by the insurance company,which should remain liable for the payment of the reasonable value of the services of whatever attorneys the assureds select.
