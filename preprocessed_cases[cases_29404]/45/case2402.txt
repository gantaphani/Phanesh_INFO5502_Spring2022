this equitable contribution action involves three insurers,guideone mutual insurance company guideone,whose insurance policy covered an employee who negligently caused injuries to another person while driving his car in connection with business for his employer,and utica national insurance group and graphics art mutual insurance company collectively utica,whose policies only covered the driver employer,who was only vicariously liable for the actions of its employee.guideone and utica settled the underlying action,exhausting guideone primary and umbrella policies.guideone thereafter sought and obtained,by summary judgment,contribution in the amount of from utica umbrella policy,representing an alleged overpayment by guideone based upon its pro rata share of coverage.utica appeals,asserting that because its umbrella policy covered a party only vicariously liable,it should not share pro rata with guideone umbrella policy that covered the tortfeasor employee.
we conclude the court erred in awarding guideone equitable contribution in the amount of from utica umbrella policy,which represented guideone pro rata share of coverage under its own umbrella policy.this is so because an employer is only vicariously liable for the actions of the tortfeasor employee,and therefore all of the insurance policies covering the tortfeasor employee,primary and excess,must be exhausted before the umbrella policy of an insurer that covered only the employer must make a contribution.

on appeal,utica asserts the court erred by finding that utica umbrella policy covering a party only vicariously liable cea shared pro rata with guideone umbrella policy covering the primary tortfeasor west,and awarding prejudgment interest from the filing of the lawsuit because guideone damages were not fixed until the court entered judgment in its favor.
