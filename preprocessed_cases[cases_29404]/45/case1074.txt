plaintiffs peggy welshans williamson and vanessa welshans appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant aetna life insurance company aetna.plaintiffs initially brought suit in tennessee state court alleging violations of common law breach of contract,violations of the tennessee consumer protection act tcpa,ann,and the tennessee bad faith statute,ann.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that aetna wrongfully denied health insurance benefits for williamson daughter,welshans,pursuant to an employee health plan administered by aetna.in october,aetna removed the matter to federal district court,and,in november,the district court granted aetna summary judgment motion with respect to all of plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs now urge this court to reverse both the jurisdictional determination of the district court and its subsequent grant of summary judgment in favor of aetna.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
williamson was employed by general agencies of the united methodist church general agencies from until she retired in.general agencies provided group health insurance the plan to its employees,and,as part of williamson retirement,she continued to be eligible for the plan.williamson was a member of the task force at general agencies that designed the employer insurance plan and recommended that aetna be selected as the plan administrator.based on that recommendation,general agencies contracted with aetna to administer its group health plan from january,through december.
welshans is williamson daughter.in may,when welshans was years old,she was severely injured in an automobile accident in which she sustained broken legs,a broken pelvis,and a broken back.according to plaintiffs,her left knee was severely injured as a result of the accident,and she has subsequently undergone seven surgeries.her ability to sit,stand,walk,climb stairs,or do any bending or squatting for a sustained period of time is impaired.until,when welshans reached the maximum age for coverage as a dependent child,she was eligible for coverage under williamson plan through general agencies.after,welshans was provided continued coverage by cigna,the prior administrator of general agencies health plan,as a fully handicapped dependent because of the injuries she sustained in the accident.welshans received coverage as a handicapped dependent from to pursuant to the terms of the plan with cigna.
welshans has not been employed since the accident,but she has been a student since.in,she attended east arkansas community college in wynne,arkansas.in,she transferred to lambuth university in jackson,tennessee.following her graduation from lambuth,she earned a masters degree in american history from the university of memphis in and has since enrolled in the doctoral program.at the time of her deposition,she expected to complete a doctorate in american history and modern europe in.according to aetna brief,she has since completed the doctorate.welshans is physically and mentally able to care for herself,and she lived independently in wynne,arkansas,while attending community college.she occasionally lived with her mother while attending lambuth university from,and,since,has lived alone in the memphis and collierville,tennessee area.welshans has received social security disability income since and has no other source of disposable income.welshans transfers money from williamson bank account into her own account each month as needed to meet her living expenses,including rent,bills,and food.
welshans and williamson both participated in the indemnity provisions of general agencies group health plan during the time in which aetna served as the administrator.the indemnity provisions provided that the insured was responsible for the submission of claims to aetna.the plan further identified procedures and other health care services that were excluded from the plan.
in january,when aetna began administering the plan,welshans was years of age.because of her age,welshans was ineligible for coverage as a dependent child of williamson.the plan provided,however,that health insurance coverage for the insured fully handicapped dependent may be continued past the maximum age for a dependent child,if he or she has not been issued a personal medical conversion policy.the plan defined a fully handicapped dependent as a person 
not able to earn his or her own living because of mental retardation or physical handicap which started prior to the date he or she reaches the maximum age for dependents and 
he or she chiefly depends on the insured or another care provider for support.
dependent on another care provider is defined as requiring a community integrated living arrangement,group home supervised apartment or other residential services licensed or certified by the department of mental health and developmental disabilities,the department of public health or the department of public aid.
according to the plan,once coverage has been established,it will continue until any one of the following occurrences cessation of the handicap and dependency t he end of a day period from the date aetna requests proof of the continuation of the handicap and dependency,if proof is not provided within a day period or termination of dependent coverage as to the insured dependent for any reason other than reaching the maximum age.the plan specifically confers upon aetna the right to request proof of the continuation of the handicap as often as it may reasonably require,but not before months prior to the dependent reaching the maximum age.
when aetna took over the administration of the general agencies health plan in,it initially rejected medical claims submitted by welshans and other children of insured employees,whom cigna had previously provided coverage for as handicapped dependents,because of a computer error.in response to the error,aetna instituted a policy by which it would cover all incapacitated dependents including welshans without question for the calendar year.aetna further stated that it expected to return to normal procedures to determine eligibility by january,at which time dependents could be terminated if they did not meet the plan eligibility criteria.
on july,aetna first denied welshans coverage as a handicapped dependent.according to williamson and aetna internal notes,aetna determined that she was not handicapped as described in the plan because the physical limitations described do not seem to be of a severity to preclude full time employment.williamson sent a second request for continuation of coverage in august,along with a statement from welshans doctor,thomas limbird,describing her injuries in detail and opining that she was unable to maintain employment.aetna requested additional information regarding welshans dependent and marital status in a letter dated september.
it is unclear whether further determinations were made as to welshans eligibility in,or.some form of litigation between the two parties has been ongoing since.welshans originally filed suit against aetna in federal district court in,alleging diversity jurisdiction and seeking payment of medical benefit claims.this matter was resolved by settlement in june,and aetna states that it is undisputed that aetna extended coverage to welshans as a handicapped dependent from.
on october,and november,aetna again requested verification of welshans status as a handicapped dependent.it is unclear whether plaintiffs responded to these requests.aetna claims that plaintiffs did not respond,citing both the deposition testimony of aetna employee and internal notes recording the of this requested information.williamson did not produce any documentary evidence or recall a specific date,but generally alleged that she responded to all requests for information.
although the district court states that it was undisputed that aetna terminated welshans coverage in,the termination date is unclear from the record.it is clear that aetna denied many of welshans claims in.aetna internal notes,dated november,state that no incapacitated child info received will close out the contact.further,aetna list of claims states,for the first time,on february,that a claim was denied because coverage was terminated.around the same time,however,aetna mailed williamson a certification of prior group health coverage,prepared on may,which provided evidence of prior health coverage for welshans from january,to january.neither the district court opinion nor aetna addresses this document.
on january,plaintiffs filed separate complaints in district court alleging diversity jurisdiction and stating claims for breach of contract and violations of the tennessee consumer protection act and the tennessee bad faith statute as a result of aetna alleged failure to pay welshans medical claims.in september,prior to the conclusion of a bench trial,plaintiffs voluntarily their case,and the court dismissed the action without prejudice.subsequently,on september,plaintiffs filed a complaint in tennessee state court setting damages at less than.aetna removed the action to federal district court based on diversity of citizenship in october.plaintiffs filed a motion to remand,arguing that the amount in controversy did not satisfy federal requirements.the district court rejected this argument,and subsequently granted aetna summary judgment motion on the merits of the case,concluding that plaintiffs had failed to set forth any evidence that a breach of contract occurred,or that aetna acted deceitfully or in bad faith.plaintiffs timely appealed.
the district court denied plaintiffs motion to remand and granted aetna summary judgment motion thus,the standard of review is de novo.davis mccourt,cir terry barr sales agency,cir.
the first question we must address is whether the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction.plaintiffs concede that the parties are diverse,but argue that the district court denial of their motion to remand to state court was in error because the amended complaint alleged damages of less than,thereby falling short of the threshold for diversity jurisdiction.aetna contends that diversity jurisdiction is established because it is more likely than not that plaintiffs complaint seeks damages in excess of.
removal of cases from state to federal court is governed by a,which provides that any civil action brought in state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the united states where such action is pending.a.federal district courts have original jurisdiction over all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and is between citizens of different states.a.a defendant seeking to remove a case to federal court has the burden of proving that the district court possesses jurisdiction.gafford,cir.jurisdiction is determined at the time of removal,and subsequent events,whether beyond the plaintiff control or the result of his volition,do not oust the district court jurisdiction once it has attached.paul mercury indem.red cab.rogers stores,cir.
on september,plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in the circuit court of shelby county,tennessee,which was amended on september.in the second complaint,plaintiffs reassert the previously dismissed claims and request 
judgment three times the amount of their actual damages including prejudgment interest,which are to be determined at trial,or alternatively,their actual damages including interest plus the percent penalty provided by ann,but limited to exclusive of interest,costs,and attorneys fees.
plaintiffs aver that this limitation means that aetna can not demonstrate that the amount in controversy exceeds.
the district court held that,although generally plaintiffs may choose to claim less than the federal requirement in order to preclude removal from state court,tennessee rules of civil procedure enabled plaintiffs to claim an amount lower than the jurisdictional amount in the complaint,yet seek to recover damages in excess of that amount citing.civ.tennessee rule provides that every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled,even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party pleadings.civ.thus,the district court concluded,aetna must demonstrate that it was more likely than not that the amount in controversy would exceed.see rogers,at cir.
to this effect,the district court continued 
the amount in controversy is determined by the allegations in the complaint.national nail moore,d,citing laughlin kmart,cir.in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that,as a result of defendants wrongful acts in denying welshans medical insurance claims during the period of,they have suffered damages in the amount of plaintiffs further aver that they are entitled to recover treble the amount of actual damages pursuant to ann.and an additional percent penalty on all sums recovered under ann.calculating the relief requested using the damages suffered,the complaint asserts that plaintiffs are entitled to recover up to under count i under count ii and under count iii.
on appeal,plaintiffs attempt to reargue the same objections they made before the district court namely,that the stipulation in their motion to remand that they do not and will not seek or request judgment in the amount of or greater,exclusive of interest and costs,precludes federal jurisdiction.we need not reach this argument because we hold that the request for attorneys fees properly placed this case within the purview of federal jurisdiction,and we thereby affirm the district court exercise of jurisdiction on other grounds.city mgmt.chem,cir w e may affirm on any grounds supported by the record,even though they may be different from the grounds relied on by the district court.citing hilliard postal service,cir.

it is generally agreed in this circuit that the amount in controversy should be determined from the perspective of the plaintiff,with a focus on the economic value of the rights he seeks to protect.buckeye recyclers chep usa,d,see pennsylvania city of girard,cir goldsmith sutherland,cir wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction ed.
