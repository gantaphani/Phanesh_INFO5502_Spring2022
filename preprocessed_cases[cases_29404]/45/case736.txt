this case concerns factory mutual decision in october to distribute to its policyholders a million membership credit that was contingent on policy renewal.factory mutual is a mutual insurance and was a policyholder for almost years with factory mutual and its predecessor company.the district court concluded that factory mutual breached its contract with when it denied its equitable share of the million distribution.the district court held that because was a policyholder and member in on the distribution record date,should be accorded its equitable share.we agree and affirm the district court judgment.
background 
factory mutual charter stipulates that the company,like all mutual insurance companies,will establish and maintain a surplus against extraordinary losses and other contingencies,by appropriating from time to time such sums as the board of directors may determine in addition to any unearned premium or reinsurance.in accordance with the charter,factory mutual maintains a surplus fund that includes appropriated sums and unearned premiums to cover extraordinary losses and other contingencies.in,factory mutual initiated internal discussions regarding a membership credit for its policyholders.one major reason for a membership credit was the unexpected growth in the surplus funds.
at about the same time,after extensive discussions with factory mutual,indicated to factory mutual during a meeting with factory mutual on august,that it intended not to renew its policy.policy expired on october.
on october,factory mutual informed the rhode island department of business regulation dbr that it was planning a proposed membership credit.on october,factory mutual board of directors approved the proposed million membership credit.factory mutual publicly announced the credit on october.in a series of documents,factory mutual described the membership credit to its policyholders.factory mutual set eligibility for the distribution as follows a ll factory mutual insurance company policyholders on the date of record will be eligible to receive the membership credit when their policies renew during the membership credit period.emphasis added.factory mutual thereby conditioned the distribution of the membership credit on a policyholder future a policy renewal before the policy expired.factory mutual also established the date of record or record date as september.
in its notices to policyholders,factory mutual specifically linked the membership credit to its surplus growth and framed the distribution as a reward or return from that growth.in an october,press release,factory mutual stated 
policyholders of commercial and industrial property insurer fm global will receive a collective million in savings on their premium beginning january,as a result of lower than expected property losses during recent years,resulting in higher than projected surplus growth.the return will be disbursed to fm global policyholders as a membership credit on premium for policy renewals.
emphasis added.factory mutual specifically apportioned shares of the membership credit distribution based on the amount of each policyholder premium contribution on the record date and the number of years the policyholder held a policy with the company.the distribution acted akin to a mutual insurance company typical distribution of surplus capital as a return to policyholders in proportion to their past contributions,except that factory mutual distribution was contingent on policy renewal 
on the distribution record date,was a factory mutual policyholder in good standing,but it had decided not to renew its policy when the policy expired on october.because it was a policyholder in good standing on the distribution record date,requested a portion of the membership credit in cash,which factory mutual denied.subsequent negotiations between the parties failed to resolve the dispute.therefore filed suit on september,in the judicial district court of dallas county,texas,against factory mutual,alleging breach of contract,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,unjust enrichment,and violations of the texas insurance code.on october,factory mutual filed a notice of removal to the united states district court for the northern district of texas.on october,the parties entered into a joint stipulation,dismissing with prejudice the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims along with several texas insurance code claims.on december,both parties filed for summary judgment on the breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and remaining texas insurance code claims.
on september,the district court issued a memorandum order granting summary judgment in favor of on the breach of contract claim awarding in damages.the damages reflect the share of the distribution that would have received had it been accorded a share.the district court found that the charter of the company,the,and the policy unambiguously confirmed that kimberly clark bargained for coverage by and membership in a mutual insurance company as opposed to a stock insurance company and all of the rights and benefits that typically accompany membership in a mutual insurance company.the district court therefore concluded that 
thus,the court infers that under the policy,upon purchasing a policy and obtaining membership in the company,a policyholder gains an interest in the surplus and has a right to its equitable share in any distribution of such surplus as declared by the board,so long as the policyholder is a member of the company on the relevant date.consequently,refusing to provide its equitable share of the surplus,even though the company was a member of factory mutual on the record date,breaches the policy.
factory mutual timely appeals on two grounds that the district court erroneously considered the plaintiff claims within a framework rather than under a corporate governance framework and if the claims are considered within a framework,the district court erred in concluding that factory mutual breached its contract.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court a party is entitled to summary judgment only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.on a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see hockman westward commc ns,llc,cir.in reviewing the evidence,the court must therefore refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.turner baylor richardson med,cir.
claims are properly analyzed under contract law 
factory mutual contends that claims for a portion of the surplus distribution implicate corporate governance law,specifically the business judgment rule,and therefore should not be considered under a framework.this choice between viewing a mutual insurance policyholder claims as a matter of contract or as a matter of internal corporate governance originates with the policyholder dual roles the mutual insurance company the policyholder is both an insured customer and also a controlling member of the.see,keystone auto.club cas.comm r,cir ohio farmers indem.comm r,cir hutchins mut.ins.of hazen.claims against factory mutual can be framed as either a breach of and factory mutual contractual relationship or as disagreement with other about corporate governance and internal affairs.
underlying claims allege that factory mutual improperly denied right,or eligibility,to a share of an announced surplus disbursement.courts clearly consider a policyholder right to a share of a surplus distribution as a matter governed by contract law whereas a policyholder grievances with a surplus distribution timing,amount,and method are corporate governance matters and thereby insulated from most policyholder lawsuits by the business judgment rule.see equitable life assurance society of the brown.brown royal highlanders,see also prudential ins.of am.miller brewing,cir andrews equitable life assurance soc.of,cir boynton state farm mut.auto.ins,greeff equitable life assurance soc.of,
the parties do not dispute the propriety of the timing or amount of the distribution,but factory mutual contends that its corporate decisions in respect to a policyholder eligibility for a surplus distribution should be considered as part of its discretion over the method of a surplus distribution.at issue in this case is whether factory mutual method of distribution discriminates against a particular subset of policyholders because they chose not to renew their polices but were otherwise in good standing and had contributed to the surplus.such discrimination would be clearly outside of the board discretion over surplus distributions because it would contravene state policy and is thereby not protected by the business judgment rule.see life ins.street.rhode island laws describing state policy against discrimination among insureds of the same class.the question presented to us is therefore whether factory mutual discrimination breaches right to a distribution share if other,with materially identical contracts and materially identical rights to a share,had received their shares.accordingly,claims for a distribution share must be analyzed under a rubric and not under the business judgment rule 
ii.factory mutual breached its contract with when it denied its share of the surplus distribution 
the policy contract is clearly labeled a mutual insurance contract.the policy is silent as to the board discretion over the distribution of excess surplus,but states that t his policy is issued by a mutual company having special regulations lawfully applicable to its organization,membership,policies,or contracts of insurance.it also states that t he insured by accepting this policy hereby becomes a member of this company and subject to the provisions of its charter and,with power to vote at its meetings.section of factory mutual charter states 
e ach natural person,partnership,association,corporation or legal entity insured on the mutual plan by the corporation shall be a member of the corporation during the term of its policy,but no longer,and at all meetings of the members shall be entitled to one vote either in person or by proxy provided,however,that where there is more than one insured under any policy,such insureds shall nevertheless be deemed to be a single member of the corporation for all purposes.the corporation may issue policies which do not entitle the insured to membership in the corporation nor to participate in its surplus.
emphasis added.finally,section of factory mutual charter states upon termination of the membership of any member,all his or its right and interest in the surplus,reserves and other assets of the corporation shall forthwith cease.in sum,factory mutual and contract is a mutual insurance policy acknowledges the special regulations applicable to mutual insurance companies and grants policyholders an entitlement as a member for all purposes,which includes rights and interests in the surplus until the policy termination unless the policy states otherwise,which is not the case here.
courts consistently describe mutual insurance contracts as creating certain settled expectations between the parties.as the wisconsin supreme court noted 
every of a mutual insurance company knows,or ought to know,that he will remain a member so long as he remains a and no longer.he knows,or ought to know,that as soon as his membership relation is established he becomes possessed of an equitable interest in the assets of the company consisting of all accumulations prior to his time,and such as may be added thereto during his membership,but which can not be realized on in possession in the absence of a necessary distribution of the surplus on account of the company going out of business,or in some proper way.
huber martin,see also fid.cas.of metro.life ins,misc d.the supreme court in pennsylvania mutual life insurance lederer described the mutual company in this way 
in a mutual company,whatever the field of its operation,the premium exacted is necessarily greater than the expected cost of the insurance,as the redundancy in the premium furnishes the guaranty fund out of which extraordinary losses may be met,while in a stock company they may be met from the capital stock subscribed.it is of the essence of mutual insurance that the excess in the premium over the actual cost as later ascertained shall be returned to the policy holder.
see also chiropractic ins.united states,cir thompson white river burial ass n,cir keystone mut.cas.driscoll,cir.basically,the settled expectations when entering a contract with a mutual insurance company are the policyholders pay premiums into a common fund to cover contingencies,and if there is an accumulated excess of capital beyond what is necessary to cover contingencies,excess surplus,the insurance company returns the excess in surplus distributions to the policyholders.this essential aspect of the mutual insurance company relationship with its policyholders is insurance at actual cost or insurance at cost.see white river burial ass n,at to say that an essential of mutual insurance is that the excess of premiums received over the actual cost of insurance shall be returned to the policyholders is but another way of saying that the essential of mutuality is insurance at cost.we have stated that t he furnishing of insurance to members at cost is the chief aim and function of a mutual insurance company,and any company which does not return to the policyholders or members the excess of the premium over the cost can not be said to be a mutual insurance company.am.ins.of thomas,cir.texas courts also agree with describing the mutual insurance company purpose as providing policyholders insurance at cost.see mercury life health hughes,while the mutual insurance policyholders do not receive dividends,they get other equally valuable benefits.it is the duty of the directors to operate the company as economically as possible and furnish insurance to its policyholders as near actual cost as possible.other authorities unanimously agree in describing the purpose of a mutual insurance company as providing insurance at cost.see,mut.fire ins.of germantown united states,cir fid.cas.of,at the distribution of divisible surplus is in reality an adjustment of the premium in retrospect of the amount found to have been actually necessary to cover the contingencies which materialized and it effects a reduction in the cost of the insurance.dryden sun life assurance of,simons am.mut.liab.ins,mcquade thacher,misc d.see generally russ segalla,couch on ins.the object of mutual insurance is to provide insurance protection at cost.
consequently,because they contracted for at cost insurance,policyholders who contribute to a surplus are equitably entitled to a share of any announced surplus distribution as a proportionate return on their prior contributions to the accumulated capital stock.see,in re metlife demutualization,d,russ segalla,couch on ins.as a general rule,the surplus of a mutual company belongs equitably to the policyholders who contributed to it,in the proportion in which they contributed.consistent with these authorities,we have stated,in a diversity case involving texas law,that 
dividends normally belong to the stockholders,which in a mutual company are the policyholders,but the insured though not a stockholder may by contract be allowed to participate.this share in profits more naturally belongs to the insured than to the beneficiary,and is a return to him of a part of his premium which the year results have shown was not necessary to have been paid to maintain the insurance with its legal reserve.
union cent.life ins.williams,cir.similarly,rhode island has defined mutual insurance company to mean a corporation in which shares are held exclusively by members to whom profits are distributed as dividends and members are both the insurer and the insured in a health insurance act.laws emphasis added.here,factory mutual surplus distribution was apportioned based on past contributions,and therefore policyholders who contributed,like,should be entitled to a share.
because the right to the surplus is dictated by contract and is the policyholder equitable right based on past contributions,the corporate board has no competing right to the surplus assets once they announce the surplus to policyholders.the kentucky supreme court has stated 
w here the company is a mutual,being conducted on the plan of giving the cheapest safe insurance to its members,all surplus ought to belong to the members,the policy holders.for in a purely mutual company there are no stockholders,and no one else therefore to whom the surplus could go than its policy holders.and it should in equity go to those who had contributed it.the officers of such a corporation being paid salaries for their services have no interest as such in the surplus.

although the legal title to the property of a mutual company is held by the company,the property is held for the benefit of its members,policyholders,and stockholders.the funds of the company are to be treated as a trust fund for the members 
each member has the same proportionate interest that every other member possesses.policyholders are entitled to participate in the annual surplus of the company and if there is an inequitable distribution of surplus a policyholder may sue to obtain his or her proportionate share.the right to share in a surplus may,however,be restricted to current policyholders.
footnotes omitted see also huber,at.accordingly,a corporate board has the discretion to manage the timing,amount,and method of a surplus distribution but once a distribution timing,amount and method is declared,the distribution funds no longer constitute the company property instead,the funds become the joint asset held by the members who are policyholders at the distribution operative date.the wisconsin supreme court stated 
all this results in a necessity that some definite time be adopted when the rights of individuals become fixed,after which may be applied the arithmetical process by which they become known.in deference to such necessity,the rule has become settled as to stock corporations that a dividend belongs to those who own the stock when it is declared.complete analogy exists between rights of members in a mutual insurance company and stockholders in a stock company in and to such a surplus.declaring a dividend is nothing but authoritatively deciding to distribute some or all of the surplus.we therefore think it entirely logical to apply the foregoing rule,and to hold that on march,the dividend distribution became separated from the corporate assets and became the property of the several members then existing,payable to each on demand when the amount to which he was entitled had been ascertained.
zinn germantown farmers mut.ins,emphasis added citations omitted.as the wisconsin supreme court acknowledged,there is a complete analogy between the rights of members in a mutual insurance company and stockholders in a stock company in and to such a surplus.id.as this court has stated in the analogous context of stockholder dividends 
under the law of texas,a declaration of dividends creates a debt owed by the corporation in favor of each stockholder which can not be rescinded.although the declaration of this dividend provided that the sums thereunder were payable to the stockholders of record at such times and in such installments during the year as the directors saw fit,the liability of the company accrued as of the date of the declaration.
cohen,cir footnote omitted.in short,when a distribution is declared,the company becomes liable to pay the policyholders because they collectively own any announced distribution from the surplus.because the corporate board controls the timing of the distribution,it necessarily establishes some definite time when the rights of policyholders become fixed and the distributed funds are owned by those policyholders who have rights at that time.zinn,at.
the parties dispute the date when rights of the policyholders became fixed for the distribution,the distribution operative date.factory mutual contends the operative date that fixes the rights of the policyholders is the date the corporate board declared its approval of the distribution,the declaration date,which was october.contends the operative date was the date of record or the as described in the public notices to members describing the distribution details,which is september factory mutual contention is without merit.again,the complete analogy between stockholders in stock companies and mutual insurance policyholders,as to the distribution of a surplus,is useful.the distribution materials specifically establish the record date as september,and on that date was a policyholder in good standing.the declaration date is important only because the company incurs liability to pay its promised distribution on the declaration date.however,we have defined the record date as the operative date one uses to determine the set of stockholders who can participate in a stock corporation dividend distribution,the stockholders of record.see,caruth united states,cir in general,dividend income is taxed to the shareholder who,on the record date,owns the stock with respect to which dividends are paid and who is entitled to receive the dividend.cohen,at noting that the company incurred its liability to pay dividends on the declaration date to the stockholders of record.see generally black law dictionary ed defining record date to mean the t he date on which a stockholder must own shares to be entitled to vote or receive a termed date of record.the relevant state statutes also emphasize the importance of the record date as the operative date to ascertain the stockholders of record for a capital distribution in stock corporations.see.bus.act ann.describing the record date as determining which shareholders have rights to a stock dividend laws a same.accordingly,the record date is the effective date to determine which stockholders can partake in the distribution even though the company accrues its liability to pay the announced distribution to those stockholders of record on the declaration date.see,cohen,at.in accordance with these general principles and the complete analogy,as to the right to receive surplus distributions,between stockholders and mutual insurance policyholders,as a policyholder of on the record date,was entitled to participate in the distributed surplus.
factory mutual final argument against according its share is based on the fact that did not renew its policy before it expired,which the board had established as a condition precedent for participating in the distribution.the kentucky court of appeals and a new york court,the only courts to directly confront this issue,barred the conditioning of surplus distributions on future renewal by relying on the general principles underlying mutual insurance we described above.see mut.ben.life ins.davis,wells metro.life ins,misc,see also aetna life ins.hartley,opinion modified on other grounds.we agree with these authorities as we noted earlier,once a surplus distribution is announced,the policyholders on the record date own the surplus and the corporate board no longer has any rights or interests in the distributed amounts.accordingly,as a policyholder of record,owned a share of the surplus,and factory mutual can not then disentitle based its subsequent failure to renew its,could have changed its mind and decided to renew its policy on october,which is after the distribution record date.as a practical matter,factory mutual eligibility rules effectively bar any return of excess capital to members on the record date who no longer need insurance or can not afford to renew their insurance,thereby directly contravening members equitable rights to a distribution from a surplus that was created,in part,by their past contributions.conditioning a right t
