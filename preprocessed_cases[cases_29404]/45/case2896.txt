insurance code section section provides delay in the presentation to an insurer of notice or proof of loss is waived if the insurer omits to make objection promptly and specifically upon that ground.appellant contends the trial court erred in finding section did not apply to denial of a claim based on a provision.he argues a provision should be treated the same as a timely notice provision and can not be used to excuse an insurer from compliance with section.appellant maintains that a provision is void as a matter of law to the extent it acts to waive the insurer compliance with section.we disagree.
