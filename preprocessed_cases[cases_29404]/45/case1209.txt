avent america,incorporated avent appeals the district court declaratory judgment that medmarc casualty,pennsylvania general and state farm insurance companies the insurance companies do not have a duty to defend avent in a series of lawsuits involving the presence of bpa in certain products avent sold.the plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuits are parents who bought these avent products containing bpa and then refused to use the products once they learned of the dangers of bpa.the case at hand hinges on whether the underlying lawsuits state claims for damages because of bodily injury,and are therefore covered by the insurance policies,or not.avent argues that the underlying suits claims that the plaintiffs will not use the products out of fear of bodily injury sufficiently state claims for damages because of bodily injury.the insurance companies argue that the underlying suits are not covered by the policies because the claims are limited to economic damages due to the purchase of unusable products and these damages are not because of bodily injury.state farm asserts an additional argument that it does not owe a duty to defend because the term of its coverage ended well before any of these claims could have arisen.the district court agreed with the insurance companies.for the reasons set forth below and based on the insurance companies admission at oral argument that they would have to and alter their position should the underlying complaints be amended to include allegations of actual bodily injury,we affirm the district court grant of declaratory relief to the insurance companies.
background 
underlying lawsuits 
this duty to defend case centers around a series of class action suits filed against avent for using bpa in their products without informing the consumers of the health risks associated with the potential leaching of bpa.the classes in the underlying suits consist of parents who purchased avent products for their children.while the fifteen complaints vary in their specific allegations,they all sketch out the same general claim avent manufactured products that contained bpa avent was aware of a large body of research that showed that bpa,even at low levels,is harmful to humans and is particularly harmful to children despite this knowledge,avent marketed their products as superior in safety to other products for infants and toddlers parents would not have purchased avent products if they knew that using products with bpa could be harmful to their children upon learning of the safety problems associated with products that contain bpa,the stopped using the products and therefore did not receive the full benefit of their purchase.
these class actions were consolidated for purposes into in re bpa polycarbonate plastic products liability litigation,mdl,in the western district of missouri.after the consolidation,many of the underlying plaintiffs from the consolidated class action suits filed a new class action complaint against avent in the western district of missouri.this new action,broadway avent america,cv.the broadway action is the current operative complaint,but the other class action complaints remain relevant insofar as they might be used to send the matters back to the transferor courts.the complaint in the broadway action the broadway complaint is representative of all of the underlying complaints for the purpose of our discussion of whether the factual allegations state a claim that triggers the insurance companies duty to defend.therefore,we discuss only the broadway complaint in detail in this section.
the broadway complaint summarizes the suit in the following manner 
this action arises out of defendants misrepresentations omissions and failures to warn of otherwise disclose that their baby products are manufactured using a dangerous chemical recognized to be toxic in several respects for years and which poses serious risks to an individuals health as the fact that it leaches into food and beverages in the course of normal,everyday use.
broadway complaint.the complaint defines the purported class of plaintiffs to be all persons who purchased polycarbonate plastic baby bottles,nipples,training or sippy cups,and other products manufactured,sold distributed by defendants that contained.broadway complaint.the complaint dedicates thirteen pages to the health risks caused by exposure to bpa.broadway complaint.these pages cite to numerous scientific studies that show that bpa exposure causes various problems,including early sexual maturation in females,increased obesity,and increased problems such as and autism,in a variety of lab animals.the complaint alleges that the general prevailing consensus from these studies has been that there should be concern about exposure to bpa for humans.however,at no point in those thirteen pages,or anywhere in any of the underlying complaints,do the plaintiffs allege that any of these negative health effects have manifested in their children.notably,the plaintiffs never allege that they or their children ever used the products or were actually exposed to the bpa.instead,the plaintiffs allege a uniform injury across all plaintiffs that stems from their purchasing an unusable product.broadway complaint,in every related case,plaintiffs and class members suffered uniform damages caused by their purchase of baby products produced,manufactured,distributed,sold by defendants.the counts alleged against avent include violation of illinois consumer fraud act,violation of connecticut unfair trade practices act,violation of state consumer protection laws,breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and unjust enrichment.plaintiffs prayer for relief includes damages in the form of the amount of monies paid for defendant offending baby products other consequential or incidental damages actual damages,statutory damages,punitive or treble damages,and other relief as provided by the statutes cited in the complaint injunctive relief barring defendants from continuing their use of bpa in their baby products in the manner described in the complaint and all other relief to which plaintiffs and members of the class may be entitled at law or in equity.the prayer for relief also asked for attorneys fees and class certification.
after the initial pleadings stage in the consolidated actions and in the broadway action,avent filed a motion to dismiss the complaints on the ground that they did not state a legally cognizable injury.avent argued that because the plaintiffs prayers for relief contain no allegations of physical illness,cost of future medical monitoring,fear of future injury,or emotional distress,this was essentially a product liability action and should be dismissed.omnibus introduction to defendants motion to dismiss,in re bpa.when responding to this motion,plaintiffs conceded that they did not seek damages for any physical harm but rather sought only economic damages.plaintiffs stated 
defendants contention that plaintiffs claim must be dismissed because plaintiffs have failed to plead a legally cognizable injury mischaracterizes plaintiffs claims and ignores plaintiffs allegations regarding the economic injuries they sustained as a result of purchasing defendants goods.defendants correctly note that plaintiffs do not seek to recover for personal injuries or property damage.however,as defendants concede,plaintiffs do seek to recover for their economic losses.courts routinely recognize a plaintiff right to recover for economic loss where the plaintiff alleges he has purchased goods that do not perform satisfactorily or are worth less than represented.plaintiffs have clearly alleged such injuries.
plaintiffs suggestions in opposition to defendants joint motion to dismiss all claims of all named plaintiffs for failure to plead a legally cognizable injury and lack of standing pursuant to.b and b,in re bpa.in response to avent motion,the district court dismissed some of the claims and let others go forward.in addressing the argument that this is a product liability case,the district court found that to be a mischaracterization of the complaint.it found that the essence of the claim was not that someone was injured,but that consumers were not told of bpa presence and the corresponding health risk.order and opinion addressing certain of defendants motion to dismiss,in re bpa.the district court reasoned 
the claims of plaintiffs in this category do not depend on proving the products are defective.it is true that,in a general sense,plaintiffs claims revolve around safety in that the allegedly material facts that were concealed relate to that issue.however,plaintiffs claims are not predicated on proving the elements of any jurisdiction product liability laws t he plaintiffs in this category purchased a product they allege they would not have purchased had they known the true facts.now that they know the true facts,they are unwilling to risk allowing their children to use the product.they can not obtain the intended benefit from the goods,so they incurred damages.
order and opinion addressing certain defendants motions to dismiss,in re bpa.based on this reasoning,the district court dismissed all of the counts of the complaints,except for the unjust enrichment claim,with regard to any plaintiffs who disposed of or used their products before learning about the bpa because those plaintiffs were unaffected by the defendants alleged concealment.the district court left the unjust enrichment claim intact for all plaintiffs because the measure of unjust enrichment damages is the benefit conferred to the defendant,not the harm to the plaintiff.
b.the insurance policies 
the insurance companies provided avent with general commercial liability insurance at various times between and.state farm provided coverage from april,through april.pennsylvania general provided insurance from april,through april,under new policy contracts each year.medmarc provided insurance to avent from april,through april,and again from april,through april,under new policy contracts each year.all parties agree that the relevant language is substantially the same in all of the insurance policies.the relevant portion of the insurance agreement,as taken from the medmarc policy,states 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage included within the operations hazard to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance does not apply.we may,at our discretion,investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result.
b.this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if 
the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and 
the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.
the agreements define bodily injury as bodily injury,sickness or disease sustained by a person,including death resulting from any of these at any time.
procedural background of the duty to defend case 
avent tendered the in re bpa and broadway lawsuits to medmarc,pennsylvania general,and state farm seeking defense and indemnification for the underlying actions.medmarc and pennsylvania general denied coverage.state farm and avent entered into a standstill agreement to defer the coverage dispute.however,avent terminated that agreement and both parties filed declaratory judgment on that issue.medmarc also filed a complaint against avent in october seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend avent in these bpa class action suits.avent answered the complaint and counterclaimed seeking coverage.avent then filed a complaint against pennsylvania general and state farm seeking a declaratory judgment that they also had a duty to defend and indemnify.although the state farm case was initially a separate case,it was consolidated into the medmarc action.all three insurance companies eventually moved for either a judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment on the grounds that this was not an occurrence for which they provided coverage and that there were no allegations of bodily injury.state farm additionally claimed that any occurrence to which coverage might apply happened outside of its coverage period.avent filed for summary judgment in opposition to the insurers various motions.the district court granted the insurance companies motions,basing its ruling on the lack of allegations of bodily injury.avent appeals.
ii.discussion 
this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of state farm and a grant of a motion on the pleadings in favor of medmarc and pennsylvania general.we review grants of summary judgment and motions on the pleadings de novo.see bannon of,cir.in assessing whether the district court correctly granted declaratory relief to the insurance companies we must begin our analysis with a review of the general standard for duty to defend under illinois law an insurer must provide its insured with a defense when the allegations in the complaint are even potentially within the scope of the policy coverage.cas.forge indus.staffing,cir citing guillen potomac ins.of.if the underlying complaints allege facts within or potentially within policy coverage,the insurer is obligated to defend its insured even if the allegations are groundless,false,or fraudulent.northbrook prop.cas.transp.joint agreement.when considering whether an insurance company has a duty to defend,the court should not simply look to the particular legal theories pursued by the claimant,but must focus on the allegedly tortious conduct on which the lawsuit is based.eng rs,commercial unions ins,cir.this is because the illinois courts have held that the duty to defend should not hinge on the draftsmanship skills or whims of the plaintiff in the underlying action.int l ins.rollprint packaging.although we focus on factual allegations above legal theories,factual allegations are only important insofar as they point to a theory of recovery.health care indus.liab.ins.program momence meadows nursing center,cir.therefore,based on these standards,we must consider whether the allegations in the complaint point to a theory of recovery that falls within the insurance contract do the allegations amount to a claim for damages because of bodily injury due to an occurrence 
judicial estoppel 
as an initial matter,the insurance companies argue that we should hold that avent is judicially estopped from making the argument that the underlying complaints state claims because of bodily injury and therefore give rise to a duty to defend.judicial estoppel provides that a party who prevails on one ground in a prior proceeding can not turn around and deny that ground in a subsequent one.butler roundlake police dep t,cir.as discussed in the background section,avent previously argued that the complaints in the underlying suits should be dismissed because they made no claims of physical harm and therefore were product liability claims.the district court agreed with their position to the extent that it held there were no claims of physical injury.
while the filings of avent and the plaintiffs in the underlying actions are instructive on the duty to defend question,judicial estoppel is not appropriate in this case because avent current argument is not sufficiently in tension with its position in the underlying suits.in the underlying suit,avent argued that the complaints did not state claims for bodily injury and therefore did not state a cause of action.the district court in in re bpa agreed that the complaints did not state claims for physical harm,but it found that the complaints did state viable claims for economic damages resulting from plaintiffs purchasing a product less desirable than they believed they were purchasing.in the case at bar,avent argues that such a claim for economic damages is sufficient to trigger a duty to defend.avent points to the language in the insurance polices that covers claims for damages because of bodily injury and urg
