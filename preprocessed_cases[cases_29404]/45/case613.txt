plaintiffs are homeowners in maryland who purchased title insurance from ticor title insurance company of florida when they refinanced their mortgages.they allege that ticor charged them rates that were higher than the applicable rates ticor had on file with the maryland insurance commissioner.and plaintiffs claim that ticor,by splitting these excessive charges with its local agents,violated section of the real estate settlement procedures act respa.
because ticor and its agents performed services in return for the charges that they collected,we conclude that plaintiffs theory of liability conflicts with respa statutory text and with our previous recognition that respa is not a statute,see boulware crossland mortgage,cir.thus,the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs respa claims.we also conclude that plaintiffs claims warranted dismissal,primarily for want of exhaustion,and we therefore affirm the district court judgment.while the law is not indifferent to the abuses plaintiffs allege,plaintiffs have chosen the wrong statute and the wrong forum in which to press their case.
ticor is a florida corporation that sells title insurance in maryland.pursuant to the maryland insurance code,ticor has filed the rates that ticor charges for title insurance with the maryland insurance commissioner,and the commissioner has approved those rates.see,ins.in particular,ticor has three filed,approved rates its original issue rate its reissue rate and its extended coverage rate.ticor reissue rate is less than its original issue rate,and its extended coverage rate is more than its original issue means that the extended coverage rate is double the reissue rate.the insurance code requires ticor to adhere to these rates when it sells title insurance in maryland.see id,b.
the plaintiffs in this case,thomas arthur and jennifer whitehead,claim that ticor did not follow these filed rates when it sold title insurance policies to plaintiffs and others in maryland.in particular,arthur and whitehead allege that ticor charged the wrong rate when plaintiffs purchased title insurance policies in connection with refinancing the mortgages on their homes.plaintiffs claim that when a title insurance policy already exists on a piece of property,as was the case when plaintiffs refinanced,ticor must charge the reissue rate.but when plaintiffs refinanced their mortgages and purchased title insurance for the benefit of their lenders,ticor charged plaintiffs the extended coverage rate.plaintiffs therefore claim that ticor charged them double the lawful rate.
plaintiffs also claim that ticor charged these excessive rates with the assistance of local title insurance companies that acted as ticor agents in maryland and that received commissions from ticor.specifically,plaintiffs allege that ticor agents performed closing and settlement services when plaintiffs refinanced their mortgages.plaintiffs allege that the services performed by the agents included conducting title searches and issuing the title insurance policies on behalf of ticor.and when ticor allegedly charged plaintiffs an excessive rate for their title insurance policies,plaintiffs claim that ticor split the excessive fees with its agents.
based on these allegations,plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against ticor in district court.plaintiffs sought damages under four legal theories.first,plaintiffs stated a claim for money had and received under maryland common law.second,plaintiffs claimed that ticor had violated section of the federal real estate settlement procedures act respa.third,plaintiffs brought a claim for negligent misrepresentation under maryland law.finally,plaintiffs filed a count of civil conspiracy,also under maryland law.plaintiffs asserted that the district court had both federal question and diversity jurisdiction over this action.
ticor moved to dismiss before any issues of class certification were reached,and the district court granted the motion for all four of plaintiffs claims.only the first three counts are at issue in this appeal.on plaintiffs claim for money had and received,the district court dismissed because plaintiffs had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies that were available to them under the maryland insurance authorized the insurance commissioner to order,among other things,restitution for a violation of the insurance code.see,ins.d.with respect to respa,the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to state a valid claim because ticor and its agents had performed services in connection with plaintiffs purchase of title insurance,and because respa did not prohibit charging excessive fees for those services.finally,the district court dismissed plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation count because plaintiffs had not alleged a false statement by ticor.
plaintiffs now appeal the district court dismissal of their claims under respa,for money had and received,and for negligent misrepresentation.our review is de novo.
we begin with plaintiffs claims under respa.section b of respa provides no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.b.as an initial matter,plaintiffs concede that ticor and its agents did perform services in connection with plaintiffs purchases of title insurance.indeed,plaintiffs complaint specifically states that ticor provided settlement services and issued plaintiffs title insurance policies.the complaint also declares that ticor agents provided closing and settlement services,including title searches and the issuance of the policies on ticor behalf.despite the fact that ticor and its agents performed services,plaintiffs claim that ticor can still be liable under section b because the company charged rates for title insurance that were too high under maryland law and because it gave a portion of the excessive charges to its agents.
plaintiffs claim can not be squared with the plain language of the statute.section b prohibits giving and accepting a portion of a charge other than for services actually performed.thus,the text of the statute makes clear that it bars splitting a charge with a party that has not actually performed services.the statute does not prohibit,as plaintiffs would have it,charging what plaintiffs claim is too much for services that have been performed,or splitting a fee with a party that has performed services.indeed,to accommodate plaintiffs theory of liability,we would have to delete the words other than from the statute and add a new provision that bars giving and accepting excessive fees for services actually performed.
in boulware crossland mortgage,cir,we held that section b did not prohibit a mortgage company from imposing a unilateral overcharge on a consumer for obtaining the consumer credit report.id.at.we based that holding in large part on our recognition that section b of respa is not a broad provision.id.at.rather than prohibiting alleged overpricing,we held in boulware that section b prohibits certain classes of arrangements in which fees are split with or kicked back to a third party.see id.we noted that congress directed against a particular kind of abuse that it believed interfered with the operation of free splitting and kicking back of fees to parties who did nothing in return for the portions they received.id.at quoting mercado calumet fed.sav.loan ass n,cir see also id.at section b prohibits splitting fees with anyone for anything other than services actually performed.quoting willis quality mortgage usa,d,
it is difficult to reconcile this interpretation of section b with the theory of liability proposed by plaintiffs.plaintiffs argue that ticor violated respa by charging too much for title insurance,even though both ticor and its agents performed services.but holding ticor liable because it charged rates that were in plaintiffs view too high would require us to treat respa as a result that we rejected in boulware.in effect,plaintiffs would require federal courts to e
