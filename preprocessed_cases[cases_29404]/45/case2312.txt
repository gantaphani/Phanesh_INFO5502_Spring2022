factual and procedural background 
plaintiff submitted a claim to defendant,his homeowners insurance carrier,for the cost of repairing two decks attached to his home.plaintiff repaired the decks upon the recommendation of a contractor who had discovered severe deterioration of the framing members supporting the decks.plaintiff believed his decks were in a state of imminent collapse,entitling him to policy benefits.
defendant denied plaintiff claim on the ground,among others,that there had been no collapse of his decks within the meaning of the policy,in that its coverage was expressly restricted to actual collapse.
the losses not insured section of plaintiff homeowners policy provided that defendant did not insure for any loss to the dwelling caused by collapse,except as specifically provided in section coverages,collapse.that provision stated we insure only for direct physical loss to covered property involving the sudden,entire collapse of a building or any part of a building.collapse means actually fallen down or fallen into pieces.it does not include settling,cracking,shrinking,bulging,expansion,sagging or bowing.
plaintiff sued defendant for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.defendant moved for summary judgment,arguing that plaintiff did not suffer a compensable loss because the decks did not actually collapse in his opposition to the motion,plaintiff argued there was a material factual issue as to whether his decks were in a state of imminent collapse.plaintiff also argued that public policy required that the collapse provision of the policy be construed to provide coverage for imminent collapse.the trial court denied defendant motion for summary judgment,concluding there were triable issues of material fact.the parties agreed to try the case to the court on the narrow issue of whether defendant owed plaintiff policy benefits due to the imminent collapse of his decks.
the trial court found for plaintiff.the public policy of the state of california is that policyholders are entitled to coverage for collapse as long as the collapse is imminent,irrespective of policy language.the trial court declined to honor the policy restriction of coverage because it would,in the court view,encourage property owners to place lives in danger in order to allow insurance carriers to delay payment of claims until the structure actually collapses 
the court of appeal affirmed,holding that a homeowners policy that expressly defines the term collapse as actually fallen down or fallen into pieces must,nevertheless,for reasons of public policy,be construed as providing coverage for imminent collapse.

discussion 
i nterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller.while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,bank of the west.thus,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu ins.if possible,we infer this intent solely from the written provisions of the insurance policy.see id.at.if the policy language is clear and explicit,it governs.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d.palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d.
as the court of appeal acknowledged,the policy language here was clear and explicit.the plain language of the collapse provision in rosen homeowners policy is unambiguous,in that it is susceptible only of one reasonable collapse of a building or a portion thereof is a prerequisite to an entitlement to policy benefits.by defining the term collapse to mean actually fallen down or fallen into pieces,state farm effectively removed any ambiguity in the term collapse.under no stretch of the imagination does actually mean imminently.
the lack of ambiguity in the collapse provision here distinguishes this case,the court of appeal pointed out,from the case upon which the trial court principally west homeowners american guarantee liability ins.th,d doheny west.
in doheny west,supra,th at pages,d,the homeowners association of a large condominium complex sued its property insurer for breach of contract and bad faith,alleging that the parking structure of the complex,as well as the swimming pool and associated facilities built above the parking structure,had been in a state of imminent collapse,and that the insurer had wrongfully denied a claim for the necessary repairs the association had made to the structure.
unlike the policy in this case,the doheny west policy did not specify that the reach of the term collapse was restricted to actual collapse.instead,the doheny west policy excluded coverage for collapse except for loss or damage caused by or resulting from risks of direct physical loss involving collapse of a building or any part of a building resulting from specified causes.doheny west,supra,th at,d.while the doheny west trial court held that this language embraced imminent as well as actual collapse,the trial court found for the defendant insurer on the ground the plaintiff homeowners association had not met its burden of proving that any part of the building was in a state of imminent collapse.id.at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed.noting that its task was not merely to construe the word collapse in isolation,but rather to construe the total coverage clause,the court of appeal held that the coverage clause before it can not be said to be clear,explicit,and unambiguous,and thus must be interpreted to protect the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.citation.doheny west,supra,th at,d.with these principles in mind,the court of appeal stated it is undisputed that the clause covers collapse of a building,that is,that there is coverage if a building falls down or caves in.however,the clause does not limit itself to collapse of a building,but covers risk of loss,that is,the threat of loss.further,on its terms it covers not only loss resulting from an actual collapse,but loss involving collapse.thus,with the phrases risk of loss,and involving collapse,the policy broadens coverage beyond actual collapse,fn.omitted.
however,the court of appeal rejected the plaintiff contention that the policy phrases in question broaden ed coverage to the extent that the clause covers substantial impairment of structural integrity.doheny west,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal concluded that the trial court had correctly interpreted the policy language before it by requiring that the collapse be actual or imminent.id.at,d,fn.omitted.this construction of the policy,the court of appeal observed,avoids both the absurdity of requiring an insured to wait for a seriously damaged building to fall and the improper extension of coverage beyond the terms of the policy,and is consistent with the policy language and the reasonable expectations of the insured.ibid.
we agree with the court of appeal that doheny west is distinguishable from this case.as the court of appeal observed it is a rule that an opinion is only authority for those issues actually considered or decided.santisas goodin cal th,d,wilshire ins.tuff boy holding,th,d.at no time did the court in doheny west hold that an unambiguous collapse provision expressly limiting recovery to actual collapse must nevertheless be construed to provide coverage for imminent collapse.the court also did not purport to discern a public policy establishing a contractual entitlement to coverage for imminent collapse in all cases.it simply construed the ambiguous collapse provision before it,as it was required to do.aiu ins,supra,cal d.in so doing,it was required to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the insured and in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured.kazi state farm fire casualty cal th,d.in construing the collapse provision in doheny west to provide coverage for both actual and imminent collapse,the court expressly relied on the broad language of that particular policy.specifically,the court held that the phrases risk of loss,and involving collapse effectively broaden ed coverage beyond actual collapse.the state farm collapse provision at issue in this case,however,does not contain any comparable language that can be construed to extend coverage beyond actual collapse.
however,n otwithstanding the lack of ambiguity in state farm collapse provision,the court of appeal held,as a matter of public policy,that state farm must provide insurance benefits for imminent collapse of rosen two decks.
the court of appeal gave the following explanation for its decision not to enforce this unambiguous coverage provision the notion that in the absence of coverage for imminent collapse an insured may wait until the full or partial actual collapse of a building simply to ensure coverage is troubling indeed.the actual collapse of a building or any part of a building tragically can result in serious injury or loss of human life,as well as substantial property damage.a requirement that an insurer provide coverage when collapse is imminent clearly is in the best interests not only of the insured and the insured visitors but also of the insurer.rectifying the problem prior to an actual collapse may well save lives and money.moreover,our holding does not unduly burden the insurer because its liability is limited for a loss which is imminent,and,thus,soon to occur anyway.surely,an insurer exposure to liability will be far greater in the event of an actual collapse.any holding to the contrary would encourage property owners to risk serious injury or death or greater property damage simply to ensure that coverage would attach.we can not and will not sanction such a result.we therefore conclude that notwithstanding the language of the collapse provision,public policy mandates that state farm afford rosen coverage for the imminent collapse of his decks.
applying the same logic,with the same lack of restraint,courts could convert life insurance into health insurance.in rewriting the coverage provision to conform to their notions of sound public policy,the trial court and the court of appeal exceeded their authority,disregarding the clear language of the policy and the equally clear holdings of this court.in,national union fire ins.cal th,d,we held that an insurer duty to defend its insured in a suit seeking damages was limited to a civil action prosecuted in court,and did not extend to a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.the court of appeal in fireman fund ins.superior court th,d,we noted with approval,had rejected the suggestion because it is in the nation best interests to have hazardous waste cleaned up,our courts must construe insurance policies to provide coverage for such remedial work lest the insureds be discouraged from cooperating with the epa,at,d.t he court of appeal in fireman fund aptly stated,while we agree that it is in everyone best interests to have hazardous wastes cleaned up,we do not agree that a california court may rewrite an insurance policy for that purpose or for any purpose.this is a contract issue,and imposition of a duty to defend cercla proceedings that have not ripened into suits would impose on the insurer an obligation for which it may not be prepared whatever merit there may be to these conflicting social and economic considerations,they have nothing whatsoever to do with our determination whether the policy disjunctive use of suit and claim creates an ambiguity.fireman fund,supra,th at,fn,d,see also aiu ins,supra,cal d at,the answer is to be found solely in the language of the policies,not in public policy considerations,fn.omitted.
in lloyd of london,supra,cal th,d,we held that an insurer duty to indemnify its insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages is limited to money ordered by a court,and does not extend to expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.we rejected the argument that we should rewrite the indemnification provision,extending it to cleanup orders issued by an environmental agency,in order to advance the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination effects by calling in the insurer resources in supplement to those of an insured that is prosperous or in place of those of an insured that is not.our reason is that we do not rewrite any provision of any contract,including the standard policy underlying any individual policy,for any purpose.see transport indemnity cal th,d.to do so with regard to the standard policy,with which we are here concerned,might have untoward effects generally on individual insurers and individual insureds and also on society itself.through the standard policy,individual insurers made promises,and individual insureds paid premiums,against the risk of loss.to rewrite the provision imposing the duty to indemnify in order to remove its limitation to money ordered by a court might compel insurers to give more than they promised and might allow insureds to get more than they paid for,thereby denying their general free dom to contract as they please of any effect in the matter.id.at,d,accord,linnastruth mut.benefit.cal d.it is conceivable that to rewrite the provision thus might result in providing society itself with benefits that might outweigh any costs that it might impose on individual insurers and individual insureds.it is conceivable.but unknown.knowledge depend s in large part on what we are ill suited for,that is,the amassing and analyzing of complex and extensive empirical data.transport indemnity,supra,cal th at,d.without such knowledge we could not proceed.lloyd of london,supra,cal th at,d.

in aas,supra,cal th,d,we applied the economic loss rule in a negligence action by homeowners against the developer,contractor,and subcontractors who built their dwellings.the plaintiffs alleged that their homes suffered from many construction defects,but they conceded that many of the defects had caused no bodily injury or property damage.the trial court barred them from introducing evidence of the defects that had caused no injury to persons or property.we upheld the trial court ruling.we explained that under the economic loss rule,appreciable,nonspeculative,present injury is an essential element of a tort cause of action.id.at,d.construction defects that have not ripened into property damage,or at least into involuntary losses,we held,do not comfortably fit the definition of appreciable harm an essential element of a negligence claim.ibid.
