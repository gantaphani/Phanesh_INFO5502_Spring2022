plaintiffs,who are former employees of defendant city of medford city,allege that the city policy of denying health insurance coverage to retirees violates their due process rights.specifically,plaintiffs contend that oregon revised statutes section and city resolution confer on them a property interest in health insurance coverage that is protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.section provides that a local government that offers health insurance coverage to its officers and employees shall,insofar as and to the extent possible,make that coverage available for any retired employee who elects it.we certified a question as to the interpretation of this provision to the oregon supreme court and received that court answer.we now conclude that,under the oregon supreme court interpretation of section,neither that statute nor resolution creates a protected property interest.accordingly,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs due process claim.
in,the oregon legislative assembly enacted oregon revised statutes section,which read 
the governing body of any local government that contracts for or otherwise makes available health care insurance coverage for officers and employe e s of the local government may,in so far as sic and to the extent possible,make that coverage available for retired officers and employe e s of the local government and for spouses and unmarried children under years of age of those retired officers and employe e s.the governing body may prescribe reasonable terms and conditions of eligibility and coverage,not inconsistent with this section,for making that coverage available.the local government may agree to pay none,part or all of the cost of making that coverage available.
or.laws ch,emphasis added.
in,the oregon legislature amended the statute.or.laws ch.the legislature replaced the discretionary word may with the mandatory word shall.the legislature also inserted a provision stating that the local government may,but need not make coverage available after a retired employee or that employee spouse becomes eligible for medicare or a retired employee child reaches the age of majority.the statute currently reads 
the governing body of any local government that contracts for or otherwise makes available health care insurance coverage for officers and employees of the local government shall,insofar as and to the extent possible,make that coverage available for any retired employee of the local government who elects within days after the effective date of retirement to participate in that coverage and,at the option of the retired employee,for the spouse of the retired employee and any unmarried children under years of age.the health care insurance coverage shall be made available for a retired employee until the retired employee becomes eligible for federal medicare coverage,for the spouse of a retired employee until the spouse becomes eligible for federal medicare coverage and for a child until the child arrives at majority,and may,but need not,be made available thereafter.the governing body may prescribe reasonable terms and conditions of eligibility and coverage,not inconsistent with this section,for making the health care insurance coverage available.the local government may pay none of the cost of making that coverage available or may agree,by collective bargaining agreement or otherwise,to pay part or all of that cost.
emphases added.
in,the city adopted resolution,which set forth the city plan for complying with section.the resolution interprets section as requiring that continuation of health insurance be offered to employees who retire from city service.the resolution provides that a retiree shall have a sixty day period from the date of retirement in which to elect coverage.under the resolution,a n otherwise qualified retiree may continue on the program until the earliest of several events,including the retiree attainment of medicare eligibility,termination of insurance coverage by the city or its carrier,or termination of the retiree program by the city.
before,the city permitted all employees to elect to continue their health insurance coverage upon retirement.in,however,the city negotiated with its police officers union for a health insurance program that did not give officers the opportunity to continue coverage after retirement.in,the city placed employees under that same health insurance program,which does not cover retirees.in,the city placed employees of its parks and recreation department and its public works department in the same program.
the city contracts with the oregon teamsters employers trust to provide health insurance to its employees.the teamsters contract with the city states p articipants are not allowed to participate in the trust retiree plan or any insured or hmo option available through it.this provision means that retirees are excluded from coverage under the teamsters plan.the members of the teamsters are responsible for voting on the extent of coverage.according to the city,the teamsters were willing to provide health insurance benefits to retired employees,but only if the members of the teamsters voted for such coverage.to date,the members have not approved an extension of health insurance benefits to retirees.
although the city does not provide health insurance coverage after retirement,retirees can choose to remain covered for months after their retirement under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of.after that period expires,retired employees can enroll in the oregon public employees retirement system health insurance program,into which the city has paid so that its retired employees can obtain coverage.
in august,plaintiffs filed suit against the city and city manager michael dyal.plaintiffs are former city police officers or employees who have retired and who have been denied benefits under the teamsters plan.plaintiffs alleged that defendants had violated resolution and oregon revised statutes section the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment the age discrimination in employment act of adea,and the parallel oregon age discrimination statute.the district court granted summary judgment on the due process and the adea claims 
in its order granting summary judgment,the district court held that neither section nor resolution afforded plaintiffs a constitutionally protected property interest.the court reasoned that the statute text did not sufficiently limit the conditions under which the city would be required to extend health insurance coverage to retirees.because a protected property interest is a prerequisite to a due process claim,the district court concluded that plaintiffs claim failed as a matter of law.plaintiffs appealed 
in a decision filed last year,we determined that section was ambiguous as to how much discretion it conferred on local governments.doyle city of medford,cir order.whether the statute significantly constrains the discretion of local governments is central to our analysis of the alleged property interest.because no oregon appellate court had construed the provision at issue,we certified a question to the oregon supreme court.we asked the oregon supreme court 
what amount of discretion does oregon revised statutes section confer on local governments to determine whether or not to provide health insurance coverage to their employees after retirement 
id.at.the oregon supreme court accepted the certified question.doyle city of medford,or table.
the oregon supreme court reject ed the city position that the statute delegates to the city discretion to make health insurance coverage available to retired employees.doyle city of medford,or.rather,the court held that local governments have an obligation to make health insurance coverage available to retirees,but that there may be factual circumstances that excuse that obligation.id.at.what constitutes compliance with this standard will depend on the circumstances of each case and can not be determined in the abstract.id.at.it is the government burden to show circumstances sufficient to excuse the obligation.id.at.the mere fact that,
