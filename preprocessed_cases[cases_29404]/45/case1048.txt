procedural background 
mmo filed suit against amalia,barr,tran,and luu on april.in its complaint,mmo alleged that tran,luu,amalia,and barr breached the insurance contract,made negligent misrepresentations,and engaged in fraudulent behavior.mmo sought compensatory damages for these claims.mmo also sought partial rescission of the contract,as it related to coverage of tran and her dependents.for this claim,mmo requested that the court provide restitution in an amount to be determined at trial,but believed to exceed,plus interest,attorney fees and court costs.at compl.finally,mmo brought a claim against tran and luu,alleging that they had been unjustly enriched by their failure to disclose their son condition and seeking compensatory damages.amalia filed an answer that included counterclaims alleging that the litigation was frivolous,that mmo had tortiously interfered with amalia current and future contractual relations,that mmo had negligently handled the analysis and payment of claims,and that mmo had breached its contract with amalia.at answer and countercl.at.amalia sought compensatory damages in excess of on its counterclaims.

ii.jurisdiction 
although the district court did not analyze jurisdiction,and the parties have not contested our jurisdiction,we must independently satisfy ourselves that the federal courts have jurisdiction.see steel citizens for a better env t,d goodyear atomic miller,d.to that end,we requested letter briefs addressing jurisdiction prior to oral argument.jurisdiction,in this case is premised on mmo federal cause of action brought under the employee retirement income security act of,et erisa.specifically,mmo asserted a claim under erisa provision,a,a,seeking partial rescission of the contract between mmo and amalia.
section a provides that a fiduciary may bring a civil action a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.a.dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because of the inadequacy of the federal claim is proper only when the claim is so insubstantial,implausible,foreclosed by prior decisions of this court,or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.steel,at.quoting oneida indian nation of county of oneida,d.jurisdiction is defeated only if the federal claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.id.quoting bell hood.
whatever the merits of mmo a claim for equitable relief,it is clear that this claim is not wholly insubstantial and frivolous.id.there is no dispute that mmo is a fiduciary,that the plan at issue in this case qualifies as an erisa plan,and that none of the statutory exemptions from erisa are applicable.as a fiduciary,mmo may,pursuant to a,seek appropriate equitable relief to redress violations of erisa or to enforce the terms of the plan.the only remaining threshold question regarding mmo a claim is whether that claim and the relief requested from the district of the be characterized as equitable or legal.sereboff mid atlantic med,d life annuity ins.knudson,d.as discussed below,this issue was not raised by the parties and therefore we do not pass on it.in any case,the answer is irrelevant to our jurisdiction inquiry.even if the contract rescission requested by mmo were characterized as legal relief and therefore failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,federal courts would nonetheless have jurisdiction.see primax recoveries,gunter,cir in sum,we hold that a district court has jurisdiction over an action ostensibly brought under a apparently for solely legal relief,even if that action fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.accordingly,we conclude that there is jurisdiction over this action.
iii.motion for summary judgment and motion for reconsideration 
standards of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.mazur young,cir.summary judgment is proper if the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.c.because we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,we may affirm the judgment on grounds other than those employed by the lower court,as long as the party opposing summary judgment is not denied the opportunity to respond.thornton fed.express,cir see also nance goodyear tire rubber,cir.
although we usually review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of a motion to reconsider,when a party files a motion for reconsideration of a grant of summary judgment we review the district court decision de novo.sommer davis,cir,cert.denied,d.however,a district court refusal to consider evidence produced for the first time on a motion to reconsider will be reversed only if the refusal constitutes an abuse of discretion.id.
erisa claim 
we may assume without having to decide that mmo claim states an equitable claim cognizable under a mmo claim is nonetheless barred by the limitations provision of the contract between mmo and amalia,which provides 
no action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of sixty days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy.no such action shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.in the case of legal action other than those to recover benefits,no such action may be brought more than two years from the date the cause of action arises.
at contract at.the district court assumed that the provision applied to all of mmo claims,and mmo brief on appeal repeatedly refers to the limit.mmo br.at.we note,however,that the provision,which refers to a legal action,could plausibly be read as referring only to actions at law so as not to include equitable claims.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed discussing the historical distinction between actions at law and suits in equity.however,we need not decide whether it is the provision or the provision that applies to mmo claim.as we explain below,because mmo claim accrued in february but mmo did not bring suit until april,more than three years later,mmo claim is barred even if we assume that only the provision applies.
erisa does not provide a statute of limitations for suits brought by a fiduciary under a when a federal statute contains no limitations period,we normally borrow the limitations period from the most analogous state or federal law.lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d wilson garcia,d.however,choosing which statute to borrow is unnecessary when the parties have contractually agreed on a limitations period and that limitations period is reasonable.see morrison marsh mclennan,cir upholding application of contractual limitations period contained in benefits handbook to erisa action see also northlake reg l med.ctr.waffle house.employee benefit plan,cir holding that contractual limitations periods on erisa actions are enforceable,regardless of state law,provided they are reasonable doe blue cross blue shield united of,cir holding that contractual limitations periods if reasonable are enforceable in suits under erisa,regardless of state law.because the contract language clearly states that the parties shall have either two years or three years to bring the claim at issue and mmo did not present arguments indicating that a limitations period of two or three years would be unreasonable,we find no reason to believe that the contractual limitations provision here is unreasonable.accordingly,we uphold the district court finding that the limitations provision applies to this case.
we now turn to mmo argument that because it did not discover the alleged fraud until august,the discovery rule makes its suit,filed on april,timely under the contractual limitations period.as a preliminary matter,although the parties and the district court assumed that ohio law governed application of the discovery rule,we have held that the discovery rule is a matter of federal common law in the context of erisa claims under a.united food commercial workers unions v.the muir,cir although the statute of limitations may be borrowed from state law,it is federal law that determines the date on which a statute of limitation s begins to run.the presence in the parties contract of a provision stating that the contract will be governed by the laws of the state of ohio,at contract at,does not change this result.as we have observed elsewhere,the normal purpose of such choice of law clauses is to determine that the law of one state rather than that of another state will be applicable they simply do not speak to any interaction between state and federal law.ferro garrison,cir quoting volt info.sciences,bd.of trustees,d brennan,dissenting.
under the general formulation of the discovery rule,a claim accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff discovers,or in the exercise of due diligence should have discovered,the injury which forms the basis for his claim.see,dixon clem,cir.united food,at collecting cases.in the context of fraud,we have imposed upon the plaintiff a positive duty to use diligence in discovering the existence of a cause of action.herm stafford,cir.we have also held that i nformation sufficient to alert a reasonable person to the possibility of wrongdoing gives rise to a party duty to inquire into the matter with due diligence.united food,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.and in determining whether a plaintiff was reasonably diligent,we have stated that a plaintiff superior personnel and equipment with which to detect foreseeable error is relevant to the inquiry.id.
mmo had access to information more than three years before it filed suit that,in the exercise of due diligence,should have allowed it to discover that hiep luu had a condition.at least as early as february,mmo had the following information tran and luu did not disclose hemophilia as a condition for hiep luu,and within a few months of the contract formation,on february,mmo had paid over worth of hemophilia treatments for hiep luu.see at claims paid chart at.yet mmo did not file suit until april,more than three years after it began paying claims for luu hemophilia treatment.mmo argues that it did not discover that tran and luu had misrepresented hiep luu health status on their application until an audit that mmo conducted in august.although mmo may have obtained actual knowledge that hiep luu had a condition only in august,we conclude that it reasonably should have discovered this fact in february.
in michigan united food,we affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiff,a union welfare fund,which had brought suit under erisa to recover alleged employer underpayments to the fund.at.like mmo,the plaintiff in michigan united food did not have actual knowledge of its causes of action until it completed an internal audit,and similarly relied upon the discovery rule to argue that its claims were not barred by the limitations period.id.at.noting that the plaintiff possessed both the data and the qualified personnel necessary to detect the errors on which it brought suit,we concluded that i ts failure to detect the errors until the audit was attributable to a lack of diligence.id.at.
viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to mmo,we believe the same reasoning applies h
