in this declaratory judgment action,benchmark construction services,benchmark and its insurer,united states liability insurance company uslic,debate the scope of an employer liability exclusion in a dispute over the insurer duty to defend and indemnify benchmark in an underlying personal injury lawsuit.ruling on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court concluded that uslic had no duty to defend or indemnify benchmark in the personal injury lawsuit.given ambiguities in the exclusion,which must be construed in the insured favor,we reverse.
in july,homeowners tom and sue ghezzi hired general contractor benchmark to renovate their newton,massachusetts home.the homeowners had hired architect thomas huth to design the renovation plans.huth,in turn,hired sara egan painted design to apply decorative painting to one of the interior walls,and egan set her employee,meghan bailey,to the task.uncontestedly,benchmark had no contractual relationship with huth,egan,or bailey neither was bailey work performed under a contract with any of benchmark contractors or subcontractors.on march,while bailey was applying the decorative paint,she fell from a ladder that was positioned on top of scaffolding.
bailey sued benchmark in the massachusetts superior court,alleging that she was injured in the fall,that benchmark owed her a duty of care,and that benchmark negligently erected and maintained the ladder and scaffolding benchmark sought a defense from its insurer,uslic,but uslic determined that bailey claims are not covered under benchmark insurance policy and,hence,that uslic has no duty to defend or indemnify benchmark against those claims.according to uslic,an endorsement to the policy excludes bailey injuries from coverage.
at the time of the accident,benchmark was insured under uslic commercial general liability coverage policy.the policy confers broad coverage for bodily injury and property damage,as well as for personal and advertising injury and medical expenses.these coverages are then refined through numerous exclusions.endorsements are appended to the policy,many of which provide additional exclusions or alter the contours of existing exclusions.one of these endorsements,bodily injury exclusion all employees,volunteer workers,temporary workers,casual laborers,contractors,and subcontractors the l endorsement,entirely replaces the employer liability exclusion from the original policy and is at the heart of this appeal.as modified by the l endorsement,the insurance does not apply to 
i e bodily injury to any contractor,subcontractor or any employee,volunteer worker,temporary worker or casual laborer of any contractor or subcontractor arising out of or in the course of rendering or performing services of any kind or nature whatsoever by such contractor,subcontractor or employee,volunteer worker,temporary worker or casual laborer of such contractor or subcontractor for which any insured may become liable in any capacity.
stripped of language not relevant here,this provision excludes 
bodily injury to any employee of any contractor arising out of rendering services of any kind for which any insured may become liable in any capacity.
contractor is not a defined term under the policy the policy provides that uslic has a duty to defend benchmark against suits seeking damages because of bodily injury to which this insurance applies.
on june,uslic filed a declaratory judgment action in the massachusetts district court to establish that the insurance policy does not provide coverage for bailey claims,and that uslic consequently has no duty to defend or indemnify benchmark against those claims.benchmark counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment establishing that bailey claims are,indeed,covered under the policy and that uslic has a duty to defend and indemnify its insured,benchmark,in the underlying personal injury action.the parties submitted cross motions for summary judgment.
on july,the district court entered judgment for uslic.the court held that the policy excludes bailey claims because the l endorsement excludes injuries to contractors employees who are injured while performing services.although the insurance policy does not provide a definition of contractor,the court held that contractor unambiguously means anyone with a contract.since bailey boss,egan,had contracted to do the decorative painting,bailey was a contractor employee and her claims are subject to the exclusion.benchmark appealed.

the l endorsement excludes claims for bodily injury to contractors,subcontractors,and their various workers and employees.the district court based its decision on the scope of the word contractor,which it held unambiguously means anyone with a contract.thus,the court held,since bailey was a decorative artist working for egan,who had a contract with the architect,she was the employee of a contractor and the exclusion applies to her claims.
we conclude that the undefined term,contractor,is ambiguous.we also conclude that there is an additional ambiguity in the exclusion at issue not addressed by the district court whether the phrase for which any insured may become liable refers to services or bodily injury.resolving these ambiguities in favor of benchmark removes the uncertainty about the scope of the l endorsement exclusion and brings bailey claims squarely within the coverage of the policy.
ambiguous antecedent 
we begin with the ambiguity in the l endorsement that the district court did not consider.here,we focus not on the meaning of the word contractor in the endorsement,but rather on the proper reading of a phrase b odily injury to any employee of any contractor arising out of rendering services of any kind for which any insured may become liable.emphasis added.the parties disagree about the proper antecedent of the phrase for which any insured may become liable that is,whether it modifies services or bodily injury.
according to benchmark,t he phrase for which any insured may become liable modifies the clause services of any kind,indicating that the policy excludes the claims of a contractor employee only if the contractor employee is injured while performing services for which the insured has some responsibility.uslic,on the other hand,contends that the exclusion uses deliberately broad language to reflect that an insured might become liable to a worker on a job site with whom the insured has no contractual relationship.under that interpretation,the phrase for which any insured may become liable modifies bodily injury,not services.
construing the provision as benchmark suggests limits the exclusion to bodily injury that
