removal garnishment 
the panel vacated the district court judgment discharging insurers,and remanded for further proceedings in a garnishment proceeding arising out of an insurance settlement and assignment.
in the underlying settlement,the plaintiffs and defendant stipulated to a judgment against the defendant for million,and defendant assigned to the plaintiffs her rights against her liability insurers.plaintiffs applied in state court for writs of garnishment against the insurers.the insurers removed the state garnishment proceedings to federal district court.
the district court,pursuant to fed.civ,applied arizona garnishment law,and held that because the plaintiffs missed their ten day window for objecting,the garnishment failed and the were discharged.
the panel held that the garnishment proceeding was removable,and the district court had jurisdiction.the panel held that under swanson liberty national insurance,cir,the garnishment proceeding against the insurers,for purposes of removal,was a separate and independent civil action from the suit by the plaintiffs in the underlying action and as such,it was removable.
the panel held that there was no federal judgment in this case upon which to execute.the panel noted that the only judgment was in the superior court of the state of arizona.the panel further held that the necessary predicate for application of fed.civ.was a judgment in the federal district court in which execution was sought.the panel also held that there was no state judgment against the insurance companies that could be registered and enforced in federal court.
the panel held that the district court had discretion under fed.civ.c to order repleading.the panel held that the arizona laws for garnishment proceedings,were,upon removal,supplanted by the federal rules.the panel also held that the district court may order repleading because this case was in substance a claim by the insureds assignee against the insurers for breaching their obligations under their insurance policies,and the claims in the state court pleadings were no longer at issue.
we address removability and procedural law for garnishment.
marcus labertew,his wife,and john and jennifer mcdermott sued fred auzenne and loral langemeier in the superior court for the state of arizona.they claimed that auzenne and langemeier defrauded marcus labertew and john mcdermott to get them to work for auzenne and langemeier multilevel company,defamed them regarding their employment at the company,owed them salary and expense money,and got john mcdermott falsely arrested and imprisoned in korea while on a business trip for the company.
the labertews,the mcdermotts,and langemeier settled the case with what in arizona is called a damron agreement,after the case accepting the validity of this procedure under the agreement,plaintiffs dismissed their case,they and defendant langemeier stipulated to a judgment against her for million,a covenant not to execute against her personally and an assignment by her to plaintiffs of her rights against her liability insurers chartis property casualty and century insurance.
such cases are often followed by new lawsuits by the assignees,that is,the injured plaintiffs holding the assignment,against the insurance company.the labertews and the mcdermotts,though,did not pursue that course.instead,they applied in state court for writs of garnishment against the insurers.garnishment is commonly used by successful plaintiffs such as collection companies,to garnish wages from judgment debtors employers and savings from judgment debtors bank accounts.the labertews and the mcdermotts theory was that because they had a judgment against langemeier for million,and the insurers owed langemeier this much,the insurance companies should pay them this money as langemeier judgment creditors.
arizona has a procedure for contesting garnishment,as when a bank has no funds in an account owned by the judgment debtor,or a putative employer no longer employs the judgment debtor and owes no wages to him.the procedure is that within ten days,the garnishee answers,and if the garnishee claims it owes the debtor nothing or less than the full amount,then the judgment creditor has ten days to file an objection to the answer if no objection to such an answer is timely filed,then the garnishee is discharged 
the insurance companies removed the garnishment proceedings to federal district court,and answered that they owed nothing.the labertews and the mcdermotts never objected to this answer.the district court concluded that it had jurisdiction,and that pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,arizona garnishment law applied therefore,because the labertews and the mcdermotts had missed their ten day window for objecting,the garnishment failed,and under arizona law the garnishees were discharged 
the labertews and the mcdermotts appeal.
the labertews and the mcdermotts make two arguments first,the district court lacked jurisdiction because the garnishment was not removable second,if the garnishment was removable,then their failure to file an objection was immaterial,because the federal procedural rules did not import this arizona requirement.we review both issues de novo 
jurisdiction.
only a civil action can be removed from state court to federal court garnishment of wages or money in a bank account is ordinarily a collection device completed within the same proceeding as the case against the judgment debtor,not a separate action.this suggests a question of whether the garnishment in this case is removable.
we answered that question yes,in swanson liberty national insurance in swanson,as in this case,a tort plaintiff obtained judgment,then sought to garnish,in state court,the amount of the judgment from the defendant liability insurer the insurer removed,federal jurisdiction was contested,and we held that the federal district court did indeed have jurisdiction over the garnishment issue we comment that the labels the case had in the state court and the fact that the whole sequence had only one case number there are not determinative of the question of whether the garnishment issue is separable from the tort liability issue and thus can be considered an independent action.following the eighth circuit,we held that separability,so far as it affects removal,is in the end a federal question.
this case is not distinguishable from swanson.swanson arose from alaska garnishment procedures,and this case arises out of arizona procedures,but the differences between the state procedural rules are not material to the analysis our sister circuits generally agree with the position taken by swanson as do the treatises to the extent that arizona law may differ from the alaska garnishment procedures construed in swanson,and to the extent that it might matter,removability is even clearer here.we noted in swanson that alaska had not yet characterized its garnishment proceedings as to separability but arizona holds that a garnishment proceeding,after its inception,is treated in all respects,except its title,as an original independent action.
treating the garnishment as a separate civil action for purposes of removal makes sense.langemeier,the defendant in the arizona action,has no interest in the dispute,being protected by a covenant not to execute.the insurance companies were not parties to the arizona case.though the complaint in the arizona action may affect the coverage and duty to defend issues in the garnishment,the issues at most overlap,and are not congruent.the insurers duties,which will control the garnishment,were not relevant to and did not arise in the arizona tort case.the insurers may be entitled to a jury trial which they have already requested as well as discovery,addressing coverage and duty to defend procedures rarely needed in routine wage and bank account garnishments.the amount in controversy and complete diversity requirements between the insurance companies and the labertews and mcdermotts have not been disputed.the lack of diversity between the labertews and mcdermotts and langemeier is immaterial,because langemeier is a nominal part y with nothing at stake.
