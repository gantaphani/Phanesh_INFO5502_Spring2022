aicco,granite state insurance company,and northwestern pacific indemnity company appeal,contending the trial court erred when it sustained a demurrer and dismissed the complaint in which they alleged respondent insurance company of north america ina and various related entities had violated the unfair competition law hereafter ucl.bus,et appellants are entities transacting business.their complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the issue of whether respondent ina could shed all liability under a class of policies providing asbestos and environmental coverage,by restructuring itself and assigning its liabilities to another company,without obtaining the consent of affected california policyholders.
we agree the court erred when it sustained the demurrer and abused its discretion when it dismissed the complaint for lack of a justiciable controversy.we will reverse the judgment in favor of ina.
factual and procedural background 
it is well settled that on review of an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,we presume all material allegations of the complaint to be true.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,blank kirwan cal d.we do not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.moore regents of university of california cal d.appellants complaint alleges the following material facts.
ina is the oldest stock insurance company in the united states.over the course of its history,ina has sold billions of dollars of asbestos and environmental a e insurance to consumers in california and elsewhere.
ina a e coverage was unprofitable for the company.thus ina corporate parents,cigna corporation,and ina financial,developed a plan for ina to shed its obligations under the a e policies it had written.this was accomplished in the following manner.
ina was incorporated under the laws of pennsylvania.that state has a statute that permits corporate division.see.thus,utilizing the division statute,ina divided into two entities.the first was and still is known as ina.it consists of the lines of insurance that had proved profitable for the ina.the ina continues to write insurance under the ina name.
the second entity was cci insurance company cci,a subsidiary of cigna.pursuant to the division,ina transferred its obligations under the a e policies to cci.because cci was not authorized to conduct insurance business in pennsylvania,cci then merged with another cigna subsidiary,century indemnity.century indemnity exists solely to handle and to pay pending and future claims,including a e claims,out of a limited pool of assets provided to it by cigna.century indemnity does not write any new insurance or collect any new premiums.
ina contends that as a result of the restructuring,it is now free of any obligation to its california policyholders under the a e policies it had written.according to ina,if century indemnity is unable to satisfy all those obligations,the owners of the transferred policies will have no recourse against ina as it currently exists.
the restructuring plan was approved by the pennsylvania insurance commissioner in february without the consent of california policyholders,and without a requirement that consent be obtained.in july,the pennsylvania supreme court ruled that the procedures followed by the insurance department when approving the restructuring were adequate and that the plan could take effect.see lafarge,ins.the court said,however,that policyholders were not foreclosed from asserting any legal rights they might have.id.at.
the california department of insurance also approved the restructuring plan.that approval was expressly conditioned on the right of affected policyholders to challenge the impact of the reorganization in the courts.
the division of ina had immediate negative consequences for ina california policyholders.prior to the division,owners of the transferred policies were protected from the risk of ina insolvency by the california insurance guarantee association.coverage under the guarantee fund is,however,only available when the claimant insurer actually issued the policy under which a claim is made.since century indemnity did not issue the transferred policies,those policies were no longer entitled to guarantee fund protection.
under the order entered by the pennsylvania insurance commissioner,ina was required to provide written notice to its policyholders regarding the allocation of ina liabilities to century indemnity.ina did so in a form letter on cigna letterhead that was signed by gerald isom,the president of cigna and ina.the letter did not tell policyholders that ina had transferred its obligations under the a e policies to century indemnity,or that it disclaimed further responsibility under the transferred policies.instead the letter stated g enerally,ina policy claims with a date prior to january,are now handled by century and claims on or after january,will be handled by ina there will be no change in the manner in which your claim is serviced.no additional action on your part is required.
in december,two competitors of ina,appellants aicco,and granite state insurance company,filed the present action against ina and cigna.in january,aicco and granite state,joined by another competitor of ina,appellant northwestern pacific indemnity company filed an amended complaint naming ina financial,century indemnity company and ace property casualty insurance company as additional defendants the amended complaint contained a single cause of action.appellants sought a declaration that ina had violated the ucl in two respects.first appellants relied on civil code section which states,the burden of an obligation may be transferred with the consent of the party entitled to its benefit,but not otherwise appellants alleged ina had violated civil code section when it transferred the a e policies held by its california policyholders to century indemnity without their consent.appellants sought a declaration that ina remained liable under the transferred policies.alternately,appellants alleged that the notices ina had sent to its california policyholders were deceptive and misleading because they did not describe the true nature of what had occurred as a result of the restructuring.appellants asked that ina be required to take appropriate corrective action to alleviate the harm its previous misleading conduct has caused 
ina demurred to the complaint.it argued it was entitled to prevail as a matter of law because its conduct was not illegal under the ucl.ina supported its demurrer with numerous documents including orders issued by the pennsylvania and california insurance departments when approving ina corporate division.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court did not discuss whether civil code section had been violated or whether the notice provided by ina to its california policyholders was misleading.instead,the court ruled that assessing the ability of century indemnity to satisfy the obligations undertaken by ina was speculative and premature.the court also concluded that the pennsylvania and california insurance departments alone possessed the expertise needed to determine whether california policyholders might suffer harm as a result of the transfer.
after the trial court entered judgment in favor of ina,appellants filed the present appeal.
ii.discussion 
a.the complaint states a cause of action 
appellants contend the trial court erred when it sustained the demurrer to their complaint.
in reviewing a dismissal following the trial court sustaining of a demurrer,we take the properly pleaded material allegations of the complaint as true our only task is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.snyder michael stores,cal th,d.we must give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.citation.if the complaint states a cause of action under any theory,regardless of the title under which the factual basis for relief is stated,that aspect of the complaint is good against a demurrer.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.
here appellants complaint sought a declaration that ina had violated the ucl.that law prohibits unfair competition,which is defined by the statute to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice bus.t he legislature intended this sweeping language to include anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,quoting bank of the west superior court cal th,d.
because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices that are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.when determining whether a practice is unlawful,section borrows violations of other laws,and makes them independently actionable under the ucl.communications,at,d.virtually any,state or serve as a predicate for a section claim.stevens superior court th,d.
in general,the unfairness prong has been used to enjoin deceptive or sharp business practices.klein earth elements,th,d.
the standard for determining whether an action is fraudulent within the meaning of business and professions code section is simply whether the public is likely to be deceived.state farm fire casualty superior court th,d disapproved on other grounds in communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d.this means that a section violation,unlike common law fraud,can be shown even if no one was actually deceived,relied upon the fraudulent practice,or sustained any damage.state farm fire casualty,at,d.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the complaint.appellants alleged that ina violated the ucl when it transferred the a e policies held by its california policyholders to century indemnity without obtaining the policyholders consent.appellants sought a declaration that ina remained liable to those policyholders.we agree appellants stated a cause of action under this theory.
civil code section states,the burden of an obligation may be transferred with the consent of the party entitled to its benefit,but not otherwise this language does not mean that a third person can not assume the obligations of a contract between other parties,but only that he can not relieve a party thereto from his obligations without the consent of the creditor.wiseman sklar.
two courts have applied these principles recently in the insurance context.in travelers indemnity gillespie cal d,the court posed the question of whether an insurer that wished to withdraw from the market and to transfer its obligations to another company through a reinsurance and assumption agreement,could be released from liability to its insureds.the court ruled the original insurer would remain liable,explaining its decision as follows a contract by which a reinsurer assumes the policies of the original insurer does result in the reinsurer being directly liable to the original insureds citation,but it does not release the original insurer,which remains jointly obligated with the reinsurer citations.indeed,the original insurer can not be released by any agreement with another insurer,absent the consent of the insured.see,id.at.
similarly,in baer associated life ins.d,an insurance company had withdrawn from certain insurance lines pursuant to a cease and desist order issued by the california insurance commissioner.the company then entered into a reinsurance and assumption agreement with a second insurer to take over its insurance contracts.when the second insurer defaulted,a plaintiff sought to recover from the original insurer,arguing it had never consented to the reinsurance and assumption agreement.applying civil code section,the court ruled the plaintiff could recover in those circumstances because i t simply is not within the power of an insurer,against the consent of the insured,to substitute another insurer in carrying out its undertaking.baer,at.
the results reached in travelers and baer are consistent with the manner in which insurance contracts are interpreted nationally.as a insurance treatise explains,an insurer may not transfer its liability to another company and compel its policyholders to accept the new company as their insurer.when another insurance company assumes the insurer obligations,the original insurer is not relieved of its liability to the insured without the consent of the insured to substitute another insurer.holmes appleman on insurance,quoting security ben.life ins.
by alleging ina had transferred its a e policies to century indemnity without obtaining policyholders consent,and then disclaimed any further responsibility,appellants have plead a violation of civil code section.the violation of civil code section,in turn,was adequate to allow appellants to proceed under the theory that ina action was an unlawful business practice under the ucl.communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d.we conclude appellants complaint states a cause of action under this theory.
we reach the same conclusion about the alternate theory of the complaint.appellants alleged that the notice ina sent to its policyholders violated the ucl because it was deceptive and misleading.the notice did not mention that ina had transferred its contractual obligations to century indemnity,nor did it state that ina had disclaimed any further responsibility under the a e policies it had written.rather,ina told its policyholders to do nothing and implied that nothing of consequence had occurred.we conclude these actions were likely to deceive ina a e policyholders about the consequences of the reorganization and how it would affect their right to insurance coverage under the policies they had purchased.the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud under the ucl.state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at,d.
ina disputes these conclusions and advances a host of reasons why the court order sustaining the demurrer should be affirmed.we now address those arguments.
b.the complaint states a justiciable controversy 
ina contends the trial court properly sustained the demurrer because appellants complaint did not state a justiciable controversy.
first,noting that appellants framed their cause of action as one for declaratory relief,ina contends the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to assume jurisdiction over the dispute.ina relies on authority that holds a trial court can sustain a demurrer if the complaint is devoid of essential facts showing the necessity or propriety of a declaration wilson transit authority d.
while trial courts do have discretion to decline to issue a declaratory judgment,that power has been strictly confined.where a case is properly before the trial court,under a complaint which is legally sufficient and sets forth facts and circumstances showing that a declaratory adjudication is entirely appropriate,the trial court may not properly refuse to assume jurisdiction and if it does enter a dismissal,it will be directed by an appellate tribunal to entertain the action.declaratory relief must be granted when the facts justifying that course are sufficiently alleged.columbia pictures detoth cal d,see also witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,cases cites therein.
here the complaint alleges that ina transferred its a e policies to century indemnity and then disclaimed any further responsibility under those policies.appellants contend that act violated civil code section and cases interpreting that section,which hold that i t simply is not within the power of an insurer,against the consent of the insured,to substitute another insurer in carrying out its undertaking.baer associated life ins,supra,d at.a complaint for declaratory relief is legally sufficient if it sets forth facts showing the existence of an actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties under a written instrument and requests that these rights and duties be adjudged by the court.maguire hibernia soc.cal d.we conclude appellant complaint satisfies these requirements.the trial court abused its discretion when it declined to assume jurisdiction over the case.
next,ina contends the complaint was not justiciable because in the absence of a default or breach,civil code section gives rise to no cause of action.to support this argument,ina relies primarily on a quote from baer associated life ins,where the court stated,the obligations of an assignor of a contract continue to rest upon him and he will be required to respond to the other party to the contract in the event of a default on the part of the assignee.citation.baer associated life ins,supra,d.quoting wiseman sklar,supra.at,italics added.while the language quoted can reasonably be read to mean that a party who assigns a contract to a third party remains liable in the event of a breach by the assignee,it does not mean that civil code section is violated only when an assignee breaches.indeed,in travelers indemnity gillespie,our supreme court held that when one insurance company assigns its obligations to another,both the original insurer and the assuming insurer are obligated to the insured and that the original insurer can not be released by any agreement with another insurer,absent the consent of the insured.travelers indemnity gillespie,supra,cal d at.nowhere did the court state that a current or prospective breach was necessary.we conclude a cause of action under civil code section can be stated even if the party to whom a contract has been transferred is not in default.
ina also contends there is no justiciable dispute because it never disclaimed responsibility under the a e policies that were transferred to century indemnity.instead,ina contends it has left the question of disclaiming liability under the policies as a matter for an unknown and unlikely future day.mindful of the issue before us,we reject this argument.when determining whether a complaint states a cause of action we are obligated to presume the material allegations of the complaint are true.snyder michael stores,supra,cal th at,d.here appellants alleged ina has taken the position that it is now free of any obligation to pay policyholders the full amount to which they are entitled,if century indemnity does not do so and that if century indemnity is unable to discharge all of ina future obligations under the transferred policies,the owners of the transferred policies will be without recourse against ina.these allegations were adequate to create a justiciable dispute.
appellants have standing to bring this claim 
ina contends that appellants lack standing to bring the present suit.
business and professions code section states that an action for relief under the ucl may be filed by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.emphasis added.our supreme court has interpreted this language to mean that a private plaintiff who has himself suffered no injury at all may sue to obtain relief for others.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,supra,cal th at,d.we conclude that under the broad language of business and professions code section as interpreted by our supreme court,appellants have standing to bring the present suit.
the cases ina cites do not undermine this conclusion.south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance th,d involved a claim by a car dealer that a lending institution employed a fraudulent method of calculating interest.the trial court dismissed the suit after concluding the defendants had not violated the ucl.the appellate court affirmed because t here is no evidentiary basis for restitution,disgorgement or injunctive relief under the standards of because plaintiff failed to show actual deception or likelihood of deception in connection with any of the business practices or transactions at issue.id.at,d.the court did not mention standing or base its decision on that ground.
similarly in bronco wine frank logoluso farms d,the issue was the propriety of awarding restitution to grape growers who were not parties to the action.the appellate court noted the widely varying facts relating to each grower and decided to reverse the restitution judgment as to those growers.id.at.again,the court did not mention standing or base its decision on that ground.
d.the regulatory proceedings do not preclude judicial review 
ina contends the trial court properly abstained from deciding this case.this argument has several components.first ina contends the trial court acted properly when it refus ed to revisit and,in effect,invalidate the restructuring plan approved by the pennsylvania and california insurance commissioners we reject this argument because it is based on a false premise.ina mischaracterizes the gravamen of the complaint as an action to invalidate the regulatory approval and reallocation of ina assets.while appellants prayer asked the court to declare that ina purported transfer to century indemnity of ina liabilities to california policyholders and ina release from future liability to those policyholders is invalid,the complaint fairly read does not ask the court to invalidate the regulatory order regarding the transfer of assets or to somehow unwind that division.appellants simply asked the court to determine the legal consequence of the division,whether as a matter of california law,ina remained liable to its former california policyholders even though their policies had been transferred to century indemnity.there was no need to abstain from deciding that legal issue.
next,ina contends that the insurance department approval of the corporate division precluded judicial review of the consequences of that division.according to ina this litigation is at best duplicative of the efforts of responsible agencies and,at worst,impermissible judicial interference.this argument is unpersuasive factually and legally.
factually,while the california department of insurance approved ina division,it did not purport to decide the legal consequences of the division.indeed,the insurance department expressly said that its consent does not foreclose creditors,including policyholders,from pursuing any remedy at law which may be available to them.since the insurance department did not take a stance on the legal consequences of the division,any ruling in this case could not interfere with a ruling of that body.
furthermore,even if the insurance department had made some sort of ruling on the legal consequences of the division,that ruling would not be binding here.the court in baer associated life ins,supra,d,faced this precise issue.there a deputy insurance commissioner had made an explicit finding that the defendant insurance company was relieved from liability when it assigned policies to another insurer.the appellate court held the commissioner finding was not binding,explaining its decision as follows with all due respect to the deputy insurance commissioner authority,it simply does not encompass interpretation of law.subject to review by the supreme court,we are the arbiters of what is meant by particular statutory language.id.at.we conclude the insurance commissioner approval of ina division does not preclude judicial review.
next ina contends the trial court properly abstained from deciding this case because in order to do so,the court would engage in impermissible microeconomic regulation of the business of insurance.this is so,ina claims,because in order to decide this suit,the court would be required to comprehend and weigh economic as the adequacy of reserves,reinsurance and other capitalization in the hands of century indemnity to process billions of dollars worth of claims actuarially projected to occur,in a particular estimated volume,frequency and value,over several decades we reject this argument because the various considerations ina cites all relate to the ability of century indemnity to pay whatever claims may arise under the transferred policies.as we have explained,this ability of the party to whom a contract is assigned or transferred is irrelevant when determining whether civil code section has been violated.thus the court will not be required to evaluate those considerations in order to decide the present suit.there was no need to abstain.
ina also contends the trial court properly abstained from deciding appellant suit under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.that doctrine comes
