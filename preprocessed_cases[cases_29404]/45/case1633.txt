this is an action for indemnity brought by virtue of a joint use agreement between union electric company amerenue ameren,a missouri corporation,and southwestern bell telephone,successor in interest to southwestern bell telephone company sbc,a texas limited partner with general and limited partners that are delaware corporations.ameren sued sbc to recover a settlement paid by ameren to the family of jesse james,an sbc subcontractor employee,for death resulting from electrocution on a wooden utility pole owned by sbc and covered by the joint use agreement.
the parties each moved for summary judgment.the district court denied ameren motion and granted summary judgment to sbc.for reversal,ameren argues that the plain language of the joint use agreement requires judgment in its favor.we reverse,order judgment on liability in ameren favor,and remand for trial only on the issue of the reasonableness of ameren settlement.
background 
by written agreement dated december,the predecessor of sbc and ameren entered into a joint use agreement which granted each company the right to use various utility transmission poles of the other located in missouri.the agreement outlined the rights and obligations of each party to the other.ameren provides electricity through its transmission lines.sbc has low voltage lines it uses in the provision of telephone and other services to its customers.lines are hung by both parties on their own utility poles and on poles owned by the other.
on march,sbc dispatched a contractor to repair a downed sbc cable.jesse james,one of the contractor employees,went up in a truck boom bucket to attach telephone cable to the utility pole.james was fatally electrocuted when he came into contact with ameren ground wire.this wire was energized because the ground wire had been cut with a six to eight foot section missing and sections of neutral wire were also missing.
jesse james three minor children brought a wrongful death action against ameren and sbc in the missouri state courts.ameren sought indemnity and a defense from sbc pursuant to the joint use agreement.sbc was granted summary judgment in the state court case because james was an employee of an independent contractor covered by worker compensation,and sbc did not exercise control over the work being performed by james.james union electric.sbc declined to defend ameren.thereafter,ameren settled the case with the three minor children for each,which settlement was approved by the state court on june.ameren also seeks the costs of its defense of the james litigation in the amount of.
the indemnity provision in the joint use agreement provides 
each of the parties hereto assumes the risk of liability for any and all injuries to its own employees,agents,contractors or customers and shall indemnify,protect and save harmless the other party to this agreement or any other licensees,irrespective of their own negligence,from any and all such claims,damages including punitive damages,suits,judgments,liabilities,loss,court costs and expenses,including attorney fees,and for damages to or loss of any property of said employees,agents,contractors or customers arising form the exercise of any rights conferred by this agreement.
joint use agreement at pages.the joint use agreement was the product of negotiations between the parties and replaced a previous agreement from that had governed the relationship of the parties.it is undisputed that the joint use agreement was in force at the time of james death.the agreement differed from the joint use agreement in that the agreement specifically limited indemnity to instances where an injured party was on the other company utility pole.the parties disagree about the substance of the negotiations between their attorneys but the limitation in the previous agreement relating to pole ownership does not appear in the joint use agreement.the district court reasoned that since james was on an sbc utility pole at the time of his death,sbc was not exercising any rights conferred by the joint use agreement.thus,sbc had the right to work on its own utility pole regardless of the joint use agreement.the court held that the joint use agreement had no application when an sbc subcontractor was working on an sbc pole.the court granted sbc motion for summary judgment and denied ameren motion.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo applying the same standard as the district court.mayer nextel west,cir.this court determines whether the evidence,when viewed in the light most favorable to the party,and according it the benefit of all reasonable inferences,shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.we apply the law of the state of missouri because it is the forum state.miller pilgrim pride,cir.the parties apparently agree that the application of missouri law is proper.the district court interpretation of missouri law is also reviewed de novo.sligo,nevois,cir.an appellate court has the authority under to reverse summary judgment in favor of one party and to grant summary judgment on the issue of liability in favor of another party if no relevant factual dispute exists.see fabric provident life accident ins,cir appellate court has the authority under to order summary judgment even where a party did not move for it if the record on the issue is sufficiently developed.
indemnity agreement 
the rules applicable to the construction of contracts apply generally to indemnity agreements.chehval john mercy med.the interpretation of a written contract is a matter of law for the court.sligo,at.whether the contract language is ambiguous is also a question of law.id.to determine whether a contract is ambiguous the court must consider the entire written agreement and give words their ordinary and usual meaning.id.under missouri law,an indemnity agreement is enforceable if the agreement is clear and unequivocal,the provision applies to the claim in question,and the agreement was not signed under duress.schaefer spider staging,cir applying missouri law.further,an agreement seeking indemnity against one own negligence is enforceable if the contract was formed in a commercial setting by parties on substantially equal footing expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.united states fid.guar.hous.auth.of the city of poplar bluff,cir.
by the agreement plain language the parties each assumes the risk for all injuries to their respective employees,agents,contractors or customers,and each agrees to indemnify,protect and save harmless the other party,irrespective of that party own negligence for all claims,including punitive damages and attorney fees arising from the exercise of any rights under the agreement.jesse james was an employee of a contractor of sbc.ameren is the other party to be protected and indemnified by sbc for claims for injuries to sbc employees.the negligence of either sbc or ameren is irrelevant as between them,it mattering only whether james was sbc or ameren contractor employee.
the only question remaining regarding liability is whether the accident arose because of the exercise of any rights conferred by the agreement.sbc contends that it was not exercising any rights under the agreement since it had access to its own utility pole regardless of the existence of the indemnity agreement.this analysis misses the point.absent the agreement,ameren energized high voltage lines would not have been placed or remained on the sbc utility pole since without the agreement it would have been a trespasser.thus,ameren was exercising rights conferred by the agreement and the indemnity clause applies.
the indemnification was broad,but it was specific.united states fidelity,at.these are two commercial entities with apparently equal bargaining power and in the negotiation process.an agreement making each of these large commercial entities responsible for injuries to their own customers,agents,contractors and employees is a sensible allocation of loss because each is in a better position to protect and insure against those losses by v
