the prior publication exclusion of liability insurance contracts prevents a company from obtaining ongoing insurance coverage for a continuing course of tortious conduct.in this appeal,we consider the scope of the prior publication exclusion.
on february,in the district court in new mexico,the navajo nation and its affiliates collectively navajo nation sued urban outfitters and its affiliates collectively urban outfitters for trademark infringement and related common law and statutory violations.navajo nation central allegation was that urban outfitters advertised,promoted,and sold its goods under the navaho and navajo names and marks on the internet and in retail stores s ince at least march.urban outfitters tendered the complaint to onebeacon america insurance company and hanover insurance company.
onebeacon provided commercial general liability and umbrella liability coverage to urban outfitters prior to july.the insuring agreement specifically included personal and advertising injury coverage on july,onebeacon issued a fronting policy to urban outfitters providing identical coverage for which hanover served as the responsible insurer.the policy was in effect from july,to july.hanover subsequently issued separate commercial general liability and umbrella liability policies to urban outfitters,which were effective from july,to july.the fronting policy and policies excluded coverage for personal and advertising injury liability arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.
on april,two months after navajo nation filed the trademark infringement suit,hanover provided a reservation of rights letter,informing urban outfitters of hanover and onebeacon joint retention of defense counsel.on july,hanover sought a judicial declaration in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania that it was not responsible for urban outfitters defense or indemnification.on august,the district court granted hanover motion for judgment on the pleadings,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.
the district court held that hanover had no duty to defend or indemnify since hanover did not begin insurance coverage of urban outfitters until sixteen months after the alleged infringement began.the district court found that,because the claims in the underlying action alleged injuries stemming from advertisements published prior to the policy inception date,any resulting injury fell within the hanover policies prior publication exclusions we dismissed an initial appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction however,the district court has since addressed our jurisdictional concern by entering final judgment for hanover on its august,order,pursuant to rule b.urban outfitters and third party defendant,onebeacon,now appeal that order.
we review de novo an order granting judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.i n reviewing the grant of a rule c motion,we must view the facts presented in the pleadings and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.under pennsylvania law,which hanover and urban outfitters agree governs,t he interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law that we will review de novo.
urban outfitters contends that the district court erred in finding that navajo nation trademark infringement allegations fall under the hanover policies prior publication exclusions.both sides acknowledge an absence of binding authority,and urge us to derive antithetical lessons from the few cases on point.for the reasons which follow,we will affirm the district court decision.
in interpreting an insurance contract,
o ur inquiry is straightforward.we look first to the terms of the policy which are a manifestation of the intent of the parties.donegal mut.ins.baumhammers.when the language of the policy is clear and unambiguous,we must give effect to that language.id.next,we compare the terms of the policy to the allegations in the underlying claim.it is well established that an insurer duties under an insurance policy are triggered by the language of the complaint against the insured.kvaerner,a d at.in determining the existence of a duty to defend,the factual allegations of the underlying complaint against the insured are to be taken as true and liberally construed in favor of the insured 
an insurer that disavows its duty to defend by reference to a policy exclusion effectively assert s an affirmative defense and,accordingly,bears the burden of proving such defense.
the hanover policies personal and advertising injury provisions clearly and unambiguously cover urban outfitters alleged trademark infringement and related common law and statutory violations nonetheless,hanover contends that it has no duty to defend since its policies specifically excluded coverage for personal and advertising injury liability arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.the fronting policy under which hanover first assumed responsibility for urban outfitters liability coverage became effective on july.thus,we must determine whether urban outfitters conduct preceded or postdated that policy period inception.
the answer lies entirely within the four corners of the underlying complaint there navajo nation alleged that urban outfitters engaged in trademark infringement,trademark dilution,unfair competition,false advertising,commercial practices laws violations,and violation of the indian arts and crafts act,but offered little specificity as to when the offensive conduct occurred.navajo nation relevant allegations are as follows
