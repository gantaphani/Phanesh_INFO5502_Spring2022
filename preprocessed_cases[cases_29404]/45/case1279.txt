backgrounda.
guy carpenter,through its predecessor in interest,fox,introduced bcs to isi.isi sold extended warranty programs to a variety of businesses around the country for products including automobiles,recreational vehicles,computers and appliances.isi itself was not an insurer and therefore needed to affiliate with a company licensed to provide insurance for the warranties it sold.the isi program was a fronting program.an insurance company here,bcs issued insurance policies to customers,acting as the front,but was reinsured for the risk of loss associated with the program.bcs insured certain service contracts administered by isi.guy carpenter served as the reinsurance intermediary its responsibility was to secure reinsurance for bcs on the isi program.
in,bcs and isi entered into a management agreement which governed this fronting relationship.this agreement established isi as bcs agent in connection with the administration of the isi program,giving isi the authority to negotiate,underwrite,decline and accept risk.it also granted isi the authority to consent to premium rates on behalf of bcs.
bcs had no experience in the extended warranty business.during these negotiations with isi,guy carpenter acted as bcs exclusive reinsurance intermediary,and in that capacity,was responsible for procuring reinsurance for bcs.therefore,bcs,the insurance company,was reinsured against risks that it incurred as insurer for the isi program.under this arrangement,isi would submit claims in connection with the isi program to bcs bcs would pay those claims and then seek reimbursement from the reinsurers.from to,bcs,through guy carpenter,reinsured the program domestically and retained a portion of the underwriting risk associated with the program bcs could incur liability despite the fact that it was reinsured.
in,bcs notified guy carpenter of its intention to terminate its participation in the isi program at the end of the reinsurance treaty year because the isi program had been performing poorly.guy carpenter encouraged bcs to continue fronting the isi program and stated that the reinsurance for the program was to move to the london market.the parties agreed then that bcs would continue its participation in the program.this agreement became known as the reinsurance treaty.however,unlike the previous arrangement,guy carpenter represented that the program would be reinsured by a group of reinsurers the london reinsurers.therefore,bcs would no longer have any risk whatsoever associated with the program.guy carpenter further stated that it would procure this reinsurance on behalf of bcs.guy carpenter was never in privity with isi.
bcs alleges that guy carpenter in fact never properly procured reinsurance for the isi program.the london reinsurers consistently reimbursed bcs on all of its claims until.however,apparently without the knowledge of bcs,the london reinsurers had sent a reservation of rights letter to guy carpenter.this reservation of rights letter preserved the reinsurers right to raise coverage issues at some unspecified time in the future.
the isi program continued to perform poorly and,ultimately,disputes arose as to who bore responsibility for the losses under the program.in,after a monthly accounting,the london reinsurers refused to make any additional payments to bcs and demanded arbitration to rescind the reinsurance agreements or to obtain compensation from bcs for various losses.in order to toll the statute of limitations on any claims bcs had against guy carpenter,the parties entered into a tolling agreement on february.
bcs entered into arbitration with the london reinsurers seeking compensation for losses allegedly sustained by bcs.the london reinsurers brought a recision claim,on which the arbitrators found for bcs the london reinsurers,however,prevailed in arbitration on two other claims.the arbitration panel found that bcs,rather than the reinsurers,was responsible for losses incurred as a result of the isi program.the arbitration panel also found that contracts related to the itt lyndon business had not been ceded properly to the reinsurers and thus that business should be excluded from the reinsurance agreements.
the arbitration panel ruled that the london reinsurers should recover.bcs paid this amount,and claims to have incurred over three million dollars in expenses and legal fees associated with the arbitration proceeding.bcs claims that the liability it owes to the london reinsurers is due to guy carpenter misrepresentation and general failure to procure properly reinsurance.
bcs then brought this action against guy carpenter.the action included six counts breach of contract count i,breach of implied contract count ii,professional negligence count iii,implied indemnity count iv,breach of fiduciary duty count v and negligent misrepresentation count vi.on september,both parties moved for summary judgment.
the court held that the two year statute of limitations established by the insurance producers limitations act,ilcs ipla,applied to reinsurance intermediaries such as guy carpenter.after examining the authorities,the court decided that reinsurance was subsumed within the statutory scheme of the illinois insurance act and,therefore,reinsurance companies should be considered insurance producers for the purposes of the statute of limitations in section,at.
having determined that the ipla applied to reinsurance intermediaries such as guy carpenter,the district court held that the claims in counts i,ii,iii,v and vi of bcs complaint fell within the purview of that statute.in order to determine whether the claims were barred by the statute statute of limitations,the district court undertook an analysis of when the claims accrued.
the court held that the claims for breach of contract,breach of implied contract,professional negligence and negligent misrepresentation were claims arising out of a contractual relationship and thus accrued at the time the contract was breached.that breach occurred,held the court,at the end of,when guy carpenter failed to negotiate and procure proper reinsurance from the london reinsurers.therefore,the district court concluded,these claims were barred by the statute of limitations because this period had expired before the parties entered into the tolling agreement in.
the court then turned to the claim for breach of fiduciary duty.it first determined that the discovery rule,which tolls the statute of limitations until the plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that he has been injured and that his injury was wrongfully caused,applies to claims for breach of fiduciary duty.id.at quoting jackson jordan,leydig,voit mayer.the district court then determined that this claim accrued on june,when bcs was placed on notice that there were potential problems with the isi program for which bcs could be held liable by the london reinsurers.because the statute of limitations would have expired before the parties entered into the tolling agreement,the district court found bcs claim for breach of fiduciary duty to be.
therefore,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of guy carpenter on counts i,ii,iii,v and vi of bcs complaint.
the district court next addressed bcs claim for implied indemnity.the court first noted that the tolling agreement was executed in february,before the arbitration in question,and thus the statute of limitations did not bar bcs implied indemnity claim.bcs alleged that guy carpenter should be required to indemn
