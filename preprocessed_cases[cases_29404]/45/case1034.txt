this appeal arises from the district court administration of a receivership estate,the assets of which included nearly viaticated life insurance policies purchased by trade partners.the district court authorized the receiver to pool the policies and distribute the proceeds on a pro rata basis to persons who had acquired an interest in the policies from trade partners.under the plan of distribution,holders of such an interest were classified as class a claimants.
intervenor frank taber challenges the inclusion of his claim with those of the class a claimants in the district court plan.taber argues that his diligence is what distinguishes him from other class a claimants.he acquired from trade partners the status of beneficiary of a particular policy known as the policy.taber contends that his diligence in securing a vested interest in the policy proceeds should give him priority over other class a claimants and that he should receive the full amount of his beneficial interest in the policy proceeds.
we affirm the district court decision to grant taber a pro rata share in the distribution plan.taber alleged diligence in securing a beneficial interest is not cause for him to take priority when the interest that he actually acquired is no better than the interests acquired by supposedly class a claimants.
