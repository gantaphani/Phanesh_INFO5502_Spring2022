katherine tweedle appeals from orders of the district court entered after judgment in her favor on her claim against state farm fire casualty company.this case is before us for the second time.in the first appeal,state farm challenged a jury verdict in favor of tweedle on her claim to recover homeowners insurance policy proceeds.tweedle state farm fire cas.cir.state farm had refused to pay,contending that the fire that destroyed the insured house was intentionally set and that tweedle had misrepresented material facts to state farm investigators.the case went to trial on tweedle claim for breach of contract,and she prevailed.state farm appealed and we affirmed.
back in the district court after our mandate issued,numerous postjudgment motions were filed.tweedle challenges the court rulings on four of those motions the court granted the motion to intervene filed by john stansel harvey,who is tweedle,of the house that was destroyed,and on the state farm homeowners insurance policy the court granted,in part,state farm motion to correct the judgment,amending the judgment to reflect setoffs for a advance that state farm paid to tweedle and harvey and that state farm paid to satisfy the mortgage on the house the court denied as moot tweedle motion to enforce the third amended judgment which did not reflect the setoffs and the court denied tweedle motion to proceed against the corporate surety.
before we can consider the merits of tweedle issues on appeal,we must address the argument of harvey and appellee state farm that we have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.according to tweedle,our jurisdiction arises under the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states but the appellees argue that the orders appealed from are interlocutory and not final decisions.they also maintain,in arguments with which we agree and with which tweedle does not seriously quarrel,that the other possible sources of appellate jurisdiction are not legally sustainable in this case.first,the district court has not certified that the issues in question involve a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion such that an immediate appeal is necessary to materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.b.likewise,the district court did not expressly determine that although there remained unresolved claims for relief,there was no just reason for delay of the appeal.b.so if the orders on appeal are not final decisions,as state farm and harvey maintain,that leaves only the collateral order doctrine as a basis for our jurisdiction.to qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine,an order must conclusively decide a disputed question that is important and distinct from the case merits,and the decision must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.kassuelke alliant techsystems,cir.none of the orders on appeal meet all the requirements for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.we can assert jurisdiction over this appeal,then,only under and only if the orders appealed from are final,as tweedle contends.
appellate jurisdiction under in this case is not free from doubt.our study of the case law on the subject of final decisions for purposes of appellate jurisdiction convinces us that the words of the supreme court in remain true today no verbal formula yet devised can explain prior finality decisions with unerring accuracy or provide an utterly reliable guide for the future.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d see also id.the appellees maintain that because there are some unresolved motions pending before the district court,the orders appealed from can not be final,even though the judgment is.but relying on practical instead of technical considerations,we are confident that those pending motions do not preclude finality for the orders before us on appeal.giove stanko,cir.
both appellees point to the district court expressed view that this case is not yet final for purposes of appeal.in its order staying case pending current appeal,the district court said,this court is of the firm impression that none of its orders issued since the eighth circuit last appeal are final order of march,at.in the past,we have noted that there must be some clear and unequivocal manifestation by the trial court of its belief that the decision made,so far as the court is concerned,is the end of the case.goodwin united states,cir quoting fiataruolo united states,cir alteration in goodwin.we think that this language from the second circuit says too much in this case,where the decisions appealed from are postjudgment orders and the underlying judgment has been affirmed on appeal.a district court sense of finality,or lack thereof,does not determine whether we have jurisdiction over an appeal from such orders.as the district court conceded,a ppellate jurisdiction is primarily an issue for the appellate court.order of march,at quoting missouri ex rel.nixon coeur tribe,cir,cert.denied,d.while a district court impression as to the finality of its own orders might be helpful in some cases where our jurisdiction is challenged,we ultimately must look to the substance of the unresolved issues and determine for ourselves if we have appellate jurisdiction over the orders appealed from.that is,we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction over this appeal,regardless of the district court belief as to finality.see moussa ins,cir.but before we continue our analysis,some procedural background is in order.
before the district court held a telephone hearing on harvey postjudgment motion to intervene and other matters,state farm attempted to satisfy the amended judgment by tendering a check for the entire amount of the judgment made payable to tweedle and harvey,as,and tweedle attorney.tweedle objected to state farm inclusion of harvey as payee.during the telephone hearing,harvey declined any interest in the portion of the judgment that compensated for loss of personal property and acknowledged that he was not entitled to the attorney fees owed to tweedle trial counsel.but harvey maintained that he had an interest in the money that state farm was obligated to pay for the loss of the house,the prejudgment and postjudgment interest on that money,and the penalty due under arkansas law.the district court ordered state farm to deposit the disputed amount with the court,pending disposition of harvey motion to intervene,and to pay the balance,which included the amount for loss of personal property,attorney fees,and costs,to tweedle and her attorney.state farm complied.although the district court granted harvey motion to of the orders from which tweedle now court has yet to decide if harvey is entitled to any of the judgment proceeds on deposit with the court and,if so,in what amount.
in its brief,state farm specifically identifies various motions pending in the district court that it says could impact the judgment and order on appeal.br.of state farm at see also id.at.of those motions,there are two that have,in fact,been decided by the court.the court denied as moot tweedle motions to enforce the judgment and also denied her motion to dismiss or strike the motion to intervene.order of,at.tweedle motions seeking approval to cash the second check she received from state farm were not decided before she filed her notice of appeal,which necessarily divested the district court of jurisdiction to decide them after that date.but the day before she filed her notice of appeal,tweedle filed a partial satisfaction of judgment averring that the check was deposited in her attorney trust account.the two pending motions seeking the district court approval to cash a check that has already been deposited have no bearing on the finality of the orders on appeal.four of the motions in question are for attorney fees,but these also do not affect the finality of the decisions appealed from.see budinich becton dickinson,d a n unresolved issue of attorney fees for the litigation in question does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.
that leaves the issue of harvey right,if any,to the judgment proceeds and the two related motions,tweedle motion to refer the proceedings to the divorce court and her motion for a jury trial.the question for us is whether the unresolved harvey matters thwart the finality of the orders now on appeal or whether instead they raise collateral matters,like postjudgment attorney fees,that do not affect finality for purposes of appellate jurisdiction under.we conclude,at least in this case,that questions related to a postjudgment intervenor entitlement to judgment those proceeds have already been deposited with the squarely into the category of collateral matters that do not affect the finality of unrelated postjudgment orders.we think this is especially appropriate where,as here,the intervention was approved not only after the judgment but also after affirmance on appeal of the judgment against the original defendant.we may indeed docket yet another appeal once the harvey issues are resolved,but that does not mean that the orders now before us lack finality.
the final judgment rule is designed to insure that the scarce resources of litigants and the courts are not wasted in interlocutory appeals that impede the flow of litigation,making it difficult and expensive to reach a final resolution of issues.miller special weapons,cir.our disposition of the orders on appeal will actually advance resolution of the litigation,at least as to the disputes between the original parties,tweedle and state farm.if we determine that harvey was not properly permitted to intervene,the case is essentially over as to all parties.that is,there will be no question of apportionment of the funds deposited with the court if tweedle is successful.and if harvey prevails on appeal on the merits of his motion to intervene,then at least state farm can be more or less done with the litigation,having already satisfied the judgment of the district court.likewise,our disposition of the other issues on appeal will facilitate final resolution.the remaining orders on appeal concern the setoffs,interest on the setoffs,and tweedle desire to proceed against the surety.if the district court got it right,and we affirm,state farm is out of the litigation except for the lingering attorney fees motions.if not,the court can correct its judgment,and state farm can satisfy that judgment and be done with the case.if we decide the merits of the issues now on appeal,and the district court decides the pending motions for attorney fees,state farm will remain a party with an interest in the litigation in name only and can avoid further expense and delayed resolution.
state farm has a jury verdict against it on the merits,and we have affirmed that verdict.state farm paid,either to tweedle and her attorney or into the court,the entire amount of the judgment owed according to the orders of the district court,including interest,attorney fees,and costs.all that remains for the district court is the ministerial task of determining how much of the judgment,if any,is owed to defendant harvey.goodwin,at.that is between tweedle and harvey and does not involve state farm interests.and any subsequent appeal from the district court decision on the matter likewise will not concern state farm.as the district court noted,state farm has complied with every decision of this court and the eighth circuit the judicial system should not demand more.order of march,at.
t he underlying dispute has already been settled,and there is little danger that prompt appeal of matters will cause confusion,duplicative effort,or otherwise interfere with the trial court disposition of the underlying merits.miller alamo,cir.the appellees have not substantiated their claim to the contrary by explaining exactly how our consideration of the postjudgment orders at issue will confound the workings of the district court on the matters still before it.like a postjudgment motion for attorney fees,the resolution of the remaining issues surrounding the portion of the judgment that state farm has deposited with the court will not alter the orders tweedle appeals from or moot or revise decisions embodied in the order s.budinich,at.we hold that we have jurisdiction to consider tweedle appeal.
for her first issue,tweedle argues that the district court erred in allowing tweedle and to intervene in the action after the judgment was affirmed on appeal.before trial on tweedle claim,but more than a year after she filed suit,tweedle moved the court under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure required joinder of parties to join harvey as a necessary party.state farm opposed the motion,but harvey did not.the district court denied the motion,noting that it was untimely and that tweedle claim could be adjudicated without harvey.soon after we decided the first appeal and affirmed the jury verdict in tweedle favor,harvey moved the district court to intervene.the court granted harvey motion under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure intervention of right.
tweedle argues that harvey motion was untimely because it was filed not only postjudgment but also after adjudication of the appeal on the merits.we will not upset the district court conclusion that harvey motion was timely unless that court abused its discretion.see jenkins missouri,cir.in exercising that discretion,the court is to consider all surrounding circumstances,but especially the stage of the litigation,the reason for the delay in seeking intervention,and any possible prejudice to the parties already in the litigation.id.at.as the district court noted,this litigation is nearly wrapped up,but nothing in rule a precludes postjudgment or even intervention.as to the reason for harvey delay in seeking intervention,the court noted that state farm defense to the claim was that tweedle committed arson and lied to investigators,and harvey could not be expected to expend his resources when state farm suspected tweedle,not him,of wrongdoing.order of,at.the court also determined that the likelihood of prejudice to could permanently lose the opportunity to collect any proceeds outweighed any prejudice to tweedle,who would only be delayed in collecting the judgment.id.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that harvey motion to intervene was timely.
apart from the question of timeliness,tweedle asserts that the court erred as a matter of law in granting harvey motion.we review de novo a court decision on the merits of a rule motion to intervene,keeping in mind that rule should be liberally construed with all doubts resolved in favor of the proposed intervenor.south dakota ex rel.barnett dep t of interior,cir.harvey must satisfy three conditions to prevail he must have a recognized interest in the subject matter of the litigation that might be impaired by the disposition of the case and will not be adequately protected by tweedle and state farm.id.it is tweedle position that harvey does not have the requisite recognized interest in the disputed property.we disagree.
it is undisputed that the warranty deed conveyed the insured house to tweedle and harvey together as grantees.the two divided the proceeds of the salvaged property when it was sold after the fire.each signed a promissory note for the mortgage on the house,and they were on the homeowners insurance policy.their divorce decree gave tweedle possession of the house as child support,but each party was to continue to pay half of the mortgage payment.nothing in the decree purported to change the joint ownership of the house.these facts make it clear that harvey has a recognized interest in the property at issue in this litigation.
tweedle argument on this point focuses not on the facts but on her assertion that the division of the insurance proceeds,dependent as it is,at least in part,on the ownership of the house that was destroyed,should be decided by the court that granted the divorce.the district court has not decided tweedle motion to refer the issue regarding ownership of the house to the divorce court,so we will not consider the question on appeal.we will say,however,that tweedle does not make any compelling arguments to this cour
