this appeal by lsb industries,and el dorado chemical from summary judgment in favor of its insurer,national union fire insurance of pittsburgh,pennsylvania national union,requires us to decide whether the district court erred in determining that the insurance company demands for unpaid insurance premiums were not barred by the oklahoma statute of limitations.specifically,we must decide whether the express terms of the mutually consented to retention agreements,which provide for interim premium adjustments up and down,are structured so that the statute of limitations is not triggered until a final premium adjustment becomes due.
appellee is a commercial insurance company that issued policies of insurance to lsb and its subsidiaries.in effect from april,to january,the policies provided general liability,automobile and worker compensation insurance.these separate retention agreements,entered into in,and respectively,contain provisions designed to make premiums paid by appellants accurately reflect the actual losses experienced by the insurance company.because insured losses can take years to be finally adjusted,premiums under each retention agreement are adjusted annually,either to require additional payments from the insured or refunds from the insurer.
the total amount due for losses is defined as total incurred losses,which consist of amounts arising from losses actually paid by the insurance company for claims made under the policies paid losses and amounts arising from estimates the company has reserved to cover future payments reserves.total incurred losses are then multiplied by a loss conversion factor and a tax multiplier.the term reserves is defined in the stipulation as follows an amount shown on a loss run as reserves does not represent an amount actually paid by national union under the applicable policy,but is an amount which national union has estimated as the amount it expects to pay in the future with respect to existing claims.appellee brief at.
the retention agreements provide for the annual computation of retrospective premiums.upon each retrospective adjustment,appellee is required to either bill appellants for additional premiums,if reserves were insufficient to cover actual losses,or to refund premiums to appellants,if actual losses and reserves are less than what it had previously billed for premiums.correspondence dated as early as reveals the parties disagreements over the insurance policies and the retention agreements.their disputes involved a variety of issues,including,but not limited to,claim handling,amounts paid on claims,settlement of claims,calculations of reserves reflected in loss runs and calculations of retention premiums.
as a result of differences between the parties,appellants made no retention premium payments to appellee after january.although appellee made repeated demands for the outstanding retention payments,their efforts were to no avail.
appellee then filed a complaint on february,alleging that appellants failed to pay insurance premiums in the amount of owed under the retention agreements.the complaint sought damages for breach of contract and an open,mutual or running account.
on december,the parties entered into a settlement agreement,which resolved all of the issues in this dispute but one.they could not agree whether oklahoma statute of limitations barred any part of appellee claim.the parties agreed to seek a judicial determination of that issue upon stipulated facts.
on a motion for summary judgment,the district court determined that no part of appellee claim was.in making its determination,the court relied on the plain language of the retention agreements and the interpretation of a similar insurance policy in brookshire grocery bomer.the texas court decision turned on the termination clauses of each retention agreement clauses that provided that final premiums may not be computed,except by mutual agreement,until all claims have been fully settled.
in the case at bar,the termination clause of the retention agreement provides 
such computation of the premium for the three year period shall be final if all claims have been closed or it is mutually agreed between national union and lsb that the final premium will exceed the maximum premium.
if such computation is not final,losses shall be valued annually thereafter until such time as there are no new or outstanding claims,or a mutual agreement is reached between national union and lsb.
appellants appendix,vol.i at.
the retention agreement provides 
the premium so computed shall be the final retention premium if 
all claims have been closed and no new claims have been reported for a period of months after the expiration of the policy 
it is apparent that the premium computed will exceed the maximum retention premium,or 
a mutual agreement is reached between national union and lsb.
if such computation is not final,losses shall be valued annually thereafter until the final adjustment is calculated.
