in this insurance coverage dispute,bowling green professional associates bowling green,an drug treatment facility in kentucky,appeals a declaratory judgment and summary judgment opinion and order of the district court.the crux of this declaratory judgment action is whether either of two liability policies issued to bowling green by two different insurers,travelers indemnity company of connecticut travelers,and evanston insurance company evanston,provide coverage to bowling green for a lawsuit brought in kentucky state court.following bowling green demand to its insurers for litigation defense and liability indemnity,travelers filed this action in federal district court in the western district of kentucky seeking a declaratory judgment of whether it owed a duty to defend or indemnify bowling green in the underlying state court action.evanston seeking a similar declaration regarding the caudill estate claims only.the district court exercised jurisdiction and granted the insurers motions for declaratory judgment.bowling green timely appealed.
for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in exercising declaratory judgment jurisdiction.accordingly,we vacate the order and judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
the following underlying facts are not in dispute.in november,jonas wampler received a methadone treatment as part of an ongoing treatment plan at the bowling green clinic in hazard,kentucky.following the treatment,he left the clinic in his car.as he was driving,wampler crossed into the oncoming traffic lane and struck another vehicle,driven by stephanie caudill.both wampler and caudill perished in the collision.in a state court complaint filed in august,caudill estate asserted a claim for wrongful death against both bowling green and the wampler estate.in response,wampler estate asserted a claim for wrongful death in the same state court against bowling green and the physician,raza,who administered the methadone treatment to wampler.
following the filing of the claims by caudill and wampler estates,bowling green sought insurance defense and indemnity from both evanston and travelers pursuant to the aforementioned insurance policies.evanston agreed to defend the wampler claims,but denied coverage for the caudill action on the grounds that it did not present a claim for injury to or death of a bowling green patient.travelers agreed to temporarily defend both the wampler and caudill estate actions,pursuant to a reservation of rights.thereafter,travelers instituted the present action in federal district court against both bowling green and evanston to determine its duties,if any,under its policy.likewise,evanston and in an effort to limit its obligations to bowling green.all three parties filed for summary judgment to resolve the matter.in its memorandum opinion and order,the district court granted a declaratory judgment in favor of both insurers,holding that evanston owed no duty to defend or indemnify bowling green in the caudill action,and that travelers owed no duty to defend or indemnify any of the claims asserted by the caudill and wampler estates.bowling green timely appealed.
the insurance policies 
both travelers and evanston have insurance contracts with bowling green.evanston issued bowling green a professional liability insurance policy covering professional negligence.evanston does not dispute that it has a duty to indemnify and defend bowling green in the suit by jonas wampler estate because wampler was a patient and the policy clearly covers claims by patients it does contest that it has a duty to indemnify and defend bowling green and raza against caudill estate.travelers was bowling green general liability insurance provider.travelers contests that it has a duty to defend bowling green against the suits brought by caudill and wampler estates.
evanston policy 
the policy issued by evanston prescribed indemnification for personal injury by reason of any negligent act,error or omission in professional services rendered as defined by the policy,personal injury means any physical or mental injury to or death of any patient with respect to the duty to defend,the policy states that evanston shall defend any claim or suit against the insured seeking damages to which this insurance applies after exercising jurisdiction,the district court concluded that there was no ambiguity in the language in the professional liability policy disclaiming coverage for claims of injury by of the clinic and that evanston was not required to defend or indemnify bowling green against caudill estate because caudill was not a patient of the clinic.
further,the district court concluded that the policy was not ambiguous in its exclusion of coverage for punitive damages claims by wampler estate.in the policy exclusions section,it states that 
this policy does not apply 
f to punitive or exemplary damages except,that if a suit shall have been brought against the insured for a claim falling within the coverage hereof,seeking both compensatory and punitive or exemplary damages then the company will afford a defense to such action,without liability,however,for such punitive or exemplary damages 
l to any claim arising out of general liability 
on appeal,bowling green argues that evanston should defend the clinic in the suit by caudill because the policy with evanston is ambiguous regarding whether evanston is required to defend bowling green in an action by a third party like caudill bowling green reasonably expected that the evanston policy would require evanston to defend it in a situation like the one herein and public policy requires evanston to defend the clinic in that to decide otherwise would result in drug clinics being unwilling to operate in kentucky.
in response,evanston argues that the plain language of the policy clearly excludes a duty to defend a suit by a,and caudill was not a patient of bowling green.further,evanston argues that bowling green had no reasonable expectation that its medical malpractice policy would require evanston to defend against a suit brought by a third party like caudill.finally,evanston rejects the assertion that public policy requires it to defend the clinic and urges this court to rely solely upon insurance law and contract interpretation.
travelers policy 
travelers issued a general liability insurance policy to bowling green during the relevant time period,providing among other things,commercial general liability coverage.this coverage is defined generally 
we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance does not apply.
in granting travelers motion for summary judgment,the district court concluded that travelers owed no duty to defend or indemnify bowling green by virtue of an exclusion in the policy for health or cosmetic services.the exclusion provides 
this insurance does not apply to bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury arising out of 
the rendering or failure to render 
medical,surgical,dental,or nursing service or treatment,advice or instruction,or the related furnishing of food or beverages 
any health or therapeutic service,treatment,advice or instruction 
the furnishing or dispensing of drugs or medical,dental or surgical supplies or appliances 
the district court rejected bowling green argument that the exclusion did not cover caudill estate negligence claims and,accordingly,granted travelers motion for summary judgment.on appeal,bowling green argues that travelers,as the provider of a general liability policy,is responsible for defending claims arising from negligence unrelated to medical treatment at the clinic.bowling green contends that any negligence in the act of allowing patient wampler to leave the premises after his methadone tr
