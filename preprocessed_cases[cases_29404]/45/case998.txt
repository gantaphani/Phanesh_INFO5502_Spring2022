linda isbell,individually and as next friend of jordan isbell and kaitlyn isbell,stephen ryan,and charlotte ryan appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to american national property and casualty company anpac and american national general insurance company angic collectively,american national.the issue is whether a homeowner policy provides coverage for a lawsuit seeking damages caused by a parent negligent failure to warn of her minor son propensity to commit acts of sexual molestation against other minor children.because we conclude the facts alleged in the negligence action do not constitute an occurrence as defined by the homeowner policy,we affirm.
the facts in this case are essentially undisputed.mfi is the son of charlotte ryan and her first husband,michael isbell.mfi lived with his mother and her second husband,stephen ryan,during most of the year,but regularly visited and spent a part of each summer with his father,michael isbell,his second wife,linda isbell,and their two minor daughters.in,mfi stayed with the isbells for part of the summer.in june,the isbell daughters told their mother that their had repeatedly sexually molested and abused them.the isbells reported the incidents to the appropriate authorities,and mfi was charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault.the court found that mfi committed the charged conduct.
linda isbell,individually and as next friend of her two minor daughters,filed suit in state court against charlotte ryan,individually and as next friend of her minor son mfi.in her petition,linda isbell alleged that charlotte ryan breached her duty to warn the isbells of mfi propensity to molest children.specifically,she alleged that charlotte ryan was aware of mfi proclivities from an investigation of mfi conducted by child protective services cps after mfi was accused of sexually molesting a male cousin in.cps found good cause to believe the sexual and physical abuse had occurred,referred the ryans to appropriate services,and obtained an agreement from the alleged victim mother not to allow mfi access to his cousin.according to linda isbell,charlotte ryan did not convey to the isbells the result of the cps investigation,did not apprize them of other accusations against mfi of sexual impropriety,did not warn of mfi proclivities for sexual improprieties with other children,and did not warn that mfi was a danger to minor children 
at the time the events alleged in linda isbell negligence action took place,charlotte and stephen ryan were insured by a texas standard homeowner policy the policy issued by angic angic filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court against stephen and charlotte ryan seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend the ryans in the state court action under the policy,nor any obligation to pay or indemnify them for any damages recovered by linda isbell.thereafter,linda isbell instituted a declaratory judgment action in state court against angic and anpac for a declaration of her rights with respect to the ryans policy.linda isbell action was removed to federal court,and by agreement of the parties,consolidated with angic action.the parties agreed to realign themselves in the consolidated action,with angic and anpac as plaintiffs and linda isbell and the ryans as defendants.
in the consolidated action,the parties for summary judgment.the district court granted angic and anpac motion for summary judgment and denied linda isbell and the ryans motion.the district court issued a memorandum and opinion holding that the facts alleged in linda isbell negligence action against charlotte ryan did not constitute an occurrence as required by the policy as a prerequisite to coverage.alternatively,the district court held the sexual molestation committed by mfi to be excluded under the policy intentional acts exclusion.as a result,the district court held that neither angic nor anpac had a duty to defend nor any obligation to pay or indemnify the ryans under the policy.linda isbell and the ryans now appeal.

linda isbell and the ryans contend that american national has a duty to defend and potentially a duty to indemnify charlotte ryan in linda isbell state action against her.under texas law,the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify are separate and distinct obligations.am.alliance ins,writ dism.the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify if the insurer does not have a duty to defend the insured,then the insurer also does not have a duty to indemnify.see lay aetna ins,writ ref a ppellee had no duty to defend appellant,and,in turn,appellant has no right to indemnification.thus,we address american national duty to defend first.
we determine an insurer duty to defend from the factual allegations of the plaintiff petition in the underlying action.argonaut ins.maupin.using texas eight corners rule,we look to the four corners of the policy and the four corners of the complaint to determine whether there is a duty to defend.bailey,at union fire ins.merchs.fast motor lines.an insurer is required to defend in any case in which at least some of the allegations in the pleadings potentially state a claim covered by the policy.gulf chem.metallurgical associated metals minerals,cir.in reviewing the underlying pleadings,the court must focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of the damages rather than the legal theories alleged.merchs.fast motor lines,at quoting merchs.fast motor lines,union fire ins,writ granted adamo state farm lloyds,dist,writ denied it is not the cause of action alleged which determines coverage but the facts giving rise to the alleged actionable conduct.maayeh trinity lloyds ins,if the petition only alleges facts that,even if true,are excluded by the policy,the insurer does not have a duty to defend regardless of the legal theories involved in the case.the insured bears the burden of showing that the claim against him is potentially within his policy coverage.life ins.travelers ins,cir.
by the terms of the ryans policy,in order for coverage to exist and american national to have a duty to defend,the underlying action must allege damages caused by an occurrence.the policy provides liability coverage,in relevant part,as follows 
coverage c personal liability 
if a claim is made or suit is brought against an insured for damages for bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies,we will pay up to our limit of liability for damages for which the insured is legally liable provide a defense at our own expense by counsel of our choice even if the suit is groundless,false or fraudulent.we may investigate and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate.
the policy defines an occurrence as an accident,including exposure to conditions which result in bodily injury or property damage during the policy.although the policy does not define the term accident,texas case law defines it as an unexpected happening without intention or design.allen auto.ins,dist,no writ.
linda isbell and the ryans do not dispute that mfi sexual molestation of the isbell daughters was intentional and thus not an accident.they concede that,from the standpoint of mfi,it did not constitute an occurrence within the meaning given by the policy.they contend instead that charlotte ryan negligent acts causing the isbell daughters injuries must be considered separately from mfi intentional acts.
to support this claim,linda isbell and the ryans focus on the significance of the policy severability clause.the policy severability clause reads this insurance applies separately to each insured.linda isbell and the ryans argue that the severability clause modifies the definition of occurrence so that the determination of whether an event constitutes an occurrence must be made from the perspective of the insured being sued because mfi acts were unexpected and without design from the standpoint of charlotte ryan,they argue that they satisfy the threshold requirement of an occurrence for coverage purposes.thus,they conclude,coverage c of the policy obligates american national to defend charlotte ryan in linda isbell negligence action.
we have held that,under texas law,where a liability is related to and interdependent on other tortious activities,the ultimate issue in determining coverage is whether the underlying tortious activities are encompassed within the definition of occurrence.am.states ins.bailey,cir cornhill ins.plc valsamis,cir ny life ins.travelers ins,cir.an insurer has no duty to defend or to indemnify its insureds against claims that could not be brought absent the underlying and excluded tortious conduct.bailey,at no duty to defend church and its associate ministers for negligence claims arising from the sexual misconduct of a pastor cornhill,at no duty to defend employer for negligent hiring and failure to provide safe workplace where employee sexually harassed another employee ny life ins,at no duty to defend employer for negligent hiring,training,and supervision of employee who allegedly defrauded a client.here,we find no way to separate charlotte ryan liability for negligent failure to warn from mfi sexual molestation.if mfi had not sexually molested the isbell daughters,linda isbell would have no claim for damages against charlotte ryan.thus,we find charlotte ryan liability to be related to and interdependent on the tortious acts of mfi.because mfi underlying acts are not encompassed within the definition of occurrence,under the rule stated in bailey,cornhill,and new york life,american national has no duty to defend.
linda isbell and the ryans contend that even if these cases correctly state texas law,the severability clause in the ryans policy changes the result in this case.they rely mainly on three cases interpreting texas law to support this view.we are not persuaded,however,that any of these cases control the outcome of this case.
first,linda isbell and the ryans state that the holding in commercial standard insurance american general insurance,supports their interpretation of the policy severability clause and its effect on the policy provisions.in that case,the texas supreme court confronted a similar severability of interests clause providing that the term the insured was used severally in the insurance contract.the issue in commercial standard was the effect of the severability clause on the applicability of policy provisions excluding coverage under certain circumstances.whether or not the exclusions applied depended on the identity of the insured for purposes of the provisions at issue.id.at.the court found significant the fact that the exclusions all referred to the insured as opposed to an insured.when a claim is made against one who is an insured under the policy,that person is considered the insured for the purpose of determining the insurance company obligations with respect to that claim.id.thus,the court concluded that the fact that a claim against one insured might fall within one of the policy exclusions would not preclude coverage of a claim against another insured.
commercial standard is distinguishable from the case now before us.in this case,we must determine the effect of the severability clause,if any,on the definition of an occurrence under the policy.unlike the exclusion at issue in commercial standard,which was defined with respect to the insured,an occurrence is defined in the ryans policy with respect to an event.the definition of occurrence does not contain any language referencing the insured to which the severability clause can be linked.instead,it simply defines a set of facts,namely,an accident.as a result,linda isbell and the ryans reliance on commercial standard is misplaced.
second,linda isbell and the ryans rely on our decision in western heritage insurance magic years learning centers child care,cir.magic years is similarly distinguishable from this case.in magic years,a former employee sued magic years and two of its officers for sexual harassment by the president of the company.the plaintiff alleged that not only did the president intentionally and negligently harass her,but that magic years was responsible under the doctrine of respondeat superior and for entrusting him with supervisory responsibility.although we found that the sexual harassment was covered under magic years policy,we did not base this finding on the policy severability clause.instead,we relied on a special endorsement in the policy providing coverage for sexual harassment claims to trump the general policy definition for occurrence.there is no such special endorsement in the ryans policy.
linda isbell and the ryans acknowledge this difference between magic years policy and the ryans policy.still,they argue that our alternative holding in magic years that the sexual harassment would fall within the definition of occurrence even in the absence of the special endorsement should control the outcome of this case.we are not persuaded that this point in magic years should be accorded such weight.we have repeatedly criticized and declined to follow this aspect of magic years as unexplained and inconsistent with texas precedent.see life ins.travelers ins,cir declining to follow the alternative holding in magic years because it failed to acknowledge,and was inconsistent with,our earlier holding in columbia mutual insurance fiesta mart,cir am.guar.liab.ins.v.the,cir same.texas courts have also declined to follow magic years for the same reason.see king dallas fire ins,dist,granted declining to follow magic years for reasons stated in new york life.
finally,linda isbell and the ryans suggest that the texas court of appeals decision in walker lumbermens mutual casualty,no writ,supports their interpretation of occurrence.they read walker to stand for the proposition that an insured minor child intentional acts do not preclude coverage for the insured vicarious liability.this characterization of walker,however,is not wholly accurate.coverage in walker did not turn on a determination of whether the child intentional destruction of property constituted an occurrence.the policy in walker clearly provided coverage for all sums for which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as well as for loss of property of others caused by an insured.id.at.the issue in walker instead was whether the child acts fell within an exclusion to coverage.as in commercial standard,the exclusion for intentional acts in walker was defined with respect to damage caused by the insured rather than an event.thus,walker does not control our construction of occurrence under the ryans policy.
while none of these cases addressed the significance of a severability clause for determining whether a complaint alleges an occurrence,two recent texas court of appeals cases have reached this issue.in king dallas fire in
