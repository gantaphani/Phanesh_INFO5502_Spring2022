the world trade center building stood on the northern edge of the world trade center site.as the north tower collapsed on september,it sent flaming debris spewing into the area around.the fiery debris crashed into,gouging chunks out of the building.fires burned on multiple floors.confident that the people inside had evacuated,grappling with the death of hundreds of firefighters and a supply of water,the new york city fire department made the decision to establish a collapse zone and walk away,rather than fight the fire.after burning for seven hours,collapsed,destroying the electrical substation owned by consolidated edison of new york,con ed directly underneath the building.
con ed,along with its insurers,sued the defendants,who designed,built,operated and maintained wtc,alleging in relevant part that the defendants negligence caused the building to collapse.the district court disposed of the claims against the defendants in two decisions at issue in this appeal.the first,on january,granted a motion to dismiss brought by a number of defendants involved in the construction of the building,including appellees tishman construction corporation and the office of irwin cantor.in re september prop.damage bus.loss,d.the second,issued september,granted summary judgment to appellees world trade company,silverstein development and silverstein properties,together,the building developer and manager.aegis ins,world trade,d.
we affirm the grants of summary judgment,albeit on different grounds than those relied on by the district court.we hold that even assuming arguendo negligence on the part of the defendants,any such negligence was not the cause in fact of the collapse of.
background 
world trade center 
the con ed substation in question was built in to provide electric power to the world trade center site,built on land owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey.the agreement between the port authority and con ed allowed the port authority to build above the substation.in,the port authority exercised that right by entering into an agreement with world trade company,world trade to build.pursuant to that agreement,the port authority would own,which would be designed,constructed and operated by silverstein properties,world trade agent.world trade held a year lease on.
the substation was built on a trapezoidal parcel of land,and was designed as a trapezoid to mimic the shape of the parcel.to achieve its design goals,the building included two sets of support columns internal columns that formed a rectangle at the center of the structure,and external columns that were laid out along the building trapezoidal perimeter.the trapezoidal shape also required that in the northeast corner of the building,the steel girders connecting two columns and formed an oblique angle,rather than a right angle.the relevant building standards at the time was constructed specified that 
through accident or misuse,structures capable of supporting safely all conventional design loads may suffer local damage,that is,the loss of load resistance in an element or small portion of the structure.in recognition of this,buildings and structural systems shall possess general structural integrity,which is the quality of being able to sustain local damage with the structure as a whole remaining stable and not being damaged to an extent disproportionate to the original local damage.
american national standard minimum design loads for buildings and other structures,section.construction on was completed in.
ii.terrorism in manhattan 
in,the port authority formed the office for special planning the office to assess the vulnerability of the authority various facilities to terrorism.a report prepared by the office examined the vulnerabilities of the world trade center complex,noting a number of symbolic bombing incidents in new york city from to,including 
three people injured in explosion at the manhattan offices of the airline aeroflot in,with the jewish defense league claiming credit.
a pipe bomb exploding the of new york state supreme court in manhattan in after warnings of a bomb blast by the croatian freedom fighters.
four bombs at stock exchanges and banks in manhattan in,with fuerzas armadas de liberacion nacional faln claiming credit.
a bomb at the bankers trust company in manhattan,also in,with faln again claiming credit.
a bomb at broadway apparently directed toward the new york city police benevolent association in.
in,a car bomb was detonated in the parking garage below one world trade center.see united states yousef,cir.ramzi yousef,along with several,drove a van onto the b level of the parking garage below the world trade center.they then set the bomb timer to detonate minutes later.at approximately that day,the bomb exploded,killing six people,injuring more than a thousand others,and causing widespread fear and more than million in property damage.id.testifying at yousef trial,a secret service agent told the jury that yousef intent was to cause one world trade center to topple,killing tens of thousands of people.
iii.september,
the horrific events of september,are well known and need not be repeated here in great detail.al qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners.american airlines flight and united airlines flight were deliberately crashed into the twin towers of the world trade center.a third plane,american airlines flight,crashed into the pentagon.united airlines flight crashed into a field in shanksville,pennsylvania during a struggle between the passengers and the hijackers.the planes crashing into towers one and two ignited intense fires that burned until both towers collapsed.altogether,roughly people were killed in attacks in new york,including new york city firefighters and paramedics.see aegis,d at.
the collapse of the north tower sent flaming debris spewing beyond vesey street,as described in the world trade center building performance study 
debris from the collapsing towers,some of it still on fire,rained down on the surrounding buildings,causing structural damage and starting new fires.the sudden collapse of each tower sent out air pressure waves that spread dust clouds of building materials in all directions for many blocks.the density and pressure of the dust clouds were strong enough to carry light debris and lift or move small vehicles and break windows in adjacent buildings for several blocks around the wtc site.most of the fires went unattended as efforts were devoted to rescuing those trapped in the collapsed towers.the story marriott world trade center hotel wtc was hit by a substantial amount of debris during both tower collapses.portions of wtc were severely damaged by debris from each tower collapse,but progressive collapse of the building did not occur.however,little of wtc remained standing after the collapse of wtc.wtc,and had floor contents and furnishings burn completely and suffered significant partial collapse from debris impacts and from fire damage to their structural frames.wtc,a story building that was part of the wtc complex,burned unattended for hours before collapsing at.the falling debris also damaged water mains around the wtc site

when firefighters arrived to assess,they found a building ravaged by the debris that careened through the air when the north tower collapsed,with multiple active fires throughout the structure.one observer testified that he saw to floors where the corner ibeam was missing.and there were more floors that had damage throughout the front facade of the building and several floors were completely exposed.another testified looking at the south face of he observed flames,you know,broken windows,damage to the building,ibeams sticking out,possible pieces of the plane,i thought.first deputy fire commissioner frank cruthers testified the exterior of looked like it had been bombarded with large,heavy objects.others reported structural damage to a section of the building where there were steel columns,just hanging from its attachment to the upper floors,and there was no walls,no outside walls to that particular side of the building.an elevator car rested in the hallway,blown out of the elevator shaft,and it was or feet away from where the elevator shaft once was.
chief of department peter hayden consulted with an engineer 
we posed to him the question that considering the structural damage that was obvious to the to the building on the southwest corner,and the amount of fire damage that was occurring within the building,could we anticipate a collapse and if so,when.he said yes and he gave an approximate time of five to six hours,which was pretty much right on the money because the building collapsed about that afternoon.
chief daniel nigro reported more fire at on september than he had seen in his entire career before the fires at the world trade center towers.both nigro and hayden observed fires burning on multiple floors of.under normal conditions a fire starts at one floor and works its way up and you might have a few floors of fire if the fire department ca get a handle on it.it is rare that you see fires on noncontiguous floors in a.others reported fire pushing out of the top floors.firefighter tiernach cassidy reported that most of the windows were broken on the south face of the building.the entire south face of the building.and where there was a broken window,there was either smoke or fire pushing out of it.cassidy recalled fires across the south face of,and while he could not recall exactly which floors appeared to have fire it was considerable.it was it seemed to me,i think the original time i may have said every floor.but what i could estimate at the time it was a lot of fire.
the collapse of the twin towers destroyed the water main responsible for bringing water to,resulting in significant damage done to the water supply in the area.firefighters resorted to stretching lines from the fire boats onto land to provide water supply to fight fires.as the fema study reported 
water on site was limited due to a inch broken water main in vesey street.although was sprinklered,it did not appear that there would have been a sufficient quantity of water to control the growth and spread of the fires on multiple floors.
at a nearby hydrant on the corner of vesey street and west broadway,a battalion chief reported seeing firefighters trying to hit world trade center but water was just like there was water on the sidewalk,there was no pressure in the hydrants,you could tell that there was a problem.a firefighter who entered turned the wheel on the standpipe and found that there was no water in it.
with no water,and no civilian lives at risk,and with their comrades buried in the towers debris,the fire department decided to create a collapse zone around and allow the fire to burn,unchecked.hayden explained 
the decision not to attempt to extinguish the fire in that building was based on the fact that,number,the amount of fire that was occurring in the building,the fact that the buildings had been searched and evacuated,and thirdly,and most important i think at that point in time is we had already lost firefighters.the building at this time we deemed to be vacant and we decided not to risk any more firefighters lives that day.
deputy commissioner cruthers,in command at the time,said 
the idea was that we expected that this building would come down,my goal at that point was not to lose any more people.
i made up my mind when i assumed command that my primary responsibility was to the living,and although we had a strong obligation to conduct searches and extinguishment operations where we could and those in any building are inherently dangerous.
so it was that we were going to do any things that involved danger,but there had to be a favorable analysis to justify committing people what was the upside,what were we going to get,and at that point,not only the firefighters,but the police officers,the port authority workers,office of emergency management people,everyone was there.
the first obligation is to the people who are alive,and then decide what is the likelihood of a successful effort compared to the risk of their lives.
the building collapsed roughly seven hours after the fire department decided to walk away,at,crushing the con ed substation.
ii.proceedings before the district court 
in,con ed sued new york city the city and the port authority the owners and lessees of and the design and construction professionals who designed and built.in re september prop.damage,d at.con ed alleged the city negligently designed and installed a backup generator in space it rented in for its office of emergency management.the city moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted,finding the city immune from suit under the new york defense emergency act,unconsol.law et.id.at.against the port authority,as owner of the,con ed brought claims for,inter alia,negligent design,maintenance,operation and control of,as well as breach of contract.in re september,d.the district court granted summary judgment to the port authority on con ed breach of contract and negligence claims,id.at,but that decision was vacated by this court,aegis ins,port,app x cir.the parties eventually settled.in re september prop.damage bus.loss,app x.cir.
in april,tishman and cantor,among others,moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.tishman,cantor and the other design and construction defendants argued three general grounds for dismissal the absence of a duty of care owed to con ed and its insurers the absence of proximate cause the inappropriateness of the products liability claims.in re september prop.damage,d at.the district court granted the motion to dismiss.the district court found tishman and cantor did not owe con ed a duty of care because neither was in privity,or a similar special relationship,with con ed.the district court concluded that tishman and cantor owe d duties of care and proper performance to those entitled to receive the benefit of their work or services or products,but not to third parties such as con ed.id.at.
con ed filed a second amended complaint on july.in november.moved for summary judgment,arguing that it had no duty to prevent the destruction of the con ed substation because the terrorist attack and its consequences were unforeseeable to.in the alternative.argued that the events of september were an intervening and superseding cause of con ed injury.con ed opposed summary judgment,arguing that there were material questions of fact as to whether.negligently designed and constructed.in district court,con ed offered two alternate theories to support its argument the building was designed and constructed in such a way that it lacked structural integrity,particularly in the northeast corner of the building and diesel fuel used in emergency backup generators systems,and stored in tanks throughout,fueled the fires in the building,which in turn heated the transfer trusses bearing much of the building weight.aegis,d at.con ed theorized that the heated transfer trusses expanded and failed,causing to collapse into its center.id.on appeal,con ed abandons its diesel fuel theory,and now argues only that it should be permitted to present its claim that was negligently designed and constructed to a jury.
as the moving papers raised only questions of law.did not submit expert reports to the district court.in its initial response,con ed submitted a few summary declarations,which drew a single declaration from.in support of its reply papers.after the motion was fully submitted,however,con ed sought leave from the district court to file supplemental declarations attaching hundreds of pages of expert reports.in granting leave,the district court stated.is under no obligation to respond to the supplemental declarations unless and until the court requires them to do so.at oral argument on the motions,the district court repeated that direction,stating i f i want you to respond,i let you know.
relevant to this appeal,the supplemental declarations filed by con ed included several opinions from con ed experts opining,to a reasonable degree of scientific probability,that if were properly designed and constructed,it would have survived the events of september a large fire unfought by either internal sprinkler systems or firefighters.guy nordenson,a professor of architecture and structural engineering at princeton university and a practicing structural engineer in new york city,opined that b ased upon my review of available photographic and video evidence,and the deposition testimony of eyewitnesses,including members of the,it is my opinion that the collapse of or did not cause structural damage to any of the core columns of.his report stated 
a building should have sufficient structural integrity to withstand a local failure such as the loss of a single girder with only local consequences.however,as a result of deficiencies in both its overall design and its details,the structure lacked redundancy and robustness and therefore did not have sufficient resistance to disproportionate collapse.its design lacked a fundamental consideration for structural integrity and load path redundancy.
nordenson opined that 
the traveling office contents fire present on several floors of were determined to have no influence on the cause or the character of the progression of global collapse.although thermal effects and the presence of fire in the building are critical to the initial local failure mechanism,for the purposes of the global collapse,ambient conditions were assumed because elevated temperatures would only make the structure less resilient.
instead,nordenson points to several structural vulnerabilities in design and construction that he opines led to the building collapse,including n compliant lateral bracing of columns l ack of lateral support for interior columns m ultiple interdependent transfer structures d iscontinuity of concrete slab diaphragm due to trench headers and l ong spans and large tributary areas of interior columns.
another of con ed experts,frederick mowrer,an associate professor emeritus in the department of fire protection engineering at the university of maryland,opined that t here is a reasonable expectation that firefighters will not engage in,or be effective in,offensive firefighting in buildings.mowrer states that v ery tall buildings,such as the building,are generally required to be of type construction.type buildings,mowrer stated,are 
a type of construction in which the structural elements are of incombustible materials with ratings sufficient to withstand the fire severity resulting from complete combustion of the contents and finish involved in the intended occupancy the building was not able to withstand the fire severity resulting from complete combustion of its contents without collapsing,thereby violating this principle.unlike the and buildings,the building was not subject to the additional fuel loads and structural damage associated with the aircraft impacts.
internal quotation mark and citation omitted.thus,mowrer opined 
because a building of type construction should be able to withstand complete combustion of its fuel load without collapsing and with no intervention by manual fire fighting or automatic sprinkler protection,the lack of manual fire fighting and the inoperative automatic sprinkler protection in the building on september,should not have caused the collapse of the building.
mowrer also opined that the fireproofing material used in was not properly applied to the fluted steel decking and floor support structural steel beams and girders.this reduced the fire resistance of the beams,girders and floor assemblies below the level that would have been achieved if these cavities had been properly filled.he opined 
the failure to properly fill the flute cavities with the fire protection material applied to the beams,as required,permitted the girders and beams to heat up more quickly than expected when exposed to an ordinary office contents fire.this more rapid heating would cause the girders,beams and floor assemblies to fail more quickly than expected when subjected to such a fire that was sufficient to cause a failure which would have led to the global collapse of.
the district court granted.summary judgment.the district court briefly discussed con ed theories as to why collapsed,and acknowledged its expert declarations.however,the district court concluded that the absence of duty makes it unnecessary to explore further,at trial,these complicated and confusing speculations as to how world trade center collapsed and what significance the collapse offers on issues of negligence in the building design or construction.aegis,d at.the district court found that while may have owed con ed a general duty to protect the substation from risk of harm,that duty did not encompass the long chain of events on september,that eventuated in the destruction of the con edison substation.id.the district court explained 
the risk reasonably to be perceived by and its duty to be obeyed,did not encompass the strange,improbable,and attenuated chain of events that led to world trade center collapse and the crushing of con edison substation.nothing in common experience or history could give rise to a reasonably foreseeable risk relating to the chain of events flowing from the terrorists and their hijackings to the destruction of the con edison substation to permit a duty to exist under the present circumstances would subject the developer of world trade center to uncontrolled and unforeseeable liability.the risks being litigated were not within the zone of reasonable foreseeability,and so extending duty here would create impermissibly broad liability,and would offend new york policy.
id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.the district court dismissed all claims remaining against and entered final judgment in the case.at this point in the litigation,con ed appeals from the dismissal of its action against the.defendants,tishman construction and cantor.

the parties agree that collapsed as a result of fire ignited by burning debris from the collapse of one world trade center,but on little after that.con ed argues that its expert declarations and reports support the conclusion that inadequate design and construction of permitted office contents fires to cause the collapse of.con ed posits that debris from tower hit,setting off office contents fires.in broad strokes,con ed argues one of the building girders was not adequately connected to an appropriate column,and this inadequate connection set off a series of failures leading to the building collapse.defendants argue was properly designed and constructed,but simply could not withstand the events of september.
for the purposes of this appeal,we need not delve into the mechanics behind the building failure.while we conclude that the district court erred in finding the.defendants did not owe con ed a duty of care,we nevertheless affirm on the ground that the record before us establishes that,given the unprecedented nature and sheer magnitude of the events of september,the alleged negligence on the part of defendants was not the of the collapse of.
the district court erred in granting.summary judgment on the ground that the events of september were not foreseeable,and thus defendants did not owe con ed a duty to protect against them.under new york law,which applies to this case,a plaintiff must establish three elements to prevail on a neg
