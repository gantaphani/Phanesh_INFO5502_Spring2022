this appeal grows out of a lengthy and complex dispute over commercial liability insurance coverage.at odds are the insured,metropolitan life insurance metlife and one of its insurers,liberty mutual insurance liberty.metlife claims that liberty had a duty to defend and indemnify metlife in numerous lawsuits relating to the marketing of life insurance policies and real estate investments.liberty refused coverage and prevailed in the district court.metlife now appeals.
background 
the origins of this dispute lie in lawsuits brought against metlife by dissatisfied customers.the lawsuits fall into three groups 
sixteen individual vanishing premium lawsuits in alabama state courts the alabama cases 
nine nationwide vanishing premium class actions in federal court the class actions and 
two real estate investment cases arising out of dealings with copley real estate advisors,a metlife subsidiary the real estate cases.
metlife claims that the commercial previously comprehensive general liability insurance cgl and umbrella excess liability insurance uel policies that it purchased from liberty require that liberty defend and indemnify metlife.we describe each group of lawsuits in turn.
the alabama cases.from late through,sixteen individuals filed suit against metlife in alabama state courts claiming that metlife sales representatives had negligently or intentionally made misrepresentations concerning metlife life insurance policies.in particular,the lawsuits charged that representatives had told buyers that if they reinvested their yearly life insurance dividends,their obligation to pay premiums would vanish after eight to ten years.in fact,the buyers payment obligations continued.the alabama plaintiffs claimed that as a result of metlife actions they suffered monetary damages and mental anguish.
beginning in december,metlife began tendering the alabama cases to liberty.based on the plaintiffs mental anguish claims,metlife argued that liberty had a duty to defend and indemnify metlife because its cgl policy included coverage for personal injury claims.initially,liberty agreed to defend the claims,but eventually it concluded that the policies did not afford any coverage and notified metlife that it would neither defend nor indemnify.
in the litigation with the alabama plaintiffs,metlife eventually paid legal fees of approximately and settled of the suits for roughly million.the last suit was still pending when the present federal action was heard.metlife seeks to hold liberty liable for both the defense costs and the settlement payments.
the class actions.the second group of suits also arose from customer complaints about vanishing premiums.beginning in october,class actions were filed in various federal and state courts against metlife all recited claims that were similar to those in the alabama cases.the federal class actions were consolidated in the federal district court in massachusetts.the consolidated complaint alleged inter alia that metlife misdescription of the vanishing premium concept comprised unfair competition,violating the massachusetts consumer protection act.laws ch.
metlife tendered the class action cases to liberty on the ground that the cgl policy provided coverage for claims of unfair competition arising out of advertising.the advertising to which metlife pointed were the illustrations it used during the vanishing premium sales meetings with customers.liberty declined to defend the class actions or indemnify metlife.metlife spent more than million in legal fees to defend the suits.subsequent to its decision in this case,the district court approved a million settlement for the class actions.
the real estate cases.the final group of lawsuits stemmed from metlife sale of commercial real estate interests to two state pension fund boards.in,copley real estate advisors,a metlife subsidiary,sold million worth of commercial real estate to the washington state investment board the washington board and million worth of real estate to the ohio state teachers retirement board the ohio board.washington also bought other real estate interests controlled by set of investments between and for about million and another set between and for about million.
as national real estate markets declined in the late,the investments quickly lost much of their value.in,washington and ohio sued metlife in state court suits alleging numerous wrongs one set of claims was that metlife had misrepresented the risks,fees,and other material aspects of the investments.in june,metlife notified liberty of the washington and ohio lawsuits.because the false statements complained of by the washington and ohio boards appeared in metlife written promotional material,metlife said that the suits were covered by both the cgl and uel policies advertising injury clauses.
liberty concluded that it would not defend or indemnify metlife as to any of these real estate suits it said that the promotional materials were not advertising and,further,that coverage was excluded under the policies insurance and related operations exclusion iroe.metlife subsequently incurred nearly million in legal expenses in the two suits and settled both actions the washington claim settled for almost million.the record does not indicate the amount of the ohio settlement.
the policies.metlife purchased eleven separate cgl policies and three separate uel policies each policy covered a single year.the uel policies provide higher liability limits.the coverage provisions are,so far as pertinent here,the same except where otherwise indicated.the key policy provisions in dispute are included in an appendix to this opinion.
the uel and cgl policies provided coverage,subject to exclusions,for several broad categories of liability.as already noted,the liabilities for which metlife sought coverage stemmed from metlife alleged misrepresentations in selling vanishing premium insurance to consumers and its alleged misrepresentations in the sale of real estate interests to the washington and ohio boards.to establish coverage,metlife mainly relied on provisions covering advertising injury,a phrase defined slightly differently in the cgl and uel policies.further,in the alabama cases,metlife also relied on a coverage provision for personal injury,which was contained in the cgl policies,but not the uel policies.
in addition to disputing initial coverage,the main exclusion invoked by liberty was the iroe exclusion from both personal injury and advertising liability,captioned insurance and related operations.the iroe,which was present in the cgl policies between and and all of the uel policies,contains two paragraphs pertinent here one excluding claims concerning insurance or annuities,and another excluding injury or liability resulting from professional services in effecting insurance,the conduct of an investment or acting as a fiduciary for pension or welfare funds.
the district court proceedings.in june,after liberty had refused to defend or indemnify in all three sets of suits against metlife,metlife brought a declaratory judgment action against liberty in alabama seeking defense and indemnification for the lawsuits.liberty countered by filing its own declaratory judgment action in the federal district court in massachusetts,asserting that it had no duty to defend or indemnify metlife.after the district court denied metlife motion to dismiss or stay the federal action in deference to metlife alabama action,metlife filed a counterclaim in federal court to establish coverage in all three groups of suits.
over the next two years,the district court supervised extensive discovery,heard numerous motions,and conducted a lengthy trial.although the trial began with metlife ready to try its claims as to all three sets of lawsuits,in the end the claims submitted to the jury were greatly narrowed by two sets of rulings by the district court during that give rise to two of the three main issues pressed by metlife on this appeal.
for the class action cases,metlife asserted coverage on the ground that the misrepresentations charged in those cases fell within the advertising injury coverage of the liberty policies.its theory of coverage under the cgl policies relied on the fact that the master complaint in the consolidated massachusetts class action against metlife included a cause of action for unfair competition under chapter,and the cgl policies included unfair competition within the definition of advertising injury.
in a motion for summary judgment,liberty asserted that the cgl policy only covered claims of unfair competition when they involved injury to an insured competitors,and it invoked massachusetts case law interpreting similar insurance clauses.the district court denied liberty motion for a variety of reasons,but its decision did not squarely address the merits of liberty claim regarding unfair competition.liberty mut.ins.metro.life ins,d.liberty also failed in other efforts to forestall trial on coverage for the class action suits.
on january,the first day of trial,liberty renewed its argument in a motion in limine to preclude metlife from claiming any coverage for,or presenting any evidence relating to,the unfair competition claim arising from the class action suits.to metlife surprise,the district court provisionally agreed with liberty and prohibited metlife from making any mention of unfair competition coverage in its opening argument.metlife was never able to persuade the court to alter its position,so no evidence relating to unfair competition coverage was presented at trial.
the district court other contested ruling,which cut even deeper,concerned metlife failure to allocate its damages in a manner satisfactory to the district court.the issue first arose when metlife made a proffer of testimony of its counsel,robert jordan.in cross examining jordan,liberty elicited the fact that some of the damages presented by metlife might be attributed to defense and settlement costs paid by metlife on behalf of its independent sales agents,who were not covered by liberty insurance.the court expressed concern that metlife did not intend to allocate its damages between these uninsured agents and the insured principal or between covered and uncovered claims.
on the fifth day of the trial,the district judge returned to this issue when he discussed the parties proposed jury instructions.the district judge advised the parties that 
i f metlife is only able to establish that there is a policy coverage for a small minority of the total of the claims within a particular lawsuit,the idea that that triggers a duty to defend the whole lawsuit at liberty mutual expense entirely and also a duty to bear the costs of settlement is,i think,going to be out of bounds.
because metlife had not yet attempted to present its damages evidence,the district court did not rule on whether and how metlife would have to allocate its damages.
on two occasions thereafter,the district court prohibited metlife from presenting evidence of damages.on the first occasion,the district court disallowed evidence of defense costs in the real estate cases on the ground that it did not properly allocate costs between the washington and ohio lawsuits and between covered and uncovered claims within the washington case it also disallowed evidence of the washington settlement on the ground that the settlement figure did not allocate between covered and uncovered claims.on the second occasion,the district court did not allow evidence of metlife legal bills for the alabama cases and the class actions on the ground that the bills were not relevant until they were established as necessary by an expert witness.
at the close of all evidence the district court suggested that metlife might reopen its case for the purpose of presenting damages evidence that allocated defense and settlement costs between covered and not covered matters.however,when metlife continued to proffer damages evidence in unallocated form,the district court ultimately refused to allow metlife to reopen the damages issue.as a result of the district court preclusion of damages evidence,none of the damage claims as to any of the three sets of lawsuits were submitted to the jury.
in the end,because of the district court rulings,the jury was asked to determine only whether liberty had a future duty to defend or indemnify a single alabama lawsuit loudermilch that had not yet been resolved and whether it had a future duty to defend or indemnify the still pending class action lawsuits under the uel policy but not under the cgl policy,since the court had already rejected coverage based on its reading of the unfair competition language.none of the claims based on the real estate cases were submitted to the jury because metlife conceded that it had not made out its prima facie case since its damages evidence had been excluded.
after deliberating for several days,the jury found that liberty did not have a duty to defend or indemnify metlife on any of the claims submitted to the jury regarding loudermilch or the class action cases.in doing so,the jury answered special questions that detailed its reasoning.the jury found inter alia that the loudermilch case was not covered by the cgl policy personal injury clause,that the class actions were not covered by the uel policy advertising injury clause,and that numerous exclusions barred metlife from recovering defense or settlement costs for both sets of lawsuits.
on april,the district court issued a judgment in favor of liberty on all counts,including those that had not been submitted to the jury.in an accompanying unreported opinion,the court explained why certain questions had not been submitted to the jury and why it had ruled against metlife on those issues.in particular,the court further explicated its ruling on the class action lawsuits unfair competition claim,the need to allocate damages,and the general scope of liberty duty to defend.
ii.discussion 
metlife now appeals and makes three claims of error that the district court incorrectly placed the burden of allocating defense and indemnity costs between covered and matters on the insured,thus effectively preventing metlife from presenting its damages evidence that the district court erred by not permitting metlife to seek coverage for the class actions unfair competition claims and that the district court erroneously instructed the jury as to how it should interpret exclusionary clauses in the insurance policies.
we address metlife arguments in turn,applying de novo review to questions of law.speen crown clothing,cir,cert.denied,d.included in this category is the interpretation of the insurance policies where relevant facts are not in dispute.liab.ins.bourbeau,cir.the parties agree that this diversity action is governed by the substantive law of massachusetts.
the alabama cases.two of metlife three claimed errors are implicated in the alabama cases the exclusion of damages evidence because of the district court ruling on allocation and the district court jury instruction on interpreting exclusionary clauses.yet the jury special verdict specifically rejected coverage for the single alabama lawsuit that it did consider loudermilch.there is no reason to think that the result would have been any different if claims based on the other fifteen alabama lawsuits had been submitted to the jury.
the loudermilch case was decided by the jury because,unlike the other fifteen alabama lawsuits,the exclusion of metlife damages evidence did not undermine metlife claim that liberty had a continuing duty to defend and indemnify.thus,the jury was asked 
with respect to the duty to defend,was any of the claims that a policyholder made against metlife in any of the lawsuits that various policyholders brought against metlife a claim within the scope of a liability insurance coverage as defined in the coverage provisions of any of the various policies in evidence that liberty mutual issued to metlife or new england 
to this,the jury answered no,thus rejecting any coverage for the loudermilch lawsuit independent of the exclusionary clauses.because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,ruggerio ambulance,grange mut.ins,the jury finding also negates a duty to indemnify.bagley monticello ins.
the loudermilch jury verdict against metlife makes metlife claimed errors harmless.see brandt wand partners,cir fite digital equip,cir.as metlife conceded in its proposed jury instructions,all of the alabama suits involved substantially similar claims.a review of the sixteen complaints confirms this many are identical and all charge metlife with the same improper conduct and rely on the same legal theories for recovery.and,since loudermilch failed inter alia for lack of initial coverage,the result is unaffected by any alleged error in instructing the jury as to exclusions.
in its reply brief,metlife argues that liberty has failed to show that the alabama cases are so similar that some form of estoppel should apply.its sole support for this position is to say indeed,they are not.in any event,estoppel is not the issue the question is whether there is any reason to believe that the claims as to the fifteen lawsuits would have been resolved differently than the sixteenth lawsuit,cir.we have been given no reason to think that they would.
the class actions.in the case of the class action lawsuits,two of metlife three claims of error are relevant the district court decision not to allow metlife to invoke unfair competition and the jury instruction on interpreting exclusionary clauses.however,as with the alabama lawsuits,the jury verdict saves us from juxtaposing state unfair competition law with policy coverage because any supposed error made by the district court was once again harmless.
although the district court prohibited metlife from arguing that the class action lawsuits were covered by the cgl policy advertising injury clause,it permitted metlife to claim coverage under the same clause in the uel policy because,as already noted see note,above,the two policies included different definitions of advertising injury.one of the questions the jury was asked was whether 
the use of metlife illustrations by sales agents of metlife,as alleged in the underlying class action complaints,constitute d advertising as used in the uel policies.
to this,the jury answered no.
where there is no advertising there can be no advertising injury.the policy language expressly requires that an injury arise from the insured advertising activities.metlife conceded as much when it said in its proposed jury instructions that the first element of advertising injury under both the cgl and uel policies was the existence of an advertising activity committed by metlife.see also ins.chaides constr.
the problem for metlife is that the jury the illustrations used by metlife agents were not advertising under the uel with equal force to metlife claim for coverage under the cgl policies.although the cgl claim did not go to the jury,the illustrations in question are the same as those in the uel claim.the only difference between the two claims was the type of wrong alleged to have been caused by the illustrations under the cgl the wrong was unfair competition,whereas under the uel it was a negligent act,error or omission.
thus,even if we assume that the district court misread massachusetts unfair competition law and mistakenly precluded metlife claim for coverage under the cgl policy,that error was harmless because there is no practical likelihood that the cgl claim could have succeeded when the uel claim failed.brandt,at.the jury verdict shows that metlife cgl claim would not have satisfied the first element of advertising coverage,and this failure would have doomed metlife claim without regard to exclusions.
the washington and ohio lawsuits.as to the insurance claims based on the washington and ohio lawsuits,the district court directed a verdict for liberty after concluding that the damages evidence offered by metlife failed to allocate amounts between covered and claims.metlife says the district court got the rules on allocation exactly backward and that its evidence on damages should have been admitted and the claims submitted to the jury.liberty defends the district court allocation ruling and says that,in any case,none of the claims are covered under the policy.
it is not uncommon for a lawsuit against an insured to assert some claims that are covered by the insurance policy and others that are not.in massachusetts,as elsewhere,an insurer must defend the entire lawsuit if it has a duty to defend any of the underlying counts in the complaint.airy ins.greenbaum,cir citing aetna cas.sur.cont l cas.and the general rule under massachusetts law is that if the insurer fails to defend the lawsuit,it is liable for all defense costs and assuming policy coverage the entire resulting judgment or settlement,unless liability can be allocated among covered and uncovered claims.liquor liab.joint underwriting ass of hermitage ins,palermo fireman fund ins.
massachusetts courts have not expressly decided which party bears the burden of allocating defense costs,but when allocation of defense costs is possible,the burden of allocation generally falls on the insurer.this is certainly the rule as to allocation of indemnity costs,liquor liab.joint underwriting ass n,at palermo,at,and this approach likely applies to defense costs,since the insurer should have been in a position to properly allocate both types of costs had it defended the lawsuit.see.transp.indem,cal windt,insurance claims disputes at ed.
the district court may not have been wrong in thinking that there must be limits to this general approach.here,for example,the district court thought some of the claimed expenses relating to the vanishing premium suits were to defend independent agents who were not insured and others were for sales outside the period covered by liberty policy.possibly an insured who needlessly conflates expenses not covered by the policy with expenses that arguably are covered would forfeit any claim that the insurer should bear the burden of disaggregating the asserted damage figures.
however,so far as we can tell,the gravamen of the district court misallocation objection in the real estate suits was that some of the expenses incurred in defending claims by washington were going to benefit metlife future defense of the ohio suit.it is hard to view such a collateral benefit as a misallocation so long as those costs were necessary for covered claims in the washington suit,the fact that the research and discovery might be useful in some later case would hardly defeat full recovery.
the district court was apparently also concerned that many of the complaint theories of recovery in the washington suit could not conceivably come within the advertising coverage of the uel policy.however,where the theories relate to a common core of facts,defense costs are often hard to separate between witnesses and documents are often the this is ordinarily the classic case for imposing the allocation burden on the insurer who refused to defend a covered theory.see,home ins.paul fire marine ins,cir.
however,any mistake by the district court on this allocation issue is irrelevant unless some real estate claim against metlife was arguably covered by a liberty issue to which we now turn.an insurer has a duty to defend its insured if the allegations in the complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.airy ins,at quoting sterilite cont l cas.here,liberty has two separate arguments against coverage.
the first argument is that the real estate suits do not even arguably involve advertising activities within the meaning of the coverage provisions of the policies,an issue on which metlife bears the burden.hakim.insurers insolvency fund.the cgl and uel definitions of advertising injury contain slightly different language but in both cases,liberty says that the promotional materials given to the washington and ohio boards,essentially prospectuses describing the real estate packages,are not advertising in any common sense of the term.
there is a basic split in authority on this issue.some courts have taken the term advertising in its ordinary usage to suggest public dissemination,usually to a wide audience on this view,a prospectus tailored to one customer and one transaction,setting forth the terms of the proposed deal and its supposed ad
