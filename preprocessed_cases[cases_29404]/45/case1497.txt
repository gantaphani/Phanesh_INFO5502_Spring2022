following a trial,a jury awarded david dill damages on his negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation claims against general american life insurance company general american.following the entry of judgment,general american filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or,in the alternative,denied on the merits.general american appeals.we dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
background 
dill,an agent of general american for selling life insurance and other products,sued general american after two of dill clients cancelled their life insurance policies.dill alleged that he lost substantial commission income because of general american misrepresentations.general american counterclaimed,alleging breach of contract against dill.after a trial,the jury found in favor of dill on his negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation claims,and awarded him in compensatory damages and in punitive damages the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict on november.
on november,general american filed a motion for an extension of time to file a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.dill did not oppose the motion for extension and the district court granted the motion,extending the time to file the rule b motion until december.general american filed its rule b motion on december.
on january,dill filed his response in opposition to the rule b motion dill addressed each of general american arguments on the merits,but also argued,for the first time,that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the rule b motion.dill contended that the motion had not been timely filed within the period mandated by federal rules of civil procedure b and b in raising the untimeliness issue,dill counsel acknowledged that he had not objected to general american motion for extension,but asserted that during the course of his research in preparing dill response in opposition to the rule b motion he discovered that the filing period could not be extended.dill argued that the district court had no authority to extend the time period for filing the rule b motion.consequently,the district court purported grant of the extension motion was a nullity,and the court lost jurisdiction once the period expired.
upon review,the district court ultimately agreed with dill.the court ruled that it had no authority to extend the period for filing the rule b motion,and that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the rule b motion because it was filed after the period expired.the district court further determined that,although it had authority,in general,to convert a rule b motion to a motion for relief from judgment under rule b,because general american motion did not allege grounds for relief under rule b and because there was no showing of extraordinary circumstances,it could not properly construe the motion as one under rule b.alternatively,the district court denied general american rule b motion on the merits.on february,four days after the district court entry of judgment on the motion,general american filed its notice of appeal to this court.
ii.discussion 
we are required to ascertain the existence of jurisdiction,whether or appellate,at the outset of an appeal.arnold wood,cir.in most private civil cases such as this one,a party wishing to appeal the judgment of the district court must file a notice of appeal within days of the date the district court final judgment is entered.fed.a a arnold,at.because the period for filing an appeal is statutory,it is a jurisdictional requirement that must be met it can not be forfeited or waived.bowles russell,d.however,i f a party timely files a motion for judgment under rule b,the period for filing a notice of appeal is tolled until the entry of the order disposing of the motion.fed.a a i.emphasis added.
in this case,general american notice of appeal was not filed within days of the district court entry of judgment on the jury verdict.therefore,general american appeal would be untimely,and we would lack jurisdiction over it,bowles.at,unless the period for filing the notice of appeal was tolled by general american rule b motion.fed.a a i.
a rule b motion must be filed within days after the entry of judgment.b.general american rule b motion was not filed within the period provided by the rule,but it was filed within the extended time frame purportedly granted by the district court.however,the district court lacked authority to extend the time period beyond the period.see.b a court must not extend the time to act under rule b except as that rule allow s fed civ.b providing no exception to filing deadline for filing a renewed motion as matter of law see also arnold,at holding that identical time period for filing rule motion,may not be extended by the court,nor by agreement of counsel.
general american,nonetheless,contends that the time limitations in rules b and b are not strict jurisdictional time limitations that must be followed rather,it asserts that time limitations for filing a rule b motion are actually rules.general american argues that dill forfeited the right to raise the untimeliness of the motion when he did not object to the motion for extension of time to file the rule b motion.dill,on the other hand,argues that even if the time period for filing the rule b motion is not jurisdictional,he did not forfeit the untimeliness issue because he raised it before the district court ruled on the merits of the rule b motion.
as the supreme court recognized in kontrick ryan,courts,including the supreme court,have more than occasionally used the term jurisdictional to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of court,d.thus,over the last few years,the supreme court has undertaken to clarify the distinction between rules and jurisdictional rules.bowles.at see also kontrick,at.clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.eberhart united states,d distinguishing between time limitations in jurisdictional rules and rules.time limitations in rules may be inflexible and unalterable on a party application,but they can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.kontrick,at.see also eberhart,at.c rules thus assure relief to a party properly raising them,but do not compel the same result if the party forfeits them.jurisdictional time limits,on the other hand,can not be waived or forfeited.kontrick,at.bowles.at.thus,we must first determine whether the inflexible time limitations of federal rules of civil procedure b and b are rules,which could have been forfeited by dill if not timely raised,or whether they are unalterable,jurisdictional time limits.then,if we conclude that the time limitations are rules,we must determine whether dill forfeited them or timely raised the issue.
time limits prescribed by statute are jurisdictional,whereas rules and limits,which are not enacted by congress,are properly classified as rules.see bowles.at noting the jurisdictional distinction between rules and limits enacted by congress.in bowles,the supreme court concluded that l ike the initial period for filing a notice of appeal,the limit on how long a district court may reopen that period is a jurisdictional rule set forth in statute.id.at citing c.because congress specifically limited the amount of time by which district courts can extend the period in c,that limitation is more than a simple rule.id.
in kontrick,on the other hand,the supreme court held that a creditor failure to comply with the time requirements in federal rules of bankruptcy procedure a and b for filing an objection to discharge did not affect the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the objection when the debtor failed to raise the time limitations before the bankruptcy court reached the merits of the creditor objection.at.critical to the court analysis was the fact that n o statute specifie d a time limit for filing a complain
