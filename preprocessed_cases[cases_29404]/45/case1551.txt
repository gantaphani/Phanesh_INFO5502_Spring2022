this case is once again before us.see bjc health columbia cas,cir reversing dismissal for failure to state a claim.the plaintiffs,bjc health system bjc and atg assurance company limited atg appeal from the district court grant of a judgment as a matter of law,a motion for partial summary judgment,and a motion to strike atg prayer for punitive damages.they also contend that the district court erred in excluding certain evidence.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
bjc,a network of hospitals,is the sole shareholder of atg,a captive insurance company that provides insurance for bjc.in september,bjc and columbia casualty company,doing business as cna health pro columbia,entered into a contract,pursuant to which columbia agreed to provide reinsurance to atg for a fixed yearly premium.
under the contract,columbia agreed to reinsure atg for individual claims that exceeded million or million,depending on the hospital,and aggregate claims over million.one clause the incurred loss condition provided that continued coverage would be conditioned upon an incurred loss ratio of less than.although the parties contest how incurred loss should be defined,they apparently agree that incurred loss refers to the costs associated with claims made against the insured party.the incurred loss ratio,in turn,is determined by dividing bjc incurred losses by the premium paid by bjc.the incurred loss condition is triggered if an incurred loss ratio exceeding occurs with respect to either aggregate claims or with regard to any individual claim.
columbia provided reinsurance for the first two years of the program.on september,only days before the end of the current policy year,columbia informed bjc that it had determined that bjc had exceeded the aggregate incurred loss ratio.columbia also stated that the incurred loss ratio had been exceeded on an individual claim,the baby c claim,as well.bjc had set a claim reserve of below million on the baby c claim,but columbia assessed a reserve of million,a sum which would lead to an incurred loss ratio well in excess of the set forth in the contract.columbia informed bjc that it would not continue with the third year of the program unless the premium was increased to million and the aggregate retention level was increased to million.
columbia extended the policy so that bjc could obtain replacement insurance,which bjc acquired from zurich.there were differences,however,between the policy offered by zurich and the policy that bjc had with columbia.as noted earlier,columbia coverage commenced at an aggregate loss of million.zurich,however,only offered coverage starting at an aggregate loss of million.this million gap in coverage means that bjc faces an additional million in potential liability that it would not be facing had columbia continued with the third year of the program although zurich declined to provide reinsurance starting at million,it stated that if it did offer coverage commencing at that level,the premium for the additional million in coverage would be million.
bjc filed suit,alleging breach of contract,and sought compensatory damages for the cost of the zurich replacement policy as well as compensation for the additional risk exposure bjc had to assume with the zurich replacement policy.bjc claimed that this latter amount was price zurich would have charged for meeting the million coverage gap.bjc also sought punitive damages,which were based on columbia allegedly fraudulent conduct.
much of this case revolves around the actuarial work columbia presented to bjc to justify columbia determination that the incurred loss ratio had exceeded.on october,the parties met in chicago to discuss their differences.at this meeting,columbia distributed an actuarial analysis that concluded that the incurred loss ratio had been exceeded.that report was at that morning.this analysis contained errors that were not present in an earlier version of the report that had been printed at that morning,but which had not been distributed.the errors in the distributed version contributed to a higher incurred loss ratio.on october,in response to unrelated concerns voiced by bjc columbia distributed a third version of the report that addressed bjc concerns but also corrected the incorrect figures from the second version.this third version,however,contained a new error one of the figures was about million too high,an error which,as described below,may have resulted in the calculation of an incurred loss ratio in excess of.
john pierce,a witness for bjc,reviewed all three versions of the actuarial report and testified that columbia did not provide any explanation regarding the manner in which columbia converted accident year data to report year data.an accident year to report year conversion was necessary because,while bjc loss data was compiled on an accident year basis,the reinsurance policy was priced on a report year basis.in his report,pierce remarked that this conversion was the critical final step in the analysis and that it was unreasonable to make this conversion without an explanation as to how it was performed.pierce also noted that without knowing how columbia had made the transition from accident year to report year figures,it was difficult to estimate the impact that the new error in the third version of the actuarial report might have had.he did,however,attempt to calculate the effect and estimated that if this error was corrected the incurred loss ratio would fall below.pierce also testified that columbia unreasonably selected the same average experience important all three versions of the actuarial analysis,despite the fact that the underlying data in these versions was different.he stated that the average experience ratio had a significant effect on the accident year figures,but could not state with exactitude how it might affect the report year data because columbia did not explain the accident year to report year conversion.
columbia actuaries either did not know or could not remember how the accident year to report year conversion was done,and columbia was unable to produce the computer models it used to conduct its and actuarial analyses of the bjc account.there was also evidence that columbia actuaries recommended a premium of nearly million for the third policy year,a substantial increase that could only be justified by a dramatic change in bjc losses or a by significant change in the assumptions columbia used in assessing the bjc account.columbia actuaries did not know whether bjc had experienced a serious change in losses between and and did not know whether there was a significant change in columbia methodologies.bjc presented testimony that there were no significant changes in bjc losses.
bjc also presented testimony pertaining to the baby c claim.angela standish,bjc director of claims and litigation,testified that there was absolutely no reason why a reserve above bjc million retention had to be set and that columbia reserve of million was neither proper nor reasonable.she also outlined various considerations that she said would tend to lessen bjc potential losses on the claim.she also stated that columbia had never expressed concerns about her reserving practices.bjc also presented testimony that after a claims audit in august,the general consensus was that things were fine.
the district court granted columbia motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of compensatory damages as it pertained to the million price quoted by zurich,as well as columbia motion to strike bjc prayer for punitive damages.the district court also granted columbia motion to exclude evidence pertaining to columbia financial and human resources practices and goals.this evidence included testimony suggesting that columbia sought to shed or increase premiums for medical malpractice insurance clients.following the presentation of bjc case,the district court granted columbia motion for judgment as a matter of law.
in granting a judgment as a matter of law against bjc,the district court concluded that,under the contract,columbia had the right to determine incurred loss and that bjc had offered no evidence that columbia incurred loss determination was made in bad faith.
we turn first to bjc claim that judgment as a matter of law against bjc was improper because the incurred loss condition is a condition subsequent.bjc contends that because the incurred loss condition is a condition subsequent,it was bore the burden of presenting evidence pertaining to incurred loss.in other words,bjc argues that incurred loss was not an element of its case and thus any infirmities in bjc evidence could not serve as a proper basis for a judgment as a matter of law against it.
courts should not construe contract provisions to be conditions precedent unless required to do so by plain,unambiguous language or by necessary implication.james brady,eno,cir quoting kansas city ry.francisco ry,internal quotation marks omitted.here,the contract language does not plainly indicate a condition precedent.in fact,the language suggests that the incurred loss condition is a condition subsequent accordingly,we agree with bjc that the incurred loss condition is a condition subsequent.we also agree that defendants typically have the burden of proving the occurrence of conditions subsequent.peabody holding,costain group plc,see also truck ins.exch.hunt,noting that if an insurer seeks to avoid coverage because of the occurrence of a condition subsequent,the insurer has the burden of proof.when the contractual provision in question reposes discretion in the defendant,however,the plaintiff must show that this discretion was exercised in bad faith.see brozo oracle,cir judgment as a matter of law was warranted where contract accorded discretion to the defendant and there was no allegation that the discretion was exercised in bad faith.
in this case,the contract allocated to columbia the right to determine incurred loss.the contract specifies that columbia would utilize a subdivision of columbia,cna healthpro claim consultants cna,f or the purposes of determining incurred losses.exhibit.this amounts to a grant of discretion because,as the evidence indicates,the determination of incurred loss is not an exact science and requires actuaries to exercise a certain measure of actuarial judgment.although one could debate the scope of columbia discretion,we will assume that columbia had broad discretion in determining incurred loss 
any latitude columbia might have had under the contract,however,was constrained by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that missouri law finds implicit in every contract.farmers,missouri dep t of,missouri law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract.this good faith requirement extends to the manner in which a party employs discretion conferred by a contract.consol.health care plan cmty.health plan.to establish a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,it is not enough for a plaintiff to show that a party invested with discretion made an erroneous decision.id.at.instead,the plaintiff must show that the party exercised its discretion in such a manner as to evade the spirit of the transaction or so as to deny the other party the expected benefit of the contract.id.at.the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not establish a general reasonableness requirement.schell lifemark hospitals of missouri.unreasonableness can serve only as evidence of subjective intent to undermine fulfillment of the contract.id.at.
to establish a submissible case of bad faith,then,bjc was required to do more than offer evidence that columbia incurred loss determination was flawed or unreasonable.instead,bjc had to present evidence that columbia determination of incurred loss was directed toward evading the spirit of the contract or denying bjc the benefit of its bargain.in this case,the benefit for which bjc bargained was three years of reinsurance coverage guaranteed at a fixed premium.accordingly,it would have been bad faith,for example,for columbia to have selected a particular method for calculating incurred loss or to have made other judgments in the process of determining incurred loss that were specifically designed to trigger a contractual provision enabling columbia to avoid its obligation.this appears to be the theory advanced by bjc.
columbia contends that it is not bad faith for a party to act on the basis of financial.financial,however,will not excuse a party from performing its contractual obligations in good faith and fair dealing.see venture associates zenith data,cir noting in a case where the parties contracted to negotiate a final agreement that although it would not be bad faith for a party to act in its financial and demand a higher price,it would constitute bad faith if the party purpose in demanding a higher price is to scuttle the deal.we have observed that the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing does not extend so far as to undermine a party general right to act on its own interests in a way that may incidentally lessen the other party anticipated fruits from the contract.countrywide services sia ins,cir quoting security galesi,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the operative word in that passage,for purposes of this case,is incidentally.it would not necessarily constitute bad faith,for instance,for columbia to employ a method of calculating incurred loss that might have the incidental consequence of triggering the incurred loss condition.as john pierce wrote in his report,the incurred loss provision functions as a kind of escape clause in the unusual event that the results on the bjc excess policy prove to be much worse than expected.exhibit.a certain measure of caution,then,would be consistent with the bargain struck by the parties and not constitute an act of bad faith,even if it incidentally resulted in the calculation of a higher incurred loss ratio.it would not,however,be permissible for columbia to exercise its discretion in a manner designed to scuttle the deal,venture associates,at,however much in columbia best financial interest it might have been to reduce its profile in the area of medical malpractice insurance and shed clients in that line.
because columbia broader business motivations and goals bear on how and for what purposes columbia employed its discretion,evidence that columbia was seeking to shed medical malpractice clients like bjc was relevant to the question of good faith.in excluding this evidence,the district court remarked that the relevant issue was whether columbia breached the contract and not the alleged reasons,good or bad,it might have done so.the excluded evidence relates to the question of columbia good faith,however,and thus is relevant to the question whether the contract was breached.the extent to which the excluded evidence should be admitted is a matter to be evaluated pursuant to.and.
columbia claims that the incurred loss ratio was breached with respect to both aggregate claims and a single claim the baby c claim.bjc evidence of bad faith as it pertains to the aggregate claims centers primarily on the actuarial analysis conducted by columbia.considered as a whole,the evidence permits an inference that the purpose of the analysis was to reach a desired and predetermined conclusion,that the incurred loss ratio had exceeded.there was testimony that columbia unreasonably selected the same average experience ratio in all three versions of the actuarial analysis despite the fact that the underlying numbers were changing.this evidence,if credited,could indicate that the actual data were not as important to columbia as arriving at a particular conclusion.bjc also presented evidence of errors in the various versions of the actuarial analysis,most of which worked in columbia favor.in addition,columbia appeared largely incapable of explaining how it made a crucial transition between accident year and report year data and was unable to produce certain records.bjc also put on evidence from which a jury could infer that the actuarial assumptions and models it had used to evaluate the third policy year of the bjc account were more stringent than those it utilized in the previous policy years.finally,there was the excluded evidence that indicated that columbia was seeking to redu
