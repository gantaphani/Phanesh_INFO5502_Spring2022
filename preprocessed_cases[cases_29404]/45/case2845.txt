scope of review 
we review a general demurrer under principles.the appeal presents the question of law whether the complaint,liberally construed,contains facts sufficient to entitle plaintiff to any relief.we assume the truth of all material facts properly pleaded in the complaint unless they are contradicted by facts judicially noticed,but no such credit is given to pleaded contentions or legal conclusions.financial of america wilburn d.
insurance contract interpretation 
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citations.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation,national union fire ins.cal th,d.
ambiguity exists when an insurance policy provision is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citations.the fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous.citations.nor does d isagreement concerning the meaning of a phrase,or the fact that a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more than one meaning.citation.l anguage in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.citation,supra,cal th at,d.

factual background 
plaintiffs owned commercial real property that they leased to tenants.in,the california water quality control board board ordered them to test the property for pollutants after it concluded that they were suspected dischargers of pollutants causing damage to soil and groundwater in the vicinity of the property.plaintiffs notified defendants of the board order and claimed insurance coverage for the costs to respond.defendants denied coverage.plaintiffs paid a consulting firm approximately to comply with the order.in,the board closed its investigation without taking further action after essentially concluding that plaintiffs property was not the source of the pollution.plaintiffs filed this action in.they basically allege that coverage existed and seek reimbursement for the response costs.
legal background 
t he standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy was developed in.citations.over the years that have followed,it has periodically been revised,appearing in various versions.citations.it had its name changed to the standard commercial general liability insurance policy in.certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d,powerine i.
cgl policies generally indemnify the insured for all sums the insured shall be obligated to pay by reason of liability for property damage as defined.fmc plaisted companies th,d.the supreme court has established as general propositions that contamination of the environment is property damage and,in essence,that amounts the insured is required to pay to reimburse government agencies and to comply with government orders under statutes such as the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla et and similar statutes,once hazardous wastes have been released,are sums the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability for property damage.ibid.
in,at issue was the language in the cgl policy establishing the duty to defend.the policy in the case stated,the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.taking a literal approach to interpreting the meaning of the word suit in the clause,the court concluded suit was not ambiguous and denoted only a court proceeding initiated by the filing of a complaint.id.at,d.based on this policy language,the court held that the insurer duty to defend the insured in a suit was limited to a civil action prosecuted in a court it did not extend to an order issued by an administrative agency under an environmental statute.under the policies in,an insurer was required to defend a suit,but had discretion to investigate and settle a claim.id.at,d.noting the juxtaposition,the court explained that an administrative proceeding under environmental statutes does not constitute a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather implicates a claim.id.at,d.
was intended to create a rule that,by clearly delineating the scope of risk,reduce d the need for future litigation,by avoiding the determination whether each new and different letter presenting the claim of an administrative agency is to be deemed the functional equivalent of a suit brought in a court of law.citation,supra,cal th at,d.among the distinctions established by the supreme court in was the contrast between,on the one hand,a suit,a civil action in a court commenced by a complaint,and on the other hand a claim,which can be initiated by an administrative proceeding.id.at,d.
powerine i involved interpretation of the word damages in the indemnification provision of primary cgl policies issued to the plaintiff by the defendants.while addressed the scope of the duty to defend,powerine i considered the reach of the duty to indemnify.
specifically limiting its analysis to the standard cgl policy powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,the court in powerine i held that the insurer duty to indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages under the standard cgl insurance policy is limited to money ordered by a court.id.at,d.
this holding flowed directly from the syllogism powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,which states the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.the duty to defend is not broad enough to extend beyond a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court,but rather is limited thereto.a fortiori,the duty to indemnify is not broad enough to extend beyond damages,money ordered by a court,but rather is limited thereto.id.at,d.
the powerine i court further explained that the term damages in its full context and in its ordinary and popular sense is limited to money ordered by a court because the provision that imposes the duty to defend links damages to a suit,a civil action prosecuted in a court powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,and because in both the legal and the broader culture,damages exist traditionally inside of court.id.at,d.that is,the court elucidated,d amages do not constitute a redundancy to a sum that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay,but a limitation thereof.id.at,d.this limitation,the court reasoned,commends itself to society generally as laying down a rule,having a tendency to promote fairness and efficiency in the judicial sphere.id.at,d.
in reaching its decision,the powerine i court distinguished between the word damages,present in the cgl policy,and the term expenses,ordered by an administrative agency,which latter word did not appear in the analyzed indemnity provision.the duty to indemnify for damages in the primary policies,the supreme court stated,did not extend to any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental,here,proceedings conducted before the regional water boards powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the reason,the court explained,is that expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute,whether for the cleanup of a contaminated site and the abatement of the contamination effects or otherwise,do not constitute money ordered by a court.id.at,d,italics added.
read together,and powerine i stand for the proposition that the duty to defend a suit seeking damages under cgl policies is restricted to civil actions prosecuted in a court,initiated by the filing of a complaint,and does not include claims,which can denote proceedings conducted by administrative agencies under environmental statutes.likewise,the duty to indemnify for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,italics added in the same standard primary policies is limited to money ordered by a court,and does not include expenses such as may be incurred in responding to administrative agency orders.
in,the standard insurance form was amended to define suit as a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged.suit includes an arbitration proceeding alleging such damages to which you must submit or submit with our consent.citations.since then,this definition has been refined.moreover,policies issued after generally include an absolute pollution exclusion,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
discussion 
the relevant insurance policies are attached to the third amended complaint and are standard form cgl policies.
tig primary policy 
the tig primary policy covers plaintiffs for sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage.it obligates tig to defend any suit seeking those damages.it defines suit as a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged.suit includes an arbitration proceeding alleging such damages and the policy excludes coverage for injury or damage arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants at or from owned,rented,or occupied premises,and loss,cost,or expense arising out of any governmental direction or request that you test for,monitor,clean up,remove,contain,treat,detoxify or neutralize pollutants.
plaintiffs urge that and powerine i do not govern this policy because it incorporates the modifications to the standard cgl policy.they emphasize that the form now defines suit as being a civil proceeding including arbitrations.they reason that this definition expands the definition of suit to encompass administrative proceedings.they reach this conclusion as follows.
first,the form dropped the language differentiating between suits and claims,which formed the basis for the conclusion that the insurers intended to defend only lawsuits and pay claims in their discretion.and second,the form adds the pollution exclusion,which specifically excludes some,but not all,losses arising out of governmental requests or direction to test for,monitor,or clean up pollution.as to this point,plaintiffs urge that there would be no need to exclude certain governmental requests if governmental requests were not civil proceedings in the first instance.they bolster this point by citing aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu,where the court held that response costs the cost of reimbursing government agencies and complying with injunctions ordering a cleanup constituted damages under cgl policies,damages being a hallmark of a civil proceeding 
plaintiffs fallback position is that the definition of civil proceeding is at least ambiguous and can be reasonably construed to encompass administrative proceedings,thereby making resolution of the question improper via demurrer.
we need not address this issue because,even if we agreed with plaintiffs,the pollution exclusion precludes coverage 
the pollution exclusion at issue here is known as an absolute pollution exclusion.legarra federated mutual ins.th,d.section i,coverage a,paragraph f of the policy clearly states that the insurance does not apply to any loss,cost,or expense arising out of any governmental direction or request that you test for pollutants.there can be no question that the board ordered plaintiffs to test for pollutants and plaintiffs seek reimbursement for the costs incurred to make the tests.
plaintiffs make no convincing argument that the costs for which they seek reimbursement were not costs within the meaning of paragraph f.as alluded to earlier,plaintiffs urge that the pollution exclusion excludes some,but not all,losses arising out of governmental requests or direction.they apparently rely on the trial court conclusion that the provision did not exclude the cost of responding to or assessing the effects of pollutants.they state that a plain reading of the pollution exclusion does not include such activities as performing a site assessment and ascertaining potential sources of the contamination,including a determination of the relative risks and benefits of alternative responses,including doing nothing.
plaintiffs are correct about what the exclusion does not say,but the point does not avail them.this follows because the language of the exclusion is and any loss,cost,or expense arising out of any governmental direction or request 
travelers umbrella policy 
the central insuring clause in the travelers umbrella policy covers plaintiffs for the ultimate net loss in excess of the applicable underlying limit which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages.the policy later defines ultimate net loss as the sum actually paid or payable in cash in the settlement or satisfaction of any claim or suit for which the insured is liable either by adjudication or settlement with the written consent of the company.
plaintiffs urge that and powerine i do not govern this policy because the policy indemnifies for ultimate net loss,which broadens the coverage beyond damages.they point out that ultimate net loss includes all expenses incurred by the insured in the investigation and defense of claims or suits seeking damages.they reason that the implication of the definition is twofold that under this policy,as compared with the policies at issue in the powerine i decision,it was specifically contemplated that there could be claims for damages not merely lawsuits and that the insurer would indemnify the insured for expenses incurred in connection with such claims,provided the claims sought damages potentially covered by the policy.original underscoring.they conclude that so long as the response costs amount to damages compensation for harm suffered under aiu and are not prophylactic these umbrella policies must provide coverage.
travelers poses that plaintiffs read the policies out of context.it points out that the coverage clause indemnifies for damages,which,under powerine i,means a loss pay ultimate net loss for damages.it urges that an analysis of the clause is therefore unnecessary.
plaintiffs counter that it is reasonable to conclude that the insurer not only agrees to indemnify for expenses incurred in defense of claims seeking damages,but also to indemnify for the sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages interpreted in light of the fact that claims can seek damages under the definition of ultimate net loss whether or not the claim resolves in judgment or insurer approved settlement.plaintiffs bolster this point by referring to the clause,which provides for two ways in which an insured can make an indemnity claim under the policy,including one that does not require a judgment or settlement.this provision states the company liability under this policy for ultimate net loss with respect to any occurrence shall not attach until the amount of the underlying limit has been paid by or on behalf of the insured on account of such occurrence.the insured shall make claim for any loss under this policy as soon as practicable after the insured obligation to pay such amounts shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured,the claimant and the company.
we agree with travelers.
the coverage clause imposing the duty to indemnify is clear in its limitation to damages.it states the company will pay the ultimate net loss which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d,in its language,especially damages,the provision imposing the duty to indemnify is clear in its limitation to money ordered by a court.
we disagree with plaintiffs that the phrase ultimate net loss in the coverage clause expands the definition of damages when the definition clause is taken into consideration.the phrase in the coverage clause is used in reference to what amount the insurer will pay after the insurer becomes obligated to pay rather than as a trigger of the insurer obligation to pay.in other words,the coverage clause reads that the insurer will pay ultimate net loss when that loss ripens into damages.it is unreasonable to interpret the clause to read that the insurer will pay an ultimate net loss when the insured incurs an expense that is defined as an ultimate net loss because such an interpretation ignores the for damages qualifier in the coverage clause,and implicit meaning of ultimate in ultimate net loss,which suggests finality and,in context with the for damages qualifier.
it is not at all incongruous for the policy via the use of ultimate net loss in the coverage clause and the definition clause to contemplate indemnity for expenses while limiting such indemnity to expenses included in a judgment or settlement.this concept was mentioned in passing in aiu,supra,cal d,as noted in powerine i.in aiu,we held to the effect that the duty to indemnify may embrace all money ordered by a court,including money that the insured must give under law as compensation to third parties and also money that the insured must itself expend in equity in order to provide relief of the same sort.citation.we did not hold that the duty extends to any money in addition to that ordered by a any expenses required by an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.indeed,we did not even consider the issue.powerine i,supra,cal th at,d.
we decline to consider whether the coverage clause might be construed in the way plaintiffs urge when the clause is taken into consideration.a loss payable provision is a condition of coverage,not a limitation thereof,and can not be read to limit or expand the coverage obligation.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,as a general rule,conditions neither confer nor exclude coverage.
our analysis is consistent with powerine ii and ace.
in powerine ii,the umbrella policies central insuring clauses indemnified for damages,direct or consequential and expenses,all as more fully defined by the term ultimate net loss.powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d.the policies then defined ultimate net loss as the total sum which the insured,or any company as his insurer,or both,become obligated to pay either through adjudication or compromise,and shall also include all sums paid for litigation,settlement,adjustment and investigation of claims and suits.id.at,d.
in concluding that the literal wording of the insuring clauses extended indemnity coverage to response costs,the court pointed out that the term expenses was expressly contained in the central insurance clauses powerine ii,supra,cal th at,d,and the central insuring clauses expressly purported to more fully define damages,direct or consequential and expenses ibid.by incorporating the definition of ultimate net loss id.at,d.
in ace,the umbrella policy central insuring clause indemnified for all sums which the insured is obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed under contract or agreement for damages.ace,supra,cal th at,d.its limits of liability provision then stated that liability under the policy would attach only after the insured had paid or become liable for the ultimate net loss,defined,in turn,as the sum or sums which the assured shall become legally obligated to pay in settlement or satisfaction of claims,suits or judgements includ ing all expenses from the investigation,negotiation and settlement of claims and shall include legal costs.id.at,d.
in concluding that the literal wording of the insuring clause limited indemnity coverage to damages as defined in powerine i,supra,cal th,d,the court pointed out that the term expenses was not used in the central insuring clause ace,supra,cal th at,d,and the term ultimate net loss was neither incorporated into,referenced,nor a part of the central insuring clause id.at,d.as to this latter distinction,the court observed that the definition of ultimate net loss merely serves to define the insured total loss that will count toward the policy limits.ibid.nothing in the limits of liability provision of the ace policy purports to expand ace indemnification obligation,once triggered,to anything other than damages.ibid.
here,the central insuring clause does not use the term expenses and it expressly indemnifies for damages.though the central insuring clause uses the term ultimate net loss,the phrase is not used to broaden the coverage beyond that provided by the word,damages.as we have pointed out,the phrase is used in reference to what amount the insurer will pay after the insurer becomes obligated to pay rather than as a trigger of the insurer obligation to pay.nothing in the central insuring clause of traveler policy purports to expand traveler indemnification obligation beyond damages.
in sum,the insuring language of the standard cgl policy discussed in powerine i and the insuring clause of traveler umbrella liability policy are substantively the same.the central insuring provision in traveler policy,like the policy considered in powerine i,contains only the damages limitation standing alone,makes no express reference to expenses,and does not purport to further define the scope of indemnity coverage set forth in the insuring provision by reference to the definition of ultimate net loss,as was the case with the nine policies scrutinized in powerine ii.ace,supra,cal th at,d.powerine i definition of damages therefore controls.
we do not ignore the fact that plaintiffs payment of the response costs in this case might have obviated the necessity of a lawsuit or settlement and plaintiff concomitant ability to obtain insurance reimbursement.but i n arriving at our conclusion,we decline to rewrite the provision imposing the duty to indemnify in order to remove its limitation to money ordered by a court.we will not do so for the insured itself,in order to shift to the insurer some or all of the potentially substantial costs that might be imposed on the insured as the outcome of a proceeding conducted before an administrative agency pursuant to an environmental statute.neither will we do so
