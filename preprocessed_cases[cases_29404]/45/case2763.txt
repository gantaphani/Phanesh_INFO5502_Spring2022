is an insurance company in an uninsured motorist arbitration subject to the penalties provided in code of civil procedure section and civil code section based on its refusal to accept a section settlement demand within its policy limits when compensatory damages awarded in the arbitration meet or exceed its policy limits yes.the explicit language of section applies to arbitrations and the strong public policy of this state of encouraging the making and acceptance of reasonable settlement offers requires us to conclude that an insurance company is liable for section costs even when,added to the judgment for compensatory damages,the total exceeds the policy limits.we shall reverse the trial court order denying plaintiff isofea pilimai his costs in this case.we shall also order that the trial court add prejudgment interest to the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on february,pilimai sustained injuries in an automobile accident with an uninsured driver.he filed a petition to compel arbitration with farmers insurance exchange company farmers,his insurance carrier,under the uninsured motorist provisions of his insurance policy.the policy limit for uninsured motorist coverage in pilimai policy was.
on march,prior to the arbitration,pilimai served a section settlement demand on farmers offering to settle the case for.
the arbitration was held in october and november of.on november,the arbitrator served the arbitration award.the arbitrator found pilimai was entitled to recover damages in the amount of.the arbitrator entered an award in that amount less the credit that farmers is entitled to,or the amount of the uninsured motorist policy limits which will have to be proven by declaration of the court upon a petition to confirm this arbitration award.the arbitration award was silent on the subject of costs and prejudgment interest.
both pilimai and farmers timely filed petitions to confirm the award as a judgment in the trial court.only farmers,however,set its petition for a hearing.in farmers petition,it sought to obtain a judgment for based on its policy limit less the credit it was entitled under the policy.
in pilimai petition and in his opposition to farmers petition,pilimai sought a judgment in the same amount,plus costs and prejudgment interest.pilimai claimed he was entitled to recover his costs of suit and prejudgment interest based on section and civil code section.his memorandum of costs sought in costs and in prejudgment interest.
the trial court concluded that farmers petition was the only one properly before it because pilimai never set his petition for a hearing.the court further found that neither party sought to correct or vacate the award made by the arbitrator.as a result,the court entered judgment in the amount of.the trial court concluded that absent the insurance policy,pilimai would be entitled to recover his costs and prejudgment interest under section and civil code section.however,the court concluded that because an award of costs and prejudgment interest would exceed the limit of the insurance policy,pilimai was not entitled to recover costs or prejudgment interest.
farmers served notice of judgment on pilimai on june.pilimai filed his timely notice of appeal on july.this is an appealable judgment,subd.a.
discussion 
ithe lack of an affirmative pleading requesting costs does not bar the award of costs 
farmers contends the court was powerless to award costs and prejudgment interest in this case because the only pleading properly before the court was its petition to confirm the award and it did not affirmatively ask for costs.we reject this argument.
farmers petition prayed for a judgment confirming the award in the amount of and f or such other and further relief as the court may deem proper.an award of prejudgment interest fits within the petition description of further relief as the trial court deemed just and proper.newby vroman th,d.it follows logically that an award of statutorily allowable costs also properly flows from this request.further,pilimai requested an award of costs and prejudgment interest in his response to farmers petition.this was sufficient to present the issue to the court.
more fundamentally,however,there is no legal requirement that a party affirmatively plead entitlement to costs or prejudgment interest to be able to recover them.the statute that sets forth the requisite allegations for a petition to confirm an arbitration award is silent on the issue of costs and interest a petition under this chapter shall a set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.b set forth the names of the arbitrators.c set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators,if any.thus,there is no statutory requirement to affirmatively plead entitlement to costs or interest.
moreover,t he awarding of costs is but an incident to the judgment citations.accordingly,costs follow as a matter of course unless the court for good reason should decree otherwise.citation.no further judicial action is required after an award of costs is made.the requirement is imposed upon the party who is entitled to costs that he file a memorandum of the items of his costs and disbursements and if he fails to do so he is deemed to have waived the costs accruing in his favor.oak grove school dist.city title ins.d,fn.omitted.as to prejudgment interest,i t has been long settled that,in a contested action,prejudgment interest may be awarded even though the complaint contains no prayer for interest.newby vroman,supra,th at,d.
pilimai is entitled to recover his costs under section and prejudgment interest under civil code section 
pilimai argues that the trial court erred in refusing to award him his section costs and prejudgment interest.we agree.
standard of review 
because there are no disputed facts in this case,and our analysis turns on the legal question of the interpretation of section and civil code section and their application to this contractual arbitration,our review is de novo.mesa forest products,paul mercury ins.th,d.
section and civil code section 
section provides,in relevant part,a the costs allowed under sections and shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section.b not less than days prior to commencement of trial or arbitration as provided in section or of a dispute to be resolved by arbitration,any party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time.d if an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action,the court or arbitrator,in its discretion,may require the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses,who are not regular employees of any party,actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either,or both,preparation for trial or arbitration,or during trial or arbitration,of the case by the plaintiff,in addition to plaintiff costs.by its terms,section specifically does not apply to eminent domain actions,enforcement actions taken by various public entities,and labor arbitrations,subds.g,i.the statute does not exclude uninsured motorist arbitrations.from the specific inclusion of arbitration in the text of subdivisions b and d of section and the statute failure to exclude uninsured motorist arbitrations,we conclude this section applies to this uninsured motorist arbitration.
to further the purposes of section,civil code section provides,in part,if the plaintiff makes an offer pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure which the defendant does not accept and the plaintiff obtains a more favorable judgment,the judgment shall bear interest at the legal rate of percent per annum calculated from the date of the plaintiff first offer pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure which is exceeded by the judgment,and interest shall accrue until the satisfaction of judgment.
the purpose of civil code section and section is to encourage settlement by providing a strong financial disincentive to a it be a plaintiff or a fails to achieve a better result than that party could have achieved by accepting his or her opponent settlement offer.mesa forest products,paul mercury ins,supra,th at,d steinfeld proctologic medical group,th,d.the net effect of these sections is to entice parties to make reasonable settlement offers by offering them the carrot of shifting the burden of costs and prejudgment interest to the other side,and further to discourage the rejection of those offers with the stick of requiring a party who rejects such an offer to pay costs and interest.scott blount,cal th,d.in this way,the statutes seek to ease court congestion and free up scarce judicial resources.wilson stores,th,d.
section applies to arbitrations generally.in caro smith th,d,the court concluded that a plaintiff who recovered more than his section offer was entitled to recover both his court costs under section and prejudgment interest under civil code section on the entry of the arbitration award as a judgment.similarly,in weinberg safeco ins.of america th,d,the court concluded that civil code section prejudgment interest could be properly awarded in an arbitration.
as the trial court correctly concluded here,pilimai extended a valid section demand for and farmers did not accept it.pilimai recovered in the arbitration against the sum far in excess of his demand.thus,under those statutes,standing alone,pilimai was entitled to recover both his costs and prejudgment interest.
we now turn to the trial court restriction of the judgment to the policy limits.
the policy language 
farmers argues neither the arbitrator nor the court had the power to award any costs under the relevant terms of the insurance policy much less award them above the policy limits.we disagree.
the policy provides that farmers will pay all sums which an insured person or such other person as permitted under the law is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury actually sustained by the insured person both parties agree the relevant policy limit is.the policy further provides that in the event the parties are unable to agree that the uninsured driver would be liable to the insured,or on the amount of payment due,the matter is to be determined by arbitration.the policy defined the job of the arbitrator as follows t he arbitrator shall determine the existence of the operator of an uninsured motor vehicle,that the insured person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle,and the amount of payment under this part as determined by this policy or any other applicable policy.
on the subject of the procedures for the arbitration,the policy states arbitration will take place in the county where the insured person lives.local court rules governing procedure and evidence will apply.the decision in writing of the arbitrator will be binding subject to terms of this insurance.further,the policy recites,the expense of the arbitrator and all other expenses of arbitration will be shared equally.attorneys fees and fees paid for the witnesses are not expenses of arbitration and will be paid by the party incurring them.
these policy provisions must be read in conjunction with existing statutes.the interpretation of the language in an insurance policy is a question of law.in resolving such a question courts look first to the plain meaning of the disputed term to ascertain the mutual intention of the parties.citation.as a general rule of construction,the parties are presumed to know and to have had in mind all applicable laws extant when an agreement is made.these existing laws are considered part of the contract just as if they were expressly referred to and incorporated.miracle auto center superior court th,d.
as a result of this general rule that applicable statutes are considered part of the contract,we conclude the parties had section and civil code section their respective mind when they entered into this contract.consequently,those two statutory provisions must therefore constitute part of this contract unless the contract expressly excluded them 
nothing in the insurance policy explicitly waives the protections of section and civil code section.the policy definition of the duties of the arbitrator is not inconsistent with the power of the arbitrator or the court upon entry of judgment to award the prevailing party costs or prejudgment interest in the circumstances defined under section and civil code section.these items of costs and prejudgment interest are incidental to the underlying judgment,not a part of the substantive damage award.oak grove school dist.city title ins,supra,d at.steinfeld proctologic medical group,supra,th at,d.
further,the clause of the insurance contract that references the expenses of the arbitrator,attorney fees,witness fees,and other expenses of the arbitration does not expressly exclude the application of section and civil code section.given that the parties are deemed to have made this contract with those provisions in mind and to have incorporated them into their contractual documents,they must apply here.the statutes thus empowered the arbitrator or the trial court to award costs and prejudgment interest 
the parties contractual allocations of costs between themselves are often affected by section.for example,in scott,the parties entered into a construction contract that contained a unilateral attorney fees provision in favor of defendant blount.scott blount,supra,cal th at,d.during the litigation,defendant blount served a section offer of settlement of,which the plaintiff rejected.scott,at,d.after trial,the plaintiff recovered in damages.ibid.our supreme court concluded civil code section converted the express contractual unilateral attorney fees provision of the contract into a bilateral provision allowing attorney fees to the prevailing party scott scott,at,d.while plaintiff scott was the prevailing party in the action,the court concluded that the rejected section offer operated on this same attorney fees clause to cut off scott right to attorney fees as of the date of the offer.scott,at,d.more importantly,despite the fact that scott was the prevailing party in the sense that it had a net monetary recovery,the court held section required scott to pay the defendant postoffer attorney fees because it rejected the reasonable section offer and failed to obtain a larger damages award.scott,at,d.
similarly here,the insurance contract between the parties is subject to the provisions contained in section and the prejudgment interest provision of civil code section.those statutes act on the contractual language restricting the arbitrator fees and expenses and shift those expenses to farmers to serve the compelling public policies of promoting the making and acceptance of reasonable settlement offers,and the corresponding reduction of the draw on the judicial system scarce resources.thus,these statutes properly provided the court or the arbitrator the basis to award costs and prejudgment interest.
insurance code section 
farmers also argues insurance code section,subdivision p defines its maximum liability in this case as the policy limits.because the damage award,plus costs and interest,exceed that limit,farmers claims pilimai may not recover costs or prejudgment interest against it.we disagree.
insurance code section,subdivision p provides,when bodily injury is caused by one or more motor vehicles,whether insured,underinsured,or uninsured,the maximum liability of the insurer providing the underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured underinsured motorist coverage limits,less the amount paid to the insured by or for any person or organization that may be held legally liable for the injury.
the maximum liability of farmers under this provision refers to the compensatory damages recoverable by pilimai,not the costs of the proceedings or prejudgment interest that arise directly from its status as a litigant in
