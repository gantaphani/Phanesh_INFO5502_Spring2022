six flags,appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of seven of its property insurers.the parties primarily contest whether a sublimit in the relevant insurance policies that applies as respects flood limits the insurers liability for loss and damage at six flags new orleans theme park that resulted from flooding associated with hurricane katrina.the district court held that the sublimit applies to the flood loss and granted partial summary judgment for the insurers.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
factual and procedural background 
six flags,brings this suit against westchester surplus lines insurance westchester arch specialty insurance arch great lakes reinsurance uk plc great lakes commonwealth insurance commonwealth axis specialty insurance axis continental casualty continental and liberty corporate capital,liberty collectively,the excess insurers.six flags asserts that the excess insurers insured it against loss that hurricane flooding caused to its new orleans theme park.
six flags obtained,property insurance for its domestic theme parks for the period of june,to november.six flags agent,marsh,generated and submitted broker manuscript forms requesting specific types of coverage,clauses,and terms to various insurers.marsh placed insurance contracts with the excess insurers and other insurance companies that resulted in policies totaling million in combined limits for all insured losses.the policies provided four distinct layers of coverage a primary layer with million in limits a first excess layer with million in limits a second excess layer with million in limits and a third excess layer with million in limits six flags paid an annual premium of for this coverage.
the excess insurers sold policies to six flags the excess policies covering all risks within the first and second excess million to million only layers at issue in this case the excess policies contain a number of clauses that are relevant to this appeal.they insure against all risks subject to certain limits and deductibles.one such sublimit is applicable to all loss or damage per occurrence and in the term aggregate as respects flood at any location in a flood zone a or v as designated by the federal emergency management agency the flood sublimit the excess policies also contain deductibles,including separate deductibles for the perils of flood and of a named storm 
most of the excess policies define flood as 
a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from 
a the overflow of inland or tidal waters 
b the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source or 
the release of water impounded by a dam 
water that backs up or flows from a sewer,drain or sump 
loss or damage caused by flood shall include all covered loss or damage to covered property resulting directly or indirectly from flood,except loss or damage from resulting fire,explosion and sprinkler leakage or loss or damage otherwise excluded by this policy.
the commonwealth policy,however,contains an endorsement the commonwealth flood definition endorsement that replaces the definition of flood with the following statement 
the term flood is defined as loss or damage caused by waves,tidal water or tidal wave,overflow of streams or other bodies of water,or spray from any of the foregoing,all whether driven by wind or not.loss resulting from,contributed to or aggravated by a flood caused by a peril not otherwise excluded under this policy shall not be considered in application of the policy flood limit or deductible provisions.
finally,the policies lump together loss within a window resulting from a single event into an occurrence for adjusting,for application of sublimits and deductibles.relevant to this appeal,the policies define a weather cat occurrence as follows 
all loss or damage occurring during a period of hours which is caused by or results from a storm or weather disturbance which is named by the national weather service or any other recognized meteorological authority.
storm or weather disturbance includes all weather phenomenon associated with or occurring in conjunction with the storm or weather disturbance,including,but not limited to flood,wind,hail,sleet,tornadoes,hurricane or lightning.
the excess policies were effective on august,when hurricane katrina,a storm named by the national weather service,struck the gulf coast.hurricane katrina caused heavy damage to and interrupted the operations of the six flags new orleans theme park located at lake forest boulevard,new orleans,louisiana.flooding lasting several weeks caused much of the damage to the theme park,although high winds also contributed.six flags new orleans sits within a federal emergency management agency designated flood zone 
six flags submitted losses totaling million to its insurers.six flags insurers,including iri,paid million,exhausting that layer of coverage.the excess insurers adjustor,however,capped their liability at million pursuant to the flood sublimit.the excess insurers paid six flags that million plus compensation for certain losses resulting from wind damage.
after unsuccessfully protesting the applicability of the flood sublimit,six flags filed the present lawsuit in the district court.it sought a declaratory judgment that the flood sublimit did not apply to its hurricane losses and claimed that the excess insurers breached the excess policies by applying the flood sublimit to damage covered by the separate peril of a named storm.the excess insurers filed motions for partial summary judgment pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which six flags opposed.six flags also requested the opportunity to engage in additional discovery pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the district court granted the excess insurers motions for partial summary judgment and denied six flags discovery request.the district court concluded that the flood sublimit is unambiguous it specifically limit s recovery for flood in zone a or v to its respective dollar value per occurrence.six flags westchester surplus lines ins,d.the court emphasized that flood includes all loss of damage resulting from flood,and makes only very limited exceptions to this definition nowhere in the term flood or its exceptions is a named storm or waters resulting from a named storm specifically excluded.id.at.moreover,the district court determined that the weather cat occurrence provision does not,as six flags argued,exclude the applicability of the flood sublimit.it instead defines what that occurrence is and lumps all losses or damages occurring within a period of time into one covered loss for adjustment purposes.id.at.the district court thus held that losses from flood that are part of a weather cat occurrence remain subject to the flood sublimit.
because the excess policies were unambiguous,the district court declined to review extrinsic evidence that six flags presented showing that the insurers did not intend the flood sublimit to apply to storm loss and therefore denied six flags rule f motion.on april,the court entered final judgment for the excess insurers six flags now appeals.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.the court reviews de novo the district court award of summary judgment.see in re katrina canal breaches,cir.the judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the court view s all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw s all reasonable inferences in that party favor.in re katrina canal breaches,at.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.id.at quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
contract interpretation 
the parties agree that louisiana law governs their dispute.to determine louisiana law,we look to the final decisions of the louisiana supreme court.id.in the absence of such a decision,we must make an erie guess and determine,in our best judgment,how that court would resolve the issue if presented with the same case.id.in making an erie guess,we must employ louisiana civilian methodology,whereby we first examine primary sources of law the constitution,codes,and statutes.id.jurisprudence,even when it rises to the level of jurisprudence constante,is a secondary law source in louisiana.id.quoting prytania park hotel,star indem,cir footnote omitted.
under louisiana law,t he written instrument,in which a contract of insurance is set forth,is the policy.ann.an insurance policy is a contract between the parties and should be construed by using the general rules of interpretation of contracts set forth in the louisiana civil code.cadwallader allstate ins,so d.the louisiana civil code provides that i nterpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties.ann.the language of the policy is the starting point for determining that common intent.elliott cont l cas,so d,doerr mobil oil,so d.the words of a contract must be given their generally prevailing meaning,and w hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences,no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties intent.ann.the words,however,are not read in isolation e very insurance contract shall be construed according to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy,and as amplified,extended,or modified by any rider,endorsement,or application attached to or made a part of the policy.ann.
a provision in an insurance contract is ambiguous if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations or if the intent of the parties can not be ascertained from the language employed.bonin westport ins,so d.however,the fact that a term is not defined in the policy itself,does not make the term ambiguous.am.deposit ins.myles,so d,accord in re katrina canal breaches,at.words susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted as having the meaning that best conforms to the object of the contract.ann.where an insurance policy includes ambiguous provisions,the a mbiguity must be resolved by construing the policy as a whole one policy provision is not to be construed separately at the expense of disregarding other policy provisions.ins.guar.ass interstate fire cas,so d,citing.ann.peterson schimek,so d.relatedly,a provision susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted with a meaning that renders it effective and not with one that renders it ineffective.ann.finally,in cases of ambiguity,t he court should construe the policy to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the parties in the light of the customs and usages of the industry.ins.guar.ass n,so d at quoting trinity,ins.of,cir.thus,a doubtful provision must be interpreted in light of the nature of the contract,equity,usages,the conduct of the parties before and after the formation of the contract,and of other contracts of a like nature between the same parties.ann.we apply these principles to the excess policies.
c.the excess policies 
excess policies other than the commonwealth policy 
the contract provisions in the excess policies have only one reasonable meaning the flood sublimit caps the liability of the excess insurers at million for all loss or damage per occurrence,including a weather cat occurrence,as respects flood.the excess policies insure against all risks of direct physical loss of or damage to covered property subject to specific exclusions not applicable in this case.within that coverage,certain limits and sublimits set the excess insurers maximum liability,generally on a per occurrence basis.the flood sublimit applies per occurrence in the term aggregate as respects flood at any location in flood zone a or the excess policies define loss from flood to include all covered loss or damage to covered property resulting directly or indirectly from inundation of normally dry land areas.the excess policies also contain deductibles that apply on a per occurrence basis.the relevant deductible in this case is of the damage for the peril of a named storm.the parties agree that named storm and weather cat are interchangeable terms.
the excess policies define occurrence in order to explain when sublimits or the deductible not to exclude the applicability of a particular sublimit.northrop grumman factory mut.ins,wl,cir,holding that a sensible reading of the primary policy suggests that the terms named windstorm and wind were defined to explain when the special named windstorm deductible would apply citing with approval the district court case at issue here the relevant definition here is that of the weather cat occurrence.a weather cat occurrence is all loss occurring during a period caused by or resulting from,inter alia,flood,wind,hail,sleet,tornadoes,hurricane,or lightning,associated with or occurring in conjunction with a storm or weather disturbance named by the national weather service.because flood is a weather phenomenon within the weather cat occurrence,the flood sublimit applies one time per such occurrence to limit loss and damage as respects that flood.it is undisputed that the six flags new orleans theme park is located in an area designated as flood zone a and that hurricane katrina was a named storm.thus,the flood sublimit applies to limit the excess insurers liability at million over the insurers million policy limit for loss or damage resulting from flooding caused by,associated with,or occurring in conjunction with hurricane katrina.
six flags,however,argues that the flood sublimit does not apply to flood loss in a weather cat occurrence because a named storm is a distinct peril not subject to the flood sublimit as noted above,the excess policies provide a deductible that applies to the peril of a named storm.the term peril has an industry usage.a peril is t he cause of a risk of loss to person or property,the cause of a risk such as fire,accident,theft,forgery,earthquake,flood,or illness.black law dictionary ed.to six flags,because a weather cat occurrence undisputedly corresponds to a named storm,it offers a shop for insuring all loss resulting from a other words,the weather cat occurrence subsumes all of the other perils defined therein and is subject only to sublimits and deductibles expressly addressed to it.while we have no doubt that the parties could have agreed to such a provision,we can not reasonably interpret the weather cat occurrence definition to have this meaning.
six flags proposed construction ignores the language of the excess policies and disregards the express purpose of defining an occurrence.to start,six flags argument fails to acknowledge that the flood sublimit applies to loss or damage per occurrence as respects flood,not per flood occurrence or as respects the peril of flood.without reference to the terms of the excess policies,six flags nonetheless asks us to inferentially foreclose the applicability of the applicable to all loss or damage flood sublimit to the all loss or damage weather cat occurrence.reviewing the provisions of the excess policies,we conclude that,to give meaning both to the definition of flood and to per occurrence in the flood sublimit,the only reasonable interpretation is that the flood sublimit applies across different types of occurrences to loss or damage that falls under the definition of flood 
in addition,six flags reading avoids recognizing that the definition of an occurrence,which groups certain losses for adjustment purposes,is distinct from the concept of a peril,which is the cause of the loss.six flags proposed construction would transform the definition of a weather cat occurrence into the definition of a named storm peril by the mention of that peril in the deductible that applies to a weather cat occurrence.we conclude that such a result would conflate the two distinct is too tenuous to provide a reasonable alternative meaning to the excess policies.see northrop grumman,at,wl,premier entm t biloxi,llc james river ins,wl,holding that a weather cat occurrence was not a separate peril because although the deductible refers to each weather cat occurrence as insured against by this policy,the weather cat occurrence is never identified as a separate peril 
finally,six flags asks us to interpret the excess policies by applying a presumption in favor of coverage.article of the louisiana civil code provides in case of doubt that can not be otherwise resolved,a provision in a contract must be interpreted against the party who furnished its text.a contract executed in a standard form of one party must be interpreted,in case of doubt,in favor of the other party.because the insurer typically furnishes the text of a policy to the insured,often on its standard form,the louisiana courts have repeatedly interpreted ambiguous provisions against the insurer and in favor of the insured.see,tunstall stierwald,so d,the insurer bears the burden of showing policy limits or exclusions.emphasis added citing.protective ass ferguson,so.interpreting a standard form insurance contract.ins.guar.ass n,so d at if after applying the other general rules of construction an ambiguity remains,the ambiguous contractual provision is to be construed against the drafter,or,as originating in the insurance context,in favor of the insured.garcia bernard parish sch,so d,equivocal provisions seeking to narrow the insurer obligation are strictly construed against the insurer,since these are prepared by the insurer and the insured has no voice in the preparation.
these presumptions,however,do not apply to the excess policies in this case.first,article and its derivative rules of construction are inapplicable to an unambiguous insurance contract.sharp fed.sav.loan ins,cir w e have already demonstrated that this contract is not ambiguous,and therefore even giving the contract a strict construction we would reach the same result.bank of lake charles am.employers ins,cir the special rules of interpretation do indeed apply only when there is an ambiguity t his is so even when the result is an apparently harsh consequence to the insured.cadwallader,so d at f or the rule of strict construction to apply,the insurance policy must be not only susceptible to two or more interpretations,but each of the alternative interpretations must be reasonable.we will not apply a presumption in favor of six flags against the clear terms only reasonable construction language of the excess policies.
second,the court has previously determined that,under louisiana law,the presumption does not apply where the insured is a sophisticated commercial entity that itself drafts or utilizes its agent to secure desired policy provisions.see mcdermott int l,lloyds underwriters of london,cir by having its agent decide upon both the slip and the policy,the insured forfeits any benefit from the policy drafter principle.sharp,at holding that where the disputed insurance contract clause was a product of a joint effort,there would be no reason to weigh our construction heavily in favor of coverage bank of lake charles,at,holding that the presumption may not be applicable here,where each party was equally responsible for the policy language see also eagle leasing hartford fire ins,cir concluding under missouri law,based on a manuscript policy attributable to both parties alike,that w e do not feel compelled to apply,or,indeed,justified in applying the general rule that an insurance policy is construed against the insurer in the commercial insurance field when the insured is not an innocent but a corporation of immense size,carrying insurance with annual premiums in six figures,managed by sophisticated business men,and represented by counsel on the same professional level as the counsel for insurers footnote omitted.but lake charles harbor terminal dist.imperial cas.indem,cir refusing to alter the presumption where the insurance broker chose the terms but received no compensation from the insured and where there was no evidence of the insured superior bargaining power.here,the summary judgment evidence,construed in favor of six flags,shows that iri provided six flags with the weather cat occurrence definition for inclusion in its primary level policy.marsh,six flags agent,in turn directed the inclusion of identical language in the excess policies.iri is not an excess insurer and not a party to this dispute.under these circumstances,we can not apply the presumption against the excess insurers,who did not draft the disputed provision,or in favor of six flags,which is undisputedly a sophisticated commercial entity that utilized marsh to secure an insurance package suitable to its unique risks.
overall,we conclude that the excess policies unambiguously establish that the flood sublimit applies to loss and damage as respects flood caused by,associated with,or occurring in conjunction with hurricane katrina.
the commonwealth policy 
six flags argues that the commonwealth flood definition endorsement evidences the excess insurers intent to prevent the applicability of the flood sublimit to loss caused by a named storm.in its only relevant departure from the other excess policies,the commonwealth flood definition endorsement replaces the language to define the term flood.it states that 
the term flood is defined as loss or damage caused by waves,tidal water or tidal wave,overflow of streams or other bodies of water,or spray from any of the foregoing,all whether driven by wind or not.loss resulting from,contributed to or aggravated by a flood caused by a peril not otherwise excluded under this policy shall not be considered in application of the policy flood limit or deductible provisions.
six flags argues that this endorsement clarifies,for the commonwealth policy as well as for the excess policies,that flood caused by the peril of a named storm is not considered in the application of the flood sublimit.the excess insurers counter that commonwealth definition of flood means only that loss caused by other perils is not subject to the flood sublimit and the inclusion of the phrase all whether driven by wind or not,which has been universally interpreted to include flooding,would be rendered ineffective.
we conclude that the commonwealth flood definition endorsement creates an ambiguity in the commonwealth policy but not the excess policies.one reasonable interpretation of the endorsement,when considered with the entire commonwealth policy,is that loss resulting from a flood caused by a peril such as a named storm is not subject to the flood sublimit.the excess insurers do not dispute that hurricane katrina was a named storm and can not at least at this time dispute that hurricane katrina caused the flooding at issue here.thus,under this interpretation,the flood sublimit would not apply to loss resulting from the flood at the six flags new orleans theme park caused by hurricane katrina.
the excess insurers counter that commonwealth was meant only to clarify that loss caused by a separate peril is not subject to the flood sublimit when that loss also resulted from flood thus,the excess insurers argue that caused by a peril modifies loss for six flags,caused by a peril modifies flood.even if this alternative interpretation is reasonable,which we do not decide at this time,the existence of two reasonable alternative interpretations would create an ambiguity in the commonwealth policy.see bonin,so d at holding that a provision in an insurance contract is ambiguous if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.while we do not conclude at this time that only one reasonable interpretation is possible,we simply hold that at least one reasonable interpretation favors coverage of the loss from hurricane katrina without application of the flood sublimit.the district court may decide in the first instance whether the excess insurers proposed alternative interpretations are reasonable 
the excess insurers also contend that our interpretation of the commonwealth policy would render ineffective the phrase all whether driven by wind or not.we have interpreted similar language to exclude coverage for flooding where the policies at issue expressly deny coverage for flooding caused or contributed to by other perils.see tuepker,at,leonard,at.the phrase,however,is not rendered ineffective here because the commonwealth policy does not comparably provide for the applicability of the flood sublimit if the flooding was caused by another peril and because the endorsement arguably dictates the opposite result as noted above,a reasonable interpretation of the policy is that water driven by wind is meaning to that provision however,if that flood is caused by another covered peril,such as a named storm,then the flood sublimit does not apply.because a reasonable reading of the commonwealth flood definition endorsement leads to the conclusion that it excludes the applicability of the flood sublimit to flood that was caused by the peril of a named this case,hurricane therefore reverse the district court order granting summary judgment to commonwealth and remand to the district court 
six flags asserts that this conclusion extends to the excess policies.in particular,it argues that the definition of flood in the excess policies should be read in light of the definition contained in the commonwealth flood definition endorsement the excess policies do not contain a provision that similarly conditions the applicability of the flood sublimit on the peril causing the flood.thus,to the extent that the commonwealth policy differs from the excess policies,six flags asks us to modify the excess policies to find an ambiguity.we decline to interpret the excess policies by reference to the commonwealth flood definition endorsement.louisiana statutory rules require that 
no agreement in conflict with,modifying,or extending the coverage of any contract of insurance shall be valid unless it is in writing and physically made a part of the policy or other written evidence of insurance,or it is incorporated in the policy or other written evidence of insurance by specific reference to another policy or written evidence of insurance.
ann.thus,our inquiry focuses on whether the excess policies incorporate the commonwealth policy or commonwealth flood definition endorsement by specific reference.see ins.of am.bd.of comm rs of port of new orleans,cir.sufficient specific references include such phrases as as per primary policies,as per underlying policy ies as far as applicable,heinhuis venture,cir or,the provisions of the immediate underlying policy are incorporated as a part of this policy,hunter office of health,so d.the excess policies contain no such words of incorporation.the only discussion of the other policies is the excess clause,which states that,inter alia,the primary level insurance policies may insure different risks than the excess policies,and the participation clause,which sets out the proportion of each layer of coverage for which the particular insurer is liable.like all sophisticated corporations using an agent,six flags could have required that its insurers use identical words in all of the applicable policies,but it did not do so in this case.six flags has pointed us to no authority supporting the coextensive interpretation of differing policies so long as the insured intended to obtain the same coverage from each policy at minimum,because it is the commonwealth flood definition endorsement language and not the common provisions of the excess policies that creates the ambiguity,we can not impose that ambiguity on all of the excess insurers,particularly here where other excess insurers did not incorporate the commonwealth flood definition endorsement.we therefore hold that we must review the excess policies as independent units.
extrinsic evidence and the denial of plaintiff rule f motion 
six flags asks us to consider extrinsic evidence in order to discern the intent of the parties.extrinsic evidence includes the nature of the contract,equity,usages,the conduct of the parties before and after formation of the contract,and of other contracts of a like nature between the same parties.ann.extrinsic evidence may only be used to clarify ambiguity,not to create an ambiguity in an otherwise clear contract.see campbell melton,so d,see also blackburn national union fire ins.of pittsburgh,so d,doerr,so d at because we conclude that the excess policies are not ambiguous,we will not resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret them.having held that the commonwealth policy is,at minimum,ambiguous and that remand to the district court is the appropriate outcome here,we conclude that the district court on remand will be in the best position to determine,consistent with our holding today,if reference to extrinsic evidence is necessary in the first instance.
six flags finally argues that the district court erred by denying its request to conduct additional discovery pursuant to rule f six flags seeks additional extrinsic evidence regarding the excess insurers and iri intentions that the policies would provide full coverage for loss or damage from a hurricane.the district court concluded that it did not need to grant six flags motion because the excess policies were unambiguous thus,the information six flags sought to discover was not essential to deciding the partial motion for summary judgment.
we affirm as to the excess insurers.the trial judge decision to curtail discovery is granted great deference and,thus,is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.wichita falls office assocs.banc one,cir.the purpose of rule f is to provide with a much needed tool to keep open the doors of discovery in order to adequately combat a summary judgment motion.id.at.although a continuance of a motion for summary judgment for purposes of discovery should be granted almost as a matter of course,int l shortstop,rally,cir quotation marks and citations omitted,the party seeking additional discovery must first demonstrate how that discovery will create a genuine issue of material fact,beattie madison county sch,cir.in this case,the extrinsic evidence that six flags seeks to discover will not create a genuine issue of material fact because,as noted above,such evidence may not be used to create an ambiguity in otherwise unambiguous excess policies.see.ann.cadwallader,so d at courts lack the authority to alter the terms of insurance contracts under the guise of contractual interpretation when the policy provisions are couched in unambiguous terms.regarding the commonwealth policy,because we conclude that an ambiguity exists,reverse summary judgment for commonwealth,and remand,six flags appeal is moot.further discovery may be helpful,and the district court will be in the best position to control that discovery before entertaining any future motions.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.we affirm the district court entry of judgment for westchester surplus lines insurance arch specialty insurance great lakes reinsurance uk plc axis specialty insurance continental casualty and liberty corporate capital.we reverse the district court entry of judgment for commonwealth insurance and remand for proceedings between six flags and commonwealth consistent with this opinion.costs incurred by the excess insurers shall be borne by six flags.six flags and commonwealth shall bear their own costs.
