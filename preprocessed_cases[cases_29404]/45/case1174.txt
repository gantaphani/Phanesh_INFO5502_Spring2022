plaintiff,mary ellen rodgers appeals from the order entered by district court judge victoria roberts,on august,granting defendants,monumental life insurance company and american express,motion for reconsideration and thereby entering summary judgement in favor of defendants.plaintiff also appeals from the order entered by district court judge david lawson on october,denying plaintiff motion for reconsideration of the august,order.
this case is in federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship pursuant to a with the amount in controversy being greater than.the matter involves a contract dispute arising out of a life insurance policy issued by monumental life insurance company monumental,which provided for accidental death benefits that plaintiff is seeking on behalf of her insured husband.plaintiff is challenging the district court order finding that no genuine issue of material fact remained for trial and that plaintiff is not entitled to benefits under the policy.
for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court order granting defendants summary judgment,and remand the case for trial with instructions for the court to rule upon plaintiff objections to the admission of monumental expert testimony based on monumental alleged failure to comply with federal rule of civil procedure a.
background 
procedural history 
on march,plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants seeking payment of benefits pursuant to an accidental death coverage policy issued by defendant monumental to plaintiff now deceased husband,phillip rodgers,wherein monthly premiums were paid by and through rodgers credit line held by defendant american express the case was removed to federal district court on april,and defendants filed their answer to the complaint on april.
the district court held a status conference and issued its scheduling order on november,thereby establishing december,as the date for plaintiff to file her expert witness reports january,as the deadline for identification of all witnesses,including experts march,as the deadline for completing expert discovery and april,as the date for filing dispositive motions.
on january,monumental served and then filed its expert witness list naming werner spitz and molinari as monumental experts.six days later,on january,monumental also served and filed its witness list.in the meantime,on january,monumental had filed a motion to compel plaintiff to provide full medical to monumental,and issued numerous subpoenas for records to the fourteen doctors listed on plaintiff witness list.the district court issued an order granting monumental motion to compel and ordered plaintiff to furnish signed medical authorizations for the treating physicians,the two hospitals and emergency medical service,on or before february,together with letters of authority.monumental then proceeded with discovery of plaintiff treating physicians.on march,monumental served copies of the reports of molinari and spitz upon plaintiff via facsimile transmission and regular mail.
discovery concluded on march.just a few days before,on march,monumental had filed its motion for summary judgment and brief in support thereof and plaintiff filed her response in opposition and a reply brief.
on july,district judge roberts issued a written opinion and order denying monumental motion for summary judgment.monumental filed a motion for reconsideration of the court order on august.thereafter,on august,judge roberts granted monumental motion for reconsideration,opining in relevant part 
while plaintiff treating physicians may have opinions concerning rodgers cause of death,plaintiff has come forth with no factual evidence to rebut defendants contention that no evidence was found on autopsy to support the treaters opinions.in fact,one of the treating doctors.sic,johnson,specifically said that he would defer to the pathologist in proving or disproving fatty embolism as the cause of death.
in its opinion of july,the court focused on whether or not the treating doctors testimony would be admissible under daubert,and did not further consider,assuming its admissibility,whether the testimony would create a genuine issue of material fact.inasmuch as defendants have demonstrated through unrebutted testimony that an easy,fast and definitive test can be performed to determine the presence of fatty embolism,and that such a test was done on rodgers body at autopsy and no fatty embolism was revealed,this court finds that there was a palpable defect by which the court was misled in its earlier ruling.correcting it results in a disposition in favor of the defendants.
plaintiff then filed a motion for reconsideration of judge roberts order.on october,district judge lawson,the judge to whom the case had been reassigned,denied plaintiff motion for reconsideration of judge roberts order.plaintiff thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.
on july,phillip rodgers was travelling at approximately sixty on north black road in benton township,michigan,when he apparently lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve and slid off the paved portion of the road onto the shoulder where the car rolled over before coming to a rest.as a result of this accident,rodgers suffered a fractured left femur broken leg and several contusions.rodgers was transported to community hospital in cheboygan,michigan,seen by emergency room physician michael johnson,and later transferred to northern michigan hospital nmh in petoskey,michigan,where he died seven days later on july.
at nmh,rodgers was treated by paul blanchard,who initially scheduled rodgers to undergo surgery for his fractured leg on the evening of july.rodgers was alert and cognizant of his surroundings after his accident.john diedrich,an internist at nmh,was also called in as a consultant on rodgers case for the purpose of obtaining preoperative clearance.in his report,diedrich noted 
history philip rodgers is a gentleman with a history of parkinson disease,syndrome,vasodepressor syncope,hypertension,hyperlipidemia,modest carotid stenosis,and status post permanent pacemaker placement.he also has a history of peripheral vascular occlusive disease and is status post resection of abdominal aortic aneurysm with aortofemoral bypass.
in reviewing his past record,he does have episodic hyper and hypotension and has frequently had systolic blood pressures in the range,as high as to range.he does have generally blood pressures since the accident in the range of systolic.his current blood pressure is.in questioning him,he is slow to answer and does not have many details regarding his past or present history.he does have a history of chronic confusion,and that has not changed of late.
impression his perioperative risk for surgery is increased by parkinson disease,generalized vascular disease,and a pacemaker,but this is not excessive in view of the severity of his injuries.i believe that his injuries should be treated aggressively as indicated overall,i see no other contraindications to surgery 
however,rodgers condition worsened that day such that he became very lethargic with decreased mental status evidenced by extreme drowsiness and unresponsiveness.as a result,at the recommendation of consulting physician denise sinke,rodgers surgery was canceled.in her report,sinke noted that a cat scan of rodgers brain was conducted and the results did not indicate any acute bleeding or other changes.
the next day,july,rodgers condition dramatically worsened,such that the progress notes indicted that rodgers was suffering from pulmonary edema,and his breathing became so shallow that he had to be placed on a ventilator in order to breath.five days later,after the family agreed that he should be removed from the life support,rodgers expired.
an autopsy was performed on rodgers body by pathologist george krzymowski,and upon completion thereof,krzymowski indicated the following as the pathologic diagnoses 
cause of death anoxic encephalopathy due to hypotensive event following motor vehicle crash.
manner of death accident 
blanchard disagreed with the pathologic diagnosis as noted above.according to blanchard,rodgers died from fat emboli syndrome sustained as a direct complication from rodgers fractured femur.specifically,when questioned at his deposition,blanchard opined as follows 
q let me ask you that question first.could this fracture alone and just this fracture kill somebody can you answer that question 
a well,normally just fracturing the femur without any complications consequent to the fracture would not be a fatal injury.
q would you agree with the statement that,but for his sicknesses,the accident and injuries he sustained in the accident would not be sufficient to cause his death 
a i would disagree with that statement.
q and why would you disagree with that 
a because i think rodgers died because of the pulmonary complications induced by the fracture,the differential diagnosis being fat emboli syndrome,adult respiratory distress syndrome or infection.but that seems less likely to me.
q and that conclusion,then,that you just given me is in disagreement with the autopsy report is that true 
a it in disagreement with these statements here on the autopsy report.
at.blanchard opined that rodgers cause of death was a fat embolism from the fracture site.at.
johnson similarly opined during his deposition as follows 
q do you have an opinion as to what the cause of rodgers death was and the events that led up to his death 
a i have a pretty good idea why he died,but it not something that provable,really.even at autopsy it not always provable.but in a patient with a fracture like this who suddenly deteriorate s mentally,the most likely thing would be what called a fat embolism syndrome.
there fat inside your bones.and if you break them and they get into the bloodstream,they can embolize to your cerebral vessels,and that fatal usually.or certainly nearly fatal.
i would guess in his case that probably what happened.he never showed signs of sort of cardiac decompensation or something like as associated heart attack or something like that.so that be the be my best guess.
q and can you explain how that would work exactly,the fat embolism you talked about is mean,where would the fat come from,
a the fat comes from 
q and where would it go to 
a the fat comes bones,believe it or not,have fatty tissue in them in the marrow.and there not much you can do about it really.sometimes when the long bones break,which is the one most associated with a fat embolism,you know,it gets into your bloodstream.i mean,there arteries and veins in the area.and any tissue that there can get into your blood and your circulation,and then it travels through your circulation and can embolize,which means go from your heart up to your head,your cerebral vessels.
once it does that,it blocks them off,and you have basically as stroke.it not common,but it i mean,it not rare.it happens.and we worry about it.but you ca do anything to prevent it.and once it happens,all you can do is try and support patients.but you ca really do much about it.
q there no medication that you can give to 
a to prevent it not that i aware of.it a rare but basically unpreventable complication of a fracture.
q okay.so the fat the would have gone from the area of the fracture 
q to the brain 
a right.it plugs up the artery,which plugs then denies oxygen to the brain tissue that requires that arterial flow,which is what a stroke is.it what an embolic stroke is.
finally,in response to defense counsel questions as to whether he was of the opinion that rodgers died of conditions,johnson opined 
a no.i think think he died of a fat embolism.i think that came from his trauma,which is a fractured femur.and i do think that that whole scenario had anything to do with his conditions,whatever they were.
as noted previously,monumental attempted to prevent plaintiff from admitting the testimony of johnson as well as blanchard into evidence when defendant filed its motion for summary judgment.however,in her order denying monumental motion for summary judgment,judge roberts found that the testimony of these two physicians could be admitted and considered.plaintiff,in turn,sought to have the reports and testimony of monumental experts,spitz and molinari,kept out of evidence pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,inasmuch as monumental failed to comply with federal rule of civil procedure a by allegedly failing to submit its expert witness list on a timely basis,failing to submit the addresses of the witnesses in violation of a a,failing to submit written reports signed by the witnesses on a timely basis in violation of a b,failing to disclose curriculum vitae of the experts on a timely basis in violation of a b,failing to provide a list of exhibits to support the witnesses conclusions in violation of the rule,failing to provide a list of the witnesses publications on a timely basis in violation of the rule,and a few other violations.judge roberts found that because she was denying monumental motion for summary judgment,she need not consider plaintiff claim that the testimony and reports of monumental experts should not be considered.
discussion 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see weeks portage county executive offices,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable trier of fact could return a verdict for the nonmovant.see anderson liberty lobby,d.the substantive law identifies facts that are material.facts are material only if establishment thereof might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing substantive law.anderson,at.a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.see celotex catrett,d.when reviewing a motion for summary judgment,the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
in the order granting monumental motion for summary judgment,the district court found that plaintiff presented no evidence that rodgers did,in fact,die from a fatty emboli.at.in other words,although in its opinion denying monumental motion for summary judgment,the court found the expert opinions from rodgers treating physicians admissible for the purpose of establishing that rodgers died of a fat embolism directly related to the fractured femur that he sustained in the accident,the court later found in its opinion granting monumental motion for reconsideration and summary judgment,that the expert opinions from these physicians failed to establish in fact that rodgers died of a fat embolism.
the district court then compared plaintiff evidence to the report from monumental expert,werner spitz,in which spitz stated that the finding of fat emboli in microscopic sections is easy,fast and definitive.at.the court opined that plaintiff does not dispute that there is a way to determine the presence of fatty embolism.at.the district court also looked to krzymowski initial affidavit wherein he found no fat emboli on microscopic examination.based upon this evidence,the court concluded that i nasmuch as defendants have demonstrated through unrebutted testimony that an easy,fast and definitive test can be performed to determine the presence of fatty embolism,and that such test was done on rodgers body at autopsy and no fatty embolism was revealed,this court finds that there was a palpable defect by which the court was misled in its earlier ruling.correcting it results in a disposition in favor of the defendants.at.
the record does not support the district court finding that plaintiff does not dispute that there is a way to determine the presence of fatty embolism.indeed,through the affidavit of johnson,plaintiff disputed the issue of whether there is a way to determine fatty embolism on autopsy.specifically,johnson opined in reference to his belief that plaintiff died of a fat embolism that it not something that provable,really.even at autopsy it not always provable.at.therefo
