opinion and order 
this insurance contract action is before the court on defendant motion for summary judgment de.the heart of this case,and the key to resolution of the parties accusations of breach of contract,is the legal effect of a provision in the insurance contract requiring the insured to participate in an examination under oath euo at the request of the insurance company.also at issue is the parties conduct throughout the claims process in the context of the plaintiff breach of contract claim and the plaintiff claim that the defendant breached the duty of good faith.
background 
on october,national athletic sportswear,the plaintiff in this action,filed a lawsuit against westfield insurance company,the defendant in this action,in allen county superior court.the complaint has two counts.count one is for breach of contract and accuses the defendant of breaching its contractual obligation by not paying the plaintiff claimed losses,amounting to.count two is for bad faith claim settlement practices,or what indiana law would call the breach of the duty of good faith.the allegations underlying this claim are that the defendant failed to acknowledge the plaintiff communications and act promptly on them failed to affirm or deny coverage of the claims in a reasonable amount of time after the plaintiff submitted proof of loss statements did not attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt,fair,and equitable settlement of the plaintiff claim compelled the plaintiff to file suit to recover money due under the insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amount the plaintiff is entitled to required an employee of the plaintiff to submit to an euo for eight hours and then requested more time to continue the euo ignored information from its own expert about the value of the plaintiff claim and,harassed the plaintiff employees with numerous requests for documents and statements under oath and then,after the plaintiff complied,failed to acknowledge or respond to the plaintiff claim in a prompt manner.this claim of bad faith seeks punitive damages.
the defendant removed the case to this court on november,under a.on january,the defendant filed an answer to the complaint de raising several defenses.on the same date,the defendant filed a counterclaim de alleging the plaintiff failed to comply with terms of the contract,including the euo provision.the counterclaim sought declaratory judgment that the plaintiff recovery under the contract was limited or barred.on february,the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment de on the plaintiff two claims.the motion has two main arguments first,that the defendant was relieved of its duty to pay the plaintiff because the plaintiff violated the insurance contract by not submitting to the second euo,or the rest of the euo and second,that the defendant did not act in bad faith as a matter of law because it merely exercised its contractual rights under the policy.the motion did not seek summary judgment on the defendant counterclaim.the plaintiff filed a response on march,de.the defendant filed a reply de on april.

agreement regarding a planned second euo 
of material relevance to this case,the parties do not dispute that the mutual understanding upon ending the euo on april,was that another euo would be scheduled with snyder after additional documents were requested and provided.snyder testified in an affidavit during the course of the euo,clark requested additional documents from nas.either during or after the euo,he stated that he would promptly send a letter to nas following the euo itemizing the additional documents that he would like to review.de,pl.desig.of evid.in opp.to def.mot.for summ,snyder.snyder also testified that at the conclusion of the euo,i recall that clark stated that he was completed with his questioning of me other than any additional questions that he may have after reviewing the additional documentation that he would be requesting.de,pl.desig.of evid.in opp.to def.mot.for summ,snyder.snyder also acknowledged that the defendant attorney,clark,requested that i appear for a second euo.de,pl.desig.of evid.in opp.to def.mot.for summ,snyder.the plaintiff attorney at the time,harmeyer,testified in an affidavit that clark needed to review more documents and then would have more questions for snyder

the crux of this case is which party,if any,is in breach of the insurance contract.the plaintiff in the complaint accuses the defendant of breaching the contract by,inter alia,not paying the plaintiff insurance claim for losses resulting from the.the defendant in its counterclaim accuses the plaintiff of materially breaching the contract by failing to comply with terms and conditions in the policy,mainly and most importantly the euo requirement.each party states that the other party breach of contract entitles it to judgment from the court.the plaintiff claim of bad faith dealing against the defendant is a separate but related issue and will be examined below.this bad faith claim includes allegations of failing to acknowledge and act promptly upon communications from the plaintiff failing to either affirm or deny coverage of claims on a timely basis not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt,fair,and equitable settlement of the plaintiff claim compelling the plaintiff to file suit to recover what it is owed under the policy requiring snyder to undergo the euo for eight hours and then requesting another euo ignoring information from the defendant own expert about the plaintiff claim and harassing the plaintiff employees with requests for documents and statements under oath.pl.compl,de.
breach of contract 
legal standard 
the breach of contract issue here,a dispute over contract requirements,particularly euos,is similar to what occurred in the recent indiana supreme court case,morris economy fire and casualty.in that case,the insureds sued the insurance company for breach of contract and failure to deal in good faith after the two sides could not agree on the claim and whether to proceed with an euo of the insured.morris,at.the court made clear that the contract provision requiring the insureds to submit to an euo was an entirely separate condition that explicitly requires the policyholder to perform specific duties.id.at.the court also specifically noted that the conditional requirement to submit to an euo is not a cooperation clause and thus prejudice to the insurance company is not a necessary consideration in determining the enforceability of other insurance policy provisions.id.
the court in morris found that the breached the contract as a matter of law when they refused to provide an examination under oath to the defendant insurance company.id.at.the court discounted that the plaintiffs would have submitted to an euo if they had been provided copies of previous statements to the insurance company.participating in the euo and submitting requested documents was a contractual obligation.id.at.compliance was not optional or subject to a trial court determination of reasonableness.id.the contract reasonableness requirement,the court said,describes how often the insurer can make requests,not the nature and extent of the information or statement sought.id.the court declined to delve into whether other actions of the insurance company were unreasonable in light of the refusal to submit to even one euo.id.
the seventh circuit,in employers mutual casualty skoutaris,cir,applied this rule in a case similar to morris and the current action.in the context of a breach of an euo clause,therefore,the supreme court of indiana has established that an insurance company need only show a material breach to prevail.skoutaris,at.in skoutaris,the insured refused to submit to an euo regarding the claim he filed for his restaurant,which had been destroyed by fire.id.the contract does not allow skoutaris to ignore his express duties because he felt that he had done enough skoutaris intransigence constituted a willful and intentional breach of the euo clause,and the district court ruling for the insurance company summary judgment motion was correct.id.at.
the indiana court of appeals applied the morris approach in knowledge,sentry insurance,a case factually similar to morris,skoutaris,and this case.after the insured filed a claim for stolen property,the insured owner did not make himself available for an euo and thus breached the contract,making summary judgment for the defendant insurance company appropriate.id.at.it did not matter that the insured would have stipulated that his previous interview was under oath.id.
application to reasonableness claims 
the present action also boils down to a dispute over compliance,or lack thereof,with the euo clause in the insurance contract.the contract clearly states that the insured must submit to an euo if requested by the insurance company.the parties conducted one euo.both parties left that euo with the expectation that another euo would resume once the defendant requested,and the plaintiff provided,additional documents relating to the plaintiff claims.the plaintiff later objected to the second euo and refused to participate because he became frustrated and concerned the defendant was harassing him.the plaintiff claimed then,and argues now,that a condition of its participation in a second euo is that it be reasonable.
as a general matter,it should also be noted that morris and skoutaris make clear that the insureds can not put conditions on their existing contractual duties.the court in morris stated that the insureds demand that they receive copies of the previous statements before submitting to an euo was unfounded.t he contract does not provide that an insured can impose this prerequisite upon the insurer before complying with agreed duties.morris,at,quoted in skoutaris,at.this casts doubt on the legal basis for the plaintiff owner,snyder,to condition his participation in the second euo upon an explanation of the scope,subject matter,or length of that euo or that the euo be reasonable.
more specifically in regard to this case,demanding that an euo have reasonable limitations lacks legal support.the indiana supreme court rejected such an argument in morris,where the insurance contract at issue had similar language to the contract here.the quoted phrase in that case was a s often as we reasonably required.id.at alteration in original.this reference describes how often the insurer can make requests,not the nature and extend of the information or statement sought.id.the court also noted that the insureds do not contend that the frequence of the insurance company requests were unreasonable.id.
the operative language of the contract in this case is we may examine any insured under oath as may be reasonably required.de,def.desig.of mat,ex.the plaintiff argues that such language means that a ny request for additional euos must be reasonable.de,pl.memo.of law in opp.to summ.j.the plaintiff arguments for reasonableness in reference to the euo refer to both the subject matter or scope of the euos as well as the frequency or number of euos no rehashing of the same topics discussed in the euo ought to be conducted and some agreement on the length of the sworn statement should be reached.de,pl.memo.of law in opp.to sum.at.because the plaintiff here did undergo one in morris,skoutaris,and knowledge where the insureds never submitted to any issue of the frequency or length of the euo must be addressed.however,as explained below,the fact that the plaintiff submitted to one euo,or the start of the euo,before refusing to participate in the second,or in the continuation of the euo,is a distinction without a legal difference.the plaintiff at some points in its legal argument combines the issues of reasonable scope or subject matter on the one hand,and reasonable time,length,or frequency on the other hand,and at other points the plaintiff treats them separately.the court will address each reasonableness objection in turn.
a reasonableness as to scope or subject matter of the euo 
the plaintiff argues that there is a reasonableness limit on the subject matter or scope of a second euo.the plaintiff position is that 
a reasonableness limitation be placed on any further questioning of snyder.clark ought not to be allowed to rehash the same subject matter that was thoroughly covered in the first euo.the subject matter ought to be limited to the new documents that were produced by nas after the initial euo.
de,pl.memo.of law in opp.to sum.at.this argument amounts to a claim that the contract has a reasonableness requirement on what kind of matters the insurance company may ask about.however,the contract provision at issue states that the examination may be taken about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim.de,def.desig.of mat,ex,emphasis added.of course,if the defendant began inquiring into issues completely unrelated to the insurance or the claim,that would be a different matter.but no such allegation is made here.
in morris,the indiana supreme court said the similar contract provision 
describes how often the insurer can make requests,not the nature and extent of the information or statement sought.the policy contract does not itself impose an explicit general reasonableness requirement on the insurer regarding what documentation the insurer might demand of the insured or in what context the insurer might ask for an examination under oath.
morris,at.the word reasonably in the contract here,like reasonablesness in the contract in morris,refers to how often the insurer may require the insured to undergo an euo,not the subject matter or topic of an euo.
the plaintiff legal authority for a claim that the euo subject matter or scope be reasonable or limited is confined to three district court cases cited in its memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment kamin central states fire ins,joe market fish,scottsdale ins,wl,dist.lexis,and,jones state farm cas.these cases are of little help to the plaintiff.first,they all concern discovery disputes,which are governed by the rules of civil procedure.as has been pointed out,the dispute in this case,over euos,is a contractual matter.see morris,at rejecting the applicability of discovery rules.second,the first two cases stand for the proposition that a previous euo of a person does not preclude a party from deposing that person later.that holding supports the defendant position if it is of any applicability at all.
jones has more conceivable applicability,and the plaintiff puts stock in the holding.that case involved the motion to quash the deposition the sought to conduct on the grounds that the insured had already given a recorded statement and an euo about his claim.jones.the magistrate allowed the deposition to go forward but limited its scope or subject matter t here is no logical reason why that deposition should duplicate the material covered by the examination under oath or the statement taken by the claims adjustor.therefore,the deposition must be limited to those areas not covered in the previous two statements.id.at.the plaintiff adopts this view as its stance in this case,but this holding,like the other two cases,is inapplicable.the parties in this action are not fighting over discovery and depositions they are debating the legal obligations and significance of the euo provision in the insurance contract during the period of this case.that makes it an entirely separate issue governed by different legal authority,namely,indiana contract law as spelled out in the morris case.also,as previously mentioned,the plaintiff has not pointed to information that indicates the defendant planned or intended to inquire into the same information and documents that were discussed in the first euo.last,jones and the other cases have no binding authority on this court they are only persuasive authority.therefore,the plaintiff citation to these cases is unavailing for its position.
even if it were true under the legal authority governing this case that a reasonableness principle applies to the subject matter,topic,or scope of the euo,there are no material facts to support a claim a second euo would be unreasonable in this context.there is no factual indication that the defendant purpose in holding the second euo was meant to harass the plaintiff.in fact,the record indicates that the defendant purpose in conducting a second euo was to inquire into documents that were either requested of and received from the plaintiff after the first euo or not discussed during the first euo.the record also is clear that this was the understanding of both plaintiff and defendant at the end of the first euo.the defendant indicated in clark october,letter that its focus would be on new material or material not covered in the first euo,though it reserved the possibility that other matters,including those discussed in the first euo,might be addressed too.the mere possibility that matters discussed in the first euo might be addressed again in a second euo can not create a basis for claiming the second euo is presumptively unreasonable.the plaintiff evidence does not include any allegation that the defendant during the second euo intended or planned to cover the same information as the first euo,only that the plaintiff feared this.the plaintiff belief that the euo was meant to harass,a belief not articulated until august,does not create a triable issue of fact for a jury to determine.the plaintiff only accuses the defendant of refusing to set reasonableness limits on the scope or subject matter.while it might be courteous of the defendant to do so,it was not required by contract or law,as enunciated in morris and applied in skoutaris and knowledge.in sum,the court can not agree with the plaintiff argument that in this case the scope or subject matter of the euo must be reasonable,as set by a court or agreed upon by the parties.
b reasonableness as to time,length,or frequency of the euo 
the plaintiff also argues that the insurance policy contains a limitation as to how often westfield may require snyder to sit for euos.de,pl.memo.of law in opp.to summ.emphasis removed.this is a different argument than what the courts addressed in morris,skoutaris,or knowledge.the contract in this case states that insureds must undergo an euo at such times as may be reasonably required.de,def.desig.of mat,ex,contract.as noted earlier,this means the number or frequency of euos must be reasonable.see morris,at r easonableness describes how often the insurer can make requests.
the plaintiff in this case,however,does not state exactly what that reasonableness limit is or how often the defendant may require an euo other than claiming that snyder should not be required to sit for a second euo unless some reasonable understanding can be reached with westfield as to the length and scope of the second.de,pl.memo.of law in opp.to summ.but this mixes the prior argument regarding the scope or subject matter of the euo with the issue of a reasonable frequency or number of euos.because
