background 
factual background 
on december,gannon leased a chevy cobalt from ballweg chevrolet,in middleton,wisconsin.ballweg chevrolet thereafter assigned the lease to gmac.the lease was for a term of months,and gannon was required to make monthly payments of.the lease was scheduled to end one month after the last payment wa s due,but the lease provided gannon could end the lease at any time,and gmac may end th e lease if gannon were in default.the lease agreement stated gannon would be in default,if more than one full monthly payment wa s more than days past due.under the lease,gannon had the opportunity to cure the default,but if she failed to do so,gmac had the right to end the lease and require gannon to pay an early end charge,sue gannon for damages and to get the vehicle back,and pursue any other remedy permitted by law.
by january,gannon was no longer making lease payments.gmac informed gannon she was in default.on february,gmac filed a replevin action against gannon in wisconsin state court,seeking to repossess the vehicle.on april,the wisconsin court entered judgment for replevin in favor of gmac.gannon continued to drive the vehicle,without insurance,until july.
on the afternoon of july,appellants were drivers and passengers on three motorcycles traveling westbound on a highway near janesville,wisconsin.gannon was driving eastbound in the leased vehicle.as gannon approached the appellants,she crossed the center lane and collided with all three motorcycles.five out of the six appellants suffered serious physical injuries and have permanent physical impairments.
procedural background 
appellants,all residents of iowa,filed a complaint in the district court against gmac pursuant to.appellants first alleged gmac was vicariously liable for gannon negligence because gannon was no longer a lessee on the date of the accident,but,instead,was driving the vehicle with the implied or express consent of gmac,the owner of the vehicle.appellants next alleged gmac was directly liable for appellants injuries because gmac negligently entrusted the vehicle to gannon,failed to take reasonable steps to enforce its replevin judgment and possession of the vehicle from gannon,and failed to discover gannon was driving the vehicle while impaired and without insurance.
gmac filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b and b.gmac argued the substantive law of wisconsin should apply to appellants claims,and under wisconsin law,appellants damages would be capped at,which would be insufficient to meet jurisdictional requirement of in controversy.gmac also claimed both the graves amendment and iowa code barred appellants vicarious liability claims,and the graves amendment precluded appellants negligence claims.finally,gmac contended even if the graves amendment did not bar appellants negligence claims,the claims failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
the district court granted gmac motion to dismiss and entered judgment in favor of gmac.the court first conducted a choice of law analysis and determined iowa law,rather than wisconsin law,applied to appellants claims,disposing of gmac subject matter jurisdiction challenge.the district court next determined the graves amendment barred appellants vicarious liability claims,finding the lease was still in effect on the date of the accident despite the fact gmac had obtained a replevin judgment.the court similarly determined iowa code barred appellants vicarious liability claims because,as the lessee in possession of the vehicle at the time of the accident,gannon was considered the owner of the vehicle under iowa law.the district court then found the graves amendment precluded appellants direct negligence claims against gmac because appellants fail ed to point to any legal authority imposing a duty on gmac to ensure that its lessees comply with the various duties asserted in the complaint.because the district court determined the graves amendment barred appellants negligence claims,the district court declined to address the merits of the negligence claims.appellants assert the district court erred in dismissing their claims.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to.b.see northstar,merrill lynch,cir.in so doing,we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see id.at.dismissal is proper when the plaintiff complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.id.at citing.b.to survive a motion to dismiss,the factual allegations in a complaint,assumed true,must suffice to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at quoting bell atl.twombly.the court accepts as true all factual allegations,but is not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.mcadams mccord,cir quoting ashcroft iqbal.
choice of law and jurisdiction 
in the district court,gmac suggested the substantive law of wisconsin applied to appellant claims,and under wisconsin law,appellants could not meet amount in controversy requirement because their damages would be capped at.although neither party challenges the district court decision to apply the substantive law of iowa to appellants claims or the court resulting determination diversity jurisdiction existed,subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold question we must address at the outset.see sianis jensen,cir.reviewing the district court choice of law determination de novo,see donaldson borroughs diesel,cir standard of review,we agree with the district court analysis of iowa choice of law rules and particularly veasley crst int l,iowa applying iowa law in a negligence action brought by an iowa resident against the owner of a vehicle that caused an accident which injured the iowa resident in arizona.because iowa law applies to appellants claims,and iowa law does not impose a damages cap on appellants claim,we are satisfied diversity jurisdiction exists.
vicarious liability 
appellants contend the district court erred in finding the graves amendment and iowa code barred appellants vicarious liability claims.in order to determine whether gmac may be held vicariously liable for gannon negligence,we must first determine whether the lease agreement between gannon and gmac was still in effect on the date of the accident,july.appellants insist the lease agreement had been terminated prior to july,because gannon had been in default for seven months and gmac had obtained a replevin judgment.appellants alternatively argue,even if the lease were not terminated by the replevin judgment as a matter of law,there is a fact question as to whether the relationship between gannon and gmac constituted a lease or whether gannon was merely driving the vehicle with gmac express or implied permission.
the district court found gmac replevin judgment in wisconsin state court did not terminate the lease,and,thus,the lease was still in effect at the time of the accident.the district court reasoned,under wisconsin law a replevin judgment determine s only the right to possession of the collateral or leased goods,but such judgment shall not bar any subsequent action for damages or deficiency.stat.e.the district court declared,w hen a lessor
