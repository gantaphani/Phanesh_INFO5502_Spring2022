in this diversity case,appellee travelers indemnity company of illinois travelers seeks to recover under a motor vehicle liability policy that onebeacon america insurance company and pennsylvania general insurance company collectively,onebeacon had issued to leasing associates,and lai trust collectively lai,a vehicle leasing agency travelers settled a vehicle liability suit for on behalf of capform,which had leased the vehicle involved from lai.citing the policy,travelers demanded that onebeacon reimburse travelers,the policy limit.although onebeacon has admitted that its policy with lai may be read to extend coverage to the capform vehicle,it protested that the parties never intended such a result.accordingly,onebeacon asked the district court to reform the policy in light of mutual mistake.on for summary judgment,the district court refused to reform the policy and ordered onebeacon to pay the to travelers.we reverse.
onebeacon is an insurance company headquartered in massachusetts.lai,a company that leases cars and trucks to businesses,contracted with onebeacon for general insurance coverage for the company vehicles the policy defines an insured to include 
a.you for any covered auto.
anyone else while using with your permission a covered auto you own 
although onebeacon acknowledges that this language may be read to extend coverage to lai lessees,it says that neither it nor lai intended that coverage.
capform,is a texas and florida construction company that leased some of its vehicles from lai.lai standard lease required lessees to insure the leased vehicles,at their own expense,either by applying to be added to the onebeacon policy or through another insurer.capform chose to insure its vehicles with travelers.in,a capform employee in florida,driving a capform truck on lease from lai,struck and severely injured a pedestrian,manuel pedreira.travelers defended capform and eventually settled pedreira personal injury suit for.
during the settlement process,travelers became aware of the policy onebeacon had issued to lai and read it to grant coverage for pedreira case.travelers asked onebeacon to contribute,the policy limit,to the pedreira settlement.onebeacon refused and instead filed suit against both travelers and lai seeking a declaratory judgment that capform was not covered by its policy.alternatively,onebeacon asked that the insurance contract be reformed to match the parties intent that it would cover only those lessees who had specifically applied for,and been approved for,coverage under the onebeacon policy.lai was dismissed as a defendant after stating,in an agreement for judgment the agreement,that its onebeacon policy did not cover lessees who purchased the required insurance coverage for their leased vehicles from insurers other than onebeacon.
both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment.onebeacon argued that the agreement,taken together with evidence of the course of conduct between it and lai,and of the insurance obligations lai imposed on its lessees,established that the parties were mutually mistaken when they executed a contract that did not exclude from coverage vehicles that lessees had chosen to insure independently.travelers sought summary judgment based primarily on the policy language.
the district court initially refused to grant judgment for either party,prompting the two companies to submit a joint motion for reconsideration stating their belief that there are no material facts that require a trial and asserting that this action can and should be resolved through the parties motions for summary judgment.in response,the district court issued a order granting summary judgment for travelers,concluding that onebeacon has failed to present full,clear,and decisive proof of mistake.dist.order at quoting polaroid travelers indem.without elaborating,the court cited three factors for its decision the clear and unambiguous policy language,onebeacon inability to identify any policy language that was included by mistake or endorsement that was omitted by mistake,and the massachusetts public policy concerning liability insurance.
on appeal,onebeacon challenges the district court conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reformation,arguing that the undisputed facts conclusively show that neither onebeacon nor lai intended insurance coverage under the onebeacon policy for lai lessees who did not individually apply for,and pay for,that coverage.the insurer also contends that there was no public policy justification for refusing to reform the policy to conform to the parties intent.for reasons we shall explain,we agree.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the parties agree that the substantive contract law of massachusetts applies in this diversity case.we accept that choice.see cochran quest software,cir.the district court summary judgment ruling is subject to de novo review.mcconkie nichols,cir.
mutual mistake and contract reformation under massachusetts law 
under massachusetts law,a written contract may be reformed if its language does not reflect the true intent of both parties.polaroid,at see also berezin regency sav.bank,cir john beaudette,sentry ins.a mut.d,mickelson barnet.massachusetts courts have referenced the approach to mutual mistake articulated in the restatement second of contracts.see,nissan autos.of marlborough,glick,howell glassman.the restatement summarizes the applicable principles as follows 
where a writing that evidences or embodies an agreement in whole or in part fails to express the agreement because of a mistake of both parties as to the contents or effect of the writing,the court may at the request of a party reform the writing to express the agreement,except to the extent that rights of third parties such as good faith purchasers for value will be unfairly affected.
restatement second of contracts.when a party asks for reformation of a contract,it is not asking the court to interpret the contract but rather to change it to conform to the parties intent.see id.cmts.a,accordingly,the usual restrictions on contract interpretation,such as the parol evidence rule,do not apply to a court inquiry into the parties intent.see berezin,at polaroid,at.in a reformation case,it does not matter that a contract unambiguously says one thing.a court still will accept extrinsic evidence in evaluating a claim that both parties to the contract intended it to say something else.
the critical limitation in a contract reformation case is the burden of proof to be entitled to reformation,a party must establish that the undisputed material facts fully,clearly,and decisively show a mutual mistake,polaroid,at see also lordi lordi.although t he classic case for reformation is when the mutual mistake can be traced to a typo or transcription error,a scrivener error is not a prerequisite for reformation.allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts.mutual mistakes justifying contract reformation may result simply from the parties inattention.see,polaroid,at discussing mistaken omission of a pollution exclusion from policies de vincent ford sales,first,basis for equitable relief sufficiently set forth where allegations claim mistake resulting from inadvertence of the parties.such is the mistake urged by onebeacon,which claims that neither it nor lai the policy broad definition of an insured extended coverage to lai lessees who had not independently insured the vehicles with onebeacon.
the mistake that onebeacon must a high degree of not that the outcome of its agreement differed from its expectations,but rather that the contract language did not express the agreement as originally intended.see restatement cmt.a the province of reformation is to make a writing express the agreement that the parties intended it should.the distinction is between a contract that does not accurately reflect hence misrepresents the agreement of the parties and a contract that accurately reflects the intent of the parties but is premised on some mistaken fact.reformation is not available to correct mistaken factual assumptions about the parties bargain,but may be used to correct misrepresentations of the parties contractual intent.th
