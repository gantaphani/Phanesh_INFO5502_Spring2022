granite microsystems,and its president were sued by a former employee for intentional infliction of emotional distress,false imprisonment,and wrongful employment termination.they were insured under two liability policies providing coverage for bodily injury caused by an occurrence,which was defined in the policies as an accident.a third liability policy provided coverage for bodily injury caused by accident.at issue in this appeal is whether the former employee allegations trigger coverage under these policies.the district court said no,and we agree.the insurance policies cover liability for accidental,not intentional,injuries the employee lawsuit alleged only intentional,not accidental,injuries.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
granite microsystems,a wisconsin corporation,makes computers and products.daniel armbrust is president of granite microsystems,and mark lucterhand was its director of global operations.in the fall of,lucterhand ruptured his quadriceps while walking down a flight of stairs at work.armbrust witnessed the injury,but despite lucterhand obvious agony and inability to walk on his own power,armbrust forcibly transported him against his will to a scheduled business meeting where for two hours he endured excruciating pain.several hours after his injury,lucterhand was finally transported to the hospital where he underwent surgery and received postsurgical care for five days.armbrust called him at the hospital at least twice to hasten his discharge.when lucterhand returned to work,armbrust accused him of milking his injuries and soon fired him.
lucterhand sued granite microsystems and armbrust in federal court for intentionally terminating his employment in retaliation for exercising his rights under the family and medical leave act fmla.see.lucterhand also asserted claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.
granite microsystems tendered the lawsuit to its insurers,federal insurance company and vigilant insurance company,for defense and indemnity.federal insured the company under a commercial general liability cgl policy and a workers compensation and employers liability workers compensation policy during the relevant time period.vigilant insured the company under a commercial excess and umbrella insurance excess umbrella policy.two of the cgl policy and the excess umbrella coverage against liability for damages for bodily injury and property damage caused by an occurrence,defined in the policies as an accident.the workers compensation policy covered liability for benefits required by workers compensation law for bodily injury by accident.
the insurance companies declined the tender and intervened in the lawsuit,seeking a declaratory judgment that the policies did not cover the damages alleged by lucterhand.on for summary judgment,the district court agreed with the insurers,concluding that there was no coverage because lucterhand lawsuit against granite microsystems did not even arguably allege damages from an accident.
ii.analysis 
wisconsin law governs this suit,which was filed under the court diversity jurisdiction.in wisconsin,as elsewhere,a liability insurer must defend a suit against its insured if the allegations in the underlying complaint raise the possibility of coverage under the terms of the insurance policy.see estate of sustache am.family mut.ins,wi,the insurer duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify insofar as the former implicates arguable,as opposed to actual,coverage.fireman fund ins.of bradley,wi.the issue,then,is whether the allegations in lucterhand complaint fall potentially within the coverages of the cgl,excess umbrella,and workers compensation policies.sustache,wi,an insurer duty to defend its insured is determined by comparing the allegations of the complaint to the terms of the insurance policy.our standard of review is de novo.first bank of manitowoc cincinnati ins,cir.
the complaint alleged that granite microsystems intentionally terminated lucterhand employment in retaliation for exercising his fmla rights,intentionally inflicted emotional distress,and falsely imprisoned him.the last two claims are intentional torts the first is a statutory claim under the fmla,and the complaint alleged that armbrust intentionally fired lucterhand in violation of his rights under the statute.it is well established that liability policies generally do not cover losses that are intentionally caused.insurance transactions are predicated on the general proposition that coverage is provided for fortuitous losses,and not for intended consequences.robert keeton alan widiss,insurance law a guide to fundamental principles,legal doctrines,and commercial practices,a,at practitioner ed.the transferred risk is the defense against and payment of damages for which the insured becomes responsible because of an accident.
to reflect this fortuity principle,insuring agreements in liability policies typically specify that the insurer will pay damages for which the insured becomes legally responsible because of an accident,id.at,or,as in the cgl and excess umbrella policies at issue in this case,damages for bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence,with occurrence defined as an accident.id.g,at see also holmes,eric mills,holmes appleman on insurance a,at t he occurrence concept preserves the fortuity principle and requirements recognized under the earlier accident test.similarly,the workers compensation policy at issue here covers bodily injury by accident.although the term accident is not defined in any of the policies,wisconsin uses several alternative but similar definitions to demarcate its meaning.an accident as that term is used in liability insurance is a n unexpected,undesirable event or an unforeseen incident which is characterized by a lack of intention.everson lorenz,wi,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.and the word accident,in accident policies,means an event which takes place without one foresight or expectation.a result,though unexpected,is not an accident the means or cause must be accidental.am.family mut.ins.am.girl,wi,quoting black law dictionary ed.
in addition,liability policies will often contain a specific exclusion for intentional or expected injuries.keeton widiss,supra,a,at.an exclusion embodies the same fortuity principle as the policy language granting coverage only for injuries caused by an accident or an occurrence defined as an accident.the cgl and excess umbrella policies contained exclusions specifically excluding coverage for bodily injury arising out of an act that is intended by the insured or would be expected from the standpoint of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the insured,to cause bodily injury.similarly,the workers compensation policy specifically excluded coverage for bodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated by you.
in addressing the coverage question in this case,the district court first focused on the term accident,which appears in the language in all three policies.see am.girl,wi,describing the sequential analytical steps in an dispute.the court concluded that coverage under each policy depended not on whether the damage armbrust was alleged to have caused was accidental but whether armbrust actions themselves were accidental.because the complaint alleged that armbrust actions were intentional,the court concluded that coverage was not even arguable under any of the policies.
granite microsystems claims this analysis is backward.the company argues that the focus instead should be on whether the damage alleged in the complaint was intended or accidental,not whether armbrust actions alone were intentional.granite microsystems maintains that even if armbrust is alleged to have engaged in intentional acts,if the alleged injury was not intentional,then the complaint seeks damages for an accident and the claims are covered.
this distinction makes no difference in this case,for reasons we will explain in a moment.we note,however,that in cases in which the distinction might make a difference,the law is not well settled.courts nationwide have struggled to sketch the
