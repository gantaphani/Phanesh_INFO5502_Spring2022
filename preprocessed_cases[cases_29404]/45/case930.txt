in this declaratory judgment action,plaintiff liberty corporate capital,liberty appeals from the district court grant of defendant dallas glen hills lp dgh motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the appeal presents an issue of first impression in our circuit regarding how the citizenship of a lloyd of london underwriter suing on its own behalf is to be determined for diversity purposes.the district court concluded that the citizenship of every underwriter subscribing to a lloyd policy must be considered when determining whether complete diversity exists.we disagree and therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the action.accordingly,we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural background 
in august,dgh claimed an insured commercial property loss on lloyd of london policy the policy.liberty,acting through its subsidiary liberty syndicate syndicate assigned an adjuster to inspect the property.liberty determined that the policy provided no coverage for the claim.the policy has a limit of which liberty insured percent of the risk 
thomas rokeby conynghan corfield corfield,a british subject and active underwriter for syndicate,filed a declaratory judgment action on his own behalf and as the representative of certain underwriters at lloyd,london subscribing to the policy seeking a declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the policy.corfield alleged that jurisdiction was based upon diversity of citizenship pursuant to however,corfield complaint failed to allege dgh citizenship.corfield alleged only that dgh was a texas limited partnership.
the district court issued an order noting that corfield had failed to properly allege dgh citizenship because the complaint did not allege the citizenship of each of dgh partners moreover,the district court questioned whether corfield had properly pleaded his own citizenship given that he had brought suit both on his own behalf and as the representative of the other underwriters on the policy.noting that the seventh circuit considers the citizenship of every underwriter subscribing to a lloyd policy for diversity purposes,indiana gas home insurance,cir,the district court ordered corfield to either plead his citizenship in accordance with the seventh circuit approach or submit a memorandum brief explaining why corfield british citizenship alone should control.
in response to the district court order,liberty replaced corfield as the named plaintiff and filed an amended complaint.liberty,the lead underwriter on the policy,is a british corporation incorporated,domiciled,and with its principal place of business in the united kingdom.as with corfield,liberty alleged british citizenship and sought relief on its own behalf and as the representative of all other underwriters subscribing to the policy.recognizing that the amended complaint did nothing to allay the jurisdictional concerns raised by the district court,liberty amended its complaint a second time.in the second amended complaint liberty sought relief on its own behalf and as the lead underwriter of those underwriters subscribing to the policy.again,however,liberty failed to affirmatively allege dgh citizenship,instead alleging that none of dgh partners were british citizens.
the district court entered a second order,this time threatening to dismiss the action without prejudice unless liberty amended its complaint to properly allege dgh citizenship.the district court agreed to defer consideration of liberty citizenship given the split in authority concerning how the citizenship of a lloyd underwriter is to be determined and given that dgh had not yet moved to dismiss the case.liberty amended its complaint once more to allege that all of dgh partners were believed to be citizens of texas,and that no partner was a citizen of the united kingdom.
dgh moved to dismiss the case pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.dgh argued that for diversity purposes the district court must consider the citizenship of every underwriter subscribing to a lloyd policy when determining if complete diversity is satisfied.dgh also asserted that at least one underwriter on the policy was a citizen of texas as was at least one of dgh partners.thus,dgh argued that complete diversity was lacking.
hoping to avoid dismissal,liberty amended its complaint once more.this time liberty alleged claims only on its own behalf as the lead underwriter on the policy.liberty deleted all allegations that it was suing in any type of representative capacity on behalf of the other underwriters.liberty also alleged that all of dgh partners were either citizens of texas,delaware,and new york.the district court nevertheless concluded that the citizenship of each underwriter subscribing to the policy must be considered for purposes of determining whether complete diversity is satisfied.because dgh contended that at least one underwriter was a citizen of texas,the district court concluded that the parties were not completely diverse.the district court therefore granted dgh motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.liberty timely appealed.

principles of jurisdiction 
the federal diversity statute provides that the district courts have original jurisdiction over all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds and is between citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state.a.it is that the diversity statute requires complete diversity of citizenship a district court can not exercise diversity jurisdiction if one of the plaintiffs shares the same state citizenship as any one of the defendants.whalen carter,cir citing strawbridge curtiss,cranch.mas perry,cir.
the citizens upon whose diversity a plaintiff grounds jurisdiction must be real and substantial parties to the controversy.navarro savings lee,d citing mcnutt bland,how.marshall baltimore ohio,how.coal blatchford,wall.thus,a federal court must disregard nominal or formal parties and rest jurisdiction only upon the citizenship of real parties to the controversy.id.at.at.
the sole issue presented in this case is whether complete diversity requires that the court consider the citizenship of every underwriter subscribing to a lloyd of london policy when the lead underwriter sues only on its own behalf.the issue is one of first impression in this circuit and several of our sister circuits have reached different conclusions.however,before addressing the complex jurisdictional issues raised in this case,a basic understanding of the organizational structure of lloyd of london and the unique characteristics of a typical lloyd insurance policy is necessary.
lloyd of london 
lloyds of london is not an insurance company but rather a entity which operates and controls an insurance market.john sylvester roberta anderson,is it still possible to litigate against lloyd in federal court,tort ins.the lloyd entity provides a market for the buying and selling of insurance risk among its members who collectively make up lloyd.certain interested underwriters at lloyd,london layne,cir citing clifford chance,doing business in the united kingdom,to barbara ford,forte,herbert wallace eds.eileen dacey,the structures of the lloyd market,in lloyd,the ilu,and the london insurance market,at,pli commercial law practice course handbook series.thus,a policyholder insures at lloyd but not with lloyd.lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed.citing bickelhaupt,general insurance,ed.
the members or investors who collectively make up lloyd are called names and they are the individuals and corporations who finance the insurance market and ultimately insure risks.sylvester anderson,supra,at.names are underwriters of lloyd insurance and they invest in a percentage of the policy risk in the hope of making return on their investment.squibb,at.lloyd requires names to pay a membership fee,keep certain deposits at lloyd,and possess a certain degree of financial wealth.chemical leaman tank lines,aetna cas.surety,cir.each name is exposed to unlimited personal liability for his proportionate share of the loss on a particular policy that the name has subscribed to as an underwriter.squibb,at.typically hundreds of names will subscribe to a single policy,and the liability among the names is several,not joint.id.
most names or investors do not actively participate in the insurance market on a day to day basis.layne,at.rather,the business of insuring risk at lloyd is carried on by groups of names called syndicates.id.at.in order to increase the efficiency of underwriting risks,a group of names will,for a given operating year,form a syndicate which will in turn subscribe to policies on behalf of all names in the syndicate.squibb,at chemical leaman,at.a typical lloyd policy has multiple syndicates which collectively are responsible for percent of the coverage provided by a policy.sylvester anderson,supra,at.the syndicates themselves have been said to have no independent legal identity.id.thus,a syndicate is a creature of administrative convenience through which individual investors can subscribe to a lloyd policy.a syndicate bears no liability for the risk on a lloyd policy.rather,all liability is born by the individual names who belong to the various syndicates that have subscribed to a policy.
each syndicate appoints a managing agent who is responsible for the underwriting and management of each name investments.chemical leaman,at.the managing agent receives this authority through contracts with each name.id.the managing agent,which is typically a legal entity,appoints one of its employees to serve as the active underwriter for the syndicate.id.at.the active underwriter selects the risks that the names in the syndicate will underwrite and has the authority to bind all names in the syndicate.id.the active underwriter has the authority to buy and sell insurance risks on behalf of all names in the syndicate,and to bind the syndicate members in these transactions.layne,at.
in practice,since many names through their respective syndicates are liable on a lloyd policy,the active underwriter from one of the underwriting syndicates is designated as the representative of all the names on the policy.squibb,at.this single underwriter,called the lead underwriter on the policy,is usually the only name disclosed on the policy with all other names remaining anonymous.id.the lead underwriter is typically the first to subscribe to the policy and typically assumes the greatest amount of risk.the lloyd corporate entity maintains records on the identity and last known residence of names insuring risk in the lloyd market.that information is kept strictly confidential.
in sum,while an insured receives a lloyd policy of insurance,what he has in fact received are numerous contractual commitments from each name who has agreed to subscribe to the risk.the names are jointly and severally obligated to the insured for the percentage of the risk each has agreed to assume.the insured does not have to sue each name individually however to collect on their individual promises because the typical lloyd policy contains a clause providing that any name can appear as representative of all names.id.thus,when litigation ensues over a lloyd policy,the only named lloyd party appearing in the litigation is usually the lead underwriter on the policy.id.the standard lloyd policy states that in any suit instituted against any one of the names upon this contract,all the names will abide by the final decision of such court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.id.thus,each name is contractually bound on an individual basis to the insured to adhere to any adverse judgment reached in the suit notwithstanding that only one name participates in the litigation as a named party.thus,a syndicate,being only a grouping of names,has no contractual relationship with the insured.
in the instant case,syndicate is a syndicate with liberty as its sole name and underwriting member.liberty is the lead underwriter on the policy and insures percent of the risk which is more than the risk insured by any other name on the policy liberty is a british corporation with its principal place of business in the united kingdom.thus,if only liberty citizenship is relevant for jurisdictional purposes,then the parties are completely diverse because dgh is a citizen of texas,delaware,and new york.if,however,the citizenship of every name subscribing to the policy is relevant for jurisdictional purposes,then the district court dismissal was proper as liberty has not alleged the citizenship of all names subscribing to the policy,and at least one name is believed to be a citizen of texas.
law and analysis 
several of our sister circuit courts have addressed the lloyd citizenship conundrum and have reached differing results based upon differing reasoning.in certain interested underwriters at lloyd,london layne,cir,lloyd had brought a declaratory judgment action seeking to deny coverage under a policy.defendants were tennessee citizens and the plaintiff lloyd underwriters were citizens of great britain.defendants,who sought to vacate an adverse judgment,argued that the were really agents or representatives of the subscribing syndicates.thus,defendants argued that the court should have looked to the citizenship of the subscribing syndicates in order to determine whether the parties were completely diverse.analogizing a lloyd syndicate to an unincorporated association,defendants argued that a lloyd syndicate has the citizenship of every name in the syndicate.
the sixth circuit began its analysis with the real party to the controversy test.id.at citing carden,at.wright,federal practice proc.ed.under this test,if one of the nondiverse parties is not a real party in interest,and is purely a formal or nominal party,his presence may be ignored when determining jurisdiction.id.citing salem trust manuf.fin.noting that federal rule of civil procedure a requires that every action be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,the court stated that the real party in interest analysis turns upon whether the substantive law creating the right being sued upon affords the party bringing the suit a substantive right to relief.id.at citing swanson bixler,cir american bank trust weyerhaeuser,cir wright,supra,at.the sixth circuit,citing erie railroad tompkins,concluded that tennessee law should apply to determine whether the had a substantive right to relief.id.
applying tennessee law,the sixth circuit concluded that the were liable on the contract because they had functioned as agents for undisclosed principals the syndicates.because under tennessee law an agent for an undisclosed principal is personally liable on a contract,the underwriters were found to be real parties in interest.id.at.further,under tennessee law,once the agent is sued,the principal is no longer liable.thus,once the agent underwriter became the party sued,the principal syndicates had no further interest in the case.id.given that the syndicates had no interest in the case after the underwriter was sued,they were not real parties to the controversy and their citizenship could be ignored.id.accordingly,the court looked only to the citizenship of the when determining whether complete diversity existed.
four years later,the seventh circuit decided indiana gas home insurance,cir.indiana gas sued its insurers for indemnity on environmental cleanup costs.while the case was on appeal,the parties informed the court that at least one subscribing name on the lloyd policy was a citizen of same state of citizenship as the plaintiff indiana gas.the seventh circuit focused its analysis on the syndicates as the appropriate entities to either sue or be sued on a lloyd policy.concluding that a syndicate had all the characteristics of a limited partnership,the court concluded that a syndicate has the citizenship of every name belonging to the syndicate just as a partnership has the citizenship of every partner.id.at.the court noted that this rule applied to partnerships regardless of whether partners were named in the lawsuit.id.at.the seventh circuit interpreted carden arkoma associates,d,as articulating a general rule that every association other than a corporation must be treated like a partnership for citizenship purposes.id.thus,according to the seventh circuit,the syndicates must be treated as entities and the citizenship of every subscribing name must be considered when determining a syndicate citizenship.just as a plaintiff can not ignore partners to save jurisdiction,a plaintiff can not ignore or dismiss names in a syndicate.id.at.
in reaching its conclusion,the seventh circuit rejected every aspect of layne,concluding that the sixth circuit had failed to factor in that liability vel non on a contract does not control the citizenship inquiry.id.at.for instance,limited partners can not be sued and are not liable for a partnership acts yet their citizenship can not be ignored.id.according to indiana gas,the underwriting syndicates must be treated like partnerships when determining citizenship.id.thus,pursuant to carden,the citizenship of every name on the policy must be considered when determining whether diversity is complete.
later that same year,the second circuit decided squibb sons,accident casualty insurance,cir squibb i.in squibb i,a coverage dispute against lloyd had been pending in the district court for nearly sixteen years and had culminated in a jury verdict favorable to squibb.when the case finally hit the appellate court,the second circuit sua sponte questioned whether diversity was complete because the lead underwriter had been sued as a representative of all underwriters who had subscribed to the policy.id.at.the second circuit rejected the layne court analysis and agreed with indiana gas in so far as the seventh circuit had concluded that a lead underwriter sued in a representative capacity must reflect the citizenship of every name subscribing to the policy.id.at.after all,federal courts must look to the individuals being represented rather than their collective representative to determine whether diversity of citizenship exists.squibb i,at citing northern trust bunge,cir.because the underwriter was sued as representative,and because the record failed to reflect the citizenship of all names,subject matter jurisdiction was questionable.
however,the second circuit went beyond indiana gas and surmised that the jurisdictional problems surrounding lloyd grew only out of the lead underwriter decision to sue in a representative capacity.in other words,the squibb i court postulated that where the lead underwriter sues or is sued only in his individual capacity,the existence of jurisdiction depends solely on the lead underwriter citizenship.id.at.it would not depend on the status of the other names who,though members of the syndicates at risk,would not be direct parties to the litigation.id.the second circuit rejected the notion that the names citizenship would have to be considered simply because they too would be bound by whatever judgment is rendered against the only name sued.id.the second circuit reasoned that a federal court does not lose jurisdiction simply because a is contractually bound to indemnify the diverse parties.id.as long as the party being sued is a real party to the controversy,the fact that the case will determine the rights of litigants through collateral estoppel or preclusion does not affect jurisdiction.id.because the lead underwriter is severally liable on the policy,he is a real party to the controversy.id.at.thus,where he appears in the litigation solely on an individual basis,only his citizenship need be considered.id.
the squibb i court also found that the supreme court carden decision was not an impediment.because carden applies only to formal entities created under state law,it does not apply in a lloyd context where no formal entity is a party to the suit.id.at.the squibb i court was unconvinced that syndicates are formal entities because t he contractual provision that obligates a name to abide by the judgment rendered against any other name runs vertically between the insured and each name,not horizontally from name to name.thus,a lloyds policy taken as a whole is really a series of independent bilateral contracts from insurer to insured.id.the names are bound in contract to the insured and not to each other and a syndicate bears no liability.see id.therefore,taken as a whole,a syndicate does not constitute an entity.id.rather than render its decision,the second circuit concluded that the case should be remanded to the district court for a determination in the first instance of whether british law and the policy in dispute would allow a suit to proceed against a name individually and whether the names could be dismissed as dispensable parties.id.at.
on remand,the district court concluded that british law and the contracts at issue would permit the suit to proceed against a name in his individual capacity.squibb sons,accident cas.ins,civ,wl,at june,aff,cir.the court went on to conclude that the other names were dispensable parties under rule b because all names were contractually bound by the policies and by the rules of lloyd to abide by any judgment rendered against the lead underwriter.id.at.thus,dismissing the representative claims against the lead underwriter would have no practical effect on any other name.id.because the citizenship of the lone underwriter was diverse from every other opposing party,diversity jurisdiction was met the second circuit ultimately affirmed.squibb sons,lloyd,cir squibb ii.
between squibb i and squibb ii,the third circuit decided chemical leaman tank lines,aetna casualty surety,and held that the citizenship of the underwriter sued on the policy is the only citizenship relevant for diversity purposes.at.the insured had sued certain underwriters at lloyd,london subscribing to insurance policies specifically enumerated.id.at.the parties later stipulated to an amended complaint in which one of the individual underwriters on behalf of himself and all other underwriters at lloyd,london,subscribing to specifically enumerated policies substituted for certain underwriters.the parties also stipulated that any final judgment for or against the sole party underwriter would be binding on those underwriters subscribing to the enumerated policies prior to the entry of final judgment,the parties brought to the court attention a decision rendered by another court in the same district in which the district court held that the citizenship of all underwriters on a lloyd policy had to be taken into account in determining diversity jurisdiction,north river ins.no party,however,challenged jurisdiction and the court proceeded to enter final judgment.
on appeal,the third circuit,without reference to any other circuit court decision,held that the citizenship of the underwriter sued on the policy was the only citizenship relevant for diversity purposes.at.although the amended complaint alleged that the underwriter was there individually as well as in a representative capacity,the third circuit concluded that the claim was really only one against the named underwriter individually.id.at.the court reasoned that the plaintiff had not brought suit against the underwriter as an agent of the other underwriters or against the syndicates of which they were members or against the underwriter as agent for his syndicate.id.at.the court also noted that the names shared no common liability,each being liable only for the share of the risk each had assumed.id.at.moreover,the district court had not certified a defendant class of underwriters,which according to the third circuit,would have been the only way that the underwriter could have truly been sued in a representative capacity.see id.thus,the claim against the underwriter was one against him individually.and because each name was liable only for his share of the risk,and because joint and several
