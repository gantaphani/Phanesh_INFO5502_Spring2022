the issue in this case is whether a workers compensation insurer is immune from civil liability under insurance code section for allegedly misallocating an insured employer expenses and reporting that misinformation to a ratemaking organization,resulting in higher premiums for its insured.the trial court denied petitioner state compensation insurance fund scif motion for judgment on the pleadings,and the court of appeal summarily denied the insurer petition for writ of mandate and request for immediate stay.while the question is close,we conclude section does not immunize scif from civil liability under these circumstances.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal summarily denying the petition for writ of mandate and discharge the order to show cause.
factual and procedural background 
prior to january,minimum premiums for workers compensation insurance were set by the department of insurance former,stats,ch,repealed by stats,ch.in calculating premiums,the department relied on the workers compensation insurance rating bureau rating bureau to gather and process the relevant financial information from insurers.scif is a public enterprise fund,established by law as a competitive insurance carrier.hanna,cal.law of employee injuries and workers compensation,tancor,workers compensation system,to.
in april,plaintiffs schaefer ambulance service,sectran security,and universal courier limited collectively schaefer,on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,filed a first amended class action complaint against scif.schaefer alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and negligence,and sought declaratory relief,compensatory and punitive damages,attorney fees,and costs.
plaintiffs alleged they were typical members of an ascertainable class of approximately business entities within the state of california who have purchased workers compensation liability insurance from scif during the calendar years january,through december,and who,during that relevant time period,have had claims litigated against them by one or more of their injured workers.each insured policy for the relevant years was identical.the policy provided that a ll premium s for this policy will be determined by the workers compensation insurance rating bureau manuals of rules,rates,rating plans and classifications.
schaefer alleged scif had misallocated and then misreported the insureds financial information to the rating bureau.in order to calculate the premium to be charged by scif to its insureds,the rating bureau considers a variety of factors,including what is known as the experience modification factor.this factor involves in part a comparison of the expected losses of all employers to the actual incurred losses plus reserve estimates of the insured employer at issue.
scif forwards the financial information of its insureds to the rating bureau in unit statistical reports.each report contains three columns indemnity,medical,and defense expense or allocated loss expense.only the financial information reported in the indemnity and medical expense columns,not in the defense expense column,is used by the rating bureau to compute an insured experience modification factor.reports requested by the employer or insurer that were not prepared by the attending physician are properly allocated as defense expenses.nevertheless,scif either intentionally or negligently misreported such expenses as medical expenses to the rating bureau.hence,the insureds experience modification factor was artificially inflated,which in turn allowed scif to collect excessive premiums.
schaefer further alleged that scif had a policy of refusing to provide to its insured s access to all individual claims files,refusing to provide its own insureds the ability to audit monitor the manner in which scif has represented them in various workers compensation actions,and barring its own insureds from having access to any information,including a showing of how medical legal reports on workers compensation claims are reported to the wcirb.these policies were designed by scif to prohibit insureds from auditing,questioning,or in any manner attempting to determine whether scif performed reasonably in administering the claims of the insureds,and to prevent an insured from discovering scif intentional or negligent manipulation of the reserves and misreporting of financial information to the wcirb.
in response to scif motion for summary judgment,the civil action was stayed for several years while schaefer pursued its administrative remedies.on august,the rating bureau determined that scif had improperly reported expenses for nonattending physician reports requested by the employer or insurer as incurred medical,not defense,expenses.it stated,expenses for reports prior to january,should and could only have fallen within the category of defense expense for reporting under the unit statistical plan,so long as they did not include expenses for actual medical treatment.the rating bureau directed scif to submit revised unit statistical reports for schaefer ambulance service,sectran security,and universal courier limited for the years january,to january,january,to january,and december,to december,respectively 
scif appealed the rating bureau decision to the classification and rating committee of the rating bureau,which on january,after further argument and briefing,upheld the bureau determination.scif then appealed the decision to the insurance commissioner.an evidentiary hearing was held in december before an administrative law judge,who received numerous documentary exhibits and heard two days testimony from the parties expert witnesses.on may,the administrative law judge issued a proposed decision affirming the rating bureau and stating,the bureau correctly determined that the unit statistical plan provisions in effect from january,until january,require the costs of medical examination reports,provided by medical experts other than an attending physician,to be allocated as defense expenses in unit reports to the bureau.the insurance commissioner adopted the proposed decision on may.according to scif,on january,the commissioner made this determination binding on all workers compensation insurers.
in september,scif filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court to direct the commissioner to vacate his order.on march,the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate and entered judgment in may.in may,the court of appeal affirmed.state comp.ins.fund quackenbush may,nonpub.opn.
on march,the civil action stay was lifted.in may,scif moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the action was barred by section.the trial court denied the motion,and the court of appeal summarily denied scif ensuing petition for writ of mandate and immediate stay request.scif petitioned for review,and we issued an order to show cause why the relief sought in scif petition should not be granted.
ii.discussion 
section,contained in article,chapter,part of division of the insurance code,the statute at issue in this case,provides no act done,action taken or agreement made pursuant to the authority conferred by this article shall constitute a violation of or grounds for prosecution or civil proceedings under any other law of this state heretofore or hereafter enacted which does not specifically refer to insurance.former section,which also appeared in article,provided,prior to its amendment in the purpose of this article is to promote the public welfare by regulating concert of action between insurers in collecting and tabulating rating information and other data that may be helpful in the making of adequate minimum rates for workers compensation insurance and for employers liability insurance incidental thereto and written in connection therewith for all admitted insurers and in submitting them to the commissioner for issuance or approval to authorize and regulate the existence and cooperation of qualified rating organizations to one of which each workers compensation insurer shall belong to authorize and regulate cooperation between insurers,rating organizations and advisory organizations in rate making and other related matters to the end that the purposes of this chapter may be complied with and carried into effect.stats,ch,see now,present substituting pure premium rates for minimum rates,changing issuance or approval to approval and changing spelling of ratemaking.
schaefer asserts that section grants immunity only for antitrust or concert of action claims,not claims that an insurer engaged in unilateral misconduct.along these lines,it disagrees with scif that this is a ratemaking case rather it is simply a garden variety bad faith insurance dispute.scif contends this is a ratemaking case,and that section bars all civil claims arising from workers compensation disputes,unless brought under a statute which specifically relates to insurance.since none of schaefer claims are brought under such a statute,they are barred by section.scif concedes,however,that schaefer dispute with scif relates to the alleged misreporting of costs,not the calculation of rates,experience modifications or premiums.
by its terms,section refers to an act done,action taken or agreement made pursuant to the authority conferred by this article italics added.it does not refer to an act done,action taken or agreement made pursuant to this article.as relevant here,what is authorized by article is cooperation between insurers,rating organizations and advisory organizations in ratemaking and other related matters to the end that the purposes of this chapter may be complied with and carried into effect.such activity would arguably otherwise be barred by the antitrust laws.thus,in order for the miscalculating and misreporting of loss information to fall within the scope of section immunity,it appears it must be related to such authorized cooperation in ratemaking and other related matters.
arguably,an insurer act of reporting financial information to a rating organization is inextricably tied to the operation of a rating organization.that is,while the act of reporting or misreporting financial information is a unilateral act,it results in a rating organization receiving sufficient information from each insurer that it can set a minimum rate and appropriate premiums for each insured.
here,however,schaefer does not contend the mere act of reporting financial information to the rating bureau was misconduct.in particular,schaefer does not allege that scif violated any antitrust laws by reporting such information.nor does it challenge the manner in which premiums or rates are set by the rating bureau.rather,it disputes the manner in which scif analyzed and allocated schaefer financial data prior to the data being sent to the rating bureau.the rating bureau presumably had no way of knowing,absent an audit,that medical reports of nonattending physicians were included in the reported figure for schaefer medical expenses.
of course,schaefer also alleges that scif misreported schaefer medical expenses to the rating bureau,and this led to the imposition of excessive premiums.however,while not addressing section,numerous courts of appeal decisions in other contexts have sanctioned civil claims against scif and other workers compensation insurers alleging that their misconduct resulted in unjustifiably higher premiums.in all of these cases,the insurer had to first report the misinformation to the rating bureau before the premiums could be affected.
thus,in security officers service,state compensation ins.fund th,d security officers service,the insured employer alleged that scif misconduct,including its failing to promptly resolve claims and assigning excessive reserves for unresolved claims,increased plaintiff experience modification rating and caused its premiums to rise to unwarranted levels.while scif apparently did not raise section as a defense in that case,the court rejected scif tort immunity claim,and stated the insurer may be liable if it processes claims and sets reserves without good faith regard for their impact on the insured premiums.security officers service,at,d see notrica state compensation ins.fund th,d reversing punitive damages award but otherwise affirming judgment against scif,including jury implicit finding scif had failed to estimate reasonable claim reserves,resulting in notrica paying higher premiums and receiving lower dividends macgregor yacht state compensation ins.fund th,d upholding trial court ruling that scif breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by improperly overestimating claims reserves and ineffectively investigating claims leading to higher experience modification factor and thus higher premiums lance camper republic indemnity of america th,d insured challenging practices that increased the insurer reported losses,which resulted in higher premiums,higher reserves,and lower dividends,could pursue breach of contract and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims without exhausting administrative remedies tricor california,state compensation ins.fund th,d claim that scif engaged in bad faith in settling individual policy claims to artificially inflate its reserves and tricor premiums,and deflate tricor dividends was not a dispute,and could be pursued as a civil claim without exhausting administrative remedies new plumbing contractors,nationwide mutual ins.th,d employer that assigned its subrogation rights to its workers compensation insurer had no cause of action for negligence or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when carrier did not actively pursue those rights,leading to unrecoverable higher premiums,because nothing in the relevant statutes requires subrogation rights to be pursued in a particular manner,and insured was not complaining about receipt of policy benefits.
given that premiums set for workers compensation policies are dependent in part on the financial information submitted by the insurer,insurer misconduct in handling the insured workers compensation claims or other financial information can always potentially result in higher premiums.if we were to extend section immunity to the claims alleged in this case regarding analyzing and reporting financial information,liability for misconduct that resulted in higher premiums would arguably also be precluded in these other contexts.it is doubtful section intended to paint with so broad a brush.indeed,section,subdivision a expressly provides that scif may s ue and be sued in all actions arising out of any act or omission in connection with its business or affairs.moreover,while schaefer prevailed in the administrative proceedings,scif does not point to any authority allowing the insurance commissioner to order a carrier to refund all improperly collected premiums to the insured.
interpreting section to only apply to concerted activity otherwise barred by the antitrust laws,and not to the individual misconduct of an insurer regarding its insured,is also supported by section legislative history.in,the united states supreme court held that the insurance business constituted interstate commerce subject to sherman act antitrust prosecution for insurer conspiracy to fix premium rates and monopolize trade and commerce in certain insurance areas.united states underwriters.south eastern.congress subsequently granted insurers a moratorium from the sherman act,clayton act,and federal trade commission act until june,at which time they would become applicable to the extent that the insurance business is not regulated by state law.b.in response,the california legislature enacted the insurance regulatory act of.this act included section which has language virtually identical to section.
in a letter to governor warren,deputy insurance commissioner maloney stated,it is generally conceded that concert of action in the making of insurance rates is not only desirable but necessary by reason of the very nature of insurance.accordingly,to prevent the application of the federal laws to this necessary activity in the insurance field of interstate commerce it is essential that state legislation be enacted to affirmatively authorize such concert of action in the making of insurance rates to the extent consistent with the public interest
