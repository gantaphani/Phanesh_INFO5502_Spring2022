on october,ernest edwards suffered injuries during a hunting excursion when a safety harness securing him to a tree malfunctioned,causing him to fall seventeen feet to the ground.on july,edwards filed suit in the federal district court in maine against the safety harness manufacturer,game tracker,edwards wife was also a plaintiff in the action but nothing turns on her participation.on february,edwards obtained a default judgment against game tracker,which by then had filed for bankruptcy protection.
unable to execute on the judgment against game tracker,edwards and his wife sued in the same federal court under maine reach and apply statute,seeking to collect from lexington insurance company,game tracker insurer lexington had previously received notice of edwards suit against game tracker and had disclaimed coverage under all three policies that lexington had issued to game tracker and its affiliates.
in due course,lexington moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted,finding that none of the three policies at issue covered edwards claim against game tracker a policy because edwards had failed to provide notice of the claim to game tracker or lexington within the required period an occurrence policy because the policy contained an endorsement excluding injuries caused by safety belts and harnesses and a third policy both because notice was not timely made and because the insured was gorilla,not game tracker.edwards now appeals the rulings as to the first two policies.
we review a district court entry of summary judgment de novo,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and indulging reasonable inferences in his favor.iverson city of boston,cir.the moving party is entitled to summary judgment if the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also anderson liberty lobby,d.
edwards first seeks satisfaction of the judgment against game tracker under a policy issued by lexington to game tracker.the policy would have covered an incident such as the one suffered by edwards,but only if notice of a claim was provided to either game tracker or lexington during the claim period,which ran from april to june.
during discovery,lexington sought proof that edwards had provided notice within the claim period.although asked the question three different ways,edwards could not state that he had provided notice to game tracker,its affiliates,or lexington during the notice period.instead,he said that attempts to locate and contact game tracker were made in the winter of,that his attorney at some unspecified point had telephone conversations with one or more game tracker representatives,and that formal notice was provided to game tracker in january the required date.
based on edwards failure to provide evidence establishing timely that one would expect to be available to a plaintiff or his attorney if timely notice was district court found that there was no genuine dispute of material fact and that for lack of timely notice,the insurance policy did not cover edwards claim.edwards does not now argue that notice was timely provided but instead offers reasons why the policy unambiguous notice requirement should not preclude coverage.
edwards first argues that lexington breached its duty to defend game tracker in edwards initial action against game tracker.on this premise,he argues that lexington is estopped from disclaiming coverage now alternatively,edwards says that under maine law lexington at least bore the burden of proving as a result of that earlier alleged dereliction in failing to provide a defense.
edwards was not a party to the insurance contract,or a third party beneficiary,or the insured assignee.maine reach and apply statute places edwards in game tracker shoes to the extent he seeks whatever indemnification might have been owed to game tracker under its insurance policies.less clear is edwards ability to claim benefits or advantage based on other contractual duties owed by the insurer to the insured,such as the duty to defend 
indeed,the extent to which an injured third party steps into the shoes of the insured when proceeding against the insurer is a question that arises in diverse contexts,affecting the claims available to the injured party and the defenses available to the insurer.case law varies among the states the answer may also vary depending on the nature of the insurance contract,the language of the statute under which the injured third party is proceeding,and the balancing of competing policy concerns.
the maine sjc has not yet clearly determined whether an injured third party may generally seek the collateral benefits of a breach of the duty to defend which would otherwise belong to the insured.compare elliott hanover ins,me allowing claim by an injured third party who was an assignee of the insured,with smith allstate ins,me injured third party has no judicially protectible interest in whether the insurer or independent counsel secured by insured provides the insured defense in a negligence action against him.
however,edwards estoppel argument was expressly rejected in elliott,which said that a n insurer that breaches its duty to defend is not estopped from asserting noncoverage as a defense in a subsequent action brought by the insured or the insured assignee.at see also bucci essex ins,cir.elliott does say that an insurer that breached its duty to defend may be bound in an indemnity action by any factual issues that might have been litigated in the underlying negligence action,at,but here the timing of the claim was not among the facts necessary to prove the insured liability.see bucci,at.
nor has edwards established that the duty to defend was breached,which under maine law might have triggered a shift in the burden of proof as to coverage for the purpose of indemnification.elliott,at.the problem for edwards is that in order to shift the burden of proof with regard to indemnification,he first had to show that there was a breach of the duty to defend.and to do so,he had to prove that a claim was timely made otherwise,there was neither a duty to defend nor to indemnify the insured.
the evidence as to notice is clearly inadequate to prove timely notice was given.lexington,in an affidavit and in response to an interrogatory from edwards,said that it did not receive notice of edwards claim from edwards,game tracker,or anyone else,until july,over a year after the expiration of the claim period.and,as already explained,edwards offered evidence only that formal written notice of claim,was provided to game tracker in january of,that is,after the close of the claim period.
edwards counters with the eight corners rule,according to which the duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations in the underlying complaint with the provisions of the insurance policy.if a complaint reveals a potential that the facts ultimately proved may come within the coverage,a duty to defend exists.edwards argues that therefore the district court should have compared the complaint in the underlying action with the insurance policy to determine whether there was a duty to defend,and that the district court erred in considering extrinsic evidence relating to notice.
grounded in policy considerations,the eight corners rule is appropriately invoked in the context of occurrence policies because the complaint in describing the incident will usually provide adequate information to determine least as incident is within the scope of the insurance policy.see liberty mut.ins.graham,cir.however,the rule can not be rigidly applied in the context of policies where the determinative event is the timing of the claim,a fact that likely will in this case to the merits of the underlying tort suit,and therefore absent from the pleadings the district court thus did not err in finding that edwards failed to show a wrongful refusal to defend,given that the uncontradicted evidence established that their claim was not timely made.
turning to the insurance contract itself,edwards argues that the policy is ambiguous.he does not say that the l
