the colorado auto accident reparations act.repealed july,act or act,was enacted in with the purpose of avoiding inadequate compensation to all victims of automobile accidents in the state of colorado.reid geico ins,cir.the act required automobile insurance policies to include certain minimum or basic personal injury protection pip benefits to compensate injured persons for medical expenses and lost wages resulting from an automobile accident.id.the act also required insurers to offer the named insured optional apip benefits,in exchange for higher premiums.a.specifically,the act stated 
every insurer shall offer the following enhanced benefits for inclusion in a complying policy,in addition to the basic coverages described in section,at the option of the named insured 
i compensation of all expenses of the type described in section b medical and expenses up to per person per accident without dollar or time limitation or 
ii compensation of all expenses of the type described in section b without dollar or time limitations and payment of benefits equivalent to percent of loss of gross income per week from work the injured person would have performed had such injured person not been injured during the period commencing on the day after the date of accident without dollar or time limitations.
subsequent to the district court decision and contrary to its conclusion,the colorado court of appeals held that insurers must offer both kinds of enhanced coverage to comply with the statute,rather than at the option of the insurer.soto progressive mountain ins,wl,at.july,unpublished cert.pending see also reid,at applying soto.failure to make a compliant offer of apip benefits violates the statute and results in automatic reformation of the contract to include such additional coverage.thompson,at.the act does,however,allow insurers to cap apip benefits at per person.a.
austin travelers policy included basic pip coverage,but not apip coverage.as part of the application process for this policy,austin signed a supplementary personal injury form pip form,and an acord application form.the pip form explained that travelers offered benefits for medical expenses,rehabilitation expenses,work loss,essential services expenses and death compensation resulting from an eligible person injuries caused by an auto accident.supp.app.at.the pip form also offered two forms of additional personal injury protection option ra and option rarb.option ra offered,inter alia,a maximum of in medical expenses,a maximum of in rehabilitation expenses,and a maximum of per week in wage loss expenses for up to weeks.all benefits under option ra were subject to a maximum aggregate.option rarb offered,inter alia,up to a maximum aggregate for medical and rehabilitation expenses,and up to per week in wage loss expenses with no time limit subject to the same maximum aggregate.austin declined both forms of enhanced coverage.
in allstate ins.parfrey,the colorado supreme court held that an insurer must offer insurance coverage in a manner reasonably calculated to permit the potential purchaser to make an informed decision.at.in determining whether an insurer complied with this standard,courts must look to the totality of circumstances.id.at.in doing so,courts may appropriately consider 
the clarity with which the purpose of coverage was explained to the insured,whether the explanation was made orally or in writing,the specificity of the options made known to the insured,the price at which the different levels of coverage would be purchased,and any other circumstances bearing on the adequacy and clarity of the notification and offer.
under the summary judgement standard,therefore,travelers was required to support its motion with evidence that it had made a statutorily compliant offer of apip coverage to the insured in this case.after reviewing the record,we conclude that travelers did not establish it made an offer of apip coverage in compliance with.a ii.that portion of the statute requires insurers to offer an apip coverage option that includes,among other things,payment of benefits equivalent to percent of loss of gross income per week from work the injured person would have performed had such injured person not been injured.a ii emphasis added.the closest option travelers offered on the pip form was option rarb,which only provided for per week in work loss payments supp.app.at.this amount could be insufficient to compensate for an percent loss of gross income in many cases.additionally,the pip form on which the apip coverage options appear do not list their prices.id.consequently,travelers apip coverage options on the pip form did not comply with the statute and were not offered in a manner reasonably calculated to permit the potential purchaser to make an informed decision.parfrey,at 
travelers contends that even if the apip coverage options described on the pip form were statutorily deficient,the apip coverage options on the acord form were compliant.travelers points to the fact that this form explicitly lists apip coverage options,including an option for wage loss benefits unlimited in time unlimited in weekly amount.aple.br.at emphasis in original see also supp.app.at.thus,travelers argues,the acord form offers an option for apip coverage even greater than set forth under section a ii.aple.br.at.we are not persuaded this was a compliant offer.
the section of the acord form that travelers refers to is merely a series of tiny boxes in the middle of an extensive application form.see supp.app.at.if not explained by an agent,these boxes could be confusing.id.there is a weekly work loss benefit box,for instance,located next to an empty box which,in turn,is located next to a box containing a dollar sign,a space presumably where the applicant can fill in a dollar amount and the words per week.there is also a box called no weekly limit.these boxes contain no explanations about what a weekly work loss benefit might entail,no instructions as to how the boxes needed to be filled in to purchase such benefits,no price information,and no discussion
