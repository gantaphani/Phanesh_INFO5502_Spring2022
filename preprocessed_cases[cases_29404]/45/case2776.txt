this appeal arises from a dispute between excess insurers of comprehensive general liability.the trial court ruled that appellant rli insurance company rli and respondent fireman fund insurance company fireman fund insured the same risk and had competing other insurance clauses.it therefore ordered rli to contribute to fireman fund settlement of a personal injury lawsuit against the insured.
on appeal,rli contends that it was not obligated to contribute to the settlement on an equal basis with fireman fund because the insuring agreement in its policy made it excess to the coverage fireman fund provided.we find merit in rli argument and must therefore reverse the judgment.
background 
the facts of the underlying lawsuit are undisputed and need be recounted only briefly.carmel development company carmel was the general contractor on a project to construct golf and residential facilities in monterey county.for the concrete work carmel subcontracted with largo concrete company largo,which in turn subcontracted with cab concrete for a portion of the work.on january,abel vargas,a cab employee,was severely injured on the work site.in april he and his wife sued both carmel and largo.largo settled with the vargases,but carmel proceeded to trial.a jury subsequently awarded and vargas a total of in damages 
carmel had a commercial general liability cgl policy issued by reliance insurance company reliance,as well as a million excess liability policy from fireman fund.largo had a primary cgl policy with acceptance insurance company acceptance and a commercial umbrella policy with rli.reliance and fireman fund settled the vargas action for million,with reliance paying its policy limits of million and fireman fund paying million.
carmel then sued acceptance and rli,seeking a judicial determination that it was an additional insured under the acceptance policy and that rli,as excess insurer,was obligated to contribute to the vargas settlement after the acceptance limits were met.fireman fund joined in carmel allegations by intervening in the action.rli filed a against carmel,fireman fund,and reliance.
at trial fireman fund contended that it and rli were both excess insurers,whose policies contained irreconcilable other insurance clauses.rli maintained that its policy was second level excess,which applied only when all other insurance exhausts,including the fireman fund policy.
the trial court found that carmel was an additional insured under the acceptance and rli policies issued to largo.as excess insurers,both fireman fund and rli were obligated to provide coverage when their respective underlying carriers,reliance and acceptance,had exhausted their policy limits.because rli and fireman fund had competing other insurance clauses,the court found it appropriate to require them both to contribute to the settlement amount.the court accordingly allocated the parties payment obligations in proportion to their policy limits,resulting in rli duty to contribute to the settlement 
discussion 
scope of review 
the sole issue before us is whether the trial court correctly interpreted the terms of the fireman fund and rli policies such that equitable contribution was appropriate.this question calls for an interpretation of the policy terms,which is,as with any other contract,a matter of law to be reviewed de novo on appeal.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,continental ins.lexington ins.th,d.accordingly,the policy must be construed as an entirety,with each clause lending meaning to the other.holz rubber,american star ins.cal d.whether the court properly applied equity in prorating the parties indemnity obligations,a matter of judicial discretion centennial ins.united states fire ins.th,d,is not at issue in this appeal.
principles of equitable contribution 
when two insurers cover the same level of liability,both primary or both excess on the same risk as to the same insured,courts may require each to contribute to the cost of defending the claim or indemnifying the loss.maryland cas.nationwide mutual ins.th,d dart industries,commercial union ins.cal th,fn,d.as explained in fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d,t he right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.accord,travelers cas.and sur.century sur.th,d.
in determining whether these equitable principles apply to two insurers at the same level,courts often compare the other insurance clauses of the policies.most insurance policies contain other insurance clauses that attempt to limit the insurer liability to the extent that other insurance covers the same risk.such clauses attempt to control the manner in which each insurer contributes to or shares a covered loss citation.travelers casualty surety american equity ins.th,d.although courts honor coverage terms,including other insurance clauses,whenever possible,where the policies of two or more insurers of a common insured,providing the same level of coverage for the same risk,contain conflicting other insurance clauses if one insurer pays more than its share of the loss or defense costs without participation from the other insurer or insurers,a right to contribution arises.id.at,d,citing fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d see also cse ins.group northbrook property casualty th,d when two other insurance clauses collide,the courts will force both carriers to prorate,in derogation of the policy language.
even when one other insurance clause provides for pro rata coverage while the other purports to be excess only,courts generally favor proration,because the prevailing judicial view is that imposing the entire liability for a loss on the former would annul that policy language,and create the anomaly that courts will enforce proration between policies only when they both have conflicting excess other insurance language barring proration.fireman fund ins.maryland cas.th,d century surety united pacific ins.th,d.giving excess other insurance clauses priority over policies providing for pro rata apportionment of liability among policies is completely unrelated to the original historical purpose of such other insurance clauses,which was to prevent multiple recoveries by insureds in cases of overlapping insurance policies providing coverage for the same loss.for these reasons,among others t he general rule,when multiple polices share the same risk but have inconsistent other insurance clauses,is to prorate according to the policy limits.citation.fireman fund ins.maryland cas,supra,th at,d accord,century surety united pacific ins,supra,th at,d.
applicability of equitable contribution 
in this case each of the policies at issue included an other insurance clause purporting to be excess over other available insurance.the conditions section of fireman fund policy stated,other insurance.if there is any other insurance this policy shall apply as excess of and not contributory with such insurance.other insurance was defined as insurance,other than primary insurance or insurance which is specifically purchased by the named insured to be in excess of the insurance afforded by this policy,which is available to the insured and affords coverage for injury or damage to which this policy applies.rli other insurance condition stated,whenever the insured is covered by other primary,excess or insurance not scheduled on this policy as scheduled underlying insurance,this policy shall apply only in excess of,and will not contribute with,such other insurance.this policy shall not be subject to the terms,conditions or limitations of such other insurance.
the trial court found these two clauses to be in irreconcilable conflict,thereby necessitating the parties contribution on a pro rata basis.were we to limit our analysis on appeal to these provisions,we would uphold the trial court decision,because both clauses do purport to be excess over each other and rli does not contest the court exercise of discretion.in our analysis,however,we will not read these provisions in isolation.instead,we must first address the underlying premise that the parties provided the same level of coverage.this question requires a broader examination of each policy to ascertain the context in which the other insurance provisions appeared.only if the two policies were insuring the same risk at the same level of coverage will we proceed to determine whether the other insurance clauses conflicted and thus required equitable proration.see reliance nat.indem.general star indem.th,d other insurance clauses become relevant only when several insurers insure the same risk at the same level of coverage travelers casualty surety american equity ins,supra,th,d same see also commerce industry ins.chubb custom ins.th,d predicate for prorating policies with conflicting other insurance provisions is that they operate on the same level of coverage accord,century surety united pacific ins,supra,th at,d.we therefore turn to the insuring language of each policy.
the insuring clause of the fireman fund policy stated,subject to the other provisions of this policy,we will pay on behalf of the insured those sums in excess of primary insurance that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages.the amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in section of insurance.thus,fireman fund clearly provided a policy specifically excess to that of the primary insurer,which was defined as reliance.
rli insuring agreement promised,subject to the terms,conditions and exclusions of this policy,to pay all sums which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as ultimate net loss,because of bodily injury and property damage or personal injury or advertising injury caused by an occurrence which takes place during the policy period under the next paragraph,limits of liability,rli stated that it would be liable only for the ultimate net loss in excess of.the applicable limits of scheduled underlying insurance stated in item of the declarations,for occurrences covered by scheduled underlying insurance,plus the limits of any unscheduled underlying insurance which also provides coverage for such occurrences 
the boldfaced terms were defined in a subsequent section.ultimate net loss represented the amount for which the insured was liable after deducting for all other recoveries and salvages,and it excluded certain payments,fees,and expenses.the term scheduled underlying insurance referred to the policies listed in the schedule of underlying insurance,which for comprehensive general liability meant the policy issued by acceptance.the term unscheduled underlying insurance was defined as any insurance policies available to any insured whether primary,excess,or otherwise except the policies listed in the schedule of underlying insurance.
it is apparent from the language of these basic insuring provisions that rli and fireman fund did not place themselves in the same position with respect to other carriers.fireman fund undertook to provide coverage immediately upon exhaustion of reliance policy limits,whereas rli obligated itself to step in only when the limits of both the acceptance policy and all other available and exceeded.
fireman fund,however,points out that its agreement to pay the excess of primary insurance was expressly made subject to the other provisions of this policy.fireman fund argues that through this conditional language the policy incorporated the other insurance clause,thereby making it,like the rli policy,excess to both scheduled and unscheduled insurance.the plain language of the fireman fund agreement,however,provided coverage to the insured upon exhaustion of the reliance policy limits.its insuring language did not clearly and unequivocally inform the insured that it was excess over all other insurance,primary and excess,but buried its limitation on the second to the last page in a generally worded other insurance clause,a condition generally accorded judicial disfavor.dart industries,commercial union ins,supra,cal th at,d.
rli policy was more explicit in its limitations.its limits of liability paragraph,set forth on the first page of the policy,clearly made rli coverage excess over scheduled and unscheduled underlying insurance.unscheduled underlying insurance refers not only to unscheduled primary insurance,but also to excess policies.its other insurance clause reinforced this limitation it asserted its role as excess over other primary,excess or insurance not scheduled on this policy as scheduled underlying insurance.
fireman fund maintains that the insuring limitation in rli policy should be disregarded as duplicative of its other insurance clause.we agree with rli that such an approach would entail reading the policy backwards,as if the principal statement of coverage were the other insurance clause.the insuring limitation in the rli policy is part of the insurer basic undertaking of risk,not a repetition of a condition that does not appear until pages after the basic insuring provisions.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th,d,before considering exclusions,court must examine the coverage provisions to determine whether a claim falls within policy terms.furthermore,in construing an insurance agreement we must avoid interpretations that would create redundancy in policy language.aiu ins.superior court cal d.we therefore reject fireman fund dismissal of this material insuring provision as simply a redundancy.
contractual terms of insurance coverage are enforced whenever possible,even in situations where to do so will be inconsistent with proration provisions in other policies.reliance nat.indemnity general star indemnity,supra,th at,d.here,as there was neither assertion nor evidence that enforcement of rli insuring language would intrude on the rights of the insured,it should be honored.equity should not be employed to override the terms of the insurance policies in this case because the policy terms,as they apply in this case,do not conflict or offend public policy and do not infringe on any rights of the insured,there is no reason to disregard the express terms of both policies.hartford cas.ins.travelers indem.th,d see also community redevelopment agency aetna casualty surety th,fn,d whether horizontal exhaustion rule applies depends on policy language.
fireman fund maintains that amhs ins.mutual ins.of arizona cir amhs addresses the parties dispute and supports its assertion that rli duplicative insuring language is given no greater effect merely because it appears in the insuring agreement.in amhs,an excess insurer,risk retention group rrg,provided four layers of excess coverage over a primary insurer,samaritan.the second layer was excess to several specifically named policies including samaritan and rrg first layer,except that it also limited coverage to ultimate net loss,defined as the excess of the limits of the underlying insurance and any other valid and collectible insurance.id.at.the insured physician was also covered under a primary policy issued by mutual insurance company of arizona mica.both the mica policy and the second rrg layer contained other insurance clauses.
the ninth circuit court of appeals first acknowledged the distinction between excess and primary coverage,noting that they serve different purposes.the court also recognized that categorizing insurance policies is accomplished with reference to the overall insuring scheme,and that this task can be muddied by the inclusion of an other insurance clause in an otherwise primary policy.amhs,supra.at.the court went on to hold,however,that rrg first and second excess layers were insurers with the mica primary policy and must therefore contribute to the negligence judgmen
