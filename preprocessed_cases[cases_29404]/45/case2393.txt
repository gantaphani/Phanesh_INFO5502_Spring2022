order modifying opinion no change in judgment 
it is ordered that the opinion filed herein on august,be modified as follows 
on page,delete the second full paragraph,beginning many provisions,and replace it with the following two new paragraphs 
many provisions of the right to repair act support the conclusion the act covers instances where construction defects were discovered before any actual damage had occurred.nothing in the act supports a conclusion it rewrote the law on common law claims arising from actual damages sustained as a result of construction defects.as our supreme court has acknowledged as a general rule,u nless expressly provided,statutes should not be interpreted to alter the common law,and should be construed to avoid conflict with common law rules.citation.a statute will be construed in light of common law decisions,unless its language clearly and unequivocally discloses an intention to depart from,alter,or abrogate the rule concerning the particular subject matter citations.citation.citation.accordingly,t here is a presumption that a statute does not,by implication,repeal the common law.citation.repeal by implication is recognized only where there is no rational basis for harmonizing two potentially conflicting laws.citation.california of health facilities department of health services cal th.
we next review code sections of the act that demonstrate it was not intended to,nor did it,abrogate common law rights and remedies in a situation where the homeowner has suffered actual damage.these code sections would make little sense if actual damage had already occurred in the manner alleged in the complaint.
this modification does not effect a change in the judgment.

introduction 
eric hart bought a newly constructed home from brookfield crystal cove llc brookfield.a pipe in the home sprinkler system burst,causing significant damage.brookfield repaired the damage.hart homeowners insurer,liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual,paid hart relocation expenses,incurred while hart was out of his home during the repair period.liberty mutual sued brookfield in subrogation to recover those expenses.the trial court found liberty mutual complaint was under the right to repair act,civil code section et the right to repair act or the act,and,sustaining a demurrer,dismissed it.we reverse.
the right to repair act was enacted to provide remedies where construction defects have negatively affected the economic value of a home,although no actual property damage or personal injuries have occurred as a result of the defects.we hold the act does not eliminate a property owner common law rights and remedies,otherwise recognized by law,where,as here,actual damage has occurred.accordingly,liberty mutual complaint in subrogation,based on hart right to recover actual damages,states causes of action.as our conclusion requires a reversal of the judgment,we need not address additional arguments raised by liberty mutual.

in,hart purchased a home developed and built by brookfield.the grant deed transferring the property was executed in november,and recorded a month later.according to the complaint in subrogation,in january,a fire sprinkler pipe suddenly burst and failed,flooding hart home.brookfield acknowledged its liability for,and repaired,the damage to hart home.

the history of the right to repair act 
the issue before us is whether liberty mutuals complaint in subrogation falls exclusively within the right to repair act,and therefore is we start with a brief history of the act and identification of the problem it was intended to address.normally,we would begin by analyzing the language of the statute.in this case,however,the language of the statute can be best considered with an understanding of the acts impetus and purpose.
in aas superior court cal th,the california supreme court held that construction defects in residential properties,in the absence of actual property damage,were not actionable in tort.the plaintiffs in aas superior court contended that their homes suffered a variety of construction defects,and sought as damages from the homebuilders the costs of repair the diminution in the value of their homes.id.at.the trial court excluded evidence of any defects that had not caused property damage both the court of appeal and the supreme court upheld that evidentiary ruling.id.at.
in,the california legislature enacted the right to repair act.a key specified goal of the act was to abrogate the holding of aas superior court.in response to the holding in aas,the legislature enacted civil code section et greystone homes,midtec,th,fn.omitted.the legislative history of the act explained this bill would make major changes to the substance and process of the law governing construction defects.it is the product of extended negotiations between various interested parties.among other things,the bill seeks to respond to concerns expressed by builders and insurers over the costs associated with construction defect litigation,as well as concerns expressed by homeowners and their advocates over the effects of a recent supreme court decision that held that defects must cause actual damage prior to being actionable in tort aas superior court,cal th.e xcept where explicitly specified otherwise,liability would accrue under the standards regardless of whether the violation of the standard had resulted in actual damage or injury.as a result,the standards would essentially overrule the aas decision and,for most defects,eliminate that decision holding that construction defects must cause actual damage or injury prior to being actionable.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,italics added see assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended,these standards effectively end the debate over the controversial decision in the aas case to the effect that homeowners may not recover for construction defects unless and until those defects have caused death,bodily injury,or property damage,no mat t er how imminent those threats may be italics added state and consumer services agency,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess,this bill is intended to address the perceived inequity of the aas decision and give homeowners the ability to have specified defects in the construction of their homes corrected before the defects cause actual harm or damage.
nowhere in the legislative history is there anything supporting a contention that the right to repair act barred common law claims for actual property damage.instead,the legislative history shows that the legislation was intended to grant statutory rights in cases where construction defects caused economic damage the act did nothing to limit claims for actual property damage.simply put,a homeowner who suffers actual damages as a result of a construction defect in his or her house has a choice of remedies nothing in the act takes away those rights.
the statutory language shows liberty mutual subrogation claims are not covered by the right to repair act.
the act is organized in the following manner chapter of the act sets out building standards,the violation of which constitutes a deficiency in construction for which the builder may be held liable to the homeowner.chapter of the act imposes obligations on the builder,including an obligation to furnish an express limited warranty.chapter of the act prescribes nonadversarial prelitigation procedures a homeowner must initiate prior to bringing a civil action against the builder seeking recovery for alleged construction deficiencies.chapter of the act sets out the applicable statute of limitations,the burden of proof,the damages that may be recovered,and the affirmative defenses that may be asserted it also makes the act binding on of the original home purchaser.baeza superior court th.
many provisions of the right to repair act support the conclusion the act covers instances where construction defects were discovered before any actual damage had occurred.nothing in the act supports a conclusion it rewrote the law on common law claims arising from actual damages sustained as a result of construction defects.we next review code sections of the act that so demonstrate.these code sections would make little sense if actual damage had already occurred in the manner alleged in the complaint.
civil code section,subdivision a gives the builder the right to inspect the claimed unmet standards,and specifies how that inspection and testing are to take place.this code section requires the builder to assume costs of damage occurring as a result of the testing,and further requires the builder to restore the property to its pretesting condition within hours of the testing,subd.a.
civil code section provides detailed information on how,when,and by whom inspection and testing of the structure may occur the specific language quoted in footnote,ante,dramatically illustrates that the legislative intent in enacting the act was to provide for identification and repair of construction defects before they cause actual damage to the structure or its contents,not to provide the sole remedy to recover actual damages that have occurred as a result of construction defects.
many code sections in the act provide timeframes for the homeowner to notify the builder,subd.a and the builder to acknowledge receipt of the notice of the claim,as well as the inspection of the property by the builder,the builder offer to repair,the homeowner response to the offer to repair,and the completion of the repairs of the construction defects by the builder.in the case of an actual catastrophic loss,the detailed timeframes would be unnecessary and nonsensical.if,as brookfield argues,the right to repair act applies to all claims involving construction defects regardless of actual damage,a homeowner whose property was severely damaged or destroyed would be required to await a solution during a lengthy process.as noted by the amicus curiae on behalf of liberty mutual,enforcement of a requirement of exclusive compliance with the notice provisions of the act under those circumstances would effectively extinguish the subrogation rights of all homeowners insurers who promptly cover their insureds catastrophic losses.there is nothing in the act or in its legislative history that shows the legislature intended to eliminate those subrogation rights.
civil code section eliminates the need to prove causation and damages in connection with claims brought for violation of the right to repair act in order to make a claim for violation of the standards set forth in chapter commencing with section,a homeowner need only demonstrate,in accordance with the applicable evidentiary standard,that the home does not meet the applicable standard,subject to the affirmative defenses set forth in section.no further showing of causation or damages is required to meet the burden of proof regarding a violation of a standard set forth in chapter commencing with section,provided that the violation arises out of,pertains to,or is related to,the original construction.we find nothing in the language of the act or its legislative history supporting a conclusion that the legislature intended to eliminate the need to prove causation or damages on all claims arising out of construction defects where property damage occurs.the elimination of such basic elements of proof,however,makes perfect sense when the claim is for construction defects that have not yet caused any actual damage.
civil code sections and disprove brookfield contention that the right to repair act was intended to provide the sole means for seeking redress for damages incurred due to any and all construction defects identified in the act.section provides,in relevant part if a claim combines causes of action or damages not covered by this part,the claimed unmet standards shall be administered according to this part section,subdivision a provides except as provided in this title,no other cause of action for a claim covered by this title or for damages recoverable under section is allowed.in addition to the rights under this title,this title does not apply to any action by a claimant to enforce a contract or express contractual provision,or any action for fraud,p
