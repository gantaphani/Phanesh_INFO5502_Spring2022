in this appeal,we consider whether a federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over an insurance company diversity action seeking rescission of a workers compensation policy and,if so,whether it was required to dismiss the case because exclusive jurisdiction was vested by state law in a state workers compensation agency.we conclude that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction and properly denied the motion to dismiss.we affirm.
this seemingly ab aeterno litigation originated in a simple event an accident at the island,a california waterpark.the incident spawned parallel actions that proceeded in different venues over many years,ultimately resulting in a judgment in which the island insurer prevailed.
the mishap occurred when a maintenance worker the employee was helping to assemble a water slide.a metal bar fell from a forklift and struck her head,causing serious injuries.prior to the accident,the island owner,lee investments,llc the employer or lee,had purchased a workers compensation policy the policy underwritten by united states fidelity guaranty the insurer 
the insurer contends that it agreed to issue the policy contingent on the employer representations that island employees would not be performing construction operations,as opposed to performing duties in the operation of a water park.thus,the insurer claimed that the employer had not told the whole truth in its insurance application,and that the lie had wrongfully induced it to provide coverage.
the employee filed a claim for benefits with california workers compensation appeals board the state board and the insurer began paying benefits to the employee pursuant to the policy.shortly thereafter,the insurer filed this federal action against the employer seeking policy rescission and related relief on account of the employer alleged misrepresentations.
the employee initially filed,but later abandoned,a request that the state board arbitrate the claims asserted by the insurer in the federal action.years later,the employer revived the employee request.the insurer objected,and a state administrative law judge decided to hold a hearing on the objections.the hearing never occurred,and the issue was left adrift.
in federal court,the employer joined a motion to dismiss raised by another party alleging that california law committed adjudication of the insurer action to the state board.the district court denied the dismissal motion.subsequently,the employer,the insurer,the insurer agent,and the broker filed claims against one another and additional parties 
the case was bifurcated,with some of the claims tried to a jury and others reserved for bench trial.the jury returned special verdicts in favor of the insurer and against the employer.the jury found that the employer had made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact and concealed material facts during the policy application process.based on that determination,the jury found that the insurer was entitled to rescind the policy and to recover restitution of payments it made under it.the jury found against the employer on all of its affirmative defenses and counterclaims,and found in favor of the insurer on all but one of its affirmative defenses to the employer counterclaims.
the district court entered partial judgment on the jury verdict.the employer appealed,but its appeal was dismissed as premature.the employer filed various motions seeking relief,which the district court denied.the district court then held a bench trial on some of the remaining issues,including the insurer claims to restitution of attorneys fees it paid to defend the employer in the state board proceedings and to prejudgment interest.
more than a year after the federal jury entered verdicts in favor of the insurer on its claims against the employer,and while the district court was deliberating on the issues presented in the bench trial,the employer attempted an exodus from the federal action and again requested that the state board arbitrate the insurer claims.the insurer asked the federal court to enjoin the state board proceedings.the court granted the insurer motion,observing that 
the issues surrounding issuance of the insurance policy have been fully litigated and jury verdicts entered.lee sought a jury trial,and only when the jury decided every issue against lee,now seeks to avoid the effects of the trial following which the partial judgment was entered.it will be the height of judicial waste to permit lee to yet again,a fourth time,seek to relitigate the issues,going backward to an administrative hearing.
the court also noted that lee revisionist assertion that it was dragged kicking and screaming into the federal litigation is categorically belied by the record.
the court then granted the insurer motion for summary judgment on the employer counterclaims for breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the court subsequently issued its decision on the issues presented in the bench trial and granted the insurer request for the entry of judgment pursuant to rule b.in addition to the amounts awarded by the jury,the court awarded the insurer restitution of the amount it spent for the employer legal defense in the state board proceedings and interest.
in sum,after a jury trial,a bench trial,and motions,the insurer won its claim for rescission,and was awarded restitution damages from the employer in the amount of,to reimburse the insurer for the benefits it paid under the policy less premiums the employer paid the insurer.the insurer was granted prejudgment interest against the employer in the amount of and was permitted to recover all costs of suit.judgment was entered in favor of the insurer on all claims the employer brought against it.the broker was granted judgment on all of the employers claims against it and,conversely,the employer was granted judgment on all of the broker claims against it.no damages were awarded as between the broker and the employer and each side was ordered to bear its respective costs.the court also resolved certain claims involving the alter egos 
meanwhile,over in the state proceedings,the request that the state board the insurer claims for rescission and restitution remained enjoined.the employer and the employee reached a settlement of their separate disputes before the state board,but the deal did not resolve any of the issues in the instant case 
in the end,when the smoke cleared,the insurer prevailed in the main action and the parallel proceeding remained in limbo.this appeal followed.
the employer contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the insurer claims.we disagree.the insurer is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of maryland,with its principal place of business located in that state.the employer is a business entity organized and existing under the laws of the state of california with its principal place of business located in fresno.because the parties are diverse and because the amount in controversy exceeded,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action.
the employer arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.first,the employer argues that by filing the present action the insurer improperly removed the employee state workers compensation claim to federal court,thus running afoul of c.section c provides that a civil action in any state court arising under the workmen compensation laws of such state may not be removed to any district court of the united states.however,the federal action did not involve an adjudication of the employee workers compensation benefits it addressed whether the employer insurance policy had been wrongfully obtained through misrepresentation.thus,this action did not arise under california workers compensation laws.
furthermore,the insurer did not remove a civil action from state court it filed an original claim in federal court.the employer urges us to construe the insurer complaint as a de facto removal and apply the relevant jurisdictional restrictions.however,removal jurisdiction differs from original jurisdiction and is subject to different constraints.see hurt dow chem,cir.there is nothing in the statutory scheme that would allow us to graft jurisdictional restrictions from one context onto another.section c proscribes only the removal of claims arising under state workers compensation statutes.vasquez north county transit,cir emphasis in original citing horton liberty mut.ins.that statutory restriction on the federal courts removal jurisdiction does not prohibit plaintiffs from filing such actions directly in federal court.id.nor did the district court appear,deus ex machina,to wrest control over the litigation from the state board.rather,it addressed the issues put before it in an original federal proceeding.section c does not divest federal courts of jurisdiction over this diversity action.
second,the employer argues that the district court was divested of jurisdiction by,which provides that a district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in which a party,by assignment or otherwise,has been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of the court.the purpose of is to prevent the perpetration of fraud on federal courts jurisdiction.see hartog memory,citing williams nottawa.the employer has presented no evidence of fraud or collusion.its argument is without merit.
finally,the employer claims that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because california law vests the state board alone with jurisdiction to entertain the insurer claims however,in begay kerr mcgee,cir,we rejected the argument that exclusivity provisions in state workers compensation laws,like those in california workers compensation act could divest federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction 
s tate law may not control or limit the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts.the district court diversity jurisdiction is a creature of federal law under article iii and a.pursuant to the supremacy clause,section a preempts any contrary state law.
at.here,as in begay,t he question is whether the complaint stated a claim for relief under state law pursuant to erie railroad tompkins,rather than whether the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.id.thus,even if we were to hold that the exclusivity provisions applied,they would not operate to divest the federal court of subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court correctly concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action.
the state board did not have exclusive jurisdiction to hear the insurer claims,as the employer contends.therefore,the district court properly denied the dismissal motion,a decision we review de novo.matter of mclinn,cir en banc.
as a general proposition,federal courts sitting in diversity have authority to decide state law claims seeking rescission of an insurance policy.see,atkin smith,cir gasaway nw.mut.life ins,cir.however,the california workers compensation act exclusivity provisions are substantive provisions which,under erie,a district court sitting in diversity is bound to follow.begay,at.erie requires that the federal court grant or withhold relief as the state courts would.id.at quoting markham city of newport news,cir see angel bullington,for purposes of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is in effect,only another court of the state.quoting guaranty trust york.
accordingly,we turn to california law and assess whether it would preclude california state courts from hearing the insurer claims in favor of the state board exclusive authority to do so.we are reminded that t he task of a federal court in a diversity action is to approximate state law as closely as possible in order to make sure that the vindication of the state right is without discrimination because of the federal forum.ticknor choice hotels int,cir quoting gee tenneco,cir.perhaps a better way of putting it is to say that one of the goals in deciding state law questions is to do no harm to state jurisprudence.
in analyzing state law in a diversity case,we are bound by the decisions of the state highest court.if the california supreme court has not decided the question,we are required to ascertain from all the available data what the state law is and apply it.soltani western southern life ins,cir quoting insurance of pennsylvania associated int l ins,cir.in assessing how the california supreme court would resolve the question absent controlling state authority federal courts look to existing state law without predicting potential changes in that law.ticknor,at.
we are also mindful that o nce a diversity case has been tried in federal court,with rules of decision supplied by state law under the regime of erie,considerations of finality,efficiency and economy become overwhelming.caterpillar lewis,citation omitted.that advice is particularly apt in a case that has engaged the federal courts for more than a decade.
california workers compensation act grants the state board exclusive authority to hear claims f or the recovery of workers compensation,or concerning any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto.cal.labor code a.the employer argues that the insurer claims arise out of or are incidental to the recovery of workers compensation.accordingly,the employer argues that a california state court could not entertain the insurer complaint,and therefore that,pursuant to the erie doctrine,neither can the federal courts.the district court disagreed,and on at least three occasions overruled objections to the exercise of its jurisdiction to hear the insurer claims in the face of the contention that the state board had exclusive authority to do so.
while california case law is not conclusive on the matter we are not writing on a tabula rasa,either.the relevant california decisions establish that the state board does not possess exclusive jurisdiction over the insurer claims.
first,cal.labor code does not,by its terms,apply to the insurer action for rescission.the insurer complaint against the employer sought a declaration that the policy was void ab initio and that the insurer was entitled to rescind it.the insurer further sought restitution of all sums paid by it in connection with claims on the policy.the relief the insurer sought does not involve the recovery of workers compensation,nor does it concern any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto.cal.labor code a.the insurer claims here have no legal effect on the employee ability to recover workers compensation rather,they merely affect who pays those costs the insurer,the employer,or california uninsured employers benefits trust fund.indeed,the california supreme court has confirmed that c auses of action seeking to recover e conomic or contract damages incurred independent of any workplace injury are exempt from workers compensation exclusivity.vacanti,cal th at emphasis and second alteration in original quoting pichon pacific gas electric,d.thus,while perhaps prompted by the employee workplace accident,the insurer contract claims are independent of a compensable injury under california workers compensation law.id.at quotation omitted.
second,the california supreme court has held that california state courts,and therefore federal courts sitting in diversity,can entertain such claims.scott indus.accident comm n,cal d.citing the stricter rules governing court procedures and character of proof rather than the more liberal ones applicable in administrative arbitrations,the court stated that,where questions as to insurance carrier liability within the terms of a contract are close,the carrier might fil e a declaratory relief action in state court rather than before the state board.id 
third,california law does not authorize the state board to award the damages sought by the employer in its counterclaims for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.t he state board can not award damages for injuries.la jolla beach tennis club,indus.indem,cal th,quoting scott,cal d at see id.at a civil suit for damages is no more a claim for workers compensation benefits than a criminal or disciplinary action is a civil suit for damages.united nat.ins.r d latex,cir when other claims are joined with an action for declaratory relief,bad faith,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,rescission,or claims for other monetary relief,the district court should not,as a general rule,remand or decline to entertain the claim for declaratory relief quoting gov t emps.ins.dizol,cir en banc.
this limitation is consistent with the constant theme generally applicable to administrative agencies that they are creatures of statute,bound to the confines of the statute that created them,and lack the inherent equitable powers that courts possess.int l union of,radio mach.workers,afl cio nlrb.further,the matters at hand involve state law questions of contract formation in which the state board has no special expertise.the california court of appeals has summarized,stating that jurisdiction rests with the courts over claims of bad faith and breach of contract regarding workers compensation insurance policies.salimi state comp.ins.fund,collecting cases.
because it had jurisdiction,the district court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the state board proceedings after the insurer rescission and restitution claims had been resolved by the federal jury.see scott,cal d at where there is concurrent jurisdiction and one tribunal has already assumed jurisdiction,another tribunal,although it might originally have taken jurisdiction,may be restrained by prohibition if it attempts to proceed.indeed,the court served the greater good of finality,efficiency and economy,caterpillar,at,by declining to allow the employer to litigate the primary issues anew a fourth time.the employer appeal to the anti injunction act,is misplaced nothing in that act prevent s federal courts from enjoining state administrative proceedings.bud antle,barbosa,cir 
in sum,this case does not present a collision between federal and state interests.the district court properly wrote the final chapter in the case,with the parallel proceeding ultimately having no impact on the final reckoning.
the district court correctly concluded that,under california law,there can be no breach of a duty to defend under a rescinded insurance policy.therefore,the insurer was not obligated to defend the employer before the state board and in the federal action see la sound usa,paul fire marine ins,where an insurance policy is void ab initio,the insureds never had any coverage under the policy,and the insurer never had a duty to defend or indemnify them emphasis in the original imperial casualty indemnity sogomonian,d,upon a rescission of a policy of insurance,based upon a material concealment or misrepresentation,all rights of the insured thereunder except the right to recover any consideration paid in the purchase of the policy are extinguished see also cigna property and cas.ins.polaris pictures,cir if the insurer prevailed on its rescission claim,the insured counterclaims necessarily would be defeated.thus,the effect of the judicial rescission was to turn back time,voiding all actions taken under the policy.with no effective policy in place,there was no duty to defend.
the employer appeal to buss superior court,cal th,is of no avail.there,the california supreme court affirmed that,where an action against an insured mixes claims that indubitably are covered by an insurance policy with those that may not be,the insurer has a duty to defend the entire action.id.at.that such a duty is an obligation imposed by law in support of the insurance policy,id.at,is irrelevant to the employer arguments,as buss assumes the presence of a valid policy and never addresses rescission.furthermore,with regard to restitution,the buss court went on to hold that a s to claims that are not even potentially covered by the insurance policy,the insurer may indeed seek reimbursement for defense costs because california law clearly allows insurers to be reimbursed for attorney fees and other expenses paid in defending insureds against claims for which there was no obligation to defend.cal th at quoting omaha indem.ins.cardon oil.
applying this principle to these facts,under california law,the insurer was entitled to summary judgment on the employer claims.because the policy was declared void ab initio,the insurer had no obligation to defend the employer notwithstanding that the policy,if valid,would have covered the employee injuries.
reversal is not warranted on the basis of any of the district court rulings.
the district court did not err in denying the employer motions in limine which sought to exclude two communications among the employer,the broker,and the insurer agent that allegedly showed the employer material misrepresentations in the policy application process.in the first letter,the insurer agent expressed concern to the broker that the employer employees were performing construction duties,and asked for the broker help in proving to the insurer that c onstruction has ceased at the island and accordingly that workers compensation claims arising from construction will not be reported under the policy.in the second letter,drafted by the broker to assuage the insurer concerns and signed by the employer general manager,the employer represented to the insurer agent that the island would no longer employ construction laborers and that a ny construction work will be performed by independent contractors.it was six months later that the employee suffered her injury while completing the assembly of a new water slide.
the employer contends the letters were not relevant,arguing that the insurer was required to issue a restrictive policy endorsement if it did not intend to insure construction activities.however,the insurer did not argue that the letters modified the policy.rather,the insurer submitted those letters as evidence that the employer misrepresented its operations to procure insurance,justifying the insurer in rescinding the policy under california law.see mitchell united nat.ins,any material misrepresentation or the failure,whether intentional or unintentional,to provide requested information permits rescission of the policy by the injured party citing cal,imperial cas.indem.sogomonian,d.the letters were relevant,and the district court properly denied the employer motion in limine.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the insurer motions in limine that precluded the employer from arguing at trial that the broker was the insurer agent.the district court held that this theory was not fairly disclosed in discovery,that the defendants had not had an opportunity to conduct discovery on the theory or develop a defense,and that the defendants would be unfairly prejudiced if the court allowed the employer to present the new theory at trial.the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow the belated assertion of an entirely new theory on the eve of trial,when discovery would have to be and the theory was of dubious merit.see archer daniels midland hartford fire ins,cir upholding the exercise of discretion and noting that if the destination is fated,it is best to avoid the travail of the journey.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the insurer and the broker motions in limine precluding the employer experts from testifying as to matters beyond their expertise and the scope of their expert reports.the employer complains that its hands were tied.however,its experts remained free to articulate the relevant standards of care and to opine as to whether the insurer and the broker conduct met their requirements.a district court does not abuse its discretion in limiting expert testimony to the expert area of expertise and the subjects contained in the expert disclosure.united states w.grace,cir.
