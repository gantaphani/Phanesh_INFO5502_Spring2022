appellant shaileshkumar bhatt appeals from the judgment denying his petition for writ of administrative mandamus following an audit of his dental practice by respondent the department of health services of the state of california the department.two questions are presented here whether reports prepared by a fiscal intermediary on behalf of the department qualify as official records pursuant to evidence code section,and whether a dentist working for a dentist enrolled in the program must also be enrolled in the program in order to receive payments from for services rendered.we conclude that the answer to both questions is yes and we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
appellant is a dentist who is enrolled as a provider.delta dental,which is the fiscal intermediary for respondent program conducted an audit of appellant records for the period of february,through february,and issued an audit report on may.the audit report found that there was inadequate or no documentation for certain billed services and that some of the dentists rendering services in appellant office were not enrolled in the program as required,entitling respondent to recover payment for the services.in response to the audit,appellant filed a statement of disputed issues.the office of dental services conducted an on the record review and issued a report of findings.appellant disputed the findings and requested a formal hearing.
the matter was heard before respondent administrative law judge alj robert carisoza over three days on april and september and.oral and documentary evidence was received.on the first day of the administrative hearing,darrell carlson,an employee of delta dental,which is a private company,testified that he had worked as an representative for just over three years and that his duties included comparing patient records with information contained in each patient claim detail report cdr during an audit.he testified that a cdr shows the services rendered to the patient and the amount paid for each service by,which is a division of delta dental.the information as to what services were rendered is taken by from the claim forms submitted by the provider to.copies of the cdrs in the record show that they are entitled california management information system,department of health services,surveillance and utilization review,recipient claim detail report.carlson did not personally prepare the cdrs,but retrieved them from a database.
on the last day of the evidentiary hearing,appellant counsel objected to admission of the cdrs on the ground that they did not qualify as a business record exception to the hearsay rule under evidence code section.alj carisoza accepted the documents into evidence as hearsay.
on june,alj carisoza issued a proposed decision granting appellant appeal.alj carisoza found where timely objection is made to the introduction of the department claim detail report cdr,and the department did not offer the testimony of any witness who could personally attest to the mode of preparation of the cdr,that document will only be admitted into the record as hearsay evidence.as hearsay evidence,the cdr alone can not establish a finding of fact.the cdr was relied upon as evidence by the department to demonstrate,inter alia,the types of services rendered by the provider,the dates the services were rendered,and the amount paid by the fiscal intermediary for those services.thereafter,the department compared this information with the provider records and determined that the program had overpaid the provider.as no other evidence was introduced to establish the accuracy of the cdr,the department has failed to establish the reliability of its audit findings.
on august,the proposed decision was rejected by chief alj robert tousignant,and the parties were invited to submit additional briefing.both parties submitted written arguments.on october,alj tousignant issued his final decision granting the appeal in part and denying it in part.alj tousignant found that while the cdr did not qualify as a business record under evidence code section,it did qualify as an official record under evidence code section,and was therefore admissible.he also found that the dentist who actually performed the dental services billed to must be enrolled in the program.of the nine dentists employed by appellant,three were not enrolled in at the time the services were rendered.alj tousignant therefore upheld respondent disallowance of services provided by the unenrolled dentists.
on november,appellant filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in the superior court,in which he argued that the cdrs were inadmissible and asked the court to enter judgment for petitioner consistent with judge carisoza propose d decision.in a supplemental brief,appellant argued that there was no statutory or other requirement that a dentist must be enrolled in in order to bill for services rendered.respondent opposed the petition and lodged the administrative record with the court.at the hearing on the petition,the trial court designated its tentative decision as the statement of decision.the court found that substantial evidence supported the finding that the cdrs were admissible as official records,and that as a matter of law can not be billed for services rendered by unenrolled dentists.judgment was filed on november,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
where,as here,the trial court was called upon to decide whether an agency administrative decision was supported by substantial evidence,the function of the appellate court is the same as that of the trial court,that is,to review the administrative decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.taylor bus service,san diego bd.of education d.substantial evidence has been defined as relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate support for a conclusion.citation.a presumption exists that an administrative action was supported by substantial evidence.citation.the burden is on the appellant to show there is no substantial evidence whatsoever to support the findings of the agency.id.at.however,to the extent pure questions of law were decided by the trial court upon undisputed facts,a de novo standard will apply at the appellate level.anserv ins.services,kelso th,d.
official records 
appellant contends that alj tousignant finding that the cdrs were admissible as official records can not be upheld because there was no testimony given at the administrative hearing to authenticate these documents.
evidence code section provides evidence of a writing made as a record of an act,condition,or event is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in any civil or criminal proceeding to prove the act,condition,or event if all of the following applies a the writing was made by and within the scope of duty of a public employee.b the writing was made at or near the time of the act,condition,or event.c the sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.
although similar to the business records exception,the official records exception differs in one important respect.evidence code section requires a witness to testify as to the identity of the record and its mode of preparation in every instance.in contrast,evidence code s ection permits the court to admit an official record or report without necessarily requiring a witness to testify as to its identity and mode of preparation if the court takes judicial notice or if sufficient independent evidence shows that the record or report was prepared in such a manner as to assure its trustworthiness.citations.people dunlap th,d people george th,d same.the object of this hearsay exception is to eliminate the calling of each witness involved in preparation of the record and substitute the record of the transaction instead.citations.gananian zolin th,d.accordingly,for the exception to apply,i t is not necessary that the person making the entry have personal knowledge of the transaction.citations.id.at,d.
