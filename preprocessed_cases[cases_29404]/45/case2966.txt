the dictionary definitions of decay include a general sense of gradual deterioration in strength or soundness,and a more specific sense of rot or organic decomposition.this case presents the question whether a property insurance policy covering collapse of a building due to hidden decay applies to the unexpected failure of wooden roof trusses,with no evidence of rot.we conclude that coverage can not be ruled out merely because the trusses were not rotten.an insurer promising coverage for collapse due to hidden decay,without limiting the scope of the term to organic decay,is liable on claims for any collapse caused by a concealed process of gradual loss in the strength of building materials,unless other policy terms limit coverage.under this policy and the circumstances of this case,the insured could reasonably expect coverage for an imminent collapse caused by the weakening roof trusses,unless the failure was caused by defective materials or construction methods.
stamm theatres,and its george stamm and mary ann bolacco collectively,stamm sued hartford casualty insurance company hartford,among other defendants.hartford had sold stamm a commercial property insurance policy for a movie theater in antioch,california.stamm alleged that cracks in the theater roof trusses were covered by a policy provision promising to pay for damage involving collapse of a building caused by h idden decay.
hartford successfully moved for summary adjudication based on a ruling by the trial court that decay is synonymous with rot or decomposition of organic material.the only issue remaining for trial was whether hartford had wrongfully refused to pay for temporarily shoring up the building while hartford was investigating the claim.a jury awarded stamm for the costs of shoring,finding in a special verdict that hartford had promised to pay for the shoring.
stamm appeals,contending the trial court imposed an unduly restrictive interpretation on the policy term decay.hartford also appeals.it claims the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict,and the trial court committed prejudicial error in formulating the special verdict form and responding to a query from the jury.we agree with stamm that the court definition of decay was too narrow,and summary adjudication was erroneously granted.in the unpublished portion of our opinion,we reject hartford claims of error.
background 
stamm theatre was built around.the policy at issue covered the period from july,to july.the relevant provisions are in a section entitled additional coverage collapse.they state 
we will pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from risks of direct physical loss involving collapse of a building or any part of a building caused only by one of the following 
the specified causes of loss or breakage of building glass,all only as insured against in this coverage part 
hidden decay 
hidden insect or vermin damage 
weight of people or personal property 
weight of rain that collects on a roof 
use of defective material or methods in construction,remodeling or renovation if the collapse occurs during the course of this construction,remodeling or renovation.
collapse does not included sic settling,cracking,shrinkage,bulging or expansion.
the specified causes of loss are f ire lightning explosion windstorm or hail smoke aircraft or vehicles riot or civil commotion vandalism leakage from fire extinguishing equipment sinkhole collapse volcanic action falling objects weight of snow,ice or sleet water damage.
on june,stamm notified hartford that ceiling plaster in the theater was falling and cracking.on june,an engineer retained by hartford inspected the building and found it was in a state of imminent collapse.the theater roof was supported by wooden bowstring trusses,with curved top chords,straight horizontal bottom chords,and diagonal members running between the top and bottom chords.several of the bottom chords had cracked completely through where they joined diagonal web members.
a claims adjuster hired by hartford,douglas bailey,accompanied the engineer on the june inspection.bailey,the engineer,and george stamm discussed the need for shoring up the ceiling.george stamm testified that bailey made a telephone call to hartford,then told him hartford had authorized the erection of shoring.shoring was installed on june and.hartford regional claims adjustor for large property damage claims,allen holland,visited the theater on june.holland testified that he orally advised george stamm that the shoring might or might not be covered.on june,holland took over the claim and left a message for bailey to close his file.bailey did not get the message until the next day.earlier on the,before he learned he had been relieved,bailey placed a phone call to the contractor in charge of the shoring.bailey notes of the call stated temporary towers begun at authorization of al holland.
george stamm signed a work authorization form on which the contractor had written,there may not be insurance coverage.if no coverage owner agrees to pay.george stamm testified that since hartford had already authorized the shoring,he understood he would not have to pay for that,although coverage for the damage to the roof was still in question.
on august,hartford denied coverage for the failure of the roof trusses.the shoring was still in place,at a monthly cost of.
the parties asked the trial court for a ruling on the meaning of the term hidden decay.the court decided that decay is synonymous with the words rot and decomposition.rot or decomposition is the destruction of organic matter as a result of bacteria,fungus,insects,vermin or like action.the court also noted that decay is often the result of water damage.hartford motion for summary adjudication was premised on this definition.for purposes of the motion,hartford conceded that the roof of the theater had collapsed.see doheny west homeowners american guarantee liability ins.th,d collapse coverage applies to both actual and imminent collapse.
hartford noted that both of stamm experts said they saw no evidence of decay in the roof trusses.joshua kardon,stamm structural engineer,attributed the failure of the trusses to the increased load created by a partial,to repeated cycles of elevated temperatures over the years which degraded the strength of the truss members,and to the presence of knots in the bottom chords.kardon identified the degradation due to temperature differences as the primary factor.he had inspected the theater and saw no evidence of decay,which to him meant rot caused by some microscopic agent.
hartford also relied on the conclusions of stephen quarles,a wood scientist retained as an expert witness by stamm.quarles had not inspected the theater himself,but reviewed kardon work and the reports of hartford engineers.quarles did not believe that temperature fluctuations alone were a factor,but placed primary responsibility for the collapse on cycles of high and low humidity which,over time,eroded the ability of the wooden trusses to withstand their load.quarles placed secondary importance on the presence of knots,and acknowledged a nominal amount of overloading.he stated that as a wood person he defined wood decay differently than the dictionary.to him,it meant fungal degradation of the wood.
hartford structural engineers,patrick buscovich and kenneth smetts,jointly produced a report concluding the collapse was caused by overstress in the bottom chord members in comparison to their axial load capacity.hartford characterized this finding as one of design defect though it did not rely on the policy provision covering collapse due to defective material or methods in construction if the collapse occurs during the course of this construction.these engineers had inspected the trusses and found them clean and dry but cracked,with no apparent fungal growth,mold,insect damage,or wet or dry rot.
in its opposition to the summary adjudication motion,stamm noted that buscovich and smetts conceded the trusses complied with all building regulations in effect when the theater was built.in view of that fact,and the fact that the trusses had borne the load placed on them for years,s
