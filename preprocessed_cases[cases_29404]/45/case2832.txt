defendants and,the legal heirs and estate of john hogan,appeal the summary judgment entered in favor of respondent,california automobile insurance company caic,on respondent complaint for declaratory relief and appellants for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and professional negligence.the issue presented in this appeal is whether the fatal injuries hogan suffered during an altercation with an uninsured motorist while exchanging information following a traffic accident are covered under the uninsured motorist provisions of hogan automobile insurance policy issued by caic.we conclude they are not and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
a car being driven by john hogan was involved in a minor traffic accident with a motorcycle being driven by giuseppe lionetti.hogan and his wife immediately got out of their car to speak to lionetti,who had gotten off his motorcycle.in response to hogan inquiry whether lionetti and his passenger were all right,lionetti responded that they were,but became irate,demanding to know who would pay for the damage.when hogan asked lionetti whether he had insurance,lionetti became belligerent,and did not respond to hogan request to see his driver license.fearful of lionetti because of his large,muscular build and his escalating anger,hogan ran to a nearby telephone to call the police.while she was gone,lionetti punched hogan in the face,knocking him to the ground,where he hit the back of his head on the pavement.when hogan returned,she found her husband lying unconscious and bleeding on the ground.lionetti was leaving the scene on his motorcycle.
hogan died five days later.the coroner concluded that t he cause of death is sequelae of craniocerebral trauma.the manner of death is homicide.lionetti pled guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to state prison.
at the time of the accident and hogan death,an automobile liability insurance policy issued by caic to hogan was in effect,which included uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage.under coverage h of the policy,damages for bodily injury caused by uninsured motor vehicles,caic agreed t o pay all sums which an insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner,or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury,sustained by an insured,caused by accident and arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of such uninsured motor vehicles for purposes of its summary judgment motion,caic conceded that lionetti vehicle qualified as an uninsured motor vehicle pursuant to insurance code section,subdivision b and the caic policy definition of uninsured motor vehicle.
after hogan death,appellants made a claim to caic for uninsured motorist bodily injury benefits under the policy.caic denied coverage and filed the instant action for declaratory relief.appellants then filed a against caic which,at the time the summary judgment motion was heard,alleged claims for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and professional negligence.
the trial court granted caic motion for summary judgment on the ground that hogan bodily injury did not arise out of lionetti use of the uninsured motor vehicle.the court entered judgment in favor of caic on its complaint for declaratory relief and against appellants on their.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the sole issue before us is whether lionetti liability for hogan fatal injury can be said to arise out of the use of lionetti uninsured motorcycle within the meaning of the uninsured motorist provision in the caic policy issued to hogan.interpretation of the insurance policy presents a question of law for this court to decide.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,state farm mut.auto.ins.partridge cal d,partridge.interinsurance exchange flores th,d.in this case the pertinent facts are undisputed,and we consider those facts together with the language of the caic insurance policy to determine whether coverage for hogan injuries exists.

use of the uninsured vehicle 
in determining the meaning of the phrase arising out of the use of the uninsured motor vehicle in the context of the caic policy here,we reject a but for causation analysis,and adopt the predominating factor test,which has been applied by the majority of california courts that have considered the issue.
our supreme court has explained that the phrase arising out of the use,when used in a coverage or insuring clause of an insurance policy,has broad and comprehensive application.partridge,supra,cal d at.it affords coverage for injuries where the insured vehicle bears almost any causal relation to the accident at issue,however minimal.interinsurance exchange flores,supra,th at,d,citing partridge,supra,at,fns.
in partridge,a passenger in the insured truck was accidentally shot while the insured was driving the truck hunting jackrabbits.the insured had manipulated the trigger mechanism of his pistol so that the gun would have a hair trigger action.when the truck hit a bump,the gun discharged and caused injury to the insured passenger.partridge,supra,cal d at.while the insurer disputed coverage under a homeowner policy,coverage under the driver automobile liability policy,which extended coverage to injuries caused by accident arising out of the use of the owned motor vehicle id.at,was not in dispute.the court nevertheless discussed this issue,noting that providing coverage for a shooting accident did not conflict with a long line of cases finding no automobile coverage for somewhat similar accidents.whenever circumstances reveal that the insured vehicle did bear some,albeit slight,causal connection with the shooting accident,courts have generally permitted recovery under automobile liability polices.id.at,fn.the court concluded that the policy provided coverage for the passenger injuries.id.at.the court explained the california cases uniformly hold that the use of an automobile need not amount to a proximate cause of the accident for coverage to follow.citations.id.at,fn.although there must be s ome minimal causal connection between the vehicle and an accident,even a slight causal connection between the use of the vehicle and the accident is sufficient.id.at,fns.
noting that the requisite causal connection to trigger coverage had not been defined by any california case,the court in partridge compared the two cases that had previously defined the parameters of the issue universal underwriters ins.aetna ins.d,and truck ins.exchange webb d.webb.in universal underwriters,the liability policy covered damages caused by accident and arising out of certain defined hazards which included the ownership,maintenance or use of any automobile.id.at.the issue in that case was whether the policy covered damages resulting from a collision which was due to the negligent repair of the car rather than negligent driving.the court concluded that it did.the court noted that the policy did not require that liability arise from negligence while using the vehicle the term using when employed in a policy without restrictive terms,must be understood in its most comprehensive sense.it does not require that the injury be the direct and proximate result in any strict legal sense of the active movement of the motor vehicle covered by the policy.citations.id.at.
on the other hand,the court in webb required that use of the vehicle be a predominating cause or a substantial factor in causing the injury.webb,supra,d at.the issue in webb was whether a policy which covers damage to property arising out of the use of an automobile covered the destruction of a building by a fire started when cardboard boxes unloaded from the insured vehicle were ignited.acknowledging that use includes loading and unloading from a vehicle,the court nevertheless concluded there was no coverage.id.at.the webb court reasoned the automobile is so much a part of american life that there are few activities in which the use of an automobile does not play a part somewhere in the chain of events.clearly the parties to an automobile liability policy do not contemplate a general liability insurance contract.id.at.
subsequent to partridge,the predominating factor test has been applied in the majority of california decisions considering the issue.as set forth above,we adopt this test as well,for i f any cause in fact connection between injury and use of a vehicle were sufficient,then the mere fact that a vehicle is the situs of acts causing injury,or that a vehicle is used for transportation to the scene of a crime,would establish coverage.prior cases do not support this approach.american nat.property casualty julie th,d.
california cases support finding no coverage here.
none of the california cases cited by either party involved the precise factual circumstances presented here,but we find the cases cited by caic to be persuasive 
in farmers ins.exchange hansel d,the court denied coverage for an injury sustained during an altercation between two motorists.during the fight,one driver broke a bottle on the bumper of his own uninsured vehicle,and pretended to get into the car.he then stabbed the insured with the bottle from behind the car door.the court acknowledged that,in a sense,the uninsured automobile was used by the assailant when he committed the stabbing,but held that such use was not within any category covered by an automobile liability policy.noting that v ehicle liability policies must be interpreted with regard to the intent and reasonable expectation of the parties the court concluded that i njury arising out of the use of an automobile as an instrument to create a weapon in the form of a broken bottle and as a shield for an assault with that weapon is not the form of loss for which the automobile liability policy may reasonably be expected to provide indemnity.id.at.
similarly,in american nat.property casualty julie,supra,th at page,d,the court denied coverage for injuries from a rape perpetrated inside an uninsured vehicle from which the victim had been unable to escape,holding that m ere use of a vehicle in some way connected to the events giving rise to the injury is insufficient to establish coverage.the court noted that after partridge,subsequent cases have found coverage where a vehicle is being used in a manner that reasonably could be contemplated by the insurer and injury occurs in the course of such use.julie,supra,at,d.but where the role of the vehicle in the injury is merely as a situs for the act causing injury,courts have found that the injury does not arise from the use of the vehicle and that the injury is not covered.see also rowe farmers ins.exchange th,d the mere transportation of a tortfeasor to a site where he commits a tort after departing from the uninsured vehicle does not establish the requisite causal relationship united services automobile ledger d.insufficient causal connection between use of vehicle and injury which resulted from one motorist stabbing another motorist during a fight aetna casualty surety safeco ins.d.coverage denied where gunshot injury occurred in the car,but did not arise out of the use of the car.
in state farm mut.auto.ins.fernandez cir,two motorists,one insured,the other not,became involved in a physical altercation over the uninsured driver refusal to switch from high beam to low beam headlights.after both drivers got out of their cars,the uninsured driver stabbed the other,who sought uninsured motorist coverage for his injury.the insured argued that the uninsured driver was alighting from his vehicle when he stabbed the insured.the court denied coverage,holding that the insured injuries were not minimally causally connected to the use of the uninsured vehicle.the court observed that e ven if alighting from a vehicle is a use of the vehicle,fernandez injuries did not arise out of that use.the term arising out of requires at least a minimal casual connection between the use of the vehicle and the injury.id.at.the court also rejected the insured contention that his injuries arose out of the use of the uninsured vehicle headlights,noting that t he cases have uniformly held that an intervening intentional act breaks the causal connection between the use of an uninsured vehicle and an injury.ibid.
all of these cases share a common thread none of the injuries arose directly from the use or operation of the vehicle.rather,the use of the vehicle,as transportation of the tortfeasor to the site where the injury occurred or as furniture,was merely incidental to the direct cause of the injuries sustained.
so it is in the case at bar.there is no dispute that the immediate and direct cause of hogan fatal injuries was lionetti act of punching hogan in the face with such force that he was knocked to the ground and hit his head on the pavement.the only role played by lionetti uninsured motorcycle was to transport lionetti to the site where he then committed this crime against hogan.
appellants seek to distinguish these cases based on when the perpetrator formulated the intent to injure the other party.but appellants analysis finds no support in any case,and its application does not aid in determining whether an injury arose out of the use of an uninsured vehicle.
citing cocking state farm mut.automobile ins.d,appellants contend that consideration must be given not only to what the person was doing upon injury,but also to his purpose and intent.cocking has no application to the present case.in cocking the plaintiff was driving an insured car with the owner permission.the road conditions mandated the use of tire chains,and the plaintiff pulled off to the side of the road to put snow chains on the tires.while plaintiff was standing behind the car preparing to apply the chains,an uninsured motorist drove up from behind and struck plaintiff,causing him bodily injury.id.at.the sole issue in cocking was whether the plaintiff qualified as an insured or covered person under the policy for the vehicle he was driving,and the relevant inquiry was whether the plaintiff had been occupying the insured vehicle while outside the car preparing to put snow chains on the tires.the case presented no issue of whether plaintiff injuries arose from the use of either vehicle,except to the extent that use of the vehicle could be equated with occupying it.
appellants emphasize the continuity of events that led from the collision to hogan injuries and argue that the two vehicles,the accident,and the injuries flowing from the accident are all part of one picture and constitute an unbroken chain of events arising from the subject accident.but we conclude that the intervening tortious act by lionetti broke the chain of causation between the use of lionetti uninsured motorcycle and hogan injuries.
compliance with the vehicle code mandate to exchange information did not extend use of the uninsured vehicle to lionetti assault.
appellants contend that the requirement under the vehicle code that parties to a traffic accident stop and exchange information establishes the minimal causal connection between the use of lionetti vehicle and hogan injuries,and provides the critical distinction between this case and the cases relied upon by caic.we disagree.
vehicle code sections and require the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident to stop the vehicle at or near the scene of the accident and exchange certain information with the other driver.failure to comply with these requirements constitutes a criminal offense which may result in the imposition of a fine or incarceration.
in this case it is undisputed that an accident involving hogan vehicle and lionetti uninsured motorcycle occurred,and that hogan was attempting to comply with the requirements of sections and when he was struck in the face and knocked to the ground by lionetti.but hogan compliance with the statutory mandate was no more a cause of his fatal in
