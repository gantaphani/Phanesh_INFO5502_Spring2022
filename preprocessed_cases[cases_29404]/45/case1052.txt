the city of cincinnati is the municipal owner and operator of the cincinnati municipal lunken airport lunken.flamingo express,which was already using lunken to conduct chartered and unscheduled air service,sought an additional permit from the city in to operate scheduled commuter air service with seating for up to passengers per flight.after the parties had unsuccessfully negotiated for more than a year and the city had still not approved flamingo express application,flamingo express filed a complaint with the federal aviation administration faa.the complaint alleged that the city had violated its obligations under federal law by,among other things,failing to approve flamingo express application and requiring that the company obtain unreasonably high liability insurance coverage.
following an informal investigation,the director of the faa office of airport safety and standards the director dismissed flamingo express complaint on the basis that the city had not violated its federal obligations.flamingo express then filed an administrative appeal with the faa associate administrator for airports the administrator.after the administrator affirmed the director decision,this appeal followed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the faa.
background 
regulatory framework 
the city ability to operate lunken depends in part on the receipt of funds provided by the faa as part of the airport improvement program aip.see airport and airway improvement act of,et.as a condition of receiving aip funds,the city is required to comply with the written assurances set forth in.the administrator explained that u pon acceptance of an aip grant,the assurances become binding obligations between the airport sponsor and the federal government.federal law,in turn,gives the secretary of transportation the authority to require that airport owners comply with these assurances.see,c d directing the administrator of the faa to consider safety,the public interest,and other factors in carrying out the provisions of the federal aviation act a b outlining the required assurances.
at issue in the present case is the city obligation under grant assurance economic nondiscrimination,which implements subsections through of a.that assurance requires that the sponsor of an airport receiving aip funding make the airport available as an airport for public use on reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination to all types,kinds and classes of aeronautical activities,including commercial aeronautical activities offering services to the public at the airport.fed.aviation,assurances,airport sponsors,part c sponsor certification,a,available at sponsor grant assurance a see also a permitting approval of a grant application only if written assurance is provided that the airport will be available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust discrimination.an airport sponsor,however,may establish such reasonable,and not unjustly discriminatory,conditions to be met by all users of the airport as may be necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the airport.fed.aviation,assurances airport sponsors h.
also relevant is the faa authority to issue airport operating certificates aocs to airports that serve operations of certain air carriers and to establish safety standards for those airports.see.the regulations governing the issuance of aocs are contained in part,which was revised by an faa rule that took effect in june of.see.prior to that time,there were two categories of aocs limited and unlimited.the new certification process requires airports to be reclassified into one of four new classes.
under the new rule,airports may either surrender their aocs or apply to the faa to modify downgrade their aoc classification.airport safety operations,fed.aviation,program policy and guidance,policy designation of class of certificate under the revised part june,faa policy.airports holding a limited aoc can seek reclassification as either a class ii or class iv airport.class ii airports may serve both unscheduled large passenger aircraft seats and scheduled small air carrier aircraft seats,but class iv airports may not serve the latter category.id.either type of airport,however,may serve aircraft with nine seats or less.
although certified airports have some flexibility in determining which class of aoc to seek,airports receiving federal assistance are limited by their independent obligation,under the aip grant assurances,to provide reasonable,not unjustly discriminatory access to the airport.faa policy.airports receiving federal assistance are therefore required to ensure that scheduled and planned services are not impacted by the reclassification process,and can not decline to meet the requirements for a certain aoc in order to prevent an air carrier from continuing or beginning such service.id.as the director explained,the faa would generally expect an airport operator to meet the requirements of the aoc that corresponds to the kinds of commercial operations at the airport at the time it applies for the new certificate,in order to meet the obligation for reasonable access.
faa policy,issued in conjunction with the implementation of the revised aoc procedures,specifically addresses how an airport must account for planned service when applying for a new aoc 
the faa generally treats planned service the same as existing service if the operator is able to actually begin service,to have the use of necessary facilities and equipment,and have the necessary department of transportation and faa authority to operate scheduled air transportation,and has filed formal notice with the airport operator of intent to begin service within a reasonable time,months.

factual background 
lunken is a reliever airport located in cincinnati,ohio whose primary function is to serve the aviation needs in the area by providing needed runway capacity and landside support facilities relief to the kentucky international airport.prior to,flamingo express conducted various air services at lunken with a,piper cherokee aircraft.the company operated these services with a certificate issued by the faa under part.
in april of,flamingo express submitted a permit application to the city in which the company sought approval to operate scheduled commuter service with aircraft seating less than passengers but more than passengers.such service requires flamingo express to obtain certification from the faa pursuant to part.flamingo express does not dispute that it never sought such certification from the faa.at the time that flamingo express submitted its application to the city,lunken held a limited aoc.the director noted that t his level of certification allowed it to serve charter or unscheduled operations and scheduled operations of seats or less.
both the city airport manager and its risk manager approved flamingo express application within a month of its submission.flamingo express then proceeded to submit a preliminary proposal to the city in the form of an operating agreement.in august of,the city held a public hearing on the permit and the proposal.after receiving complaints from flamingo express about the delay in approving the permit and proposal,the city responded to flamingo express in january of by providing its own proposed operating agreement.the agreement would have permitted flamingo express to operate scheduled commuter flights using aircraft with only nine seats or less,required a fee for up to flights with a surcharge for each flight thereafter,and mandated that flamingo express obtain liability insurance coverage in the amount of million per occurrence.
between february and july of,flamingo express and the city exchanged numerous letters in an attempt to solidify the terms of the proposed agreement.flamingo express argued that the city proposal was unreasonable because it did not permit flamingo express to conduct the service that it had requested,required a million minimum insurance policy even though the company current insurance coverage of million was consistent with industry standards,and included an excessive monthly fee.
the city,in turn,alleged that the agreement under consideration was for aircraft with nine seats or less because that was what flamingo express 
proposed when it applied for this license.at that time,it was discussed and agreed upon with flamingo express that we would revisit this issue if and when flamingo express was going to upgrade to bigger planes.since we have not received any indication from them of such an intention,we developed the agreement based on their proposal and our mutual concurrence on this issue.
the city also defended the reasonableness of the and requirements.no agreement was reached during this exchange of correspondence,and at one point the city suggested that if flamingo express was not willing to move on these issues,it should consider withdrawing its application.
at some point during the time period that flamingo express application was pending,the city applied to the faa for a class iv aoc reclassification.in december of,the city received the class iv aoc.the director explained that this reclassification means that a lthough the city limited aoc would have allowed lunken to serve scheduled operations of seats or less,the new class iv aoc does not.
in summary,the parties contemplated three possible options for air services by flamingo express at lunken.the arrangement,in which flamingo express conducted chartered and unscheduled air services using a plane,continued to be a viable option even after lunken became a class iv airport.flamingo express new proposal,on the other hand,contemplated scheduled air service for to passengers per flight and carried with it flamingo express current liability insurance coverage of million.the third option,proposed by the city,would have permitted flamingo express to operate scheduled service using a plane and carried with it a requirement.flamingo express refused to accept the city proposal.
procedural background 
in march of,flamingo express filed a complaint with the director.see,permitting persons doing business with an airport to file a complaint with the faa,provided that they first engage in good faith efforts to resolve the disputed matter informally.that complaint was subsequently dismissed without prejudice because it was incomplete.flamingo express refiled its complaint two months later.the complaint alleged that the city had violated its obligation to comply with federal statutes and faa regulations by failing to allow flamingo express to conduct the requested aircraft service and seeking recertification from the faa that would prohibit flamingo express from operating such service at lunken,demanding unreasonable fees,and requiring insurance coverage that was contrary to industry standards as well as the city own airport minimum liability insurance requirements.flamingo express also argued that the city undue delay in processing the application constituted a violation of federal regulations.
in february of,the director issued a director determination,concluding that the city had not violated its obligation under a to operate lunken on reasonable terms and without economic discrimination.the director found no evidence indicating that the city had deliberately delayed the application process and concluded that the time lapse was reasonable.it then proceeded to address flamingo express substantive complaints and determined that although flamingo express had submitted an application for the use of aircraft,the city had not violated its federal obligation to provide reasonable access by seeking to downgrade its faa classification.specifically,the director found that flamingo express had not taken sufficient steps to be considered a realistic prospective operator of the proposed service and that,therefore,the city was not obligated to refrain from downgrading its certification.
the director also concluded that although the city can not impose a million in liability coverage requirement for operation of a aircraft,such a requirement would be reasonable for the type of service that flamingo express had actually proposed in its application.finally,the director determined that the monthly fee required by the city was reasonable.
flamingo express then pursued an administrative appeal with the administrator.see c,permitting such appeals and providing procedures for filing.that appeal challenged the director determination only with respect to the city refusal to approve the application for aircraft service,and the requirement.in august of,the administrator issued a final decision and order affirming the director decision.the administrator concluded that the factual findings made by the director are supported by a preponderance of reliable,probative,and substantial evidence,and that the legal conclusions reached are in accordance with applicable law,precedent,and public policy.
in particular,the administrator agreed with the director determination that flamingo express had not taken steps sufficient to demonstrate substantial or realistic intent to operate the requested service and that the faa would not expect an airport sponsor to maintain a certain certification level based on unsubstantiated and unrealistic proposals.the administrator also affirmed the director conclusions with respect to the insurance requirement,explaining that the required amount would be reasonable for the operations that flamingo express wanted to conduct.moreover,the administrator noted that flamingo express could request a new operating agreement from the city if it wished to conduct scheduled service of nine seats or less.in that circumstance,the city must be given an opportunity to revise its insurance requirement for aircraft seating or less passengers to reflect the director finding.the administrator also recognized that if future informal efforts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful,flamingo express would also have the option of filing a new formal complaint against the city.
flamingo express timely filed a petition for review with this court.see a authorizing judicial review of an administrator final decision.although both the city and the faa were listed as respondents,the faa correctly points out that the faa is the proper respondent and that the city is not a party to this appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
when reviewing an order of the faa,we apply the standards of review as articulated in the federal aviation act,c,and by default,the administrative procedure act.wilson air,llc faa,cir.we apply the standards articulated in the administrative procedure act only where the federal aviation act does not provide the appropriate standard.see id.at.
the federal aviation act dictates that findings of fact made by the faa are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.c.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.wilson air,at internal quotation marks omitted.we must consider the entire record,including evidence that contradicts the faa findings.id.at.but s ubstantial evidence review gives the agency the benefit of the doubt,requiring not the degree of evidence which satisfies the court that the requisite fact exists,but merely the degree which could satisfy a reasonable factfinder.id.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.thus,e ven if two different conclusions can be drawn from the evidence,we may still find that the agency factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.id.
the federal aviation act is silent as to the standard that an appellate court must employ in reviewing the faa nonfactual findings,so we must look to the administrative procedure act to supply the appropriate standard of review.id.although questions of law are reviewed de novo,we must give some deference to the agency because it is charged with administering the statute.wilson air,at.under the administrative procedure act,moreover,the faa interpretation of its own regulations must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.see battle creek health leavitt,cir quoting thomas jefferson shalala,d.all other findings and conclusions are reviewed to determine whether they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or othe
