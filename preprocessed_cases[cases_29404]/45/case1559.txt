in this declaratory judgment action,travelers property casualty company of america travelers,a connecticut corporation,and its insured,greg paine,a minnesota resident,seek a determination of whether general casualty insurance companies,doing business as regent insurance company regent,a wisconsin corporation,had a duty to defend paine in a negligence suit brought against him by a student who was injured in a physical education class at.mary school shattuck.travelers,which insures paine as a member of the professional golfers association of america pga,provided funds for his defense through a loan receipt agreement and now seeks contribution and indemnity from regent,which insures the golf course that employs paine as its head golf professional.the district court granted summary judgment to regent,finding it had no duty to defend,and we affirm.
paine is the head golf professional for legacy golf corporation legacy,an golf course in faribault,minnesota.in this position,he manages the golf shop year round and manages the teaching programs at the golf course among other duties relating to the golf operation.his employment agreement with legacy provides that his compensation consists of a salary,any income he earns from giving golf lessons,and any bonuses he may receive.his employment agreement requires him to use his best efforts to perform all duties required by the agreement at such places as the needs and business of legacy may require,and he must market the course and promote membership growth.legacy offers golf lessons to the public and its members,and it advertises golf lessons by its pga golf professional.paine only duty at legacy during the winter months is managing the golf shop,which requires about to hours of work a week at that time of the year.
paine entered into a verbal agreement with shattuck to teach a physical education golf class at the school beginning at each morning for three months from december through february.shattuck is a college preparatory boarding and day school in faribault,minnesota,for students in grades through,located on property adjacent to legacy.shattuck is also the sole shareholder of legacy,but the two are separate legal entities.while paine had previously taught golf lessons at legacy for interested shattuck students as an extracurricular activity in the spring,summer,and fall,this was the first physical education class that he taught at the school during the school day.paine negotiated this teaching job at shattuck with headmaster dennis brown and earned for the semester.paine worked with headmaster brown and shattuck athletic director john sommer in designing an indoor golf facility in the basement of shattuck gymnasium that was then used for the class.paine billed shattuck for the agreed upon cost of his services using legacy invoices but stating on the invoice that the check should be made to greg paine.
on january,during paine golf class at the school,shattuck student lilian wu was struck in the head by a golf ball,suffering a severe and permanent brain injury.her parents commenced a lawsuit on her behalf in district court,naming shattuck and paine as the only defendants.see lilian wu,et.mary school,wl filed.the amended complaint claimed that shattuck was vicariously liable for the acts of its agent,paine,and that the golf class was a joint enterprise between paine and shattuck.
regent,legacy insurer,denied any duty to defend paine in the wu lawsuit on the ground that paine was not an insured under legacy policy because he was not acting within the scope of his employment with legacy or performing any duties related to legacy business at the time of the accident.as a pga member,paine had obtained general and excess liability insurance issued by travelers through a pga members policy that provided coverage while teaching the game of golf for or on behalf of the pga.appellants app.at.travelers agreed to loan paine sufficient funds to defend against and resolve the wu lawsuit through a loan receipt agreement on may,the district court approved a settlement in the wu case.
travelers and paine filed the current suit against legacy insurer,regent,seeking a declaratory judgment that regent had a duty to defend paine in the wu lawsuit and seeking indemnity on the ground that paine is an insured and the regent policy provides the primary coverage.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment.after comparing the allegations of the wu complaint to the relevant policy language and considering the relevant extrinsic evidence,the district court concluded that regent had no duty to defend paine as a legacy employee because he was not acting within the scope of his employment or to further his employer interests,and that there was no allegation that he was acting as legacy golf professional.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to regent.travelers and paine appeal.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see noran neurological clinic,travelers indem,cir.we affirm the grant of summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we apply de novo review to the district court interpretation of an insurance policy,which is a question of law.noran neurological clinic,at.similarly,t he question of whether a legal duty to defend or indemnify arises is a legal question subject to de novo review.metro.prop.and cas.ins.miller.
minnesota law governs this dispute and dictates that an insurer duty to defend is determined as follows 
first,an insurer duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations of a complaint with the relevant policy language.second,if a complaint fails to establish coverage,an insurer still must accept tender of defense if it has independent knowledge of facts that may establish coverage.and third,if an insured fails to meet its burden of presenting a covered claim through a complaint or extrinsic evidence,an insurer need not speculate about facts that may trigger its duty to defend.
paul mercury ins.dahlberg,internal citations omitted.the duty to defend an insured arises when any part of the claim is arguably within the scope of the policy coverage,and an insurer wishing to escape that duty has the burden of showing that all parts of the cause of action fall clearly outside the scope of coverage.jostens,mission ins.the relevant extrinsic evidence is that which,at the time the defense is tendered,id.at,is independently known by the insurer,see dahlberg,at.there is no duty to defend one who is not an insured under the policy,but a n insurer duty to defend claims arguably within the policy coverage extends until it can be concluded as a matter of law that there is no basis on which the insurer may be obligated to indemnify the insured.meadowbrook,tower ins.
in the first step of the analysis set forth in dahlberg,that is,comparing the wu amended complaint to the relevant contract language of regent policy,see at,we agree with the district court conclusion that no duty to defend arose on the part of regent.regent policy provides coverage for bodily injury damages caused by legacy employees,but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you legacy or while performing duties related to the conduct of your legacy business.appellants app.at.the policy also provides general liability insurance in a special endorsement for any person s,other than your legacy employees,while acting as your legacy tennis or golf professional for damages arising out of professional services as a tennis or golf professional.id.at.the wu complaint did not allege that paine was legacy employee or golf professional or that he was performing duties relevant to the conduct of legacy business.those pleadings alleged only that shattuck was negligent in supervising its agent,paine,and that paine and shattuck were engaged in a joint enterprise.thus,the complaint alone did not provide regent with notice of an arguable claim of coverage that would trigger the duty to defend.
the appellants argue that regent had a duty to defend paine under the second step of the dahlberg analysis,see at,because they presented sufficient extrinsic evidence to establish that the wu claim was arguably within the scope of the regent policy coverage.the district court concluded that paine own deposition in the wu case demonstrates that he was not acting as legacy agent at the time of the injury,that his employment contract is silent as to where he teaches golf,and that any benefit to legacy from his teaching at shattuck was not sufficiently related to his employment with legacy to make out an arguable claim of coverage under the regent policy.having examined the extrinsic evidence either presented to regent or within regent knowledge at the time the request for a defense was tendered,we agree with the district court conclusion that the claim was not arguably within the scope of the regent policy coverage.
the extrinsic evidence includes the letters that provided regent with notice of the claim.they indicate that paine was a legacy employee and was instructing a class at shattuck when the injury occurred,but also included with the request for tender of defense were the pleadings in the wu case,paine deposition and recorded statement from the wu lawsuit,and a copy of paine employment contract with legacy.paine own deposition in the wu case establishes that he independently negotiated and contracted with shattuck to teach the golf class,that he was paid and supervised by shattuck,that he did not share this compensation with legacy,and that his only duty at legacy during the winter was to manage the golf pro shop.he described his teaching at shattuck during the winter as over and above his job with legacy.his employment contract with legacy permitted him to independently give golf lessons and keep the income from them but did not specifically require him to teach shattuck students.his contract permits but does not purport to control his teaching activities,and his set salary and employment status with legacy are unaffected by his independent teaching obligations.
to the extent paine job description requires him to do some teaching as legacy head golf professional,it does so in the context of his responsibility to manage the pro shop,which is at the golf course.specifically,his job description requires him to manage the following aspects of the pro shop operation teaching programs.appellants app.at.teaching a physical education golf class at shattuck,a job he independently negotiated during the slow winter months when there were no teaching programs at the pro shop or golf course,can not be considered a teaching program that is an aspect of the pro shop operation,absent some specific extrinsic evidence showing such a relationship.we see none.
paine asserts in his affidavit in this declaratory judgment action that he always considered providing golf lessons to the public as part of his duties for legacy because he is expected to give lessons and to promote member growth.there is no dispute that he is required to promote member growth and that giving golf lessons to the public may aid this objective.additionally,his professional objectives at legacy provide broadly that paine must continue to improve his image as a pro and the legacy image as a whole with its customers and the community.appellants app.at,head golf professional objectives season,signed in april three months after the incident at the school.we can not ignore,however,the specific circumstances of this case which do not present a situation where he offered himself to teach golf to the public in a manner designed to bring new members to legacy.to the contrary,paine privately contracted with a private school to teach a physical education golf class to its students during the school day.shattuck students who are on the golf team use the legacy course regardless of whether they are members,and as shattuck is in part a boarding school,it is pure speculation to assume that the school class would bring in parents as members.there is no indication that paine promoted the business of legacy in any way at the school other than through the residual,but tenuous,benefit that is possible to any golf course from someone teaching a child how to golf.see generally hentges thomford,holding as a matter of law that where a pastor injurious conduct occurred off church property on the pastor day off,was not part of a activity,and was outside the church physical and spiritual influence,the residual benefit of fostering ongoing relationships is too tenuous in its connection to the pastor employment to support a determination that he was acting within its scope.
this case is analogous to the hentges case,in which the court of appeals of minnesota considered whether a pastor conduct of injuring a parishioner in a hunting accident was within the scope of the pastor employment with the church for purposes of rendering the church vicariously liable for the injury.the hentges court analysis turned on the consideration of whether the conduct was,to some degree,in furtherance of the interests of his employer.at.the court concluded as a matter of law that any benefit to the church from the hunting excursion was too tenuous to support a determination that the pastor was acting within the scope of his employment or in furtherance of the employer interest,even where there was evidence from other ministers who testified that social and recreational interaction was important to relationships.id.at.
travelers and paine assert that the hentges case is distinguishable because it involved a pastor engaged in the leisure activity of hunting when the accident one of the pastor job responsibilities.they contend that paine conduct of teaching golf,which is undoubtedly one of his job responsibilities as legacy golf professional,is therefore arguably within the scope of his employment,related to the conduct of legacy golf business,and within his capacity as legacy golf professional,and thus a duty to defend arises.while this argument is initially appealing,we conclude that it paints with too broad a brush by characterizing every golf teaching activity in which paine might engage as relating to legacy business or as performed in his capacity as legacy golf professional.we agree with the district court that hentges is sufficiently analogous to the case at hand to permit a similar conclusion in this case,that the tenuous nature of any benefit or relation to legacy business is no greater than the benefits to the church in hentges.setting aside generalizations and unsupported inferences,we see no extrinsic evidence in this case to indicate that paine teaching at shattuck was arguably within the scope of his employment at legacy,was arguably related to the conduct of legacy business,or was arguably within his capacity as legacy golf professional.where the facts did not demonstrate an arguable claim that coverage exists,regent was not obligated to speculate about facts that may trigger its duty to defend.see dahlberg,at.
the appellants assert that paine was arguably performing a duty related to the conduct of legacy business because the school is legacy sole shareholder.this argument gives too much significance to the relationship between two separate legal entities.while the relationship and physical proximity between the two entities might well warrant a feeling of obligation on the part of paine to accommodate shattuck school students within the teaching programs organized through his management of the pro shop,it does not follow that the conduct of legacy business would require him to teach a physical education class at the shattuck school.such an inference does not arise from the mere existence of a shareholder relation.see di re cent.livestock order buying,ordinarily two or more corporations are considered separate and distinct entities even though the same individuals are the incorporators of,or own stock in,the several corporations,and even though such corporations may have the same persons as officers.
finally,the appellants argue that the district court erred by not explicitly consi
