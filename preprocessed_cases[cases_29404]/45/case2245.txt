the principal issue on appeal is whether the court has jurisdiction of a complaint filed by amgen,the manufacturer of an anemia treatment,aranesp,challenging an adjustment to the medicare part b rate at which the federal government pays hospitals for using its product.the district court dismissed amgen complaint for lack of prudential standing.although we hold that amgen has prudential standing,we affirm the dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
title xviii of the social security act of,et,establishes the medicare program,which provides federally funded medical insurance to the elderly and disabled.part a of the medicare program provides insurance coverage for inpatient hospital care,home health care,and hospice services.id.part b of medicare is a voluntary program that provides supplemental coverage for other types of care,including outpatient hospital care.id.the medicare program is subject to both fiscal limits and restrictions on administrative and judicial review.we address the former as applied to amgen in part i and the latter in part iii.
a component of the medicare b program is the outpatient prospective payment system opps,which pays hospitals directly to provide outpatient services to beneficiaries.to control costs,opps,rather than reimbursing providers for their reasonable expenses in any given year,as was done prior to,pays hospitals prospectively for their services in each upcoming year,thus requiring payments for outpatient hospital care to be made based on predetermined rates.see balanced budget act of,stat.as relevant here,opps payments governed by t are calculated through a formula setting payment weights for the provision of certain services or certain groups of clinically similar services based on the mean or median costs of providing such services in past years,with adjustments for regional cost variations.id.at t c t d.pursuant to amendments to the outpatient prospective payment system in the balanced budget refinement act of,stat,the secretary of the department of health and human services the secretary then additionally modifies those resulting payment amounts.hospitals facing actual costs significantly above their prospective payment amounts receive outlier adjustments.t e t.hospitals also receive supplemental payments,called payments,to help cover the cost of providing certain treatments,including new drugs,biologicals and medical devices.id.t hereafter,t.under t,when a drug,biological,or medical device becomes eligible for status,hospitals providing it to beneficiaries receive supplemental payments equal to of the wholesale cost of the treatment minus whatever amount the hospital would otherwise receive through the prospective payment system,t d i u o,for a period of two to three years.t c.at the end of that period,the treatment is factored into the normal prospective payment system.more generally,the secretary also has authority,in light of his or her significant expertise and judgment grounded in policy concerns over medicare complex and highly technical regulatory program,see tenet healthsystems healthcorp.thompson,quoting thomas jefferson shalala,d internal quotation omitted,to make other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments.t e hereafter,t e.no supplemental funding is available for these three types of adjustments when the secretary makes any of the three outlier adjustments,adjustments,or other equitable adjustments any additional projected expenses must be offset by a reduction in all prospective payment rates.t e.supplemental payments are additionally subject to a cap they may not exceed a fixed percentage of opps payments,and must be reduced pro rata in the event they exceed that limit.t e.
amgen is the manufacturer of darbepoetin alpha,also known as aranesp,a relatively recent biological product used to treat anemia in chemotherapy and kidney disease patients.a similar product,epoetin alpha,was developed in the late,and is presently marketed both as amgen own predecessor product,epogen,and the product of its competitor and intervenor here ortho biotech products,procrit.id.providers are presently compensated for providing epoetin alpha to beneficiaries through the regular prospective payment system.while the parties disagree about the significance of molecular differences between darbepoetin alpha and epoetin alpha,aranesp differs clinically in that it has a longer,such that many patients require less frequent dosages and therefore fewer hospital visits.id.
amgen applied on november,to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms known prior to july,as the health care financing administration,which,as relevant here,administers the medicare part b program,for transitional status so that hospitals would receive supplemental payments for providing aranesp to medicare part b beneficiaries.see t a iv.according to the complaint,in september and july,respectively,the federal drug administration approved aranesp for marketing as a treatment for kidney anemia and for anemia.cms sent amgen an approval letter on february,and on march,cms included aranesp in the reimbursement rates for,to be effective april,march.cms proposed opps rates,published on august,also included payments for aranesp.the proposed rule stated,however,that the provisions had been exceptionally difficult to implement and that cms was actively seeking comment on all aspects of these proposed rates,explaining that it was open to making changes,perhaps significant to the proposed rates based on comments received.id.at.ortho biotech,the manufacturer of procrit,submitted comments questioning the payments for aranesp in light of its purported similarity to procrit.amgen responded that the two biologicals were not substitutes,and that reimbursement amounts for aranesp should not be determined in reference to procrit.
on november,the secretary published the final rule setting opps rates.claiming to act pursuant to the authority in t e to make adjustments to ensure equitable payments,cms adjusted payments for aranesp to the level hospitals would receive under the prospective payment system,effectively eliminating the supplemental payment for the biological.id.at.the decision to reduce payments was predicated on the availability of the clinically similar yet cheaper procrit,and noted that it was not an equitable or efficient use of medicare funds to pay for these two functionally equivalent products at greatly different rates.id.because no historical cost data were available to calculate aranesp reimbursement level under the prospective payment system pursuant to t c,cms calculated a reimbursement amount using what it determined to be the equivalent dosage ratio between procrit and aranesp.id.at.as an alternative ground for the decision,the final rule stated that aranesp is not new for purposes under t a iv because it is functionally equivalent to procrit and epogen.id.at.
amgen sued the administrator of cms and the secretary on the ground that the rule reducing its payments violated the plain language of the medicare act.amgen argued that under t the secretary is required to make payments for new treatments and can only reduce those payments when necessary to keep total payments under the statutory cap,and then only on a pro rata basis for all products.alleging violations of its procedural rights as well,amgen argued that the rule was arbitrary and capricious,and that procedural irregularities violated amgen rights under the administrative procedure act and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.the district court allowed ortho biotech to intervene on the question of whether amgen had standing to bring the suit.relying in large part on the fourth circuit decision in tap pharmaceuticals of health,cir,the district court ruled that amgen,as a drug manufacturer not itself regulated by or within the zone of interests of the relevant portion of the medicare act,lacked prudential standing,and dismissed the complaint.amgen scully,d.
amgen appeals the dismissal of its complaint on the ground that the district court ruling that it lacks prudential standing to challenge opps payment amounts for its product conflicts with this court precedent as well as that of the supreme court.the court reviews de novo the dismissal of a complaint,accepting as true the allegations of the complaint.see american federation of gov t employees rumsfeld.
section a of the administrative procedure act,apa provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.the supreme court has held that to qualify as adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of a statute,a plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.lujan wildlife federation,d quoting clarke securities industry,d.a party claimed injury from administrative action,therefore,will be considered within the meaning of the relevant statute for purposes of only if the party can meet the zone of interests test.qualified plaintiffs include not only those who are themselves the subject of the contested regulatory action,clarke,at.at,but also those whose interests are not so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.id.amgen contends that it is the subject of the secretary action and that its interests are consistent with the statutory scheme.we hold that amgen interests are congruent with interests underlying the medicare act and do not reach the question whether it is a regulated party.
the supreme court has explained that t he zone of interests test is not meant to be especially demanding.clarke,at.at.thus,there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the plaintiff.id.at.at.not only need a party not be a beneficiary of a statute,a putative party objectives in the action need not be eleemosynary in nature whether they are is beside the point.cred.union admin.first national bank,d.congruence of interests,rather than identity of interests,is the benchmark the zone of interests test serves to exclude only those parties whose interests are not consistent with the purposes of the statute in question,ethyl epa,because lawsuits by such plaintiffs c arr y a considerable potential for judicial intervention that would distort the regulatory process.hazardous waste treatment council epa.
parties motivated by purely commercial interests routinely satisfy the zone of interests test under this court precedents.as the court observed in mova pharmaceutical shalala,the salient consideration under the apa is whether the challenger interests are such that they in practice can be expected to police the interests that the statute protects.see also animal legal defense fund glickman,en banc cert.denied sub,ass for biomedical research animal legal defense fund,d.manufacturers challenges to agency actions,then,fall within the zone of interests of a statute when their interests appear congruent with those of the statute.for instance,in ethyl,at,a manufacturer of fuel additives had prudential standing,under the clean air act,to challenge regulations applied to automobile manufacturers because,as the developer of products that will reduce harmful air pollutants,the company interests appear congruent with those of the statute.id.similarly,in motor equipment mfrs.ass nichols,the court held that the manufacturers of replacement automobile parts could challenge,under the clean air act,the agency order permitting california to prohibit tampering with pollution monitors,reasoning that the manufacturers commercial interest in selling replacement parts was congruent with those of mechanics and ultimately of the statute.and in cottonseed products ass brock,the manufacturers of respirators had prudential standing to challenge the effectiveness of osha regulations in filtering cotton dust on the basis of the relationship alone.id.quoting faic securities federal deposit insurance corporation.
amgen commercial interest in a full statutory reimbursement rate for aranesp is neither incidental nor antagonistic to the purposes of t,the statutory provision whose violation forms the basis for the complaint,bennett spear,d.congress adopted t as an amendment to the medicare act in because the proposed outpatient prospective payments did not adequately address issues pertaining to the treatment of drugs,biologicals and new technology,and to prevent restricted beneficiary access to drugs,biologicals and new technology.i at.amgen commercial interest in selling aranesp is congruent with the interests of beneficiaries in obtaining access to the technology because congress reason for providing supplemental payments was that hospitals inadequately reimbursed for new drugs or biologicals are less likely to provide them and more likely to steer beneficiaries towards older,less expensive treatments.the required offset to other reimbursements caused by supplemental payments for aranesp under t e requirement does not create a disqualifying conflict between amgen and beneficiaries.there would be such an offset as a result of any successful challenge brought by any eligible plaintiff seeking access to a new treatment.moreover,just as beneficiaries desiring access to aranesp and hospitals desiring reimbursement for providing it would have prudential standing to challenge payment amounts,amgen as a vendor does as well,cottonseed products ass n,at.this is true irrespective of whether hospitals or beneficiaries could file lawsuits whether amgen claim is ultimately precluded is a separate question from whether it has prudential standing to file a lawsuit.unlike hazardous waste treatment council,where the court held that an association of pollution equipment providers lacked standing to challenge the agency adoption of allegedly too weak regulations and that the statute did not manifest congressional intent to improve the competitive position of suppliers of more expensive pollution control devices,id.at,here the purpose of the provision is precisely to attract supply of items,making amgen a suitable challenger.
the district court concluded that amgen competitive interest in financial gain was not closely aligned with the federal health care insurance act.amgen,d at.in reaching this conclusion the court focused on the broad purpose of the medicare act to provide more adequate and feasible health insurance protection for the elderly,id.at,and neglected the more specific interest protected by t itself,namely,preventing restricted beneficiary access to drugs,biologicals and new technology.i at.under the precedents discussed,the fact that amgen motives were commercial is not disqualifying,and in distinguishing this circuit precedent,the district court did not give adequate weight to amgen financial alignment with congress purpose in t of increasing beneficiary access to new medical technology.the district court reliance on tap pharmaceuticals of health,cir,was also misplaced,for in holding that drug manufacturers lack prudential standing to challenge the medicare b rates at which providers are reimbursed for their drugs,the fourth circuit limited the standing of commercial entities to regulated firms,their competitors,and other firms whose interests put them in the same position,id.at,a test that this court has rejected.see tax analysts advocates blumenthal,cert.denied,d.adopting a more flexible approach that focuses instead on whether a party in practice can be expected to police the interests that the statute protects,mova pharmaceutical,at,is more faithful to the supreme court teachings,in clarke,at.at,that parties are denied a right to judicial review only when their interests are marginally related to or inconsistent with the statute at issue,and in credit union,at.at,rejecting as beside the point whether a putative plaintiff objectives are the same as those intended by congress.the commercial competitor s of regulated parties,tap pharmaceuticals,at,and those in the same position,may be examples of parties whose interests sufficiently align with some statutory schemes to confer prudential standing,but the court sees no reason to consider them the only parties so situated.
accordingly,we hold that amgen interests are sufficiently aligned with the purpose of t in ensuring the access of medicare beneficiaries to new technology,and,consequently,it has prudential standing to sue the secretary and the administrator.
that amgen has prudential standing does not resolve this appeal,however.another threshold issue is whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain amgen complaint.the administrator and secretary contend that adjustments to opps rates are not subject to judicial review.this court may affirm the dismissal of a complaint on different grounds than those relied upon by the district court.see bennett spear,d.the court jurisdiction is a pure question of law,and as the merits do not hinge on any or discretionary balancing of competing interests,a remand to the district court is unnecessary.compare,procter gamble,d eeoc children.
under t e,the medicare act authorizes the secretary to make adjustments to the payments hospitals receive under the outpatient prospective payment system 
e the secretary shall establish,in a budget neutral manner,outlier adjustments under paragraph and transitional payments under paragraph and other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments,such as adjustments for certain classes of hospitals.
t e.regarding judicial review of the secretary adjustments,the medicare act provides,in pertinent part 
there shall be no administrative or judicial review under section,of this title,or otherwise,of 
a the development of the prospective payment classification system under paragraph,including the establishment of groups and relative payment weights for covered opd outpatient department services,of wage adjustment factors,other adjustments,and methods described in paragraph f regarding measures to control unnecessary increases in the volume of covered opd services 
id.t a hereafter t a.in order to determine whether the court has jurisdiction to consider amgen complaint,the court must determine first,whether the other adjustments of which t a precludes review include the other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments authorized by t e,and second,whether the secretary may use the equitable adjustment authority under t e to alter a payment amount to which a hospital would have been otherwise been entitled pursuant to the provision in t.because we hold that t a precludes review of the equitable adjustments made pursuant to t e,and that the secretary,through cms,acted within the authority under t e in adjusting the payment amount for aranesp,our review of dhhs decision is at an end.
there is a strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action,bowen michigan academy of family physicians,d,and it can only be overcome by a clear and convincing evidence that congress intended to preclude the suit.abbott laboratories gardner,d quoting rusk cort,d.the presumption is particularly strong that congress intends judicial review of agency action taken in excess of delegated authority.see leedom kyne,d aid ass for lutherans postal service.such review is favored,the court stated in dart united states,if the wording of a preclusion clause is less than absolute.
the court therefore turns to the statute language,structure and purpose,its legislative history,and whether the claims can be afforded meaningful review.thunder basin coal reich,d.that congress intended to preclude judicial review of the secretary adjustments to prospective payment amounts is clear and convincing from the plain text of t alone.the text of t e stipulates that there shall be no administrative or judicial review of other adjustments.the legislative history reflects this stipulation.see at.that congress would use such language of prohibition is unsurprising,for piecemeal review of individual payment determinations could frustrate the efficient operation of the complex prospective payment system.block community nutrition,d.payments to hospitals are made on a prospective basis,and given the length of time that review of individual payment determinations could take,review could result in the retroactive ordering of payment adjustments after hospitals have already received their payments for the year.moreover,both the and equitable adjustments to payment rates are subject to a requirement under t e,such that judicially mandated changes in one payment rate would affect the aggregate impact of the secretary decisions by requiring offsets elsewhere,and thereby interfere with the secretary ability to ensure budget neutrality in each fiscal year.other circuits have noted the havoc that piecemeal review of opps payments could bring about,see skagit county pub.hosp.dist.shalala,cir american soc y of cataract refractive surgery thompson,cir,and this court has noted similar concerns with respect to the prospective payment system the medicare a program utilizes to reimburse hospitals for the costs of providing inpatient care.see methodist hosp.of sacramento shalala,county of los angeles shalala,cert.denied,d.
in light of the presumption that congress rarely intends to foreclose review of action exceeding agency authority,however,see leedom,at.at aid ass n,at dart,at,we construe t e to prevent review only of those other adjustments that the medicare act authorizes the secretary to make in other words,the preclusion on review of other adjustments extends no further than the secretary statutory authority to make them.first,the reference to other adjustments in t a appears alongside other components of outpatient prospective payments that are contemplated by the act,such as the establishment of relative payment weights and wage adjustment factors.the canon of statutory construction,noscitur a sociis,a word is known by the company it keeps,washington state of social and health services guardianship estate of keffeler,d,which is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid giving unintended breadth to the acts of congress,jarecki searle,d,suggests that the reference to other adjustments in t a should similarly be confined to those other adjustments otherwise provided for in the act,and at least creates sufficient ambiguity to trigger the presumption that judicial review of allegedly ultra vires agency action is favored.second,the text in t a other adjustments matches the language of other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments in t e,implying that congress intended to reference adjustments made pursuant to that subsection.third,the interference with the administration of the medicare b program that would result from judicial review pertaining to the overall scope of the secretary statutory adjustment authority,as opposed to review of the reasonableness or procedural propriety of the secretary individual applications,would be sufficiently offset by the likely gains from reducing the risk of systematic misinterpretation in the administration of the medicare b program.in the similar context of prospective payments to hospitals providing inpatient services under the medicare a program,which also operates under constraints,review of the validity of certain determinations by the secretary has been held to be available notwithstanding an express preclusion on review of individual determinations,see universal health services of mcallen,sullivan,aff,table.
proceeding,then,on the basis that t a precludes judicial review of any adjustment made by the secretary pursuant to the equitable adjustment authority under t e,but not of those for which such authority is lacking,the court turns to the question of whether t e authorizes the type of adjustment the secretary,acting through cms,made here.this requires consideration of the merits of amgen claim that the secretary decision to eliminate payments for aranesp violated t,which dictates the manner in which such payments are to be calculated.if a provision shields particular types of administrative action,a court ma
