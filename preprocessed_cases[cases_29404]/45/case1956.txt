in this case,plaintiff walton technology,walton,a subcontractor on a federal construction project,claims that the prime contractor,defendant weststar engineering,weststar,failed to pay walton rental fees for equipment it rented from walton for use on the project.walton filed suit against weststar and its miller act surety,defendant reliance insurance company reliance,alleging three causes of action.with respect to weststar,walton claimed unjust enrichment and conversion based on its alleged entitlement to a pro rata share of weststar recovery from its insurance provider representing rental fees submitted by weststar as part of a damage claim associated with the rental equipment.walton also claimed that reliance and its principal,weststar,were liable on the miller act payment bond.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of weststar on the claims for unjust enrichment and conversion,concluding that walton was not entitled to a share of weststar insurance proceeds under either theory.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of reliance and weststar on walton miller act claim.because weststar had not been paid by the government so as to satisfy the subcontract clause providing that weststar would only be obligated to pay walton when and if paid by the government,the district court concluded that there were no sums justly due under the miller act.the district court awarded attorney fees to both defendants.
walton appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of weststar and reliance,as well as the award of attorney fees.we have jurisdiction under and affirm the district court judgment in favor of weststar on the unjust enrichment and conversion claims.however,we reverse the judgment in favor of reliance and weststar on the miller act claim.allowing defendants to avoid liability under the miller act based on the unsatisfied pay when and if paid clause in the subcontract between walton and weststar would prevent walton from exercising its miller act rights in the absence of a clear and explicit waiver of those rights.because we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion against both defendants,we also vacate the district court award of attorney fees to defendants as premature.
factual background 
weststar was the prime contractor on a federal project involving the repainting of the navy hammerhead crane in bremerton,washington.in compliance with the miller act,weststar obtained a payment bond from reliance guaranteeing payment to all those supplying labor and materials to the project.weststar subcontracted with walton to rent a fabric and frame shroud called the sail system to cover the crane as the work proceeded.the agreement between weststar and walton was set forth in weststar purchase order and its agreement addendum dated march,purchase order subcontract.
although the rental period was originally scheduled to end in september,various delays prevented weststar from completing the project on schedule.by the end of october,walton claimed that weststar was delinquent on rental fees and payments for other services in the amount of.on november,walton filed suit in federal court alleging that weststar had breached the purchase order subcontract by failing to make timely payment.shortly after,weststar and walton entered into settlement negotiations.
while the negotiations were pending,the sail system was damaged in a series of incidents.in late november,navy personnel operating a hyster forklift struck and damaged the sail system.the next day,a severe windstorm caused further damage.one month later,the sail system incurred even more damage when bremerton was hit by high winds,heavy rain,and heavy snowfall.weststar corporate parent,amelco,tendered notice of property damage claims to its insurer,paul fire marine insurance company paul in december and early january.
on january,walton and weststar executed the settlement agreement modification to,hammerhead crane project the settlement agreement.the settlement agreement provided for continuation of the rental period for the sail system under the purchase order subcontract,weststar continued use of the sail system until completion of the project,and the settlement of all existing disputes and lawsuits,including the breach of contract claim filed november.under the settlement agreement,weststar agreed to pay walton the sum of in full settlement of all disputes and lawsuits between weststar and walton existing at the time of the execution of the agreement and in full payment of the monthly rental for the framing system through january.the settlement agreement also provided the terms under which weststar would be obligated to make future payments to walton.future payment of rental fees would be subject to the following provision 
i t is expressly agreed that any further payment to walton for the framing and fabric rental shall only be made when and if paid by the navy and only to the extent paid by the navy walton technology will be paid its pro rata share of any recovery upon receipt by weststar,based on the ratio between weststar overall claim amount and the recovered amount,as applied to walton claim.emphasis added.
the parties affirmed their continuing rights and obligations under the purchase order subcontract,except as modified by the settlement agreement.the parties also agreed that if any legal action,arbitration or other proceeding became necessary to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement,the prevailing party would be entitled to recover attorney fees and costs incurred in such action or proceeding.
in march,weststar requested invoices from walton covering the months of january through april of.walton prepared the invoices,all dated march,and submitted them together.walton also sent an invoice for may,dated june.walton continued to furnish the sail system for weststar use through the end of.
weststar included the invoices provided by walton in its property damage claim to paul.in august,paul and weststar settled the property damage claims.paul reimbursed weststar in full for the sums weststar claimed it owed walton technology for equipment rentals,materials,and technical support,plus overhead and profit markups.weststar paid walton for rental fees for january,materials,and technical services.although weststar continued to use the sail system until december,it made no further rental payments to walton for the rental periods after january.weststar disassembled the sail system and shipped it back to walton on january and february.
on april,walton filed the instant action against weststar and its miller act surety,reliance.walton claims unjust enrichment and conversion against weststar based on walton alleged entitlement to a pro rata portion of weststar insurance recovery for rental fees included in the invoices prepared by walton and submitted by weststar as part of its property damage claim.walton also claims that reliance is liable on the miller act payment bond for unpaid rental fees through december.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court granted defendants motion,denied plaintiff motion,and dismissed the action.the district court then granted defendants motion for attorney fees in the amount of.these timely appeals followed.

iii.discussion 
walton claims against.walton unjust enrichment claim against weststar 
walton argues that it is entitled to recover a pro rata portion of weststar recovery on an insurance claim submitted to its insurer,st paul,representing amounts included in walton rental invoices for the months of february through may that were submitted by weststar as part of its claim.walton maintains that it has satisfied the three elements of an unjust enrichment claim a benefit conferred by walton upon weststar an appreciation or knowledge by weststar of the benefit and the acceptance or retention by weststar of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for weststar to retain the benefit.bailie,trend bus.under washington law,however,a party to a valid express contract is bound by the provisions of that contract,and may not disregard the same and bring an action on an implied contract relating to the same matter,in contravention of the express contract.chandler.toll bridge.having affirmed the validity of the purchase order subcontract and the settlement agreement,walton can not proceed against weststar by way of unjust enrichment.walton claim,if any,must be for breach or enforcement of one or both of these agreements.we,therefore,affirm the district court judgment for weststar on the unjust enrichment claim.
walton conversion claim against weststar 
walton also argues that it is entitled to reimbursement based on conversion due to weststar unjustified,willful interference with a chattel which deprives a person entitled to the property of possession.weststar notes that although money can,in some instances,be the subject of conversion,walton did not satisfy its burden of showing that it had an ownership right in the insurance proceeds that weststar received from paul.weststar,not walton,paid the premiums for its property insurance coverage.walton contention that weststar insurance recovery was based on losses that weststar did not incur may form the basis of an action by paul for insurance fraud,but walton can not assert this claim.accordingly,the district court properly granted weststar motion for summary judgment on this claim.
walton miller act claim 
defendants contend that they are not liable to walton under the miller act because the pay when and if paid clause contained in the settlement agreement has not been satisfied.we conclude,however,that to permit a miller act surety and its principal to avoid liability on this basis would prevent a subcontractor from exercising its miller act rights in the absence of a clear and explicit waiver of those rights.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of reliance and its principal,weststar.
the miller act 
the miller act requires a general contractor on a federal construction project to furnish a payment bond for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of work provided for in the contract.a.the act represents a congressional effort to protect persons supplying labor and material for the construction of federal public buildings in lieu of the protection they might receive under state statutes with respect to the construction of nonfederal buildings.mai steel serv.blake constr,cir quoting united states ex rel.sherman carter,d.because the miller act is highly remedial in nature i t is entitled to a liberal construction and application in order properly to effectuate the congressional intent to protect those whose labor and materials go into public projects.sherman,at.citing fleisher engineering united states ex rel.hallenbeck.
the act creates a cause of action in favor of e very person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract.a.under the act,such persons who have not been paid in full therefor before the expiration of a period of ninety days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which such claim is made shall have the right to sue on the payment bond for the sum or sums justly due him.id.however,no such suit shall be commenced after the expiration of one year after the day on which the last of the labor was performed or material was supplied.id.thus,by the express terms of the miller act a subcontractor right of recovery on a miller act payment bond is conditioned on the passage of time from completion of work or provision of materials.
there is no dispute that walton,in its capacity as a subcontractor,is a person entitled to bring a claim against reliance on the miller act payment bond.clifford macevoy united states ex rel.calvin tomkins.interpreting person to include subcontractors who deal directly with the prime contractor,as well as any subcontractor who has supplied labor or materials to a subcontractor.nor do the parties dispute that walton has not been paid for rental fees within ninety days of completing its obligations under the purchase order contract as modified by the settlement agreement.rather,the dispute here centers on whether reliance can assert the unsatisfied pay when and if paid clause contained in the settlement agreement as a defense to liability on the miller act payment bond.we conclude that it can not.
reliance liability to walton under the miller act 
defendants contend that because the pay when and if paid clause in the settlement agreement has not been satisfied,due to the fact that weststar has not been paid by the navy,there are no sums justly due for which walton is entitled to recover under the miller act.according to defendants,allowing a miller act surety and its principal to avoid liability on this basis is required by the general rule of suretyship law stating that a surety liability is coextensive with that of its principal.although general rules of suretyship law apply to miller act cases,am.cas.of reading arrow road construction,cir,defendants assume that coextensive liability between a surety and its principal is in every case defined and limited by the principal contractual liability.in the context of miller act cases,however,we must look beyond the principal contractual liability,to the miller act itself,in defining the limits of coextensive liability between a surety and its principal.
the miller act provides a federal cause of action,and the scope of the remedy as well as the substance of the rights created thereby is a matter of federal,not state law.rich,united states ex rel.indust.lumber,d.in contrast to a surety who provides a payment bond on a private construction project or pursuant to a little miller act under state law,the liability of a miller act surety is controlled by federal law because determination of the extent of the liability involves the construction of a federal statute,the miller act,under which it was created.cont l cas.schaefer,cir accord sherman,at.it is clear that the surety liability on a miller act bond must be at least coextensive with the obligations imposed by the act if the bond is to have its intended effect.sherman,at.thus,the liability of a surety and its principal on a miller act payment bond is coextensive with the contractual liability of the principal only to the extent that it is consistent with the rights and obligations created under the miller act.
this principle is illustrated by our decision in mai steel service,blake construction,cir.in mai steel,the subcontractor appealed a judgment holding that a miller act surety was not liable for labor and material costs caused by construction delays.we reversed the district court,holding that the subcontractor ability to recover did not hinge either on the cause of the delay or the terms of the underlying contract.id.at citing united states ex rel.mech.contractors millers mut.fire ins.of texas,cir.rather,we held that the surety liability depended entirely on whether the claim fell within the language of the miller act,interpreted in light of its protective purpose.id.quoting mech.contractors,at
