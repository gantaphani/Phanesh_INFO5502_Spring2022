progressive gulf insurance company seeks review of the district court order denying its motion for summary judgment and of a later order entering judgment in favor of the defendants.the sole issue before us is whether nevada or mississippi law applies to the parties insurance contract.because mississippi law applies,we reverse the judgment of the district court.

the faehnrichs divorced and,in,toni faehnrich moved to nevada.on june,toni faehnrich was involved in a rollover vehicle accident while the two children were passengers in her car.randall faehnrich presented a bodily injury claim to progressive gulf on behalf of the children,which progressive gulf denied,citing the policy exclusion.
the parties stipulated that,if mississippi law is applicable,there is no coverage under the terms and conditions of the progressive policy.we certified the following question to the nevada supreme court 
does nevada public policy preclude giving effect to a provision in an insurance contract that was negotiated,executed,and delivered while the parties resided outside of nevada,when that effect would deny any recovery under nevada revised statutes section to nevada residents who were injured in nevada 
the nevada supreme court chose to rephrase the question,as is its prerogative.rephrased,the question the nevada supreme court answered was 
does nevada public policy preclude giving effect to a household exclusion clause in an automobile liability insurance policy delivered in mississippi to mississippi residents and choosing mississippi law as controlling,where mississippi law permits household exclusions but the effect of the exclusion is to deny nevada residents who were injured in nevada recovery of the minimum coverages specified in nrs 
the nevada supreme court answered this question in the negative,holding that giving effect to the provision in the parties automobile insurance policy does not violate nevada public policy.because mississippi law applies,summary judgment should have been granted in favor of progressive gulf.the facts and reasoning are fully set out in the nevada supreme court decision,progressive gulf ins.faehnrich,wl.march,which we attach as an appendix.

before the court en banc.
the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit has certified the following question to this court does nevada public policy preclude giving effect to a provision in an insurance contract that was negotiated,executed,and delivered while the parties resided outside of nevada,when that effect would deny any recovery under nrs to nevada residents who were injured in nevada 
the certified question grows out of a dispute over the validity of a household exclusion in an automobile liability insurance policy.the policy was negotiated,delivered,and renewed several times in mississippi,where eandail and toni faehnrich lived with their two children.the policy was entitled mississippi motor vehicle policy.the faehnriches insurance application listed mississippi as their state of residence.this made mississippi the state whose statutory law the policy incorporated 
terms of policy conformed to statutes 
if any provision of this policy fails to conform with the legal requirements of the state listed on your application as your residence mississippi,the provision shall be deemed amended to conform with such legal requirements.all other provisions shall be given full force and effect.any disputes as to the coverages provided or the provisions of this policy shall be governed by the law of the state listed on.your application as your residence.
emphasis added.the parties and the ninth circuit refer to the italicized language as the policy provision.
eventually,the couple divorced and toni moved to nevada.she drove here in a jeep that she and randall the couple minor children,both boys,then flew out to join their mother in las vegas.the next day,while driving the jeep with the children as passengers,toni was involved in a accident the car rolled,and the boys suffered serious injuries.at the time,the jeep still carried mississippi registration and license plates,and toni had a mississippi driver license.
the insurance policy,issued by progressive gulf insurance,generally provides bodily injury liability coverage up to per person and per accident.but it includes a household exclusion that,on its face,eliminates coverage for the boys claims against toni,the exclusion states that the policy liability coverage does not apply to bodily injury to you or a relative.relative is defined as 
a person residing in the same household as you,and related to you by blood,marriage,or adoption your unmarried dependent children temporarily away from home will be considered residents if they intend to continue to reside in your household.
when the policy was issued,progressive offered,but the faehnriches declined,all bodily injury coverage.
randall presented a claim to progressive for his sons injuries.citing the household exclusion,the insurer denied coverage.progressive then brought a declaratory judgment action in nevada federal district court,followed by a motion for summary judgment,seeking,among other things,an order declaring the household exclusion valid and applicable.stressing that t he family member or household exclusion does not afford the minimum bodily injury coverage required by the nevada insurance code,see nrs nes,the district court denied summary judgment.it held that the exclusion violates nevada public policy and is unenforceable and,in accordance with nevada choice of law rules,mississippi law validating such exclusions can not apply.
progressive appealed.because the order denying summary judgment did not resolve the case,the ninth circuit dismissed the first appeal for lack of a final,appealable judgment.there followed a stipulation designed to convert the summary judgment denial into a final judgment.in the stipulation,the parties agreed that if mississippi law is applicable,there is no coverage under the terms and conditions of the progressive policy.they further agreed that,i n the event that nevada law is applicable,progressive would owe a duty to indemnify toni faehnrich consistent with the terms and conditions of its policy up to the applicable limits of per person and per occurrence,and that this would entitle the two children to apiece for their bodily injuries.in the stipulation progressive waives any other coverage defenses,and both sides agree that there are no other issues to adjudicate.
a second ninth circuit appeal followed.after briefing and argument,a divided panel concluded that this case turns on an unsettled question of nevada public policy and certified that question to this court.
rule of the nevada rules of appellate procedure gives this court discretionary authority to accept and answer certified questions of nevada law that may be determinative of the cause then pending
