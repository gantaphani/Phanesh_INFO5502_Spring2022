plaintiff,susan friedman,appeals the district court denial of her motion to remand to state court for lack of jurisdiction.this appeal stems from friedman suit on behalf of herself and all those similarly situated against her insurer,new york life insurance.friedman claims that her premiums were raised in violation of certain statutory provisions of florida law that were,she asserts,incorporated into her contract with new york life she seeks reimbursement of the allegedly overpaid premiums,declaratory relief,and an injunction against continuing violation of florida law.the case was brought in state court and removed by new york life on diversity grounds.because we conclude that new york life failed to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement,we conclude that the district court was without diversity jurisdiction 
facts and procedural history 
friedman is a member of the american veterinary medical association avma,and her health plan is a group plan offered to avma members.at the time of her enrollment,there were three premium rating classes used by the avma standard,standard plus and standard plus.due to her health history,friedman was placed in the standard plus rating class at enrollment,and her premium was higher than the standard premium rating class.at the time she enrolled,standard plus rates were higher than the standard premium rating class.several years after she enrolled,new york life raised the rates for the standard plus group to higher than standard,and for standard plus to higher than standard.friedman proposed class is all avma insureds in florida rated standard plus standard plus.
the suit was originally brought in the judicial circuit court in and for palm beach county.new york life removed on diversity grounds.friedman moved for remand to state court,claiming that the amount in controversy requirement had not been met.the district court denied the motion,as well as a motion for reconsideration.
the district court judge did not provide any reasoning for its denial of friedman motion for remand to state court or her motion for reconsideration.on appeal,new york life offers three possible bases for a finding that the amount in controversy exceeds the aggregate total of the premium increases for which class members seek reimbursement exceeds the amount in controversy is equal to the face value of friedman policy,which exceeds and the value of injunctive relief to the plaintiffs exceeds.
ii.discussion 
diversity is the only potential basis for jurisdiction in the instant case.as this court explained in morrison allstate indem,cir lower federal courts are empowered to hear only cases for which there has been a congressional grant of jurisdiction,and once a court determines that there has been no grant that covers a particular case,the court sole remaining act is to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.id.at citations omitted.as this court noted in kirkland midland mortgage,cir,i n removal cases,the burden is on the party who sought removal to demonstrate that federal jurisdiction exists.where the plaintiff has not plead a specific amount of damages the defendant is required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy can be satisfied.id.at citations omitted.
aggregation 
in morrison,this court outlined the relevant framework with regard to the aggregation issue that is the crux of this case 
generally,if no single plaintiff claim satisfies the requisite amount in controversy,there can be no diversity jurisdiction.however,there are situations in which multiple plaintiffs have a unified,indivisible interest in some common fund that is the object of litigation,permitting them to add together,or aggregate,their individual stakes to reach the amount in controversy threshold.as explained by the supreme court in zahn international paper 
when two or more plaintiffs,having separate and distinct demands,unite for convenience and economy in a single suit,it is essential that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount but when several plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right,in which they have a common and undivided interest,it is enough if their interests collectively equal the jurisdictional amount.
zahn,at.at quoting troy bank of troy,indiana whitehead.
despite pervasive criticism of the separate and distinct versus common and undivided distinction as arcane and confusing,there appears to be a common thread in the relevant case presence of a common and undivided interest is rather uncommon,existing only when the defendant owes an obligation to the group of plaintiffs as a group and not to the individuals severally.see eagle american and,cir t he character of the interest asserted depends on the source of plaintiffs claims.if the claims are derived from rights that they hold in group status,then the claims are common and undivided.if not,the claims are separate and distinct.national org.for women mutual of omaha ins,t he cases that allow aggregation often speak of the presence of some fund to which a plaintiff class is seeking access,and they often involve an attempt to enforce a right that belongs to a group.
our predecessor court elucidated this point further in eagle star ins.maltes,cir,stating t he supreme court has evinced a desire to give a strict construction to allegations of the jurisdictional amount in controversy,so as to allow aggregation only in those situations where there is not only a common fund from which the plaintiffs seek relief,but where the plaintiffs also have a joint interest in that fund,such that if plaintiffs rights are not affected by the rights of,then there can be no aggregation in other words,the obligation to the plaintiffs must be a joint one.id.at see also gilman bhc,cir plaintiffs in paradigm common fund cases assert claims to a piece of land,a trust fund,an estate,an insurance policy,a lien,or an item of collateral,which they claim as common owners or in which they share a common interest arising under a single title or right.
morrison,at emphasis added in morrison.
the morrison case is similar to the instant case in several respects.it involved a class action against insurance company defendants.the issue was the amount in controversy and whether the claims of the class members could be aggregated to reach that threshold.also,like this case,the plaintiffs were not seeking the face amount of the policy,but rather were seeking a different amount.they sought damages for the diminished value of their wrecked vehicles after repair in other words,they sought the difference in value between value and value.in addition to their damage claims,they also sought injunctive relief.applying the principles quoted above,this court held that the nature of the right asserted was crucial,and that the rights asserted by the morrison plaintiffs were separate and distinct and therefore could not be aggregated.
we conclude that friedman and the other putative class members have separate and distinct claims,which do not constitute common and undivided claims to a common fund.friedman and each of the other plaintiffs each claims a right to damages,namely a right to be reimbursed for the amounts that each has overpaid in premiums,which overpayments they allege violate florida law.each plaintiff could have brought a separate suit.if plaintiffs prevail,each plaintiff will recover precisely the amount of his or her overpayment whether in the same or different amounts without any effect on the rights of.moreover,there is no common fund the plaintiffs do not seek distribution of the face amount of the policy rather,each plaintiff seeks only reimbursement of the amount he or she overpaid in premiums.
new york life argues that there should be aggregation because the class members here are seeking the totality of all of the overcharged amounts,such that they seek to create a fund from which class members will benefit.we reject this argument because such a fund is not the type of common fund which is required for aggregation.as the second circuit noted in gilman 
such a fund is created to facilitate the litigation process in virtually every class action,and has nothing necessarily to do with whether the plaintiffs shared a interest in the subject of the litigation.
under the classic common fund cases,what controls is the nature of the right asserted,not whether successful vindication of the right will lead to a single pool of money that will be allocated among the plaintiffs.to call any recovery that a class might win a fund to which the class members are jointly entitled is merely added verbage.there is no fund.the claim remains one on behalf of separate individuals for the damage suffered by each due to the alleged conduct of the defendant.
at citations omitted.see morrison,at citing gilman as having explained cogently the difference between a common fund permitting aggregation and the common fund that is usually generated in any class action.as in gilman,the claims in the instant case remain separate and distinct claims of separate individuals for reimbursement of the amount each overpaid.
new york life also argues that friedman and her putative class members are mere certificate holders,and that there is only one policy which was issued by new york life to avma.indeed,the only ground upon which new york life seeks to distinguish morrison is that morrison involved multiple insurance policies,whereas the instant case involves only a single insurance policy.we find new york life attempted distinction of morrison to be unpersuasive.the instant plaintiffs are not asserting a claim for the proceeds of that single policy rather,each plaintiff is asserting a claim to be reimbursed the amount of overpaid premiums which each plaintiff paid.
also,new york life suggestion that the individual certificate holders do not have individual contracts with new york life is undermined by the florida case law.in equitable life assurance society of the united states wagoner,so d,dca,the florida court stated while the authorities are divided on the question,we believe the better view to be the one which holds that under group life insurance policies there is a contract between the insurer and the individual insured,that the contract consists both of the master policy and the certificate of insurance construed together.this portion of wagoner was quoted with approval in rucks old republic life ins,so d,dca,and rucks was quoted with approval by this court in davis crown life ins,cir.see also lutz protective life ins,d,under indistinguishable facts involving a group policy,holding that each individual certificate holder had an individual policy with the insurance company,and that aggregation was not proper.
in support of its argument that certificate holders like friedman do not have individual contracts with new york life,and in support of its argument that this fact has crucial significance for the common and undivided interest issue,new york life cites eagle,cir phoenix ins.woosley,cir bishop general motors,broenen beaunit,aff,cir edgerton armour.
all of these cases are distinguishable each involved some variation of a common fund and an undivided interest.in eagle,plaintiffs were shareholders of a utility company and their claim was akin to a shareholders derivative suit.at.broenen also involved shareholder plaintiffs.the trust indenture they jointly held prohibited each from taking any action that would affect the rights of others.at.in edgerton,plaintiffs were all shareholders or assignees of a dissolved corporation.at.in phoenix,the parties were seeking distribution of the proceeds of a fire insurance policy,and had a common and undivided interest in the claim.at 
indeed,new york life can point to no case in this or any other circuit allowing aggregation for jurisdictional purposes where each plaintiff has a claim of the kind described,one which plaintiff could have brought separately in which the amount received does not vary depending upon whether other plaintiffs join or drop out and in which a potential plaintiff does not result in that plaintiff alleged damages inuring to the benefit of any other party.
to see the difference between the instant case and the cases involving common fund scenarios subject to aggregation,it is useful to consider a hypothetical that simplifies the facts of the instant case and provides,for illustrative purposes only,some figures.suppose that friedman class initially had members and that,if each prevailed on the merits and the court ordered repayment of the disputed premiums,each member would receive the amount that he or she had overpaid in premiums.suppose further that the overpayment amount is the same for each class member and that the overpayment amount is.finally,suppose that class members lose interest in the case and drop out,leaving only members in the class.each of the remaining members would receive the same he or she would have received prior to the departure of the others.conversely,if the class grew to members,the original would not see their recovery in any way diminished 
finally,new york life argues that if the plaintiffs get relief in this case,then the entire group will be affected by future premium changes.specifically,new york life claims that there is a common relationship between the class members and that future premiums will shift between the various class members between the class members and other insureds as a result of any declaratory or injunctive relief obtained by friedman.according to new york life,from any one class will increase the premium rates of the remaining people insured through the group policy.
we have no reason to doubt that,if new york life loses on the merits of this case,one possible response might be an attempt to shift some of this cost amongst its other insureds.however,we are not persuaded that the possibility of such,which is characteristic of insurance generally,should trigger aggregation for purposes of calculating the amount in controversy new york life argument proves too much if prospective in response to lawsuits triggered aggregation,aggregation would be the rule,and not the strictly construed exception.morrison,at eagle star ins,at 
in sum,aggregation is not permissible in this case.
face value 
new york life contends that even if aggregation is improper,the case meets the amount in controversy requirement because the face value of the policy controls and friedman policy has a face value of million.in support of this proposition,new york life cites guardian life insurance muniz,cir per curiam carnes employers liability assurance,cir new york life insurance swift,cir.
these cases are easily distinguishable,as each involved a dispute about the validity of the policy or the scope of coverage for a claim that put the face amount of the policy at issue.in both guardian,at,and swift,at,the insurer alleged that the insured had procured life insurance by fraud and sought to cancel the policy.
in carnes,one of the defendants had insured a truck with plaintiff,an insurance company.the truck was used by this defendant for hauling liquid butane.when the truck blew up,killing and injuring multiple people,the insurer sought a declaratory judgment against all claims to the policy by those who suffered losses in the explosion,on grounds that the policy did not cover use of the truck for hauling liquid butane.the court stated that t he amount in controversy is the value of that which is sought to have declared free from policy for.id.at.
where,as here,there is no controversy involving the face value of the policy,but only with regards to certain premiums,it would make no sense to consider the policy face value to be the amount in controversy.
injunctive relief.
finally,new york life argues that the value of any injunctive relief should be added to the value of the compensatory damages.however,new york life conceded at oral argument that it has not argued that any single plaintiff is seeking relief which would total,including any and all aspects of such relief.therefore,new york life argument that the amount in controversy is satisfied necessarily depends upon its aggregation argument.
we have already determined the nature of the right asserted by friedman and the other putative class members,namely that they are asserting individual r
