appellants southwestern life insurance,reassure america life insurance,and valley forge life insurance collectively,the insurers appeal the april,order of the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,finding the insurers in contempt of court for violations of previously issued injunctions in the court receivership case over the assets of former viatical settlement companies and their trustees.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court order.
backgrounda.substantive facts 
this case has a long and complicated history.the current dispute arises between three providers of life insurance policies,southwestern life insurance,reassure america life insurance,and valley forge life insurance collectively,the insurers,and the receiver for two viatical settlement companies,liberte capital group liberte and alpha capital group alpha.the insurers are not parties to the underlying litigation.
both liberte and alpha marketed viatical life insurance policies to investors,and both used viatical escrow services ves to provide trustee services in handling monies received from investors to buy policies and to service premium payments over time.capwill fund leasing cfl invested monies obtained by ves in ves capacity as escrow agent and fiduciary for companies engaged in marketing viatical settlements.ves and cfl were both wholly owned by james capwill.in,liberte sued james capwill,ves,and cfl in federal district court,alleging widespread civil rico violations for the misuse,misappropriation,and dissipation of monies received from investors.a receiver was appointed in the liberte case for the liberte funds still held by ves and cfl.when alpha joined the action as an intervening plaintiff,the district court likewise appointed a receiver over the alpha funds and alpha itself.eventually,the two receiverships were joined under a single receiver,william wuliger,the appellee in the case at bar.
the district court orders which appointed the liberte and alpha receivers established identical general injunctions against satellite litigation.the injunctions read 
it is further ordered that all creditors,claimants,bodies politic,parties in interest,and all sheriffs,marshals,and other officers,and their respective attorneys,servants,agents,and employees,and all other persons,firms,and corporations be,and they hereby are,jointly and severally,enjoined and stayed from commencing or continuing any action at law or suit or proceeding in equity to foreclose any lien or enforce any claim against ves cfl and alpha capital group,or their property,or against the receiver in any court.said entities are further stayed from executing or issuing or causing the execution or issuance out of any court of any writ,process,summons,attachment,subpoena,replevin,execution,or other process for the purpose of impounding or taking possession of or interfering with,or enforcing any claim or lien upon,any property owned by or in the possession of the said receiver,and from doing any act or thing whatsoever to interfere with the receiver in the discharge of his duties in this proceeding with the exclusive jurisdiction of this court over said properties and said receiver.
many of the insurance policies underlying the viatical investments marketed by liberte and alpha had been procured through fraud.a parallel government criminal investigation into james capwill the ves and cfl principal estimated at one point that percent of the insurance policies implicated in the liberte viatical investments had been fraudulently obtained.the insurers have pursued numerous independent actions to rescind or cancel fraudulently obtained policies.these fraudulent policies were the subject of one of the insurer,southwestern life,attempts to intervene in a related case the jamieson case and the case at bar southwestern life requested leave to intervene when the liberte receiver at the time sought permission from the court to market insurance policies in the liberte portfolio that had been designated by the government as fraudulently obtained but were beyond the contestability period.southwestern life objected,arguing that to permit the receiver to sell the policies would be to perpetuate a fraud on the issuing insurance companies such as southwestern life.in denying the motion,the district court required the receiver to market such policies only with full disclosure to prospective buyers as to potential claims against policy payment.the district court also noted 
initially,it should be made clear what this court is not adjudicating at this time it is not adjudicating the respective rights of any investor,the receiver,any purchaser of policies from the receiver,or any insurer regarding any policy,in particular those policies sought to be marketed as to which the government asserts a defense of fraud on the insurance company may be asserted to avoid payment.those issues as to specified policies may be the subject of future litigation in this or other courts of competent jurisdiction.
the issue before this court is the right of the receiver to market and sell policies asserted to have been fraudulently obtained to sophisticated investors who are given appropriate warning of the defenses which may be asserted by the insurers this order does not deprive the insurers of any defenses available against the receiver or any transferee of the receiver.
at,order,april,emphasis in original.the district court reiterated the applicability of the above order to the case at bar when the district court denied southwestern life motion to intervene in its april,order in the alpha receivership case 
turning to the purpose for which intervention is sought,southwestern asserts it is solely on the issues concerning southwestern life insurance policies and the general receiver attempt to sell void and canceled policies.however,this court order of april,addressed these concerns 
as southwestern is not precluded from otherwise bringing actions or asserting defenses relative to its policies,its purpose in this litigation does not strike this court as necessary.
at order,april.both sides in the action before this court agree that the above orders permit the insurers to file declaratory judgment actions against the receiver as the real party in interest for allegedly fraudulently obtained policies held in the receivership portfolio.the parties disagree,however,on where such actions may be filed,whether such actions may include matured policies already paid into the receivership estate,and whether the above language permits joinder of alpha and liberte in actions.
liberte and alpha are now defunct corporations,in existence solely for the purpose of distributing the remaining assets to the viatical investors under and pursuant to the receivership in the case at bar.
procedural history 
the delaware lawsuit 
on january,the insurers filed suit in delaware superior court against liberte,alpha,and the receiver.the complaint requested declaratory relief with respect to the insurers obligations on allegedly fraudulently obtained,but not yet matured,policies in the receivership portfolio.in addition,the complaint requested damages indemnification with respect to matured policies already paid out from the liberte and alpha investment pools the funds for which are held in the receivership and which were allegedly procured through fraud.finally,the insurers requested a declaratory judgment that they were entitled to a of their damages on fraudulent policies from their obligations to pay on legitimate policies in the alpha and liberte portfolios.for all counts the insurers requested costs and attorneys fees.
the receiver motion for a finding of contempt 
after being served with the summons for the delaware action,the receiver filed a motion with the district court handling the receivership case,requesting that the court hold that the delaware action was in violation of the court previously issued injunctions.in particular,the receiver alleged that the delaware state court was an improper forum for actions against the receiver,that claims for money damages to be paid from receivership assets were never authorized by the district court,that the joinder of alpha as a defendant was in direct violation of district court orders,and that the request for was a willful attempt to interfere with the receiver obligations to collect legitimate monies owed for distribution to investors.
the district court conclusions 
after granting the insurers an opportunity to show cause why the court should not find the insurers in contempt of prior district court orders,the district court ruled that the delaware litigation was in violation of its previously issued injunctions against satellite litigation because the suit exceeded the scope of the litigation exception carved out in the april,and april,orders.the district court concluded that the litigation exception was limited to suits against the receiver or any transferee of the receiver.at citing the april,order.in particular,the court held that it had never authorized suit against the entities in receivership,including alpha capital group.the court also held that its authorization for suits against the receiver or its transferees was limited to the validity of policies.the court found that its prior injunctions and orders in the case made it clear that the assets already held by the receiver were not subject to contest.the court stated that it had specifically held that any challenge to the validity of a life insurance policy within the receivership portfolio must be raised prior to the viator death,if at all.at.the court referenced the following language from the april,order 
t he receiver shall be permitted to accept death benefits on any mature policy,providing he has not received a prior notice of rescission or cancellation from any insurance company and that said policy has not been the subject of a prior order of any court of competent jurisdiction declaring such policy to be void due to fraud on the insurer.
at.finally,the court found that 
in light of this court order expressly enjoining the commencement of suit against receivership entity alpha capital group doc,it appears that the insurers sole purpose for joining alpha as a defendant was to defeat the receiver diversity claim,force him to defend the action in a distant forum non conveniens,and unnecessarily increase the litigation costs to the receivership estate,all to the detriment of the defrauded investors.
in an order dated april,the district court found the insurers in contempt of the court general injunctions dated july,and february,because the delaware suit was not within the april,and april,limited litigation exception.the district court enjoined the insurers from pursuing the delaware action and specifically noted that the insurers could file suit in a federal or state court in ohio to litigate their financial obligations regarding any policies within the receivership.the court held the issue of sanctions in abeyance.
the insurers argument on appeal 
the insurers appealed the district court order to this court on april.the insurers make three interrelated arguments to this court.first,the insurers argue that the district court interpretation of its prior orders was unfounded.in particular,the insurers argue i that the prior orders can not be construed as limiting suits to nonmatured policies,ii that the prior orders did not preclude the naming of alpha as a defendant to the insurers tort claims,and iii that the district court erred by finding that the delaware court was not a court of competent jurisdiction in which the prior orders permitted suit.as a result,the insurers argue,the district court abused its discretion in finding the insurers in contempt of those prior orders.second,the insurers contend that district court construction of the prior orders as permitting suit on policies only prior to a viator death denied the insurers due process because the insurers never had the opportunity to contest the order deciding as such.finally,the insurers argue in the alternative that,even were the district court interpretation of the prior orders correct,the district court abused its discretion in enjoining the delaware suit in its entirety in lieu of clarifying what could or could not be litigated in that forum.

b.the powers of a district court presiding over an equity receivership 
to begin,we review the powers of a federal district court presiding over an equity receivership such receiverships are increasingly rare.the realm of bankruptcy encompasses the vast majority of cases involving receivership,and in that realm congress has spoken by setting forth broad and detailed statutes to guide federal courts in the disposition of such cases.there remains a class of cases,however,in which the federal courts may exercise their equitable powers and institute receiverships over disputed assets in suits otherwise falling within the federal court jurisdiction,but which fall outside the statutory bankruptcy proceedings or other legislated domain.in this range of cases the federal courts exercise the traditional,common law powers of equity.the current rules specifically reference such equitable practices and incorporate them into today civil proceedings.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure instructs that the practice in the administration of estate by receivers or by other similar officers appointed by the court shall be in accordance with the practice heretofore followed in the courts of the united states or as provided in rules promulgated by the district courts.fed.civ.pro.indeed,we have held in related proceedings to the instant case that a district court has broad powers in fashioning relief in an equity receivership proceeding liberte capital group,llc capwill,cir.
a district court enjoys broad equitable powers to appoint a receiver over assets disputed in litigation before the court.the receiver role,and the district court purpose in the appointment,is to safeguard the disputed assets,administer the property as suitable,and to assist the district court in achieving a final,equitable distribution of the assets if necessary.see moore federal practice ed.as an officer of the court,the receiver powers are coextensive with his order of appointment.id.
once assets are placed in receivership,a district court equitable purpose demands that the court be able to exercise control over claims brought against those assets.the receivership court has a valid interest in both the value of the claims themselves and the costs of defending any suit as a drain on receivership assets.see sec universal,cir.to this extent,the receivership court may issue a blanket injunction,staying litigation against the named receiver and the entities under his control unless leave of that court is first obtained.see barton barbour.it is a general rule that before suit is brought against a receiver leave of the court by which he was appointed must be obtained.this power extends to the institution of any suit,and not just a proceeding for execution of a judgment against the receivership in the receivership court.id.at.we think,therefore,that it is immaterial whether the suit is brought against the receiver to recover specific property or to obtain judgment for a money demand.in either case leave should first be obtained.because the court power of injunction in a receivership proceeding arises from its power over the assets in question,to the underlying litigation may be bound by a blanket stay,so long as the have notice of the injunction.see bien robinson.finding frivolous the contention that a would not be bound by the court injunction against claims against a receivership under the court control see also sec wencke,cir finding the district court equitable powers over the property in receivership sufficient to justify a blanket stay against litigation without leave of the court,even against.intentional interference with a receivership in contravention of a district court blanket stay is punishable by contempt 
no rule is better settled than that when a court has appointed a receiver,his possession is the possession of the court,for the benefit of the parties to the suit and all concerned,and can not be disturbed without the leave of the court and that if any person,without leave,intentionally interferes with such possession,he necessarily commits a contempt of court,and is liable to punishment therefor.
in re tyler.
to the extent that a party has a colorable claim against a receiver or the entities in receivership,due process demands that the claimant be heard,but the district court exercises significant control over the time and manner of such proceedings.see liberte capital group,at see also sec am.capital,cir.the district court may require all such claims to be brought before the receivership court for disposition pursuant to summary process consistent with the equity purpose of the court.see sec,mosburg basic energy affiliated resources,cir.the district court may also authorize,to the extent that the court deems appropriate,satellite litigation in forums outside of the receivership court to address ancillary issues.however,the receivership court typically retains jurisdiction over any attempt at execution of a judgment in such situations.
in addressing claims on the receivership estate brought before it,the district court may consider both the merits of the individual claim and the equities attendant to the situation.see id.the inability of a receivership estate to meet all of its obligations is typically the sine qua non of the receivership.in adjudicating claims on the receivership estate,or in making a decision to permit satellite litigation to resolve any claims,a district court may therefore consider such factors as litigation costs as a tax on the receivership estate,the ability of the parties to resolve their claims in the receivership court versus elsewhere,any culpability on the part of the claimant,and the implications for any satisfaction of an award on other claimants to the estate.see universal,at.
with these principles underling the district court actions in this case,we now turn to the parties arguments on appeal.
c.the scope of the district court prior orders 
the blanket stay 
at the onset of the receivership proceedings for both ves and alpha,the district court entered blanket stays precluding suit against the receiver or assets in the receivership,absent explicit authorization by the receivership court.the injunctions read 
it is further ordered that all creditors,claimants,bodies politic,parties in interest,and all sheriffs,marshals,and other officers,and their respective attorneys,servants,agents,and employees,and all other persons,firms,and corporations be,and they hereby are,jointly and severally,enjoined and stayed from commencing or continuing any action at law or suit or proceeding in equity to foreclose any lien or enforce any claim against ves cfl and alpha capital group,or their property,or against the receiver in any court.said entities are further stayed from executing or issuing or causing the execution or issuance out of any court of any writ,process,summons,attachment,subpoena,replevin,execution,or other process for the purpose of impounding or taking possession of or interfering with,or enforcing any claim or lien upon,any property owned by or in the possession of the said receiver,and from doing any act or thing whatsoever to interfere with the receiver in the discharge of his duties in this proceeding with the exclusive jurisdiction of this court over said properties and said receiver.
at.the stay clearly enjoins all persons from commencing or continuing any action at law or suit or proceeding in equity to enforce any claim against ves cfl and alpha capital group,or their property,or against the receiver in any court.at.
the insurers argue that this universal language is ambiguous with regard to its applicability to the insurers because the injunction does not specifically mention insurance companies,and the injunction does not make it clear that the insurance companies could not bring suit to establish legal rights or claims,which could then only be enforced via application to the receivership court.we find that both arguments are belied by the plain language of the injunction itself.
the stay is clearly written to encompass the broadest possible scope of potential action against the receiver,the entities in receivership,and receivership assets.in fact,the stay contains the any other persons to include any person who happens not to be included by creditors,claimants,bodies politic,parties in interest,and all sheriffs,marshals,and other officers,and their respective attorneys,servants,agents,and employees.the insurers are clearly claimants,parties in interest,and other persons.the insurers argument that the blanket stay does not unambiguously apply to them is disingenuous.
the insurers related argument that the stay does not clearly foreclose actions to establish a legal claim to be subsequently enforced only upon leave of the receivership court similarly lacks merit.the stay is written in the broadest possible terms.the stay precludes suit to enforce any claim against ves cfl and alpha capital group,or their property,or against the receiver in any court.at.a claim is defined simply as a cause of action.black law dictionary ed.to argue that the adjudication of the legal rights of the insurers against the receiver with respect to the disputed policies is not to enforce a claim is unsupportable.
the blanket stay issued by the receivership court was.the insurers admit that they were on notice of this general injunction.any suit brought by the insurers must therefore have been specifically authorized by the litigation exception in the district courts subsequent orders.
the litigation exception 
the parties agree that the district court memoranda and orders issued in response to southwestern life motions to intervene established an exception to the previously issued injunctions.the relevant orders stated 
initially,it should be made clear what this court is not adjudicating at this time it is not adjudicating the respective rights of any investor,the receiver,any purchaser of policies from the receiver,or any insurer regarding any policy,in particular those policies sought to be marketed as to which the government asserts a defense of fraud on the insurance company may be asserted to avoid payment.those issues as to specified policies may be the subject of future litigation in this or other courts of competent jurisdiction.
the issue before this court is the right of the receiver to market and sell policies asserted to have been fraudulently obtained to sophisticated investors who are given appropriate warning of the defenses which may be asserted by the insurers this order does not deprive the insurers of any defenses available against the receiver or any transferee of the receiver.
t he receiver shall be permitted to accept death benefits on any mature policy,providing he has not received a prior notice of rescission or cancellation from any insurance company and that said policy has not been the subject of a prior order of any court of competent jurisdiction declaring such policy to be void due to fraud on the insurer.
at,order,april,emphasis in original.the district court reiterated the above order when the district court denied southwestern life motion to intervene in the alpha receivership case 
turning to the purpose for which intervention is sought,southwestern asserts it is sole
