the petitioner,century insurance company,seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate and set aside an order granting the motion of the real party in interest,linda ahles,to reconsider an earlier order sustaining a demurrer to ahles complaint without leave to amend 
ahles had filed a complaint against century for breach of a contract of insurance,tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing bad faith and fraud.the trial court ruling,which allowed her to go forward with her action and required century to file an answer,was based on the legislature enactment of code of civil procedure,section hereafter,section this new statute,which became effective on january,revives,subject to certain conditions and limitations,insurance claims arising out of the northridge earthquake of that previously had been barred by the applicable statute of limitations.italics added.
the trial court application of section to restore legal vitality to ahles complaint raises a number of important questions which we must address.after a review of this record,the legislative history of section,including the significant public policies it seeks to serve,and the relevant case law,we are persuaded that the new statute does not impermissibly impair century right of contract or deny it substantive due process by the destruction of vested contract rights,embraces and applies to the month contractual limitations period included in century policy as mandated by insurance code section,applies to all cases pending on the date the statute became effective,and extends to ahles tort claim for bad faith,as well as her breach of contract cause of action in view of these conclusions,we will affirm the trial court order of december,and deny century writ petition.
factual and procedural 
on january,ahles was the owner of the residential property at garfield avenue in culver city,california.she had a homeowner insurance policy issued by century policy no.which included,by endorsement,coverage for loss and damage caused by earthquake.the policy covered her home and other structures on the property.on january,a large earthquake,commonly known as the northridge earthquake,struck southern california and caused extensive damage.
on or about may,ahles reported to century that she had observed damage to her property which she believed was attributable to the northridge earthquake.three weeks later,century sent an adjuster to inspect the property and evaluate the damage.in july,century sent an engineer to further inspect the property,including ahles attic and the crawl space underneath her home.based on those inspections,century determined the amount of damage to ahles home was less than the amount of her deductible.it therefore made no payment to her for that damage 
approximately four years later,on august,ahles had her home inspected for termites.according to ahles allegations,the termite inspector observed earthquake damage in the crawl space under her house.on or about september,she filed a supplemental claim for earthquake damage with century.in that claim,ahles asserted that her home had sustained earthquake damage that had neither been discovered nor considered during century adjustment of her original claim.almost one year later,on july,century sent an adjuster to inspect ahles home and to investigate her new claim.the adjuster concluded that the damage claimed by ahles was not caused by the earthquake.on that ground,and because ahles had submitted her supplemental claim more than four years after the earthquake and the adjustment on her initial claim,century denied it.ahles responded to this denial on august,by filing a complaint against century,alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
century then sent engineers to inspect ahles house on october.the engineer report apparently acknowledged that ahles home had sustained considerable damage,but blamed it on causes other than the earthquake.the report,however,also noted that the initial engineer report had been incomplete in that it had failed to identify damage to the foundation and stucco,as well as other problems.
at proceedings held on march,the trial court sustained century demurrer,but granted ahles leave to amend her complaint.she did so,and added as an allegation in her first amended complaint a cause of action for fraud.when century again successfully demurred,ahles was once more granted leave to amend.
after ahles filed her second amended complaint on july,century again demurred.as one ground,century argued that ahles entire action was barred by the statute of limitations contained in the insurance policy.century policy issued to ahles contained a provision stating that n o action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions and the action is started within one year after the occurrence causing the loss or damage.italics added.century contended,pursuant to this clause,that ahles had only one year from denial of her claim to file suit.her entire action was therefore untimely.
in response,ahles asserted that in she was assured by three different century representatives that there had been no structural damage to her home and that if she discovered damage which exceeded her deductible,she could her claim ahles argued she reasonably relied on these representations and,in,when the termite inspector informed her of the damage under her house,ahles believed she could make a claim.ahles further alleged that century claims handling practices were improper,so much so that the department of insurance audit found of the northridge earthquake claims were mishandled.finally,ahles alleged century had been guilty of bad faith and fraud in that it knowingly lowball ed,mishandled and improperly denied hers and numerous other claims pertaining to the northridge earthquake.under these circumstances,she contended,century waived and was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations 
at the hearing held on september,following which the trial court sustained century demurrer to her second amended complaint without leave to amend,ahles asked the court to take judicial notice of sb,a bill which had been passed by the california legislature and was then awaiting the governor signature.the bill had been drafted to add section to the code of civil procedure.see fn,ante.
the trial court,recognizing that the governor had not yet signed the bill,indicated the case was therefore controlled by the one year limitations period in the insurance contract.ahles had timely filed her claim and,although she argued her claim of delayed discovery of further earthquake damage was excusable,the court indicated that it was not persuaded that the delay was justified.the trial court held that ahles complaint was time barred and sustained century demurrer without leave to amend.in concluding the proceedings,however,the trial court stated,and of course,if the governor signs a bill that is enacted into law,that is a ground for reconsideration under of the code of civil procedure.
according to century,it served notice of the trial court ruling sustaining its demurrer without leave to amend and entering a judgment of dismissal on october.ahles,however,asserts century never served her with a signed,copy of the dismissal.the only copies received by ahles were blank.
on november,days after the judgment of dismissal,ahles made an ex parte application for a special setting of a motion for reconsideration of the trial court october,ruling and to vacate that decision.ahles indicated that unknown to counsel and the court,the law sb had been signed into law on september.ahles brought the motion for reconsideration and to vacate judgment based upon the new law.
on december,following a hearing,the trial court granted ahles motion for reconsideration pursuant to the provisions of code of civil procedure,section,subdivision c when century argued that sb would not be in effect until january of,the court stated,i put it over to january,conditionally granting the motion and overruling the demurrer on the statute of limitations ground,unless prior to january,that law is in some way effectively altered by way of amendment,or whatever other statutory or constitutional event may occur to nullify that law.the court set dates for hearings,a status conference and trial.before the end of the hearing,counsel for century stated,a point of clarification,your honor.as i understand,the court ruling is reviving the second amended complaint in total.italics added.the trial court responded,yes.
century response to this ruling was to file the within petition seeking writ relief.it argues both in its petition and in a subsequent brief filed in response to amicus briefing that the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant reconsideration because ahles application was not timely,a judgment had been entered and the time for appeal therefrom had expired.century also contends that the trial court basis for granting relief to ahles was flawed in that sb did not become law until after the trial court had ruled and thus could not serve as a basis for the court ruling,did not apply since ahles claim had already been litigated to finality,is unconstitutional as an impermissible impairment of contract and constitutes destruction of vested contract rights in violation of the due process clause and,in any event,does not apply to tort claims asserted by an insured.
on february,we stayed all further proceedings in the trial court,issued an order to show cause and set the matter on calendar.
discussion 
before turning to the critical questions concerning the proper construction,application and constitutional vitality of section,we must first address century jurisdictional arguments.
the trial court had jurisdiction to consider and rule upon ahles motion to reconsider and to vacate the court order of september,and the judgment of october,
trial court grant of reconsideration after entry of judgment 
century first argues the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant ahles motion for reconsideration because judgment had been entered in the matter on october.century contends that,once a final judgment has been entered,a motion for reconsideration may not be entertained.in making this argument,century relies on the court decision in apri ins.superior court th,d.in apri,the trial court signed an order granting a motion to quash and dismissing apri from the action.it then granted a motion for reconsideration of the ruling on the motion to quash.apri contended this was error and the appellate court agreed.the matter had been dismissed within the meaning of code of civil procedure section once the dismissal was entered,the trial court had no jurisdiction to reconsider the motion to quash.the apri court stated,the trial court failed to observe the critical distinction between an order of dismissal,which is a judgment,and other orders.a court may reconsider its order granting or denying a motion and may even reconsider or alter its judgment so long as judgment has not yet been entered.once judgment has been entered,however,the trial court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the judgment.it may correct judicial error only through certain limited procedures such as motions for new trial and motions to vacate the judgment.citations.id.at,d.here,century has provided a copy of a judgment of dismissal bearing an october,superior court file stamp and the trial judge signature since it appears a final,appealable judgment had been entered,we conclude the trial court could not grant ahles motion for reconsideration.
the trial court,however,could have properly granted a motion for a new trial and,under certain circumstances,a motion to reconsider may be construed as one for a new trial.in passavanti williams d,the appellant argued that his motion for reconsideration should have been construed as a motion for a new trial or to vacate the judgment for purposes of determining when the time to file a notice of appeal had begun to run.the appellate court determined it was compelled to treat the motion for reconsideration as a motion for new trial because two of its prior decisions had indicated such a procedure was appropriate.id.at.the court stated,because of those decisions,we believe that good cause exists and fairness requires us to construe plaintiff motion for reconsideration in this case to be a motion for new trial or a motion to vacate the judgment ibid.although the passavanti court indicated that,absent a showing of extremely good cause,it was disinclined to engage in the practice of construing motions and would hold counsel to the label they attach to their motions,it concluded such good cause had been shown.ibid.
in the present case,ahles designated her motion as one for reconsideration and to vacate the decision of.italics added.however,as century has pointed out,a motion to vacate a judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section does not contemplate merely the setting aside of the judgment,as does a motion for new trial or a motion for relief from default under.it expressly provides for vacating the judgment and entering of another judgment.hence an order of vacation,without directing entry of a new judgment,is void.ramirez moran d,original italics.here,the trial court granted ahles motion,but failed to enter a new judgment.moreover,under the circumstances presented,it would have been inappropriate to do so.
although ahles labeled her motion as one for reconsideration or to vacate the trial court judgment of october,ahles purpose in making the motion was to restore the action to the trial court calendar.in essence,ahles made a motion for a new trial pursuant to code of civil procedure,section.under that section,a verdict may be vacated and any other decision may be modified or vacated,in whole or in part,and a new or further trial granted on all or part of the issues,on the application of the party aggrieved,for any of the following causes,materially affecting the substantial rights of such party.error in law,occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.italics added.here,it is arguable the trial court decision or entry of judgment was based on an incorrect or erroneous understanding of the law the court apparently believed it had the right to reconsider its october ruling granting century demurrer without leave to amend.in addition,the trial court could arguably have relied on the pendency of sb to at least continue the matter until the statute became effective.see,subd.b.
we note that ahles may properly bring a motion for new trial from a judgment of dismissal resulting from the sustaining of a demurrer.carney simmonds cal d,see finnie district coast dist.th,d.further,when treated as a motion for new trial,ahles motion is timely 
although we are,as was the court in passavanti,generally disinclined to construe a motion as other than that which it has been labeled,extremely good cause exists for treating ahles motion as one for a new trial.passavanti williams,supra,d at.at the proceedings held on september,after the trial court determined ahles complaint was time barred,it specifically stated that,should the governor sign sb,that would be a ground for reconsideration under of the code of civil procedure.notions of fairness indicate ahles should be allowed to pursue her claim in view of the trial court attitude and comments regarding the case the trial court invited ahles to make a motion for reconsideration if and when the governor signed sb.this invitation indicates the trial court considered its ruling to be subject to later modification.apri ins.superior court,supra,th at,d nothing in the record indicated the trial court dismissal entered in favor of apri was intended to be without prejudice.
finally,had the trial court neither invited nor granted ahles motion,it is clear from the record before us that ahles would have filed a notice of appeal from the october,judgment.had she done so,we would have had to consider,given the retroactive provisions of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b see fn,ante,the present questions by way of appeal.instead,since the trial court order necessarily precluded the filing of a notice of appeal,we may properly consider the issues raised by way of century petition for a writ.the result of this case,however,will be no different simply because we review the matter on a writ rather than on appeal.
california rules of court,rule a 
century next argues that,if notice of the judgment was served on october,then december was the last day to file a notice of appeal and the last day the trial court had jurisdiction to grant any motion ahles might have brought.w hen a judgment becomes final by lapse of the time for appeal,the court generally has no further jurisdiction of the subject matter mason associates,guarantee sav.loan d.accordingly,century argues,pursuant to california rules of court,rule a,that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion on december.
california rules of court,rule a provides in relevant part except as otherwise provided by code of civil procedure section or other statute or rule,a notice of appeal from a judgment shall be filed on or before the earliest of the following dates days after the date of mailing by the clerk of the court of a document entitled notice of entry of judgment days after the date of service of a document entitled notice of entry of judgment by any party upon the party filing the notice of appeal,or by the party filing the notice of appeal or days after the date of entry of the judgment.italics added.
as we have already noted see fn,ante,century has failed to establish that it served on ahles a copy of the notice of entry of judgment before december,and there is no evidence in the exhibits to indicate the clerk mailed a copy of the notice of entry of judgment.under these circumstances,the trial court had jurisdiction to consider ahles motion up to days after october,
section justified the trial court order 
a.the legislature power to revive barred claims 
we begin our consideration of century attack on section by recognizing a well established principle of law.the legislature is constitutionally free to revive a civil cause of action that has become time barred under a former statute of limitations.campbell holt.a law removing the bar of a statutory limitations defense after it has been perfected is not unconstitutional see also chase securities donaldson.reaffirming campbell holt.
this is also the rule in california.t he legislature has the power to expressly revive civil causes of action.liebig superior court d.liebig rejecting a challenge to code of civil procedure,section,which expressly revived tort claims of victims of sexual molestation see also tietge western province of the servites,th,d tietge w e find no constitutional impediment to the revival of a personal cause of action lent doe th,d lent rejecting the contention that liebig was decided incorrectly and should not be followed.
in people frazer cal th,d,the supreme court signaled its adoption of the reasoning in chase securities donaldson,supra.in a case which rejected a due process challenge to a statute that retroactively extended the criminal statute of limitations for certain sex crimes,the frazer court stated the holding of no constitutionally protected interest arises once a statute of limitations has run,and that such protection can be retroactively withdrawn consistent with due been reaffirmed by the high court in subsequent cases.see plaut spendthrift farm,d noting that statutes of limitation can be extended,without violating the due process clause,after the cause of the action arose and even after the statute itself has expired electrical workers robbins myers,d rejecting the claim that congress was without constitutional power to revive,by enactment,an action which,when filed,is already barred by the running of a limitations period.people frazer,supra,cal th at,d.
given this history,it is clear that the decisions in liebig,tietge and lent represent current california law on this issue.it is also clear that it is the legislature,not the courts,which is the proper forum for resolving the competing policy interests involved in the decision to revive a time barred claim.tietge,supra,th at,d lent,supra,th at,d.
public policy considerations in the enactment of code of civil procedure section 
in the instance of section,the legislature has chosen to extend the limitations period available to insureds to file a lawsuit n otwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,for any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of.italics added.claims as to which the applicable statute of limitations had expired were revived for a period commencing on the effective date of the statute.any action pursuant to this section commenced prior to,or within one year from,the effective date of this section shall not be barred based upon the expired limitations period,subd.b.
this statute is subject to three limitations the insured must have contacted the insurer or its representative about potential northridge earthquake damage prior to january,subd.a the statute will not apply to claims which have been litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction,subd.d and the statute will not apply to any claim which has been resolved by a written settlement agreement,provided the insured was represented by an attorney admitted to practice in california at the time of the settlement and said attorney signed the agreement,subd.d,italics added.
public policy considerations 
it is important to our later discussion of the constitutional issues raised by century to recognize and appreciate the serious public policy considerations that were involved in the enactment of section.whenever a state determines,in good faith,that a practice of an industry is injurious to the public,the state may control the practice even where the legislation directly affects the internal affairs of a business or industry,as long as the legislation is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.cal.state auto.bureau downey d.the business of insurance is clothed with a public interest,and therefore subject to be controlled by the public for the common good.german alliance ins.lewis.especially in california,the insurance industry is a highly regulated industry.calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d.
the field of insurance so greatly affects the public interest that the industry is viewed as a business,in which the special relationship between the insurers and insureds requires special considerations.the insurers obligations are rooted in their status as purveyors of a vital service labeled in nature.suppliers of services affected with a public interest must take the public interest seriously,where necessary placing it before their interest in maximizing gains and limiting disbursements a s a supplier of a public service rather than a manufactured product,the obligations of insurers go beyond meeting reasonable expectations of coverage.the obligations of good faith and fair dealing encompass qualities of decency and humanity inherent in the responsibilities of a fiduciary.insurers hold themselves out as fiduciaries,and with the public trust must go private responsibility consonant with that trust.egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d,italics added.
the egan court recognized that the unequal relationship between the insured and insurers demanded special remedies for breach of that public trust,such as tort remedies for the failure to perform obligations promised in a policy and punitive damages.the court explained t he relationship of insurer and insured is inherently unbalanced the adhesive nature of insurance contracts places the insurer in a superior bargaining position.the availability of punitive damages is thus compatible with recognition of insurers underlying public obligations and reflects an attempt to restore balance in the contractual relationship.id.at.
the significant public interest in the special relationship between the insured and insurer justifies the availability of tort remedies,and distinguishes insurance contracts from other types of contracts.tort remedies remain unavailable in contract cases.see,cates construction,talbot partners cal th,d,availability of tort remedies for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing not extended to contracts since the insurance policy cases represent a major departure from traditional principles of contract law foley interactive data cal d,tort remedies not permitted for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment contract cases.
similarly,the public interest in protecting vulnerable insureds mandates that insurance contract interpretation,like insurance contract remedies,not be limited by the usual contract rules the rights and obligations of the insurer can not be determined solely on the basis of rules pertaining to private contracts negotiated by individual parties of relatively equal bargaining strength.barrera state farm mut.automobile ins.cal d.rather,statutes pertaining to,and contractual provisions contained within,insurance policies must be construed in light of applicable public policy,promoting the protection of the insured and the public at large.id.at.so too,statutes which affect existing insurance contracts,enacted to promote the public interest,are invariably upheld as a reasonable exercise of the state police power.see,carpenter pacific mut.life ins.cal d,hinckley bechtel d.it is clear that the state significant public policy concerns for the less powerful insureds,which bolster its power to regulate this business of insurance,also prompted the enactment of section.
legislative history of section 
as the legislative history of section underscores,the legislature enacted section to promote an important public policy to bring needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake.assem.judiciary com.analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.the committee found compelling reports of rampant mishandling of insurance claims by insurers,and the unavailability of relief from the former administration of the department of insurance proponents contend that there are strong public policy reasons to protect quake victims under the circumstances of this bill.they state that thousands of people who suffered damage to their homes did not receive the benefit of their insurance contracts because of the insurance companies conduct.they further assert that ample evidence exists to show that insurers handling northridge earthquake claims engaged in a systematic program of misleading consumers about the nature and extent of damage to their homes.later,when it became clear that the problems were indeed significant,proponents assert that the insurers simply refused to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become.id.at.to compound problems,proponents note that when homeowners complained to the department of insurance to obtain relief,the department afforded no help.thus,based on the circumstances surrounding the northridge earthquake,proponents argue that there are sufficient public policy reasons to extend the statute of limitations and allow the homeowners to seek justice on their insurance claims.bill,reading may,rules comm.reg.sess.the legislature also considered the opposition of the insurers,including arguments that the reopening of claims that an insurer had legally denied from northridge claimants through the introduction of retroactive legislation raises serious constitutional questions rules,off.of floor analysis,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,but after extensive analysis,determined these objections were without merit 
code of civil procedure section is constitutional 
there is no impermissible impairment of contract 
century asserts section violates the contract clauses of both the united states and california constitutions in that it abrogates the contractual litigation deadline for northridge earthquake victims prescribed in every california insurance policy and purports to invalidate the finality of certain agreements for settlement and release of northridge earthquake claims 
both the united states and california constitutions contain clauses prohibiting the legislature from passing laws which impair the obligations in contracts.see,art.i,cl.cal,art.i.although the language of both contracts clauses is facially absolute,it has been determined that their prohibition s must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the state to safeguard the vital interests of its people.energy reserves group kansas power light,d energy reserves.thus,impairment of an existing contract is not necessarily unconstitutional.the states must possess broad power to adopt general regulatory measures without being concerned that private contracts will be impaired,or even destroyed,as a result.united states trust new jersey,d.
in energy reserves,supra,the court indicated that in determining whether legislation violates the contracts clause,three factors must be considered whether the state law has,in fact,operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship,if the state law constitutes a substantial impairment of contract rights,does it nevertheless have a significant and legitimate public purpose such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem and if such a legitimate purpose is established,is the adjustment of the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties based upon reasonable conditions and of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the legislation adoption.id.at.the energy reserves court recognized that a s is customary in reviewing economic and social regulation,courts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.id.at.
in determining whether legislation amounts to a substantial impairment,one factor to be considered is whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been regulated in the past.energy reserves,supra,at.whether the state actively regulates the industry at issue frames the parties reasonable expectations and minimizes any potential statutory impairment id.at.in california,the insurance business is a highly regulated industry,and one in which further regulation can reasonably be anticipated.calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d,see fn,ante.the calfarm court noted that by at least,insurers were well aware of the possibility that initiatives or ordinary legislation might be enacted that would affect existing policies.id.at.
in light of its past extensive exercise of legislative power over the insurance industry to help victimized insureds,insurers should reasonably have expected the california legislature to enact legislation designed to help insureds affected by the northridge earthquake.the court in wolfe state farm fire casualty ins.th,d,acknowledged as much when it dismissed an individual injunctive relief action against insurers based on their refusal to sell any new homeowners policies in order to avoid providing earthquake coverage,deferring to the legislature expressed intent to deal with problems arising from the earthquake both now and in the future.id.at,d.the legislature enactment of section to correct insurers wrongful processing of northridge earthquake claims should have been reasonably expected,rendering the insurers policies susceptible to alteration.
the revival of barred claims for one year fails to rise to the level of an impairment of a contract,because it merely affects the remedy for the violation of the contract,not the obligations contained within it.see home blaisdell.lincoln superior court cal d.this is also true of section.it simply affects a remedy it does not create or destroy any substantive rights as the united states supreme court opined in campbell holt,supra,at,the defense of the limitations bar is not a vested right,and a statute which revived a contractual right to payment which had already lapsed did not violate the contract clause.
similarly,application of section to settlement agreements entered into without california counsel does not substantially impair such contracts.the statute on its face does not declare the agreements null or void it simply revives barred claims so that they can be further addressed.indeed,the statute reference to settlement agreements serves only to describe one of the circumstances where section will not apply.the ultimate viability of those settlement agreements is not impaired.moreover,even if section could be said to substantially impair existing insurance contracts and settlement agreements,it may constitutionally do so to address a legitimate public purpose appropriately adjusted to the rights and responsibilities of the affected parties.energy reserves,supra,d.
for example,former civil code section repealed effective january,indisputably,yet legitimately,impaired final community property settlement agreements,judgments or decrees,to include a division of military retirement benefits.in in re marriage of potter d,the court rejected due process and contract clause challenges to application of section to a final judgment previously stipulated to by the parties in light of t he paramount interest of this state in the equitable distribution of marital property upon dissolution of marriage.id.at.
in in re marriage of bouquet cal d,the supreme court retroactively applied amended former civil code section to an existing interlocutory judgment that section changed the husband earnings and accumulations while living apart from community property to separate property.acknowledging the statute,as amended,impaired the wife vested property rights,acquired prior to the date of the amendment,the supreme court nonetheless concluded that this use of the police power to abrogate rights in marital property that derived from the patently unfair former law justified the impairment.id.at.
legitimate state interest also may change contract provisions.for example,the energy reserves court upheld a kansas act,which regulated prices in already existing contracts,as a reasonable exercise of its police power to protect consumers from the escalation of natural gas prices caused by deregulation,observing that higher gas prices have caused and will cause hardship among those who use gas heat but must exist on limited fixed incomes.energy reserves,supra,at.in california,the supreme court in calfarm upheld provisions of proposition,which altered the terms of existing insurance policies so as only to allow cancellation of those contracts on certain,specified conditions,in order to continue to make insurance available to californians and avoid a potential crisis.calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
the legislature enacted section to alleviate a broad and significant problem caused by the insurers conduct to help thousands of policyholders who were misled by the insurers into waiving their right to make claims in a timely manner.this purpose is backed by the power of the legislature to protect california citizens and provide for their general welfare and justifies any potential impairment of contract provisions.see home blaisdell,supra,at.statute extending time for redemption from mortgage foreclosure sales was held to constitute a legitimate and substantial legislative purpose.
finally,the revival of the statutory remedy is appropriately limited in time and application.section is only operative for the period of one year,and is limited to claims where the insurers had already been contacted prior to january,to claims not finally litigated,and to claims not settled through a california attorney.special deference is granted to temporary statutes.see home blaisdell,supra,at.when viewed with the proper legislative deference,this legislation does not impermissibly impair century contract rights.
no vested contract rights are destroyed in violation of the due process clause 
according to century,the retroactive application of section,subdivision b,destroys its vested contractual right to repose following expiration of the contractual limitations period.this argument,however,ignores what appears to be settled law.the contractual limitations period in century policy is mandated by statute.it is therefore properly treated as a statute of limitations which does not,upon its expiration,endow in the defendant a vested right.insurance code section mandated provisions are treated identically to statutes of limitations.see california union ins.poppy ridge partners d.in california union,the insurer failed to plead the limitations period as an affirmative defense and argued that it was sufficient to claim that the insured had failed to satisfy the provisions of the contract.the court disagreed,explaining the insurer had advanced no substantive,convincing reason for distinguishing the contractual limitations period from a statutory limitations period which is a personal privilege affecting the remedy only and waivable in advance,by contract,or by failure to plead it for some purposes contractual and statutory limitations periods have been treated similarly.citation.the court conclude d the contractual limitations period should be treated the same as a statutory one,as an affirmative defense that must be pled as such or is waived.california union ins,supra,at,see also lawrence western mutual ins.d.the section contractual limitations period should function no differently than a legislatively enacted statute of limitations.
the running of a statute of limitations does not grant a defendant a vested right of repose.see nelson flintkote d.the nelson court held a personal injury action could not be automatically extinguished by the mere passage of time,but rather that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded by a defendant and ruled on by a court.id.at.in gallo superior court d,the court stated,a potential defendant has no vested right in the sense of repose conferred by his knowledge a lawsuit against him appears to be barred.id.at.in other words,because the limitations period operates as an affirmative defense which is inoperative until certain conditions are met,it is properly plead and accepted by a court it can not be deemed a vested right.see in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d,fn,we use the word vested here to describe property rights that are not subject to a condition precedent.
second,even if the running of the limitations period created a vested right in defendant,such a right yields to important state interests,without any violation of due process.in addison addison cal d,the court indicated that vested rights,of course,may be impaired with due process of law under many circumstances.the state inherent sovereign power includes the so called police power right to interfere with vested property rights whenever reasonably necessary to the protection of the health,safety,morals,and general well being of the people.the annals of constitutional law are replete with decisions approving,as constitutionally proper,the impairing of,and even the complete confiscation of,property rights when compelling public interest justified it the constitutional question,on principle,therefore,would seem to be,not whether a vested right is impaired by a marital property law change,but whether such a change reasonably could be believed to be sufficiently necessary to the public welfare as to justify the impairment.italics added.the addison court easily permitted impairment of vested property rights by the retroactive application of legislation where it was justified by overriding societal concerns.in in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d,the court also upheld the impairment of a spouse vested property rights by a community property statute retroactively applied due to the legislature intent to correct rank injustice of former law.
similarly,in battle kessler d,the court permitted an amended statute to apply retroactively to previously barred claims,for the period of one year,because the legislature acted to right a wrong.see also lent doe,supra,th,d applied code of civil procedure section to previously barred claims.liebig superior court,supra,d at.applied newly enacted section,which extended the statute of limitations for child molestation cases to previously barred causes of action,because the law is clear that vested rights are not immune from retroactive laws when an important state interest is at stake nelson flintkote,supra,d at.
in enacting section,the legislature took action to advance the public interest in protecting insureds mistreated by their insurers at a time when the insureds were most vulnerable.section protection of insureds reflects legislative and judicial policy,and is buttressed by the legislature unique power to regulate the business of insurance.such legislative action is propelled by an important state interest and is constitutional.
d.the term statute of limitations as used in section,embraces the contractual limitations period included in century policy 
an examination of insurance code section reflects that the legislature,in statutorily dictating policy terms,has effectively changed the year limitations period which would otherwise apply to a suit on an insurance contract code civ,subd.because this statutory dictate results in a contractual provision,it is not incorrect to refer to it as the articulation of a contractual limitations period.accordingly,century argues that,because section refers only to the applicable statute of limitations,it does not apply to the statutorily mandated contractual limitations period included in its policy.
in the context of applying section,however,this is a thin semantical reed on which to hang the conclusion that the phrase used in that section,applicable statute of limitations italics added does not also include the statutorily mandated contractual limitations period.to the contrary,it seems clear to us that the legislature intended the phrase applicable statute of limitations to embrace the mandated contractual period.indeed,that is the only limitations period applicable to the claims asserted by policyholders to which the statute is addressed.since the obvious legislative purpose behind the enactment of section was to bring relief to policyholders with claims under policies,all of which contain the contractual limitations provision,it would be absurd for us to adopt century construction of this phrase.
while it is not the prerogative of the judiciary to rewrite legislation to conform to a presumed intent citation the california supreme court reminds us that the primary purpose of statutory construction is for the courts to determine and effectuate the purpose of the law as enacted the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in order to determine this intent,we begin by examining the language of the statute.citations.but i t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.citations.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citation.finally,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.citation.mclaughlin state bd.of education th,d original italics,citing california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d,people pieters cal d.e ach sentence phrase and word must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.lungren deukmejian cal d.
in mclaughlin state bd.of education,supra,the court was called upon to interpret proposition,the english language in public schools initiative statute.id.at,d.the initiative enacted a statutory scheme which required california public schools to teach children with limited english proficiency only in english.the mclaughlin court was asked to determine,in view of the fact that proposition was silent on the matter,whether the initiative was subject to a provision in education code section,which generally allows schools to apply for waivers from such program requirements.
after thoroughly reviewing the history of both proposition and education code section,the court concluded that the respondent school boards could not,under section,apply for waivers from the requirements of the statutory scheme enacted by proposition.mclaughlin state bd.of education,supra,th at,d.the court determined that t o the extent there was any ambiguity as to the intent of proposition,the legislative history clarifie d that the chapter was designed to wrest from school boards and administrators decisionmaking authority for selecting between limited english proficiency educational options,and repose this power exclusively in parents of limited english proficiency students.ibid.
in the present case,our review of the legislative history makes it clear that the legislature intended the phrase applicable statute of limitations to embrace the mandated contractual period.during the legislative process,sb was amended to provide,notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,clearly,the legislature sought to revive the time bar created by the limitations period contained in policies providing insurance coverage for the northridge earthquake.given the obvious and universally appreciated fact that every claimant to be benefited by section has a limitations period in his or her insurance policy,and it was the bar created by that clause upon which insurers had relied in denying claims that the legislature sought to address,it would be folly to conclude that the legislature intended to make a distinction between statutory and contractual limitations periods when it enacted section.in this context,the use of the term,applicable statute of limitations was simply a generic reference to the limitations period that the legislature intended to reach by its enactment of section.such generic use of the term was no different than the lawyer shorthand utilized by century itself when it demurred to ahles pleadings on the ground that the statute of limitations contained in the insurance policy had expired 
any other interpretation would not only fail to conform to the spirit of section,but would lead to an absurd result.the legislative history of section indicates the statute was enacted to bring needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake.assem.judiciary com.analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.since all the victims policies contain the contractual limitations period,to interpret section as not applying to that limitations period would,in effect,completely nullify the statute.accordingly,we conclude the legislature failure to refer to a contractual limitations period can only be attributed to drafters oversight.mclaughlin state bd.of education,supra,th at,d.
our conclusion is bolstered by the court decision in california union ins.poppy ridge partners,supra,d.there,the court determined that,to rely on the expiration of a contractual limitations period as a defense,the defendant was required to raise it in his or her answer,just as he or she would be required to raise a statutory limitations period.the court noted that the defendant had advanced no substantive,convincing reason for distinguishing the contractual limitations period from a statutory limitations period id.at.just like a statutory limitations period,the contractual limitations period mandated by insurance code section could be waivable in advance by contract or a failure to plead it.ibid.the court recognized that,f or some purposes contractual and statutory limitations periods have been treated similarly.ibid.
the construction and application of section renders it a statute which necessitates the statutorily required contractual limitation to be equated with a statutory limitation.for purposes of a proper reading of section,they are the same and should be so construed.
ahles claim was not litigated to finality 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision d provides that revival of the limitations period does not apply to claims which have been litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to january.italics added.in california,however,a n action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal,or until the time for appeal has passed code civ.thus,a judgment in california is not final for all purposes until all possibility of direct attack thereon by way of appeal,motion for a new trial,or motion to vacate the judgment has been exhausted.southern public utility dist.silva cal d,witkin,cal.procedure ed,judgment,see also,mckee national union fire ins.th,d.in mckee,the court interpreted insurance code section,subdivision b,which requires that every insurance policy contain a provision providing that an action may be brought on the policy after final judgment against the insured has been entered.the court interpreted section,subdivision b,as meaning that the statute and standard policy language permit an action against an insurer only when the underlying judgment is final and final,for this purpose,means an appeal from the underlying judgment has been concluded or the time within which to appeal has passed.mckee national union fire ins,supra,th at,d.thus,in this sense,the courts speak of finality for res judicata purposes.id.at,d.
by not using the ambiguous term,final judgment,but rather limiting the exception to cases which have been litigated to finality,the legislature has in our view,made it clear that it intends section to apply to all cases which have not been finally decided on appeal.thus,the legislature has emphasized its intention that finality in the res judicata sense is required before section,subdivision d exception will apply.indeed,by not using the word judgment in section,subdivision d,the legislature avoided any suggestion that a final for notice of appeal purposes trial court judgment might make section inapplicable.thus,the settled rule in california that a judgment is not final so long as an appeal is pending therefrom applies here mckee national union fire ins,supra,th at,d,quoting jennings ward,and section,subdivision d,does not bar the revived statute of limitations available under section from applying to this action 
we therefore reject century argument that the statute reference to claims litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction would apply to the trial court earlier order sustaining century demurrer without leave to amend.while the superior court certainly is a court of competent jurisdiction,for the reasons discussed above,we can not construe the statutory language so narrowly.litigated finality must be read to mean a final judgment in the res judicata sense.
f.the revival of section extends to ahles bad faith tort claim but not to her fraud claim 
section revives any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake which is barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has expired.thus,the express language of the statute applies not only to contract damage claims,but also to tort claims for insurer bad faith,a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.to determine the intent of statutory language t he court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.penney casualty ins.cal d.a claim based on an insurer breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implied in every policy of insurance is clearly within the plain meaning of the phrase any insurance claim arising out of,subd.a,italics added.
moreover,the plain reading of the statute words comports with the legislative intent in enacting this law.the legislative history reveals allegations of widespread abuse by insurers who may have committed numerous acts of bad faith by denying the legitimate claims of potentially thousands of northridge earthquake victims.assem.judiciary com.analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.the companies repeatedly claims,failed to inform policyholders of their benefits and forced many claimants to sue to get full payment.id.at.according to the author,sb seeks to provide these individuals,who were victimized twice once by the earthquake and a second time by their insurance companies with a reasonable second chance to seek redress for their damages.ibid.inclusion of tort claims in section furthers the legislative purpose that victims obtain damages for their insurers misconduct.the availability of tort remedies in the limited context of an insurer breach of the covenant advances the social policy of safeguarding an insured in an inferior bargaining position who contracts for calamity protection,not commercial advantage.kransco american empire surplus lines ins.cal th,d,italics omitted.
finally,the legislature contemplated that the new law would revive claims barred by the insurance policies limitations provision,the minimum limitations period set by insurance code section case law has likewise applied that same limitations provision to claims for insurers breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.see,jang state farm fire casualty th,d holding that r egardless of whether the insured elects to file a complaint alleging solely tort claims an action seeking damages recoverable under the policy for a risk insured under the policy is merely a transparent attempt to recover on the policy original italics velasquez truck ins.exchange th,d opining that a bad faith action based on denial of a claim in the underlying policy is an action on the policy prieto state farm fire casualty d.court found neither reason nor authority to signify that a plaintiff election to seek redress under the implied covenant rather than the express contract should nullify the legislatively prescribed limitation for actions that are on the policy because grounded in a failure to pay benefits that are due under the policy and indeed constitute its very reason for being see also abari state farm fire casualty d.lawrence western mutual ins,supra,d at.
with respect to ahles fraud claim,however,we reach the opposite conclusion.while we are persuaded that bad faith claims that are seeking damages recoverable under the policy,such as those presented in jang,velasquez,prieto,abari and lawrence,have the same limitations period applicable to claims for breach of contract,and constitute insurance claims,the rationale which justifies that conclusion has no application to ahles fraud claim.her action for fraud does not rest on century failure to perform under the policy,but rather on its alleged acts of deceit and deception that go well beyond simple nonperformance.that the purpose of such alleged fraudulent behavior may have been to evade performance under the policy does not alter the conclusion that an entirely separate act of misconduct has been alleged.in addition,ahles does not seek damages recoverable under the policy,but rather damages arising from century alleged misrepresentations and ahles reliance,including such things as out of pocket premium expense,lost opportunity damages and recovery for resulting emotional distress.for these reasons,we do not perceive ahles fraud claim as an insurance claim for damages as that term is used in section.therefore,ahles fraud claim remains subject to the limitation period set out in code of civil procedure section,and her claim,if expired under that statute,will not be revived by section.

the order to show cause heretofore issued is discharged.the trial court order of december,is affirmed and the peremptory writ is denied.the stay order heretofore issued shall be vacated as of the date of the filing of a remittitur herein.ahles shall recover her costs in these writ proceedings.
following the trial court order sustaining the demurrer,a judgment of dismissal was signed and filed on october.as we explain below,we elect to treat ahles motion to reconsider the order sustaining the demurrer as a motion for a new trial.
code of civil procedure,section provides a notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of the effective date of this section.this subdivision shall only apply to cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurer representative prior to january,regarding potential northridge earthquake damage.b any action pursuant to this section commenced prior to,or within one year from,the effective date of this section shall not be barred based upon this limitations period.c nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the applicable limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of the effective date of this section.d this section shall not apply to either of the following any claim that has been litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to the effective date of this section.any written compromised settlement agreement which has been made between an insurer its insured where the insured was represented by counsel admitted to the practice of law in california at the time of the settlement,and who signed the agreement.
as we explain below,it does not extend to ahles fraud cause of action.
as century challenge to ahles complaint was by demurrer,the facts we recite are taken from her second amended complaint,which we necessarily must accept as true.morillion royal packing cal th,d.her second amended complaint is the operative pleading before us.the procedural matters reflected in the appellate record are not in dispute.
the deductible which pertained to the other structures on her property,however,was a lesser amount and,since the damage to those structures exceeded that amount,century did pay ahles under the policy.
on august,approximately three months after ahles filed her claim,century sent her a letter explaining that the damage to her home did not exceed her deductible and therefore nothing was due on that part of her claim.the letter,however,also stated if you discover that your damages exceed the relevant deductible s,please advise us and we will reconsider your claim.the letter did not contain or suggest an expiration addition,ahles alleges that,century also made general announcements which encouraged insureds to not deluge them with claims.on or about the end of january,defendant century widely disseminated a letter to its insureds and the general populace regarding common questions asked concerning earthquake coverage.this letter indicated that if damage to an insured property appeared cosmetic only but was later discovered to be more severe that century should be called only at that time.the letter further indicated that anytime additional damage was discovered that century should be contacted and the claim would be reopened to see if a supplemental damage payment was warranted.the letter further indicated that century would pay for inspections to make certain the property was safe to live in.finally,concerning formalizing a claim the letter indicated that century would let its insureds know anything that was needed,but they wanted to keep the process as simple as possible.the record,however,does not contain a copy of this letter.
these allegations raise another issue which we do not have to reach in light of our focus on the impact of code of civil procedure section where an insured presents a timely claim to his insurer for property damage under a policy,and the insurer agent inspects the property but does not discover the full extent of covered damage,does california insurance code and its one year limitations period used in all relevant insurance contracts,including century,bar a claim brought by the insured more than one year after the damage was sustained but within one year of his or her discovery of the additional damage vu prudential property casualty ins.cir,certifying this issue to the california supreme court such certification was accepted and the issue is now pending before that court no.
the following day,september,the governor signed sb into law.it became effective on january.
in its petition,century acknowledges that it is possible that what was served was only the proposed judgment before it was signed and filed.in view of that concession,and in view of the trial court implied finding by virtue of its subsequent ruling that such service had not been made,we conclude that century did not serve a completed copy of the judgment of dismissal dated october,until december.in its petition,century states that it served on ahles a signed and copy of the october,judgment of dismissal of ahles second amended complaint on december.the exhibit provided by century includes a notice of entry of judgment of dismissal bearing a january,superior court file stamp.in its petition,century indicates the copy of the dismissal was provided as a precaution in the event a copy of the judgment had not earlier been served.
code of civil procedure,section,subdivision c,provides if a court at any time determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered,it may do so on its own motion and enter a different order.
code of civil procedure section provides a written dismissal of an action shall be entered in the clerk register and is effective for all purposes when so entered.all dismissals ordered by the court shall be in the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action and those orders when so filed shall constitute judgments and be effective for all purposes,and the clerk shall note those judgments in the register of actions in the case.
century has not provided a copy of the civil register report for the case indicating the judgment of dismissal was entered.
code of civil procedure,section provides in relevant part the party intending to move for a new trial must file with the clerk and serve upon each adverse party a notice of his intention to move for a new trial,designating the grounds upon which the motion will be made and whether the same will be made upon affidavits or the minutes of the court or both,either.before the entry of judgment or.within days of the date of mailing notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of the court,or service upon him by any party of written notice of entry of judgment,or within days after the entry of judgment said notice of intention to move for a new trial shall be deemed to be a motion for a new trial on all the grounds stated in the notice.here,there is no evidence notice of entry of the judgement was given by the court clerk,and century has failed to show it served on ahles a file stamped copy of the october,judgment prior to december.accordingly,ahles motion or notice of motion,filed on november,was well within the day time limit.
century final procedural argument,based on the contention that ahles motion for consideration was not timely under code of civil procedure,section,subdivision a,is moot in light of our determination to treat her motion as one for a new trial.
in chase,the supreme court rejected a constitutional challenge to an amendment to the minnesota blue sky laws that operated to abolish the defendant statute of limitations defense in pending litigation.justice jackson,writing for a unanimous court,acknowledged that when the litigation against it was commenced,the defendant had a legitimate expectation that it could defend the claim by invoking the relevant statute of limitations,and that this expectation had been disappointed by the change in the law.this disappointment,however,did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation because w hatever grievance appellant may have at the change of policy to its disadvantage,it had acquired no immunity from this suit that has become a federal constitutional right.chase securities donaldson,supra,at.
the supreme court denied review of liebig,tietge and lent.
this may be,at least in part,the reason for the supreme court rejection,on november,of a petition filed by an insurance industry coalition to enjoin the operation of section and its effective date of january.the court was apparently not persuaded by the argument that the revival of claims of an insured who had actually settled with an insurer prior to january,but where the settlement agreement had not been signed by the insured counsel see code civ,subd.d,would impermissibly reopen settled matters.
