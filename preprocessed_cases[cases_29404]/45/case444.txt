opinion of the court 
factual and procedural background 
a disability policy and a business overhead expense policy issued by appellee minnesota life insurance company covered appellant kevin witasick those policies were later acquired and administered by appellee standard insurance company.witasick made claims against both policies,which were honored by the appellees.a dispute arose,however,concerning the coverage of some of witasick claimed business expenses.after years of discussion and negotiation,the parties ultimately settled their dispute.standard agreed to pay more than million in consideration to witasick and witasick agreed to release all claims known,unknown,and any future claims against the appellee insurance companies.the settlement also contained a covenant not to sue,whereby witasick agreed not to pursue any cause of action against standard and minnesota life stemming from any conduct prior to the date the parties sign this document,or which is related to,or arises out of the insurance policies.at.
while these settlement negotiations were taking place,the united states government notified witasick that he was the target of a federal grand jury investigation related to certain fraud charges and business expense claims on his federal income tax returns.witasick was indicted in october of.to support its charge of mail fraud,the government relied on information and documents witasick had submitted to appellee standard.an employee of standard testified before the grand jury and then again at witasick trial.witasick was found guilty of most of the charges,the exception being his acquittal on the mail fraud charge he was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment.
in november of,witasick filed a complaint against the appellee insurance companies.the complaint contained more than twenty claims based on the former policies or on standard cooperation with the government prosecution.the appellees asked the district court to dismiss the complaint,arguing that witasick claims were prohibited by the settlement agreement.the district court agreed and dismissed the complaint.witasick filed a motion for reconsideration which was likewise denied.witasick appeals.we will affirm.
appellate jurisdiction 
whether we have appellate jurisdiction is the threshold issue in this case.a notice of appeal must be filed within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.fed.a a.this time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional.bowles russell,internal quotation marks omitted.if an order granting a motion to dismiss is not set out in a separate document,then judgment is not deemed entered until days have run from the entry in the civil docket.a,c b.a n order is treated as a separate document if it satisfies three criteria it must be and separate from the opinion,it must note the relief granted,and it must omit or at least substantially omit the trial court reasons for disposing of the claims.leboon lancaster jewish cmty.cntr.ass,cir citing local union,ibew okonite,cir in re cendant.securities litigation,cir.
here,the district court memorandum opinion granting the motion to dismiss was entered on march.because witasick did not file his notice of appeal until september,considerably more than days after the entry of the memorandum opinion appellees contend that the notice was filed too late and that we should dismiss the appeal.see,bowles,supra.timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.we disagree.
the march,memorandum opinion resolved all claims and detailed the district court reasons for granting the motion to dismiss.however,it did not set out the judgment of dismissal in a separate document.instead,page of the memorandum under a heading of conclusion states that a ccordingly and incorporating the discussion held during oral argument on the motion,it is ordered this day of march,that defendant motion to dismiss the complaint is hereby granted.at.an electronic signature s for judge joseph rodriguez was appended to the memorandum.at.the problem,however,is that this order is not and it includes the district court reasoning.therefore,it can not be considered a separate document.see in re cendant,at.the district court itself seemed to realize that it never entered a separate document when it dismissed the appellant complaint.in july of,witasick filed a motion asking the district court to enter a judgment pursuant to rule a,presumably so he could appeal.appellees filed a memorandum in opposition and the district court denied the motion as moot in january of in its order denying the motion,the district court specifically noted that b ecause no separate document was entered to reflect the march,decision,judgment was deemed entered after days pursuant to.c.at.accordingly,judgment was not entered until august,days after march.
there is a second questionably relevant document to the issue of appellate jurisdiction a docket entry also dated march,stating civil case terminated.at.appellees point to this entry as a separate document,arguing that it notes the relief granted,and that such electronic entries can satisfy the separate judgment requirement of rule.this entry,without a doubt,relates nothing of the district court reasoning.see in re cendant,at.however,it can not be considered a separate document because the phrase civil case terminated tells us nothing of the relief granted.it is a mere clerical notation by court personnel that the case is over,without saying why.of course,a case can be terminated for any number of reasons,such as a failure to prosecute,a failure to pay certain fees,a grant of summary judgment,a jury verdict,and so on.this entry is also used to administratively close a case during an interlocutory appeal or during a stay to allow a party to exhaust remedies,for example.a case can also be terminated while a district court seeks counsel for a pro se litigant.here,the notation civil case terminated is simply too vague to satisfy the second criteria of in re cendant and a docket entry containing such a notation can not be considered a separate document of judgment.
we agree,however,with the appellees larger point electronic entries made by a district court via the federal can,in certain circumstances,satisfy rule requirement.this is hardly controversial.the district of new jersey,as well as every other federal court,provides for electronic entries and gives them the force and effect of a court order.however,a holding that every electronic docket entry satisfies rule requirements paints with too broad a brush.
the federal system allows for three distinct types of entries text orders,utility events,and minute entries.a text order,as its name suggests,is an order of the court,with specific text granting,denying,or otherwise resolving a motion or,ultimately,a case.see,united states wecht,cir.text orders can also be used to set a hearing,order briefing,and direct service.such orders may be used to rule on substantive motions,like those seeking summary judgment,or those asking for a complaint to be dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b.see,gannon int l,blocker,cir.text orders additionally may be used to resolve other issues that arise during litigation,like motions to suppress evidence,relatively routine motions as determined by the district judge or clerk of court.indeed,the user manual for the district of new jersey specifically acknowledges the use of such orders the assigned judge or the clerk office,if appropriate,may grant routine orders by docket entry for which a notice of electronic filing will be generated.in such cases,no pdf document will be issued and the text order shall constitute the court only order on the matter.ecf user manual at page.text orders usually have no difficulty satisfying the separate document requirement of rule a and in re cendant,supra.they are separate and from any actual opinion they note the relief granted and they omit or substantially omit the district court reasoning.and,significantly,they contain an electronic signature of a judge.
the two other types of electronic docket entries are vastly different from text orders.indeed,they are not orders at all.
