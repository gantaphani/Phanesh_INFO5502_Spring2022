this case involves a property insurance policy that withdraws coverage for specified perils while the insured premises are vacant.the pertinent exclusion contains an exception stating that buildings under construction are not considered vacant.the question before us concerns whether the work being performed on the building at the time of the loss rendered the building under construction such that the vacancy exclusion does not apply.
plaintiffs argue their efforts meant that the structure was under construction and therefore covered under the policy when a water heater or waterline ruptured and caused substantial damage to the property.defendant insurer disagrees with this interpretation of the policy.the court of appeal affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurer,determining that the word construction,as utilized in the policy,envisions the building of a new structure,which did not occur here.
we reverse the court of appeal.as used in the insurance policy here,the word construction can not reasonably be understood to be limited only to the erection of a new structure.rather,the term contemplates all building endeavors,whether classified as new construction,renovations,or additions,which require the substantial and continuing presence of workers at the premises.this standard serves the purposes underlying the vacancy exclusion,which is premised upon the recognition that unoccupied properties face an increased risk of damage,whether from crime such as theft or vandalism or from building damage or loss related to neglect.if,however,a construction project results in the continuous and substantial presence of workers on the property,then the underlying justifications for the vacancy exclusion no longer exist,a point recognized by the inclusion of an under construction exception to the general vacancy exclusion.
given the parties here were unaware of this standard when litigating defendant summary judgment motion,they failed to elicit key facts that might have bearing on the issue of whether there was a substantial and continuing presence of workers at the building in the period prior to the claimed loss here.since these facts are not present in the current record,we do not decide whether the activity here satisfies the standard we announce today.rather,we remand the matter to permit either party to bring a new summary judgment motion based upon the proper standard.
factual and procedural background 
in june,plaintiffs trb investments,fran mar,coldwater farms,p r almond orchards,and chester group procured a property insurance policy from defendant fireman fund insurance company.as originally issued,this policy covered property located on california avenue in bakersfield,california.an amendatory endorsement was added to this policy upon its renewal in june.this endorsement included a vacancy exclusion that provides as follows

not pay for any loss or damage caused by 
sprinkler leakage,unless you have protected the system against freezing 
building glass breakage 
water damage 
attempted theft 
reduce the amount we would otherwise pay for the loss or damage by.
a building is vacant when it does not contain enough business personal property to conduct customary operations.
buildings under construction are not considered vacant.
a cancellation endorsement added to the policy,meanwhile,provides that defendant may cancel the policy upon the occurrence of certain specified conditions,one of which is that t he insured building has been vacant or unoccupied or more days.this cancellation provision does not apply to b uildings in the course of construction,renovation or addition.
in november,plaintiffs added to the policy the commercial property involved in this dispute,a former bank building located on chester avenue in bakersfield.this property was rented to the salvation army beginning on december.this tenant left the premises at the end of,and the building had no tenants after that point up through the time of the damage giving rise to the instant suit.the property lacked enough business personal property to conduct customary operations during this span.however,plaintiffs did retain an architectural firm and a general contractor to transform the building into a leasable shell,in which many of the interior nonsupporting walls would be removed so that the space could be refashioned to suit a particular tenant needs.in april,plaintiffs began negotiations with goodwill industries for a build to suit lease.by june,plaintiffs,the contractor,and the tenant agreed in principle to the terms of a lease and to initial floor plans.on or around july,goodwill entered into a lease agreement for the property.
on june and june,the contractor engaged in walk throughs of the building,on the latter date being joined by subcontractors involved with the project.between june and june,the electrical subcontractor removed the electrical main panel covers,traced the circuitry from these panels,took down the walls around two panels and the subpanels connected to these panels,removed unneeded circuits and floor boxes,removed exposed electrical lines,and turned on and tested the remaining circuits for demolition safety.from june to july,the electrical subcontractor periodically continued to work at the building,tracing other circuit runs,reviewing subpanel locations and functionality,turning on and testing all of the electrical circuits,and assisting the heating,ventilation and air conditioning hvac subcontractor in testing the building hvac units.beginning on july,the hvac subcontractor also tested,evacuated,and charged the refrigeration system,making several trips to the building to perform this work.
on the morning of monday,july,workers discovered that a water heater or waterline on the third floor of the chester avenue building had burst,causing significant water damage.the line burst occurred sometime between july and july.this damage notwithstanding,plaintiffs completed the planned improvements to the structure in the ensuing months.this work was substantial.the project entailed the overall complete demolition of the structure to shell walls and the development of a core space within the building.the specific changes made to the structure included the installation of walls,doors,windows,electrical,telephone,and computer wiring,plumbing,hvac,paint,coverings,and additional restrooms,and the transformation of a basement into classroom space and old bank vaults into usable office space.all told,these improvements cost plaintiffs.
plaintiffs tendered their water damage claim to defendant pursuant to the policy,which had been renewed again in june.on december,defendant denied plaintiffs claim.after attempts to reach an informal resolution of the dispute failed,plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on may.defendant,pointing to the vacancy exclusion in the policy,moved for and received summary judgment in its favor.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.the court of appeal agreed with the superior court,finding that the vacancy exclusion applied and that the premises were not under construction at the time of the loss.the court of appeal assumed that the work being performed by plaintiffs at the time of the water damage constituted renovations to the building,but concluded that under construction did not encompass renovations to an existing structure.
the court of appeal offered five justifications for its interpretation of the pertinent policy language.first,the court of appeal stated that the plain meaning of the word construction,in its ordinary and popular sense,does not include steps taken to renovate an existing building.here,the court of appeal cited to dictionaries defining construction as the act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object,and the creation of something new,as distinguished from the repair or improvement of something already existing,and defining renovation as restor ing to life,vigor or activity,and clean ing up,replac ing worn and broken parts in,and repair ing.the court of appeal concluded from these definitions that construction envisions the building of a new structure and requires the putting together of various parts in order to bring the building to a point of readiness for occupancy.in contrast,a building under renovation is readily able to be occupied but requires some repair and improvements in order to meet the aesthetic or business needs of the occupant.surveying the work commenced prior to the loss,the court of appeal regarded these efforts as mere renovations,insufficient to render the building incapable of occupation.
second,the court of appeal explained that there is no evidence that the parties gave a different meaning to the term construction so that renovations would be included.third,the court of appeal noted that b uildings in the course of construction,renovation,or addition are excluded from the cancellation endorsement attached to the policy.from this language,the court of appeal concluded that if the policy had wanted to include renovations as an exception to the vacancy exclusion,it would have said so.fourth,the court of appeal stated that its interpretation of construction was consistent with the purpose of a vacancy exclusion to prevent vandalism and ensure the prompt discovery of damage.the court of appeal surmised,b uildings under construction will usually have workers on the property on a daily basis,which deters potential vandals and encourages the early discovery of fire or water damage.renovation,however,does not require daily involvement with the property.fifth and finally,the court of appeal pointed to decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting the word construction,in the context of property insurance policies,as not including repairs or renovations.
we granted review.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs argue that a building is under construction while it is being renovated,and assert that the work being performed on the premises involved here when the water damage occurred constituted construction under this interpretation of the policy language.the court of appeal disagreed,determining that under construction,as used in the policy,envisions the building of a new structure.the court of appeal did not specify whether work on an existing building could ever bring about a new structure under this interpretation.according to the court of appeal,however,construction does not include renovation,and therefore the vacancy exclusion applies against the insureds in this case.we apply de novo review to this question of policy interpretation.zurich american ins.cal th,d.
the proper interpretation of the under construction clause poses an issue of first impression in the courts of this state.other courts faced with construing insurance policies have arrived at different interpretations of this or similar language.it has been held in some quarters that the word construction does not encompass repairs,renovations,and comparable work on an existing building.see myers merrimack mut.fire ins.cir,interpreting vacancy exclusion clarifying that buildings in process of construction are not regarded as vacant travelers indemnity company wilkes county,construing policy exclusion applicable to buildings in the process of construction jerry kentucky cent.ins,interpreting policy language providing that a building in the course of construction is not considered vacant.other courts have determined that construction includes renovations to an existing structure.brouillette phoenix assur.so d,warren davis prop.united fire cas.none of the preceding opinions,however,engaged in the sort of thorough examination of the policy language undertaken by the court of appeal below.
well established interpretive rules guide our own review of the vacancy exclusion and its under construction clause.interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law and follows the general rules of contract interpretation.citation.the fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.citations.a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citation.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.moreover,insurance coverage is interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured,whereas exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer.citation.mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,d,fn.omitted.as a coverage provision,an exception to an exclusion will be construed broadly in favor of the insured.citations.this broad construction will aid the insured in meeting its burden of proof,thereby ensuring that the end result coverage or noncoverage conforms to the insured objectively reasonable expectations.aydin first state ins.cal th,d.
as did the court of appeal,we begin our analysis by examining the under construction language at issue here to ascertain its common meaning.under means receiving or undergoing the action or effect of.webster collegiate dict.ed.construction means the act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object webster new internat.dict.t he creation of something new,as distinguished from the repair or improvement of something already existing black law dict.ed t he act of building by combining or arranging parts or elements black law dict.ed and t he action of framing,devising,or forming,by the putting together of parts erection,building oxford english dict.ed.as the court of appeal observed,there is no doubt that the term construction,as commonly understood,includes the building of a new structure.contrary to that court suggestion,however,the plain meaning of that term would not seem to exclude other types of building endeavors short of erecting a new structure,such as substantial improvements or modifications to an existing structure,including projects that transform a hovel into a mansion,raze and replace the entire interior of a structure,or otherwise fundamentally transform a building.under certain circumstances,such endeavors may be seen as comprising an act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object or building by combining or arranging parts or elements as much as the erection of a new structure.
indeed,the legislature,in defining the term construction in various contexts,has recognized that the term may have a broad meaning encompassing a spectrum of building endeavors.for example,the legislature has defined the construction of state buildings as includ ing the extension,enlargement,repair,renovation,restoration,improvement,furnishing,and equipping of any public building,subd.b see also,subd.d providing an identical definition of construction.certain administrative regulations likewise define construction as including substantial renovation,repair,or alteration efforts,tit,defining construction as the process of building,altering,repairing,improving,or demolishing any public structure or building it does not include the routine operation,routine repair,or routine maintenance of existing structures,buildings,or real property,tit,defining construction project as includ ing new construction,alteration,and extension or betterment of existing structures,tit,defining construction occupations as all job classifications associated with construction,including but not limited to,work involving alteration,demolition,building,excavation,renovation,remodeling,maintenance,improvement,and repair work.these definitions suggest that laypersons do not limit the phrase under construction to the erection o
