on for summary judgment,the court applied insurance code,section,subdivision d and declared wilshire insurance company,wilshire entitled to contribution from sentry select insurance company sentry in the amount of the expenses incurred by wilshire in defending and settling a wrongful death action.sentry appeals the judgment arguing the statute does not apply to the stipulated facts,but if it does,it was misapplied.finding no error,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
because the parties based their respective motions for summary judgment on a joint statement of stipulated facts,we confine our summary of the facts to the matters contained in their stipulation,including the exhibits.
the accident and the underlying litigation 
in july,ken holm,dba kenway enterprises kenway,was driving a kenworth tractor the tractor hauling a great dane the trailer when the rig was involved in an accident causing bodily injury and death.a wrongful death action was filed in the orange county superior court against,inter alia,kenway the owner of the tractor and statewide transportation the owner of the trailer statewide.at the time of the loss,wilshire insured kenway sentry insured statewide.wilshire made a timely demand that sentry share in the investigative expenses,legal fees,and indemnity,but sentry refused to contribute.wilshire thereupon undertook the defense of both kenway and statewide,reserving its right to seek a pro rata contribution from sentry.after expending in investigative expenses,and in attorney fees,wilshire settled all claims made in the litigation against kenway and statewide by paying on their behalf.the parties agree these amounts were reasonable and necessary to settle the action.
the tractor lease 
at the time of the accident,kenway was hauling statewide trailer under the terms of a written agreement by which statewide had leased the tractor from kenway.under the terms of the lease,kenway also provided a driver for the leased tractor.as germane to arguments made on this appeal,the lease agreement also required kenway to fully indemnify statewide for damage to property or person of a third party resulting from fire,theft,collision,or upset and to fully indemnify statewide for damage to cargo arising from any or all of these same causes.in other words,when statewide hired kenway tractor and driver to haul the statewide load,it did so with the understanding that kenway would bear the risk of liability to a third party.
the insurance policies 
to protect itself against the risk of liability assumed under these and similar circumstances,kenway had purchased an insurance policy from wilshire.the wilshire insurance policy covered kenway for the subject accident with a policy limit of million.statewide had purchased its own insurance policy from sentry that,inter alia,insured any driver hauling a statewide trailer with statewide permission.thus,the sentry insurance policy also covered the subject accident and it also had a policy limit of million.kenway tractor was scheduled as an owned vehicle on the wilshire insurance policy,and statewide trailer was scheduled as an owned vehicle on the sentry insurance policy.
the wilshire policy provided liability coverage for damages resulting from the use of the owned vehicles specifically described in the policy such as the tractor.but it also provided liability coverage for damages resulting from the use of any nonowned trailer such as the statewide trailer attached to any power unit specifically described in the policy declarations such as the tractor further,the wilshire policy other insurance clause states that wilshire liability coverage would be primary where a covered vehicle the tractor is hired by another statewide and a written agreement with the other motor carrier as lessee statewide requires kenway to hold the lessee harmless finally,under the terms of the wilshire policy,if a covered trailer is connected to a covered tractor,the liability coverage for the trailer is also primary where coverage for the tractor is primary 
the sentry policy provides liability coverage for damages resulting from use of the trailer,but no provision of this policy covers liability resulting from the use of kenway tractor the sentry policy other insurance clause states the coverage is primary if the covered trailer is hired or borrowed by statewide which was not the case,and excess if the trailer is hired or borrowed from statewide also not the case.but where the covered trailer is connected to a power unit that is not covered under the policy,the coverage for liability resulting from use of the trailer is excess the operator of the tractor is nevertheless an insured because the trailer is being used with the permission of the owner thus,the sentry policy,by its terms,provides liability coverage for the accident,but the coverage is excess.
the court ruling 
the court granted wilshire motion for summary judgment and denied sentry motion,stating it may not be the most equitable result in view of the circumstances of this case,but i just think i got to apply d,and i think that dictates my ruling.i think if it were for the application of that code section,sentry argument would be much more persuasive.the court no doubt was troubled making a decision that,under compulsion of a statute,ignored the entirely consistent provisions of the other insurance clauses in the respective insurance policies and arrived at a result at odds with those provisions.after all,wilshire had agreed to provide primary coverage.sentry had agreed to provide only excess coverage.yet,in the trial court view,section,subdivision d,required wilshire and sentry to share the loss equally as insurers.
while we recognize the same anomaly,we nevertheless agree with the trial court and affirm the judgment.section,subdivision d,provides a rule applicable to these circumstances,and the court correctly applied the statute.
discussion 
because the case was presented on summary judgment motions with stipulated facts,we conduct a de novo review to decide a pure question of law.oliver williams elevator state bd.of equalization d.trial on stipulated facts presents issue of law hersant department of social services th,d summary judgment subject to de novo review on appeal.
in,the legislature declared it to be the public policy of this state to avoid so far as possible conflicts and litigation,with resulting court congestion,between and among injured parties,insureds,and insurers concerning which,among various policies of liability insurance and the various coverages therein,are responsible as primary,excess,or sole coverage.to achieve this goal,the legislature further declare d it to be the public policy of this state that section of the insurance code expresses the total public policy of this state respecting the order in which two or more of such liability insurance policies covering the same loss shall apply.ibid.
section identifies four different circumstances under which two or more policies of automobile or motor vehicle insurance may afford liability insurance applicable to the same loss.as to each of these defined circumstances,the statute states a rule,in the form of a conclusive presumption,by which to determine that policy which provides primary coverage and that policy which provides excess coverage,subds.a,b,c d.the parties agree three of the scenarios under section do not apply.wilshire contends,however,that section,subdivision d applies,and the application of subdivision d to the agreed facts results in wilshire and sentry both providing primary coverage.sentry contends section,subdivision d does not apply because,if construed as wilshire contends,the conclusion that the policies are does not order the policies as contemplated by the statute.sentry then looks to the other insurance clauses of the respective policies to argue its policy was not primary,but excess.alternatively,sentry contends the statute should be interpreted under these facts to make wilshire policy primary and sentry policy excess.
we begin our analysis with the words of the statute.section,subdivision d states w here two or more policies affording valid and collectibl
