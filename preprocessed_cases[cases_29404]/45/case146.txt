on june,james broderick and john stamatov entered into an agreement with gulf to develop,underwrite,and sell environmental insurance policies issued by gulf.this agreement,as embodied in a plan of organization the plan,provided for the formation of eiug as a holding company with two subsidiaries,environmental capital insurance brokerage,ecib and environmental insurance underwriters agency,eiua.ecib was a company broderick and stamatov formed in to broker environmental insurance policies.under the plan,ecib was to continue its role as a broker,selling environmental insurance issued by a number of companies,including gulf.the plan provided for the organization of eiua as a program manager for gulf.in this role,eiua was to develop,sell,and underwrite gulf environmental insurance products.gulf and eiua entered into a program manager agreement the pma under which the parties agreed that gulf was responsible for obtaining reinsurance for the insurance products eiua developed.the pma also provided that gulf had to approve any materials before they could be used to advertise gulf insurance products.
as capital for eiug,broderick and stamatov contributed all of their interest in ecib stock.citibank,a gulf affiliate,contributed.thus,broderick and stamatov together owned of the eiug stock and citibank owned.broderick,stamatov,and citibank entered into a stockholders agreement the agreement allowing each of the three shareholders to nominate a director who had to be elected unanimously.broderick and stamatov nominated themselves for the director positions,and citibank nominated kent ziegler,the chief financial officer and an executive vice president at gulf.the agreement also provided that most major corporate dividends,borrowing money,employing officers,to be unanimous.
the first product broderick and stamatov developed was called terraguard,an environmental insurance policy designed for owners of properties.gulf retained james cincotta,a reinsurance specialist,to obtain reinsurance for this policy.by the spring of,a reinsurance treaty was in place,and eiua began selling terraguard policies.
terraguard did not sell well.each month the company suffered losses until,in december,eiug became insolvent.by the beginning of,broderick viewed terraguard as essentially unsalable.
given these financial problems,eiug approached gulf for a loan in january.initially,gulf made an interim loan of.on january,gulf loaned eiug million.under the promissory note for the million loan the promissory note,eiug agreed to a repayment plan under which interest payments were due on january and july of each year,and the entire principal balance was due on january.in addition,the promissory note specified that eiug would be considered in default if it became insolvent.in the event of a default,the promissory note provided that gulf could,by written notice,declare the principal and accrued interest immediately due and payable.the promissory note also provided that eiug would be responsible for attorney fees and costs incurred in attempting to seek repayment.
using the loaned money,broderick and stamatov developed a new product line called millenious,consisting of three new policies.the first was a property owner policy on properties that was very similar to terraguard.the second was a pollution legal liability policy for properties.the third was a secured creditors policy,which insured lenders against the risk that property held as collateral would become polluted while the borrowers were in default.at the outset,only the property owner policy had reinsurance because it was reinsured under the terraguard reinsurance treaty.
gulf again retained james cincotta to obtain the needed reinsurance for the other millenious policies.this time,the potential reinsurers raised questions about the insurance products.in particular,the reinsurers raised underwriting concerns about the risk and profitability of the policies given their monetary limits and anticipated terms.broderick felt that the secured creditors policy would not be profitable unless it could be issued for up to million and for a period of up to twenty years,but the reinsurers were hesitant to reinsure a policy for more than million or for longer than fifteen years.negotiations between broderick and the reinsurers lasted until.the reinsurance was in place by july.during this process,ziegler did not try to do anything that could expedite the reinsurance process.
thereafter,broderick and stamatov began trying to sell the policies.in late july,gulf acquired the renewal rights to united capitol casualty and environmental insurance policies,which were arguably in direct competition with eiug business.as cfo of gulf,ziegler was involved in this transaction,but he did not tell broderick or stamatov about it,nor did he do anything to prevent it from taking place.
broderick testified that soon after this acquisition,gulf withheld approval of broderick and stamatov advertising campaign for the millenious products.ziegler did not intervene on eiug behalf to try to get advertising approval from gulf.
ultimately,millenious was no more successful than terraguard.on december,broderick,stamatov,eiug,and eiua filed a complaint against gulf,citibank,and kent ziegler.on april,the plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint by adding ecib as a plaintiff.the amended complaint alleged,among other claims,that ziegler,in breach of his fiduciary duty,had caused the demise of eiug by failing to act on its behalf to expedite the reinsurance process for the millenious products,lift the hold on advertising,and prevent the acquisition of the united capitol insurance rights or allow some form of participation in the transaction.the defendants answered,and gulf counterclaimed alleging breach of the million promissory note and unjust enrichment.
the parties filed a series of summary judgment motions,which resulted in two opinions by the district court.on july,the district court dismissed without prejudice eiug claim for attorney fees pursuant to.laws ch.for ziegler breach of fiduciary duty.on november,the court issued a second memorandum and order dismissing gulf claim for unjust enrichment.
on june,appellants filed a motion to confirm that certain claims were dismissed by the district court on summary judgment.along with the motion,the defendants alleged that eiug counsel,joseph reinhardt,had refused to enter into good faith negotiations over a stipulation for what a docket entry should read,forcing them to file a motion and incur significant litigation costs.in support of their contention,the defendants submitted an email exchange between counsel wherein reinhardt responded to the defendants first proposed stipulation saying,for reasons that should be obvious to all of you,my response to the request to enter into a frcp dismissal is no try again,if you want to.after the second proposed stipulation,reinhardt faulted the defense counsel for not figur ing out his concerns,and stated that appellants counsel should file a motion and consider the exchange as satisfying the obligation to confer.
the district court held that reinhardt violated rule and noted that t he abundant time,energy,and paper taken by the filing of the original motion and the resulting litigation over costs might have been avoided if reinhardt had simply stated his objections to the proposed stipulations or provided a response draft.
trial began on november.three issues were submitted to the jury whether ziegler had breached his fiduciary duty to eiug,whether citibank was vicariously liable for ziegler actions,and whether eiug had breached its obligations under the promissory note.
in a general verdict,the jury found that ziegler had breached his fiduciary duty and that citibank was vicariously liable for ziegler conduct.it awarded in damages.the jury also found that gulf was not entitled to recover on its counterclaim.finally,the jury noted on the verdict slip that ziegler and citibank were to pay eiug legal fees.
the district court entered a judgment against ziegler and citibank for in damages,but denied eiug attorney fees.eiug filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment by adding attorney fees pursuant to the jury verdict and,in the alternative,a motion to vacate the previous dismissal of the chapter claim for attorney fees.ziegler,citibank,and gulf also filed motions asking for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.the district court denied all motions.
ii.discussion 
breach of fiduciary duty 
appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law because eiug did not produce sufficient evidence to establish that ziegler breached his fiduciary duty to eiug or that such a breach would have caused any harm to eiug.we review the district court denial of the rule motion de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,eiug.golden rule ins.atallah,cir.we will reverse only if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have reached a verdict against that party.id.at quoting aponte,cir see also.a if a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue,the court may a resolve the issue against the party and b grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a claim or defense that,under the controlling law,can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.

as the plaintiff in an action for breach of fiduciary duty,eiug had the burden at trial of establishing a causal connection between ziegler alleged breach of fiduciary duty and the injury sustained by eiug.see hanover ins.sutton.this connection can not be left to the jury conjecture or speculation that is,it is not enough to show the mere possibility of a causal connection the probability of such a connection must be shown.jorgensen.port,cir citing berardi menicks.under massachusetts law,a plaintiff seeking to establish causation must show that the defendant conduct was a cause of its injury,and that the defendant conduct was a substantial legal factor in bringing about the alleged harm to the plaintiff.id.citing wallace ludwig,tritsch boston edison.
eiug presented to the jury three possible bases upon which to find a breach of fiduciary duty ziegler inaction with respect to eiug efforts to obtain reinsurance for the millenious products the advertising hold that gulf had imposed on eiug in july and gulf acquisition of the renewal rights to united capitol environmental insurance business.eiug general theory of liability at trial was that ziegler had influence in gulf,which he did not use to encourage gulf to take a more aggressive reinsurance position or to intervene to lift the advertising prohibition,and that he participated in gulf decision to acquire competing environmental insurance products without telling eiug about that transaction or inviting it to participate in the united capitol acquisition.we find that,even assuming that ziegler breached his fiduciary duties,eiug claim for breach of fiduciary duty fails as a matter of law because eiug failed to present sufficient evidence that such breach caused harm to eiug.
with respect to the reinsurance issue,there was no evidence submitted to the jury that any influence exerted by ziegler would have expedited the reinsurance process.the only evidence relevant to causation was testimony that some reinsurers are sometimes subject to influence by third parties.this is insufficient to establish even a reasonable likelihood that ziegler had any influence or that such influence,if exerted,would have expedited the reinsurance process.in fact,the evidence presented was that ziegler was not responsible for reinsurance decisions and that he could not have dictated the terms of any reinsurance treaty.
with respect to the advertising issue,eiug did not present sufficient evidence that any action taken by ziegler would have changed the outcome of the advertising ban.eiug does not dispute that ziegler was not in charge of advertising decisions it only presented evidence that he was involved in the process insofar as he agreed to talk to steven zeitman,executive vice president at gulf and ziegler superior,about the advertising prohibition.such evidence can not support a jury finding that,if ziegler had lobbied on eiug behalf,as eiug suggests,this act would have affected gulf ultimate decision and would have lifted the advertising ban.
finally,with respect to the united capitol renewal rights acquisition issue,there is insufficient evidence that ziegler actions,or omissions,caused eiug injuries.first,to the extent that eiug argued that ziegler breached his fiduciary duties by not lobbying on its behalf to stop the acquisition,eiug did not present sufficient evidence to support a rational jury conclusion that any lobbying by ziegler could have halted such a transaction.the only evidence eiug presented in support of this argument was that ziegler worked under christopher watson,gulf president and the person who had the ultimate authority to decide whether to purchase the united capitol renewal rights.watson testified that he made that decision with the help of his team.this statement does not establish the extent of ziegler influence in that process.he may have help ed as part of a team,but that alone is insufficient to establish that he had the power to alter the ultimate decision eiug did not show that any exercise of ziegler influence on behalf of eiug would have resulted in a decision by gulf to forego the opportunity to acquire the renewal rights.
eiug also argued that ziegler breached his fiduciary duties by not informing broderick or stamatov of the acquisition of the renewal rights before that transaction was made public.but eiug presented insufficient evidence that any injury was caused by this delay in information.in fact,broderick testified that he was not sure exactly what eiug would have done had it known about the transaction earlier.there is no evidence of concrete or even probable loss to eiug resulting from ziegler failure to tell broderick or stamatov about the transaction.eiug did not show that it could or would have done anything different that would have avoided the losses eiug incurred.
finally,eiug argued to the jury that ziegler should have lobbied for
