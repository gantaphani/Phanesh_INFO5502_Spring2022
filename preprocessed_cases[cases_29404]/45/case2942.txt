appellant,marie migliore,appeals from a judgment in favor of respondent insurance company based on the statute of limitations.we conclude the trial court did not err and we affirm.
statement of facts 
at the time of the northridge earthquake,january,appellant was employed by her father business,a farmer insurance agency doing business as migliore insurance agency.appellant was head of the automobile insurance department.appellant residence was insured through a farmer entity,fire insurance exchange,but she had no earthquake coverage.
despite the fact appellant had no earthquake coverage,on january,she filed a claim with fire insurance exchange for damage to her residence resulting from the northridge earthquake.vic miller,an independent adjuster employed by cefco national claims,inspected her home and concluded that it had little or no damage to it.appellant claim was denied on march on the basis she had no earthquake coverage.
appellant also had her home inspected by an independent appraiser,vincent natoli,in connection with refinancing,and by an agent of the federal emergency management agency.each found no significant damage from the northridge earthquake to the residence.
appellant applied for earthquake coverage through her father agency in early march.on march,her father inspected the residence,concluded there was no earthquake damage from the northridge earthquake,and issued a binder for earthquake coverage issued by respondent.
two aftershocks from the northridge earthquake struck on march.shortly after these aftershocks,appellant noticed cracks inside and outside her house,her roof began leaking and she began experiencing plumbing problems.in late april or early may appellant and her father inspected the house and determined appellant should not make a claim because the damage appeared to be less than her deductible limit of.
in november,appellant noticed more damage to her residence,which she attributed to the aftershocks.she filed a claim with respondent,which was acknowledged on march.dennis brown of the catastrophe center was appointed by respondent to evaluate the claim.he first confirmed that appellant father had done a inspection which resulted in a finding of no damage.accepting appellant contention that all damage resulted from the aftershocks,he inspected the property and adjusted the claim for a total of.after subtracting the deductible limit of,on april,respondent issued a check to appellant in the amount of.
after receipt of the check,appellant called brown and told him that she believed his adjustment was low because it did not include repair of a hump in a cement slab in her kitchen,cracks in the cement slab and tile,damage to the foundation of the house,and other miscellaneous damage she attributed to the aftershocks.in may,brown agreed to reopen the claim and retained engineer lawrence otsubo of procter consulting group to inspect the property.
otsubo inspected the property on may,and issued a report two days later in which he concluded that most of the damage appellant attributed to the aftershocks either the northridge earthquake or was caused by it.otsubo report was sent to appellant on june.appellant disputed the findings of otsubo report with brown in a memo she sent that same date.brown wrote a memo to the file on june concluding that appellant had received adequate payment of the claim given the fact that he had attributed all damage he had seen to the aftershocks despite the findings of otsubo that most of the damage earthquake coverage purchased by appellant.the memo suggested that a letter be sent to appellant and her agent to this effect.brown closed his file on june.
on july,nancy kleinrok,branch manager of the catastrophe center prepared a letter to appellant stating that no further payment would be made on the claim.because of the significance of this letter to the outcome,we quote it here verbatim

the concrete floor slab cracks were caused as a result of the northridge earthquake,and they were exacerbated by the march,aftershock and cracked through the ceramic floor tiles in the kitchen.the cracked slab through the dining room was observed by the insured when the carpeting was removed to install the wood flooring in november.
the concrete slab cracks are recommended to be epoxy injected and the cracked kitchen floor tiles removed and replaced.
the concrete driveway and patio cracks appeared to have occurred as a result of the northridge earthquake,however,they were exacerbated by the march,aftershock and expanded.the cracked concrete slab cracks are recommended to be sawcut along the closest control joints,removed,and replaced with thick concrete,reinforced with by wire mesh.the patio stamp concrete cracks are recommended to be epoxy injected,since the cracks would appear similar to the ridges on the rough slate surface finish.

discussion 
the statute of limitations 
based on the answers to questions,the trial court ordered judgment entered in favor of respondent on its statute of limitation defense.appellant raises a number of arguments why the trial court erred on this issue.
pursuant to the requirements of insurance code section,the policy of insurance issued to appellant contained the following clause we may not be sued unless there has been full compliance with all the terms of this policy.suit on or arising out of this policy must be brought within one year after the loss occurs.the actual language of section ends with the phrase after inception of the loss rather than after the loss occurs,as in the policy at issue here.we conclude this is a distinction without a legal difference.com.insurance superior court cal d,fn.
in,the supreme court concluded that the term inception of the loss should be defined as that point in time when appreciable damage occurs and is or should be known to the insured,such that a reasonable insured would be aware that his notification duty under the policy has been triggered.id.at.here,the jury determined inception of the loss occurred in november,which triggered the running of the statute.answer to question.appellant has no quarrel with this finding.
the statute is tolled from the time the insured gives notice of the claim to the insurance company until the time the insurer formally denies the claim in writing,supra,cal d at,see also prieto state farm fire casualty d.this has been construed to mean unequivocal denial in writing.aliberti allstate ins.th,d.here,the court applied the answers to questions and,respectively,as the date of notice of the claim given by appellant to respondent and the date respondent gave unequivocal written denial of the claim to appellant.appellant takes issue with the responses to each of these questions.
citing aliberti,appellant argues that question presented the wrong inquiry to the jury.question reads when did respondent first formally advise appellant that it would not pay any more for the damage to her property caused by the march,earthquake aftershock italics added.appellant argues that the question should have required the jury to determine when respondent unequivocally denied the claim rather than when it first formally advise d appellant it would pay no more on the claim.we conclude that neither the jury nor the court was misled by the language of the question.
the jury was instructed on this issue as follows the one year suit provision starts on the date of the inception of the loss and is tolled from the time the insured gives notice to the insurer until there is an unequivocal denial of the claim by the insurer.italics added.during argument,counsel for appellant impressed upon the jurors the importance of this legal concept now,why do i say that unequivocal denial this is the law.this is the law.it has to be unequivocal denial he urged the jury to find the date of the unequivocal written denial to be the letter from kleinrok dated march,it was not until this letter of that the plaintiff,perhaps not being a rocket scientist,but the plaintiff is not dumb.she recognized that she was out of luck.counsel for respondent argued the jury should select the kleinrok letter of july,as the date of unequivocal written denial ladies and gentlemen,in the letter of july the she was advised no more money.certainly by july the when she writes out,must get own engineer.i would submit that is the date that applies for the date when she was advised,the july the letter.
the jury chose the date argued by respondent counsel.suit was not filed until september,more than two years beyond the date determined by the jury when the tolling of the statute terminated.
appellant argues,as a matter of law,that the letter of july,can not be construed as an unequivocal denial.she argues that the words deny or denied are not used in the letter and that the letter suggests that the claim remains open because appellant was invited to submit further information for consideration.specifically,she references the following paragraph this decision is based upon the information available to us at this time.if you have any other information which you believe may effect insurance company decision on your claim,please let us know so we can consider it.call us at the emergency claim center at.she also points out that after this letter respondent received a supplemental report from otsubo to make sure it had a full understanding of what the engineer was saying.
neither the fact that respondent invited further input from appellant or that she obtained a supplemental report is conclusive of the determination whether the letter of july,may be determined an unequivocal denial.rather,this evidence suggests that respondent was willing to reconsider its denial upon receipt of further pertinent information.a statement of willingness to reconsider does not render a denial equivocal.singh allstate ins.th,d.nor does the failure to use the words deny or denial render a denial equivocal.id.at,d.the letter states that no further benefits will be provided beyond those previously paid.this is unequivocal language that no further payment on the claim would be made.
appellant contends that the court erred in failing to admit a denial letter from respondent to appellant for the claim she made immediately after the northridge earthquake.at footnote of her opening brief,appellant suggests that this letter would have been helpful to compare to the letter of july,because it clearly stated w e can not compensate you for your loss and must respectfully deny your claim in its entirety.we see no significant distinction between the two letters except for the fact that the letter of july,reflects that respondent did provide coverage for the aftershock claims.it then stated that respondent would not pay any further benefits on the claim.
appellant also contends that the trial court erred in precluding appellant expert,keith charleston,from testifying about the operation of the suit against us provision.the only legal reference cited to support this contention is evidence code section,which states no evidence is admissible except relevant evidence.no further analysis or citation to authority is offered to explain why expert evidence was appropriate or should have been allowed on this issue.we conclude appellant has waived the issue.tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d.
citing spray,gould bowers associated internat.ins.th,d spray,gould,appellant argues that failure of the letter of july,to notify appellant of the statute contained within the suits against us clause precludes its operation as an unequivocal denial.at best,spray,gould establishes that failure to mention the statute may give rise to an estoppel to rely on the statute of limitation no case has established that inclusion of this information in a denial letter is necessary to qualify the letter as an unequivocal denial,and we decline to do so.
appellant argues that she alleged an estoppel theory in her complaint by pleading that respondent never provided appellant with adequate and proper notice of denial of her claim for benefits.this language,by itself,is insufficient to allege an estoppel theory.at best,it places in issue the concept of tolling discussed above.
four elements must ordinarily be proved to establish an equitable estoppel the party to be estopped must know the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had the right to believe that it was so intended the party asserting the estoppel must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.citation.spray,gould,supra,th at,d,internal quotation marks omitted.no such argument was advanced in the trial court,thus waiving the issue for appeal.green travelers indemnity d.nor does the evidence support such a theory.instead,the evidence establishes that at all times appellant protested the amount paid on her claim and respondent determination not to provide further coverage 
in a related argument,appellant also takes issue with the answer of the jury to question.that question inquires when was respondent first notified of a claim for damage to appellant property caused by the march,earthquake aftershock pointing to the language of the policy which requires prompt notice of a claim to us or our agent italics added,she argues that the uncontroverted evidence establishes she reported the claim to her father agency in november,not the date of march,as the jury answered.
there are two problems with the argument.the first is that only four months would be added to the tolling period,not a sufficient amount of time to bring the filing date within the statute.the second is that the evidence is not uncontroverted and presented a factual issue for the jury to decide.if there is substantial evidence to support the finding of the jury,including reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence,we must accept their determination.hasson ford motor cal d,overruled on other grounds in soule general motors cal th,
