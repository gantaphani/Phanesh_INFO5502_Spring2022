in,nationwide filed a civil suit in federal court against both home and cigna,alleging that home failed to perform under the reinsurance contract.the district court ordered that the matter be arbitrated pursuant to the terms of the contract.nationwide mutual ins.home ins,d.the sixth circuit reversed this order as to cigna,holding that nationwide could not compel cigna to submit to arbitration,and that nationwide had no direct claim against cigna.nationwide mutual ins.home ins,cir nationwide i.
the arbitration proceeded between nationwide and home.after the panel made a few awards,most of which were unfavorable to home,home challenged the panel as biased,and the panel resigned.although arbitration with a second panel was still,nationwide and home asked the district court to confirm or vacate some of the orders issued by both panels.the district court initially ruled that the parties motions were premature,but it later reconsidered and ruled on several of the panel orders.nationwide mutual ins.home ins,d.this included a ruling rejecting home allegations of bias against the first panel.id.at.the sixth circuit affirmed.nationwide mutual ins.home ins,cir nationwide ii 
the second arbitration panel proceeded to address the remaining issues.on may,pursuant to a prior determination that nationwide was liable to home for of home administrative costs relating to the rutty pool,the panel ordered nationwide to reimburse this amount to aisuk,the cigna subsidiary that actually paid the administrative costs,without application of any offsets,except with regard to home obligation to share nationwide own administrative costs the order reads as follows 
nationwide liability for of administrative costs.the prior panel ruling that home is entitled to a reimbursement in relation to administration costs means that nationwide must reimburse aisuk or csuk for of all administrative costs paid on behalf of home from the time of rutty demise to date and hereafter without application of any offset by nationwide save in respect of of any such administrative costs paid by nationwide.home billings to nationwide must be accompanied by full and appropriate documentation,and any disagreement concerning the billing or documentation may be referred to the panel but only after the parties have made all possible good faith efforts to resolve the matter themselves.
on july,nationwide filed a suit in district court to vacate this award.the district court granted nationwide motion in part and denied it in part.although the district court affirmed nationwide liability for of home administrative costs,it found that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority by directing that payment be made to a third party,and by failing to consider nationwide right to offset based on other liquidated debts owed to nationwide by home.while this appeal was pending,home precarious financial situation came to a head,and home entered into voluntary rehabilitation in the state of new hampshire.
home appeals the district court partial grant of nationwide motion,challenging the district court findings that the arbitration panel exceeded its authority.we affirm the district court ruling as to the payment to a third party,but hold that the district court erred in ordering the arbitration panel to further address the issue of offset rights.
a federal court may vacate an arbitration award only in very limited circumstances.those circumstances include where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,a,and where the arbitrators act with manifest disregard for the law.dawahare spencer,cir.the questions of whether an arbitration panel has exceeded its powers or acted with manifest disregard for the law are legal questions that we review de novo.green ameritech,cir.
whether the panel may order nationwide to pay aisuk,a third party 
a party may waive its objection to the jurisdiction of the arbitrators by acquiescing in the arbitration with knowledge of the possible defect.order of ry.conductors brakemen brotherhood of trainmen clinchfield,cir home argues that nationwide consented to the arbitration panel jurisdiction by voluntarily and unreservedly submitting the question to the panel.see jones dairy farm local no,cir.nationwide,however,never submitted or acquiesced in the submission of the issue of whether the panel could order nationwide to pay a third party directly.
the party claiming waiver carries the burden of proof.cordrey euckert,cir.in order to carry its burden,home first points to nationwide argument that home was not entitled to reimbursement because cigna,not home,had paid the administrative costs associated with the rutty pool.nationwide raised this argument before the arbitration panel on several occasions.this does not constitute waiver.nationwide was asking the panel to rule on whether it was obligated to pay home at all given nationwide interpretation of the panel prior order to split administrative costs.nationwide was not asking the panel to rule on its obligations to cigna or its affiliates.
second,home points to nationwide failure to object to the panel december,ruling that the issue of the alleged liability of nationwide to reimburse csuk administrative expenses would be resolved in phase iii.this ruling did not put nationwide on notice that the panel would consider ordering reimbursement directly to csuk now aisuk.it was merely an accurate description of the true nature of the expenses for which nationwide might be held liable in its arbitration with home.it was not until its order of may,that the panel listed the issue of which or receive the payment from nationwide.at that point,nationwide timely objected at the may,hearing by making clear its position that the panel could only order reimbursement to home,if at all.we therefore find no basis for concluding that nationwide waived its objection to the arbitration panel jurisdiction.
authority of the arbitration panel 
the burden of proving that the arbitrators exceeded their authority is very great.federated dep t stores,cir.a s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.united paperworkers int l union misco,d.
an arbitration panel may not determine the rights or obligations of to the arbitration.see eljer,kowin dev,cir int l brotherhood of workers,local,cir orion shipping trading eastern states petroleum of panama,cir.in ncr,cir,we held that an arbitrator exceeded his authority by ordering payment of punitive damages to.in that case,the arbitrator erred by creating legal rights in the recipients of the punitive damage award,all of whom were to the arbitration.in the instant case,home and nationwide agree that cigna and its affiliate,aisuk,are to the contract and to the arbitration.thus,the arbitration award exceeds the panel authority.
the district court held that the arbitration award must be vacated because it is in manifest disregard of our holding in nationwide i.an award is in manifest disregard if the applicable legal principle is clearly defined and not subject to reasonable debate and the arbitrators refused to heed that legal principle.dawahare spencer,cir.in nationwide i,we held that nationwide could not bring suit directly against cigna,or compel cigna to submit to arbitration,because of a disclaimer provision in the assumption contract between home and cigna.we construed this disclaimer provision as a limitation on the obligations cigna undertook in its assumption contract with home.therefore,nationwide only recourse w
