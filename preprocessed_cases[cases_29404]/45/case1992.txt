on april,patrick printup,robert old son,was driving their car when the car brakes failed the car struck a utility pole,chain link fence,and park bench.as a result,roberts,a passenger at the time of the accident,was badly injured.
the car was titled and registered to both roberts and printup and was insured by shelter.the insurance policy provided up to in liability coverage per person for both property damage and bodily injury,and in personal injury protection pip.shelter received notice of the accident on april.shelter logged the incident as a code,which means,accident,insured at fault.district court order at july,order.shelter note on the accident file stated may have bi bodily injury and that pip would apply and that medical information should be collected.id.after roberts told one of shelter employees that she did not believe her son was at fault,however,shelter did not further investigate the circumstances of the accident.in june,roberts submitted an application to shelter for pip benefits.shelter thereafter paid towards roberts medical bills,exhausting the policy pip benefits.
roberts was still being treated for her injuries in february having had four surgeries and a skin graft.at.on april,roberts consulted counsel regarding the quality of her medical care.on her counsel advice,roberts hand wrote a letter to shelter offering to settle for policy limits to satisfy all her claims against printup,shelter insured,arising from the accident the letter explained the nature of her injury,her ongoing treatment,and estimated medical expenses in excess of.at.she sent the letter to protect her claim against the statute of limitations for filing claims against printup,which was expiring on april.as the district court noted,the letter stated i am running out of time and need your answer within ten days.id.at.the district court found that roberts and her attorney had an agreement that if shelter paid its policy limits of before the statute of limitations expired,she would not owe attorney fees on her recovery.id.she instructed her attorney to dismiss the lawsuit if shelter accepted her offer before the statute of limitations expired,but to serve defendant if shelter did not accept her offer.id.the lawsuit was filed on april,requesting issuance of summons on april.id.roberts notified her attorney when she had not received a response from shelter at the end of ten days,aplt.app.at,and he permitted the lawsuit to go forward.
in the meantime,roberts settlement offer to shelter was marked received on april at shelter topeka claims office,where roberts had been informed to send it when she called shelter to obtain an address the day she mailed it.notwithstanding the need for immediate action expressed in the letter,six days later,on april,shelter claims office mistakenly mailed the letter to the pip department in columbia,missouri.the pip department then mailed roberts letter to the kansas city claims department,where it was received on may,three weeks after its initial delivery to shelter.
on may,shelter advised roberts that,upon confirmation of the medical bills,it would pay the limits of its liability coverage.shelter then offered to pay the liability policy limit.as the district court found,when shelter failed to respond to plaintiff april,letter within ten days,plaintiff became obligated to pay her attorney a portion of her recovery.id.accordingly,roberts declined the offer.shelter hired a lawyer to defend printup in the lawsuit.subsequently,shelter,roberts and printup signed a settlement agreement.the agreement stated that w ith the consent of shelter,printup offers to confess judgment in favor of roberts on the issue of fault and causation and submit the issue of damages to the court for decision.at.the parties agreed that roberts would submit evidence to the district court to support her damages,and that they would abide by the court determination.they also agreed that the settlement provided herein is fair and reasonable,is not collusive,and is entered into in good faith and as a means of amicably resolving their dispute.id.at.

in exchange for printup assignment of his claim against shelter for bad faith or negligent failure to settle robert claim against him,roberts agreed not to execute her judgment against printup.at see glenn fleming.as contemplated by the settlement agreement,roberts then filed a garnishment action against shelter seeking to collect the judgment in excess of the policy limits,arguing that shelter acted negligently or in bad faith in handling the claim against its insured.after discovery,the district court granted shelter motion for summary judgment.roberts appealed,and we affirmed as to roberts claim of bad faith but reversed and remanded as to the negligence claim.see roberts,at.
as relevant here,we disagreed with the district court conclusion that shelter errors in handling roberts offer of settlement could not constitute negligence,particularly in light of the unfair claims settlement practices model regulation a.id.at we advised the district court that it should consider the factors set out by the kansas supreme court in bollinger nuss,in deciding a challenge to an insurer handling of a claim,which requires an individualized approach.roberts,at.
after a bench trial on remand,the district court found that i n april,shelter did not have a written policy,procedure,or mechanism in place to ensure that a claim would be acknowledged within ten working days,order at robert conduct was not arbitrary,id.at she did not intentionally send her claim to the wrong office or artificially and unnecessarily shorten shelter available response time in order to set up or manufacture a bad faith claim,id.at and i n light of the statute of limitations on her claim,plaintiff reasonably set a deadline,id.at.the district court concluded that t he april,letter was a demand letter that created a duty for shelter to act without negligence in handling the offer,id.at,and that shelter breached a duty when it failed to respond to plaintiff april,letter within ten days.as a result,plaintiff became obligated to pay her attorney a portion of her recovery.id.at.
notwithstanding these findings,the district court held that shelter negligence in handling roberts claim did not cause the excess judgment against printup,relying on our decision in wade emcasco ins,cir.id.at.the court was unconvinced that the circumstances changed enough during the three weeks between plaintiff deadline and shelter attempted settlement to justify plaintiff refusal to settle.id.at.the court therefore concluded that shelter was not liable for the excess judgment.id.roberts appeals.
