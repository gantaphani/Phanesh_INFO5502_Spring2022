introduction 
defendant jason jennings appeals from a postjudgment order to modify restitution.jennings argues that the trial court erred in failing to apply the proceeds paid to his victim by his insurance carrier in a civil settlement against the amount of restitution ordered by the court in jennings criminal case.we conclude that the trial court should have offset jennings restitution obligation by his insurer payments to the victim to the extent the payments were made to cover the costs of items included in the court restitution order.
procedural and factual backgrounda.factual background 
on september,jennings lost control of his vehicle while driving in the city of san diego on fairmont avenue toward the entrance to westbound interstate.the vehicle crashed into a concrete bridge railing on the right side of the road and overturned.jennings passenger,aleah hockridge,was ejected.jennings vehicle eventually landed on hockridge,causing her to sustain major injuries including head trauma,a fractured leg and clavicle,and multiple lacerations.the results of a preliminary alcohol screening and blood test indicated that jennings had been driving with a level.
procedural background 
jennings guilty plea and sentencing 
the san diego county district attorney filed an amended felony complaint charging jennings with one count of driving under the influence of alcohol and causing injury,subd.a and one count of driving with a level of or greater and causing injury,subd.b.the complaint further alleged that jennings personally inflicted great bodily injury within the meaning of penal code section,subdivision a 
on january,jennings pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and causing injury,and admitted the enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury.the remaining charge was dismissed and sentencing was left to the trial court discretion.on april,the trial court sentenced jennings to a term of five years probation with conditions,including days of work furlough.the court also ordered jennings to pay the victim restitution in the amount of,pursuant to section,subdivision f.
the civil settlement with hockridge 
on september,hockridge signed a settlement agreement to accept from the california state automobile association bureau csaa in exchange for releasing jennings and his mother,janet jennings,from further civil liability.hockridge attorney signed the settlement agreement on october,indicating that he had explained the release and its legal effect to hockridge.
according to the settlement agreement,in exchange for,hockridge agreed to forever and fully release,aquit,and discharge,janet jennings and jason jennings of and from all claims,demands,damages,actions and causes of action of every kind and nature,known or unknown,existing,claimed to exist,or which can ever hereafter arise out of or result from or in connection with a certain accident,casualty,or event which occurred on or about september,the document also conditioned execution of the release on an agreed allocation of the settlement amount of percent to medical expenses and percent to pain and suffering 
jennings requests to modify the restitution amount 
in late,jennings moved the court to offset the he had been ordered to pay as victim restitution by amount his insurance company tendered to hockridge as a result of the civil settlement on january,the people opposed jennings request to offset the restitution order by.however,the people conceded that pursuant to people bernal th,d bernal,a brief analysis needed to be done characterizing the defendant payments thus far as being credited toward civil or criminal losses.the people acknowledged that a trial court must offset against defendant restitution obligation monies paid to the victim by the defendant insurance carrier for losses subject to the restitution order citation,stating,it seems clear that a victim may not recover twice for the same identical loss.however,the people argued that only of the civil settlement amount should be credited against jennings restitution obligation because this was the portion of the settlement that was allocated to hockridge medical costs,as opposed to her pain and suffering the people also requested that the court modify the restitution order to reflect additional medical expenses hockridge had incurred subsequent to the date of sentencing.
the court held hearings on the matter on january and.on january,the parties stipulated to an increase in the restitution obligation in recognition of hockridge additional medical expenses,and the court modified the restitution amount to.after hearing arguments from both parties regarding whether any offset was appropriate,the court concluded that jennings was entitled to no offset under bernal because,according to the court,jennings was not the insured.the court stated,it is his mother who is the insured,and based on that fact alone i distinguish bernal and find that jennings is entitled to no offset based on the insurance carrier refund to the victim.
on february,jennings filed a motion to modify the restitution order and reconsideration of the court previous ruling.in support of the motion,jennings provided a declaration from his mother in which she stated that a jennings was an insured under the policy,b jennings name was on the declarations page of the insurance policy,c jennings had used his earnings from summer jobs to help her pay for extra expenses,including the insurance premiums,and d the insurance company had indicated that it had no subrogation rights for claims paid on behalf of either jennings or his mother.jennings also submitted a csaa document entitled automobile policy declarations that listed janet and jason as drivers on policy number.the people challenged the motion on both procedural and substantive grounds,arguing that jennings had presented no new facts or law,and disputing that jennings had paid the insurance premiums.the people submitted a declaration from the victim attorney in the civil case stating that information as to who had purchased the policy had not been raised during the settlement discussions.
on march,the court held a hearing on jennings motion to modify and reconsider the previous ruling as to jennings restitution obligation.the trial court disagreed with jennings attorney that the additional evidence offered to the court was sufficient to allow the court to offset jennings restitution obligation by the amount paid to the victim in the civil settlement.the court ordered that its previous ruling regarding modification of the restitution order would stand.
jennings appeals from the court order denying his request to modify the restitution obligation pursuant to section,subdivision b,which allows challenges to order s made after judgment,affecting the substantial rights of the party.
discussiona.jennings is entitled to an offset for payments made by csaa to hockridge 
jennings argues that the trial court should have applied the csaa paid to settle hockridge civil claims against him and his mother toward the in restitution he owes hockridge under the court restitution order.the trial court did not allow jennings to offset the insurance company payments against his restitution obligation because the court determined that the insured on the csaa policy was jennings mother,and not jennings although a trial court allocation of restitutionary responsibility is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,an order resting upon a demonstrable error of law constitutes an abuse of the court discretion.people draut th,d,quoting in re th,d.
in challenging the trial court order,jennings contends that the trial court should have applied the rule announced in bernal,supra,th at pages,d,to his situation because his insurer paid his victim to settle claims against him and his mother.the bernal court concluded that payments made to the victim by the defendant insurance company to settle civil claims on behalf of the defendant satisfies section,subdivision a mandate that the victim receive restitution payments directly from the defendant.bernal,supra,th at,d.thus,under bernal,payments made to the victim by the defendant insurer in settlement of the victim civil claims against the defendant should offset the defendant victim restitution obligation to the extent those payments indemnified the victim for losses covered by the restitution order.ibid.
although the people initially conceded below that jennings was an insured on the csaa policy within the meaning of bernal,on appeal the people contend that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying jennings request to offset the amount csaa paid because t he court properly exercised its discretion in finding appellant was not the insured on the policy that paid the civil settlement.thus,the people argue,this case is more closely aligned with the factual scenario of people hamilton th,d hamilton than that of bernal.in hamilton,the court concluded that a defendant could not apply payments made to the victim by his mother insurance company to offset his victim restitution obligation.the hamilton court distinguished bernal on the basis that the insurance payments made to hamilton victim were made on behalf of hamilton mother,not hamilton himself.hamilton,supra,th at,d.we conclude that bernal,rather than hamilton,controls this case,and that the trial court erred as a matter of law in determining that jennings was not an insured within the meaning of bernal.
bernal and hamilton 
in a factual situation similar to the one presented here,the defendant in bernal was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol,subd.a and causing great bodily injury,subd.a pursuant to a plea agreement.bernal,supra,th at,d.among the conditions of bernal probation was that he make restitution to his victim for her current and future medical bills.ibid.the victim submitted a statement of loss to the probation officer setting forth approximately in losses.some time later,bernal insurance company tendered to the victim to settle any claims she may have had against bernal.when bernal sought modification of the restitution order,the prosecutor argued that the settlement amount was not enough to cover the victim current and past medical bills.the trial court concluded that bernal had satisfied his restitution obligation because the victim had released her claims against him,and because his insurance company had paid her,which was more than the victim claimed losses.
on an appeal by the prosecution,the appellate court considered and decided two issues.first,it concluded that the victim written release of all claims against the defendant did not prevent the trial court from ordering additional restitution in the criminal case.bernal,supra,th at,d.more significant for purposes of this court concluded that payments made by bernal insurance company to the victim for losses covered by the restitution order should offset his restitution obligation.id.at,d.
in reaching this conclusion,the bernal court noted that payments made by a defendant insurer are fundamentally different from payments by independent and distinct third party sources because payments made to the victim by the defendant insurer are not fortuitous,but rather are bargained for since,unlike payments from third party sources,the defendant procured the insurance the defendant paid premiums to keep the policy in force the defendant has a contractual right to have the insurance company make payments to the victim on his behalf and the insurance company has no right of indemnity or subrogation against the defendant.bernal,supra,th at,d.for these reasons,the bernal court determined,the relationship between an insured and his insurer is such that payments made by a defendant insurer are actually payments made to the victim directly from the defendant for purposes of section.bernal,supra,th at,d.
in hamilton,supra,th at page,d,the court distinguished the facts before it from those in bernal,and determined that the defendant could not offset his restitution obligation by the settlement amount paid by his mother insurer in settlement of the victim claims against her.in hamilton,the defendant,hamilton,shot and seriously injured a man while the man was performing work for the defendant and the defendant mother.id.at,d.after the victim filed a civil lawsuit against hamilton and his mother,hamilton mother insurer paid the victim between and to settle the claim on her behalf and obtained the victim release of claims and dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuit against hamilton and hamilton.ibid.the hamilton court concluded that although the defendant mother insurance company had tendered a settlement sum to the victim of his crime,hamilton could not offset the settlement payments against his restitution obligation because the only relationship hamilton had to the insurance company was the fact that it insured his mother.hamilton,supra,th at,d,citing birkett,supra,cal th at,d,defendant to pay entire restitution amount to victims,despite fact that victims insurers had already partially reimbursed victims for losses hove,supra,th at,d defendant required to pay full restitution despite fact that medicare and medical had paid all of victim medical expenses.
in distinguishing the facts before it from those in bernal,the hamilton court noted that there is no evidence that the settlement paid by hamilton insurer was made on hamilton behalf.the evidence is to the contrary.hamilton,supra,th at,d.specifically,unlike the defendant in bernal,hamilton had not procured or maintained the insurance,had no contractual right to require payments to be made on his behalf,and was potentially subject to an indemnity claim by the insurer.hamilton,supra,th at,d.in contrast to bernal,the hamilton court noted that 
the settlement and release agreement signed by the victim expressly releases hamilton it does not mention hamilton except in the caption in the victim civil case against hamilton and his mother.a letter from hamilton insurer dated march,transmitting to her a copy of the signed release,states pursuant to your request,enclosed are copies of the signed release,dismissal and settlement check we issued to resolve the claim made against you by the victim.finally,a letter from hamilton attorney states i am happy to advise that the offer to compromise in the amount of has been accepted which will release and dismiss you from this lawsuit.we were also able to extricate your son,eric,with respect to the civil action,obtaining a request for dismissal with prejudice.id.at,d.
based on this information regarding the settlement between hamilton victim and hamilton mother,the hamilton court determined that the settlement paid by hamilton insurer was made on her behalf,not on hamilton behalf.hamilton,supra,th at,d,italics added.thus,the victim receipt of payments in hamilton was due to two fortuitous events hamilton procuring insurance coverage and the insurance policy covering hamilton acts.id.at,d.the court stated,hamilton should not benefit from these circumstances.citations.ibid.because the settlement amount paid by hamilton insurer was not made directly on behalf of hamilton,the court concluded,it can not be offset against hamilton victim restitution obligation.id.at,d.
thus,after bernal and hamilton,the question a court must answer when faced with a request to offset a criminal restitution obligation is whether the defendant seeking the offset for an insurance settlement payment is an insured on whose behalf the settlement payments were made.
jennings was an insured on whose behalf csaa settled with hockridge 
in bernal,the question whether the insurance company payment was made on the defendant behalf was not at issue.see bernal,supra,th at,d.in this case,despite the fact that the parties did not raise jennings status as an insured under the csaa policy,and that the issue was,in fact,conceded by the people in briefing the court raised the issue on its own and concluded that jennings was not an insured.based on this finding,the court determined that,like the defendant in hamilton,jennings was not entitled to receive credit for csaa settlement payment to hockridge.however,there is no evidence to support the trial court conclusion.rather,the only evidence presented to the court established that,unlike in hamilton,jennings was an insured under the csaa policy 
specifically,jennings submitted a document entitled automobile policy declarations issued by csaa,which listed both janet and jason as drivers on policy number.no one disputed the authenticity of this document,which clearly reflects the fact that jennings was an insured under the policy.presumably,jennings and his mother paid a higher premium for the policy covering both of them than jennings mother would have paid to insure only herself thus,unlike the payments in birkett,supra,cal th at page,d,and hove,supra,th at page,d,the payment made to hockridge by csaa was a direct result of the fact that jennings had procured automobile insurance 
the dissent asserts that jennings did not procure the insurance,arguing that because there is no evidence that he sought out or selected the insurance policy,he did not get it or obtain it.dissent,post,at.we see no basis to draw a distinction between persons who,for whatever reason,delegate to a spouse,or other household member the power with regard to purchasing automobile insurance,and those who seek out and select the insurance themselves.the point is that the person is an insured driver.in our view,under bernal,the term procure means to get or to obtain.under this definition,we conclude that jennings did in fact procure insurance 
additionally,the settlement agreement here,unlike the release in hamilton,establishes that the settlement amount paid by csaa was made directly on jennings behalf,as well as on his mother behalf.the settlement agreement confirms that csaa tendered to hockridge in exchange for her release of claims against both jennings and his mother.the settlement document also states that its execution was conditioned on representations by defendants that represents the policy limits of all policies of insurance which are available to them to cover this occurrence further,the agreement was entered into and signed by hockridge,jennings mother,and jennings himself.
moreover,the fact that csaa paid hockridge to settle her claims provides further support for the conclusion that csaa made settlement payments on jennings behalf,and not just his mother.vehicle code section limits the liability of a vehicle owner who is not at fault in an accident to no more than for the injury of one person,subd.a.thus,jennings mother maximum liability in the civil action was.on this record,we can therefore infer that any amount over that csaa paid to settle hockridge claims was made to settle claims against jennings,and not his mother.
the facts of this case are quite different from those in hamilton,on which the people rely.in hamilton,the insurance policy was not an automobile insurance policy.although the hamilton court never identified the type of policy hamilton mother maintained,from the facts we infer that hamilton mother was covered through either a general liability policy or a homeowner policy.see hamilton,supra,th at,d insurance at issue covered shooting that occurred while victim was doing work for insured.unlike the defendant in hamilton,supra,th,d,jennings relies not only on his relationship with his mother,who is an insured and whose insurer paid to settle potential claims against her,but also on his own relationship with the insurer as an insured on whose behalf the settlement payments were made.in addition,the fact that hockridge received partial payment covering her losses was not due to fortuitous events,as in hamilton,but rather,to the fact that jennings had procured insurance that covered his acts.hamilton,supra,th at,d.thus,the source of the payment to hockridge can not be said to be completely distinct and independent from jennings.
under the dissent view,based on its assumption that jennings did not pay for the insurance he is not entitled to receive the restitution offset required under bernal.the dissent would have us hold that in addition to establishing that his insurance company made payments to the victim for the same losses identified in the restitution order,a defendant must show that he individually paid for the insurance.we do not think bernal requires this.
bernal holds simply that settlement payments made to a victim by the defendant insurance carrier must be offset against the defendant restitution obligation to the extent those payments are for items of loss included in the restitution order.bernal,supra,th at,d.for purposes of this rule,who paid the premiums is irrelevant.the rule requires nothing more than an inquiry into whether the defendant has insurance covering the loss at issue,whether the insurance carrier made payments to the defendant victim on the defendant behalf,and whether the payments were for losses covered by the restitution order.
the dissent focuses on only one portion of the bernal court justification for announcing a rule that payments made by a defendant insurer can be used to offset a defendant restitution,that payments by a defendant insurer are different from other third party sources of payment in part because a defendant has paid premiums to maintain the policy in force.see bernal,supra,th at,d.however,we are not convinced that this particular justification must be present in every case in order to entitle a defendant to an offset.whether a person directly paid the premiums on a policy is fundamentally unlike the other three reasons cited by the bernal court in support of its rule that an insured may offset payments made by his insurer to a victim against his restitution obligation.see bernal,supra,th at,d.whether the defendant procured the insurance in question,whether the defendant has a contractual right to have payments made on his behalf,and whether the insurer has a right to indemnity or subrogation against the defendant,each goes to the heart of the concept of being insured.in contrast to these factors,the question who paid the premiums on the policy is irrelevant to determining who is an insured under the policy.alex robertson imperial casualty indemnity th,d defendant insurer possessed no duty to defend plaintiff company even though plaintiff had paid the premiums on policy at issue because third party was insured under policy.
we think the relevant inquiry for purposes of bernal is whether the defendant has obtained insurance,and is thus an insured,and not the manner by which the insured procured the insurance coverage or how much he may have paid for it any individual,regardless of how he or she obtained the insurance has a contractual right to have payments made by the insurer on his behalf such that his insurer has no right of equitable subrogation against him with respect to a loss or liability for which the insured is covered under the policy.see truck ins.exchange county of los angeles th,d.thus,rather than try to determine how the insurance was procured,a court must determine simply whether or not the insurer payments to the victim were made on behalf of the defendant as a result of the defendant status as an insured.in our view,if a defendant has obtained insurance that covers the victim loss,irrespective of how the defendant went about procuring the insurance,by purchasing it himself or by having someone else purchase it,and that insurance results in the payment to the victim,bernal applies.
we recognize that there are from simply providing victim underlie the state policy of requiring a criminal defendant to pay restitution to his victim.as the dissent notes,rehabilitation of the defendant and deterrence of further crime are at least two other objectives cited by courts as grounds for imposing restitution on criminal defendants.see bernal,supra,th at,d.however,our review of the statute provisions suggests that the primary purpose of victim restitution is to fully reimburse the victim for his or her economic losses.see id.at,d.the legislative intent identified in subdivision a of section is that the victim be made whole again.additionally,the fact that victim restitution may be ordered only to cover economic losses,despite the fact that such a rule may frustrate the goals of rehabilitation and deterrence in cases in which there has been no economic loss,suggests that victim indemnification is the principal concern of subdivision f.
we note further that the objectives of rehabilitation and deterrence are independently addressed by subdivision b of section,which requires a court impose a separate and additional restitution fine in addition to that to be paid to the victim pursuant to subdivision f,unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so the fact that a court must impose a restitution fine in addition to restitution imposed pursuant to section,subdivision f,contradicts the dissent assertion that jennings could have escaped all personal responsibility for restitution and that allowing an offset in this situation steals away the rehabilitative and deterrent effect of restitution.dissent,post,at.
we conclude that the rule announced in bernal,supra,th at pages,d,applies in this case.jennings is thus entitled to offset at least some portion of the payment csaa made to hockridge against his restitution obligation 
c.the amount csaa paid to hockridge for her medical expenses should offset jennings restitution obligation 
according to bernal,the trial court must offset against defendant restitution obligation monies paid to the victim by the defendant insurance carrier for losses subject to the restitution order.bernal,supra,th at,d,italics added.the restitution order in this case obligates jennings to pay restitution covering hockridge medical expenses.only the portion of jennings civil settlement that covered these economic losses may be used to offset the amount jennings is obligated to pay hockridge under the court order for restitution.according to the civil settlement,percent of the agreement amount was directed toward hockridge medical bills thus,jennings,through his insurer,has theoretically already paid hockridge toward her medical bills.it is likely,however,that some portion of this amount went to pay for attorney fees.only that portion of the settlement payment that was directed to cover hockridge medical bills and did not go toward attorney fees should be offset against the amount of jennings criminal restitution obligation 
conclusion 
the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that jennings may not offset the payment made by his insurance company as part of a civil settlement against his obligation to reimburse the victim for her medical expenses,pursuant to section,subdivision f.the evidence before the court established as a matter of law that the settlement payment csaa made to hockridge was made on behalf of both jennings and his mother.pursuant to bernal,supra,th,d,jennings restitution obligation should be modified to reflect a credit for the amount tendered by his insurance company to pay for hockridge medical expenses.
disposition 
the order of the trial court is reversed,and the case is remanded with directions to the trial court to modify the amount of jennings restitution obligation.the trial court shall make a finding as to what portion of the allocated to medical expenses went toward attorney fees.the trial court shall offset the restitution obligation by an amount equal to,less the amount determined to have been used to pay attorney fees.
people bernal th,d,held that a court must offset against a defendant direct restitution obligation monies paid by his insurance company to his victim for losses subject to the restitution order.in the present case the majority extends bernal by requiring an offset of monies paid to defendant jason jennings victim by what,in the context of direct restitution law and the record in this case,can only reasonably be described as his mother insurance company.i disagree with bernal and i disagree with the majority extension of its holding.i,therefore,respectfully dissent.
penal code section,subdivision a,provides it is the intent of the legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.italics added.
the statutory requirement of a defendant direct restitution to a victim rests on the concept that such direct payment will emphasize to the defendant the seriousness of the crime or crimes committed.as bernal itself notes,restitution is an effective rehabilitative penalty because it forces the defendant to confront,in concrete terms,the harm his actions have caused.such a penalty will affect the defendant differently than a traditional fine,paid to the state as an abstract and impersonal entity,and often calculated without regard to the harm the defendant has caused.similarly,the direct relation between the harm and the punishment gives restitution a more precise deterrent effect than a traditional fine.citations.citation.people bernal,supra,th at,d see also,people birkett cal th,d,people crow cal th,d,in re brittany th,d.
my objection to bernal is that the nature of insurance is antithetical to a core purpose of direct restitution.insurance is in essence a means of transferring,distributing and sharing risk.appleman on insurance holmes ed ch.see san diego housing com.industrial indemnity th,d richardson gab business services,d.as such,insurance dilutes the monetary responsibility for an insured actor conduct and dissipates the direct monetary impact on actors for their civil,or in this case criminal,wrongdoing.
if rehabilitation and deterrence are core purposes of direct victim restitution,which i believe they are,then allowing a defendant to offset a direct restitution obligation with monies paid by his liability insurer effectively disengages the amount of direct restitution the defendant must pay from the calculation of the harm caused and thus steals from the restitution obligation its intended rehabilitative and deterrent effect.
the court in bernal supports its conclusion that the monies paid a victim by the defendant insurer should be an offset against a restitution obligation by noting that if such offset is not allowed,the victim might receive a windfall.people bernal,supra,th at,d.as bernal itself acknowledges,however,double recovery to the victim is permissible where the victim own insurance company pays the victim and the defendant is ordered to make full direct payment as well.id.at,d also see people birkett,supra,cal th at,d,people hamilton th,d.moreover,california has long permitted windfalls when they are the of socially useful devices.thus,this state adheres in tort law to the collateral source doctrine people birkett,supra,cal th at,fn,d,and statutorily supports the awarding of punitive damages.since the legislature has declared direct restitution a socially useful device,it is inconsequential that it may in some cases result in a crime victim receiving,to one degree or another,a windfall.
in addition to these fundamental differences with bernal,i also have a somewhat narrower,but i believe significant,difficulty with its holding.penal code section,subdivision j,provides in part restitution collected pursuant to this subdivision shall be credited to any other judgments for the same losses obtained against the defendant arising out of the crime for which the defendant was convicted.under this provision an insurer ultimately liable on a judgment is entitled to have its liability reduced by the amount of restitution paid by a criminal defendant.see people hamilton,supra,th at,d people clifton d.the reverse is not true the statute does not provide the criminal defendant with any credit for amounts paid on a civil judgment.people hamilton,supra,th at,d people clifton,supra,d at.thus the legislature has expressed a clear preference that payment come first and foremost from criminal defendants and only then from the myriad of other people and entities potentially liable on a civil judgment.bernal of course reverses this statutory preference if a trial court follows bernal and gives a criminal defendant credit for a judgment paid by his insurer,the trial court will not be able to reduce,as required by penal code section,subdivision j,the amount of any civil judgment 
accepting for the sake of argument that bernal was correctly decided,i still could not join the majority opinion in this case since,in my view,it u
