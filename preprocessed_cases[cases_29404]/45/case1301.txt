keystone consolidated industries,and valhi,collectively,keystone operate a number of mills that manufacture wire products,chemicals and other industrial materials,and have done so in some capacity since the early.beginning in and continuing through the late,keystone purchased dozens of comprehensive general liability and excess umbrella insurance policies from employers insurance company of wausau wausau.keystone seeks indemnification from wausau for approximately million,which represents the costs it has incurred or expects to incur cleaning up environmental damage that its operations caused at four sites in illinois and indiana.wausau has refused to indemnify keystone on the theory that the policies require indemnification only when a lawsuit triggers its duty to defend.the district court agreed with wausau and granted its motion for summary judgment.because,under illinois law,the duty to indemnify may arise even in absence of a lawsuit triggering the duty to defend,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
four of keystone industrial sites are at issue in this case peoria,impex,chicago steel wire and ninth avenue.keystone has requested indemnification from wausau for costs associated with cleaning up groundwater and other contamination at each site.the peoria site constitutes the most extensive claim by far the others involve only a fraction of the peoria site cleanup costs.we summarize the relevant facts about each site and its attendant claims and costs below.
keystone opened a wire mill near peoria,illinois in.this wire mill,which is one of the largest in north america,draws and finishes wire products such as fence materials and nails.in,keystone opened a steel mill,which produces steel rod coils,at the same facility in peoria.
keystone began to use chlorinated solvents,including trichloroethylene tce,in vapor degreasing cabinets to clean nails in the wire mill at the peoria site in.by the,keystone was using four such vapor degreasing cabinets.around,keystone switched from tce to another chlorinated solvent known as,tca.keystone abandoned the chlorinated solvents and converted to cleaning agents in.
during the time that keystone used the chlorinated solvents in its degreasing cabinets,part of the cleaning wastewater containing spent pickle liquor,which is sulfuric acid used to clean steel rods for wire drawing.because spent pickle liquor contains lead and chromium,the environmental protection agency has designated it a hazardous waste known as.and part app.vii.
on july,the united states filed a complaint against keystone alleging that its peoria site violated the resource conservation and recovery act,rcra and seeking to enjoin it from depositing spent pickle liquor into earthen impoundments at the site.on june,keystone entered into a consent decree with the united states.in that consent decree,keystone agreed to pay a civil penalty and to close its spent pickle liquor impoundments pursuant to a plan it would negotiate with the illinois environmental protection agency iepa.during a sampling required for the closing of the spent pickle liquor impoundments,keystone discovered tce and tca contamination collectively,the tce contamination in the groundwater beneath the peoria site.
on october,keystone began the installation and sampling of groundwater monitoring wells to determine the extent of the tce contamination.keystone notified wausau of its potential liability for tce contamination on november.in,the iepa filed a complaint and proposed consent decree in illinois state court essentially alleging that keystone failed to meet its obligations under the consent decree.in,keystone submitted claims against the wausau policies seeking indemnification for costs incurred in remediating the tce contamination.wausau has thus far refused to pay.keystone expects to incur a total cost of approximately million in cleaning up the peoria site.it has,to date,incurred costs of about million.
the impex site is a former plant located in crawfordsville,indiana.the national lock company,a subsidiary of keystone,acquired the facility in.while keystone owned the plant,it used volatile organic compounds vocs for metal cleaning and finishing.keystone arranged for an environmental assessment of the property in preparation for its proposed sale.this assessment identified voc contamination of the soil and groundwater exceeding permissible state and federal levels.keystone submitted a voluntary cleanup plan to the indiana department of environmental management in.under that plan,keystone installed and began to operate both a voc soil vapor system and a groundwater system at the impex site in.
keystone investigation and cleanup costs at the impex site exceed million.keystone seeks indemnification from wausau for expenses incurred and a declaration that wausau will be liable for future costs.
keystone acquired the third site,the chicago steel wire site,in.during a site investigation in,keystone discovered voc and lead contamination in the soil and groundwater.keystone notified the iepa of its findings and enrolled the site in illinois environmental remediation program.the iepa approved keystone remediation in august.keystone incurred a total of about relating to this remediation and seeks indemnification for those and future costs.
the final site relating to this lawsuit is the ninth avenue site,a former waste disposal site located in gary,indiana.keystone transferred spent pickle liquor from the chicago steel wire site to the ninth avenue site for disposal between april,and november.in,the epa ordered chicago steel wire and other potentially responsible parties to investigate and remediate the site.keystone has incurred costs of approximately million to date to remediate the ninth avenue site.
the district court granted wausau motion for summary judgment,concluding that illinois courts require the filing of a formal complaint in a court of law to trigger the duty to defend clause of a comprehensive general liability insurance contract and that where there is no duty to defend,there will be no duty to indemnify.keystone timely appealed and now seeks a reversal of summary judgment so that it may proceed to trial.keystone also argues that,even if illinois law requires a lawsuit to trigger an insurer duty to indemnify,the iepa complaint alleging that keystone failed to prevent and remediate the tce contamination satisfies that standard for the peoria site.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.magin monsanto,cir.federal jurisdiction in this case rests upon diversity of citizenship.a.the parties agree that illinois law governs the substantive issues underlying the appeal.
a.the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify under illinois law 
the district court concluded that,under illinois law,where an insurance policy includes both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify,the duty to indemnify arises only in circumstances involving lawsuits.proceeding from that conclusion,the district court then reasoned that since the insurance policies at issue contain both duties,keystone indemnity rights must be limited to claims involving lawsuits.both steps of the district court reasoning,however,are erroneous.first,although some authority suggests otherwise it appears fairly well settled that under illinois law,an insurance policy may entitle the insured to indemnification for claims that do not arise from the resolution of a lawsuit,so long as those claims satisfy any requirements set forth in the relevant provisions of the policy.see cent.light home ins,cilco see also sokol atl.mut.ins,cir.second,the language of keystone policies arguably supports a conclusion that wausau has a duty to indemnify keystone that is independent of its duty to defend.
an insurer most fundamental duty under its insurance contracts is its duty to is,its duty either to reimburse the insured for losses it incurs directly or to pay sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay to others.alan windt,insurance claims and disputes representation of insurance companies and insureds ed.supp.an insurer duty to indemnify often involves its duty to defend the insured in the event of a lawsuit or its functional equivalent.id.steel surety,d.but although the duties to defend and to indemnify may be related,they are not necessarily mutually dependent or coextensive.see,sokol,at w hile the duty to indemnify may sometimes nest inside the duty to defend,that will not always be the case.
moreover,the fact that the duty to defend is generally broader than the duty to indemnify does not mean,as the district court believed,that where there is no duty to defend there can be no duty to indemnify.the duty to defend is generally broader because it arises in cases of arguable or potential coverage.that is,an insured need only put the insurer on notice of the claim in order to trigger the insurer duty to defend.windt.the duty to indemnify,however,arises only in circumstances of actual coverage if the insurance policy does not cover what is alleged in the claim,the insurer will not have a duty to indemnify based on that claim.crum forster managers resolution trust,see also sokol,at.
but these characteristics do not lead to the conclusion that the factors required to trigger the generally broader duty to defend are always required to trigger the duty to indemnify.in many circumstances,the duty to indemnify explicitly involves the duty to defend a lawsuit or its functional equivalent.in other cases,however,the duty to indemnify is separate from and independent of the duty to defend.in short,while a lawsuit may be sufficient to trigger an insurer duty to indemnify,it is not a necessary condition under illinois law.
given these conclusions,the next logical question is what is required to trigger an insurer duty to indemnify.the answer to that question is found in the language of the policies.under illinois law,construction of insurance policies is a question of law.outboard marine liberty mut.ins.policies will be construed as a whole if the words used in the policies are clear,then they must be given their plain,ordinary,and popular meaning.cilco,at citing outboard marine,at.with those principles in mind,we turn next to the wausau policies.
b.the wausau policies 
keystone purchased both general liability and excess umbrella policies from wausau beginning in and continuing through.the general liability policies cover keystone from into the the excess umbrella policies cover keystone from through.although each of the general liability and excess umbrella policies is somewhat unique,wausau used two basic insuring agreements for the general policies and two basic insuring agreements for the excess umbrella policies.
each of keystone general liability policies contains a provision requiring wausau to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of property damage.keystone concedes that under these general liability policies,wausau obligation to defend is triggered only by the filing of a suit.the term suit,under illinois law,requires the commencement of some action in a court of law before an insurer duty to defend is triggered.steel prot.mut.ins.
but,as earlier explained,the fact that wausau duty to defend does not arise unless a lawsuit is filed does not mean that wausau duty to indemnify depends on the filing of that lawsuit.in fact,the policies here support a conclusion that the duty to indemnify is separate and independent.the general liability policies grant keystone coverage for property damage so long as the liability is imposed by law and is caused by accident.the general liability policy language changed slightly,in that liability under these policies are based on an occurrence rather than on an accident.under the general liability policies,wausau pledged to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence.the policy further states that wausau shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of bodily injury or property damage and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit but wausau shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit after the applicable limit of the company liability has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements emphasis added.
to unpack that language a bit,although the general liability policies base wausau obligation to defend not illogically on the filing of a suit,the indemnity terms require wausau to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages.in addition,the indemnity terms also state that wausau shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment once the policy limits are exhausted.the disjunctive reference to claims or judgments is significant it lends some support to reasoning that a lawsuit is not necessary to trigger the duty to indemnify.if it were,the policies likely would not make a disjunctive reference to claims.
keystone excess umbrella policies likewise indicate that wausau duty to indemnify is separate from and independent of the duty to defend.the excess umbrella policies require wausau to pay on keystone behalf all sums which keystone becomes obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law.the policies define sums as the insured loss.the policies also expressly provide that defense costs for either claims or suits are covered,with expenses to be included within the definition of loss.
the excess umbrella policies require wausau to pay all sums in excess of the retained limit which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage.additionally,the policies require wausau to pay keystone defense costs once the primary coverage is exhausted for claims or suits both the and the excess umbrella policies refer to claims or suits.once again,the disjunctive or is significant.its inclusion suggests that claims are to be distinguished from suits.this language suggests that,under the excess umbrella policies,wausau duty to defend,like its duty to indemnify,may be triggered by something less than a lawsuit.
the excess umbrella policies here are fundamentally different from policies imposing a duty to defend only in the event of lawsuits.if wausau is correct that its duty to defend requires a formal suit,then the reference to claims would be mere surplusage,which is problematic.it is well settled that reviewing courts will give meaning to each term in an insurance policy.see cilco,at.there is a colorable argument,then,that the excess umbrella policies impose upon wausau a duty to defend not only in the event of lawsuits but also in the event of claims not taking the form of suits.if,under the excess umbrella policies,a lawsuit is not necessary to trigger wausau duty to defend,under a narrow reading of the duty to lawsuit certainly would not be required to trigger the duty to indemnify.
but although the potential construction of wausau duty to defend under the excess umbrella policies provides interpretative support for the conclusion that a lawsuit is also not required to trigger its duty to indemnify,the duty to defend is not directly before us.the claims in this case center on wausau duty to indemnify.because a duty to indemnify separate from and independent of a duty to defend is cognizable under illinois law and because both keystone general liability and excess umbrella policies suggest that wausau duty to indemnify is in fact based on different conditions from its duty to defend,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to wausau on the grounds that a lawsuit was necessary to trigger the duty to indemnify.
yet that does not end our inquiry.although the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend are separate and independent in keystone policies,those policies require that keystone be legally obligated to pay damages before wausau duty to indemnify attaches.understanding cilco is therefore critical to understanding the indemnification terms of the keystone policies.the cilco policies,like those at issue here,also hinged indemnification on the insured legal obligation to pay
