background 
factual overview 
ami is a delaware corporation that owns and operates hospitals and medical research facilities.for close to a decade,it and national union have been locked in this coverage dispute over a million excess directors and officers d o insurance policy.that policy supplemented a million primary d o policy ami purchased from the harbor insurance company harbor and covered losses arising from any claim against a director or officer of the corporation by reason of any wrongful act.
the events that gave rise to this dispute began in when several prospective purchasers approached ami board of directors with offers to buy the company.in order to manage the numerous bids and decide whether to accept one,ami board formed a special committee to consider a possible sale.the board appointed harold williams,a former chairman of the securities exchange commission and a member of ami board,to head the committee.
the committee conducted what amounted to a silent auction and issued guidelines for bids and a deadline for offers from interested buyers.three separate groups submitted bids.the board ultimately accepted an offer from the first boston corporation.among the losing bidders was a group headed by lee pearce,a major investor in ami and,like williams,a director.upon learning that ami had denied his bid to buy the company,pearce sold his shares and resigned from the board.
shortly thereafter,several ami shareholders filed separate class action lawsuits against williams,pearce and the other board members alleging misconduct in their handling of the sale.pearce then filed a against williams and ami,accusing williams of treating his bid with animus and of specifically designing the auction to foil his attempt to buy the company.
concerned about its potential liability,ami requested permission from both harbor and national union to use the proceeds from its respective primary and excess d o policies to settle the various suits.harbor agreed,but only with regard to the shareholders actions.citing a provision in the policy which barred coverage for claims brought by past,present or future directors or officers,it denied any obligation to cover losses stemming from pearce.
ami used the money from harbor and settled the shareholders suits for approximately million.it then released harbor from any further liability.ami continued,however,to press national union for permission to use the proceeds from its policy to settle pearce.national union steadfastly refused,noting that ami had failed to exhaust the full million of coverage from its primary policy and,in any case,that its policy,like harbor,did not cover the pearce action.
without the benefit of the policy proceeds,neither ami nor williams was able to resolve their dispute with pearce and the case went to trial.in the midst of the proceedings,however,national union stepped in and brokered an unusual settlement between pearce and williams.national union offered to pay pearce million,on the condition that pearce release williams from the suit but continue pressing his claims against ami.any amount pearce won from ami would then be deducted,dollar for dollar,from national union payment.in other words,for his release of williams,national union offered pearce a million guarantee if by settlement or verdict,pearce collected million from ami,national union would pay the other million but if pearce collected million or more,national union would pay nothing.the agreement lone qualification was that national union could refuse any settlement agreement that paid pearce less than million.
ami vehemently objected to this mary carter agreement but pearce accepted it and released his claims against williams.ami contends that williams settlement,which came in the midst of his trial testimony,amounted to a virtual confession of guilt before the jury and was devastating to ami defense.the trial nonetheless continued.while the jury deliberated,ami settled with pearce for million,well above national union million guarantee and more than enough to relieve it of any liability to pearce.
following the settlement,ami filed the instant suit against national union,alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.a jury found national union liable on both counts.though the jury awarded no damages for the breach of contract,it did award ami million for national union breach of the implied covenant.when national union appealed,this court,in an unpublished decision,affirmed the jury verdict.the supreme court,however,noting the intervening waller decision,granted certiorari and remanded the case for further consideration.national union fire ins.of pittsburgh american med.int l,d.after the district court reinstated its judgment,national union appealed once again.
b.the policy provisions 
as this case is now,in light of waller,essentially a coverage dispute,the terms of the underlying policies are of utmost importance and so we review them briefly here.as noted above,the primary harbor policy paid for losses,on behalf of the corporation 
arising from any claim or claims first made during the policy period against each and every person,jointly or severally,who was or now is or may hereafter be a director or officer of the corporation by reason of any wrongful act as hereinafter defined in their respective capacities as directors or officers of the corporation,but only when the corporation shall have indemnified the director or officer for damages,judgments,settlements,costs,charges or expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any action,suit or proceeding to which the directors or officers are a party or with which they are threatened or in connection with any appeal there from 
losses covered by the policy included any amount the corporation has paid to a director or officer as indemnity for a claim or claims against him arising out of those matters set forth in the insuring clause above whether actual or asserted the term wrongful act applied to any breach of duty,neglect,error,misstatement,misleading statement or omission by the directors or officers so alleged by any third party claimant solely by reason of their being such directors or officers.wrongful acts,however,specifically did not include any act the directors or officers are alleged to have done or attempted to prevent the acquisition of the corporation or its securities by another company ies,entity ies or individual s or any combination thereof 
several other exclusionary clauses in the harbor policy further limited its scope.of particular relevance to this case is an exclusion,which barred coverage for claims against the directors or officers brought 
by the corporation,its subsidiaries or successors or by one or more past,present or future directors or officers including their estates,beneficiaries,heirs,legal representatives,assigns or any affiliate of the company,or by any security holder of the company whether directly or derivatively except where such security holder bringing such claim is acting totally independently of,and totally without the solicitation of,or assistance of,or participation of,or intervention of,any director or officer of the company or any affiliate of the company.
national union excess policy followed all the terms and conditions of the primary harbor policy.unlike the harbor policy,however,it specifically listed ami as a named insured,and although it did not include language expressly requiring exhaustion of the harbor policy,it limited its liability to excess of provided by the primary policy.
ami was thus seeking coverage only for costs associated with pearce claims against director williams.while it had no right under the policy for coverage of its own defense against or liability in pearce suit,ami was an insured,and sought damages for losses it incurred in the pearce litigation as a result of national union alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing contained in its contract with national union.
ii.the impact of waller 
a.the waller decision 
in its earlier review of this case,this court dismissed national union appeal without considering its various coverage defenses.since that decision,however,the california supreme court holding in waller provided that where there is no coverage of any kind under an insurance contract,the insured may not hold the insurer liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.waller,cal th at,d,at.
the plaintiffs in waller,which included a corporation and its directors and officers,sought coverage under a commercial general liability cgl policy for costs they incurred in defending a suit brought by a former company.id.at,d,at.in his complaint,the alleged damages for emotional and physical distress which,according to the waller plaintiffs,triggered the insurer coverage obligations under the cgl policy.id.the california supreme court,however,held that the claims stemmed from a business dispute between the parties,and that the alleged damages were either the direct result of or derivative of an economic loss suffered by the former.id.at,d,at.since the cgl policy did not cover economic losses or injuries caused by economic losses,there was no potential for coverage and therefore no coverage for defense costs.id.thus,the court concluded,the insurer had no obligation at all to the company or to its directors and officers with respect to the suit by the former.id.at,d,at.
the california supreme court then considered whether the waller plaintiffs might nonetheless state a cause of action against their insurer for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at,d,at.it held that when the policy offered no coverage for either defense costs or indemnity,no such liability for breach of the implied covenant arose.the court observed that the implied covenant was a supplement to the express contractual covenants,to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct that frustrates the other party rights to the benefits of the agreement.id.at,d,at.without a right to coverage,the waller court concluded,there is no obligation the insurer may frustrate.the court thus refused to extend the implied covenant an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings,id.quoting love fire ins.exchange,d,and concluded that in the absence of an obligation to defend or indemnify the insurer did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at,d,d,at.
in light of the waller holding,this court earlier refusal to consider national union coverage defenses is inconsistent with california law.if national union can establish that its excess policy did not cover any losses ami might have incurred reimbursing williams in connection with pearce,then ami may not state a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.we therefore must consider whether any of those coverage defenses was valid in order to determine whether the contractual underpinnings of the implied covenant were present in this case.
b.the jury verdict 
before moving to the specific coverage defenses national union raises on this appeal,however,we first consider its contention that the jury decision not to award damages for breach of contract necessarily precludes its award for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under waller.
an insurer violates the implied covenant when it frustrates the insured efforts to collect benefits due under a policy.waller,cal th at,d,at.thus,it does not matter for purposes of liability under the implied covenant that an insurer avoids liability for breach of contract by finally making good on the policy after lengthy and unnecessary delay that injures an insured,or,as is alleged here,after taking some action concerning coverage that injures an insured.the waller court specifically so acknowledged,stating that delayed payment based on inadequate or tardy investigations,oppressive conduct by claims adjusters seeking to reduce the amounts legitimately payable and numerous other tactics may breach the implied covenant because they frustrate the insured right to receive the benefits of the contract in prompt compensation for losses.id.quoting love,d at.thus,although benefits must have been due,they need not also have been wholly denied in order for an insured to maintain a cause of action alleging bad faith.
considering the circumstances of the instant case,if,as the district court found,national union owed benefits under the excess policy,the jury was entitled to find that its initial refusal to provide coverage to williams was inconsistent with its obligations under their contract.because pearce eventually released williams from the suit,however,pursuant to the mary carter agreement,ami did not need to indemnify williams for any costs he incurred and thus could have suffered no losses covered by the policy as a result of national union refusal to provide defense or indemnity.nonetheless,assuming that benefits had been due,the jury could have found that national union initial delay,the incentives the mary carter agreement provided to pearce to continue his suit against ami,and the timing of the deal with pearce all violated the policy implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,at substantial cost to ami.
we therefore reject national union contention that the jury verdict in this case was necessarily inconsistent with the holding in waller.this case turns instead on whether the district court was correct that the excess policy covered losses ami might have incurred defending against pearce.if so,the jury finding that ami suffered no damages as a result of the breach of contract did not preclude its concurrent finding of damages for breach of the implied covenant.
iii.the coverage defenses 
national union raised four separate coverage defenses.it need win on only one,however,to prevail on this appeal.because,as explained below,we find that the exclusion to the policy barred coverage of pearce,we reverse without discussing national union other defenses.
the exclusion to the policy barred coverage for any claim brought against one or more past,present or future directors or officers,by the corporation,its subsidiaries or successors or by one or more past,present or future directors or officers.emphasis added.national union contends that this exclusion barred coverage of ami claim.
pearce,at the time he filed his,was a past director of ami,while williams,a defendant,was still on the board.on the surface,therefore,it seems that this exclusion plainly barred coverage of ami claim.ami,however,argues that pearce was not acting in his capacity as a director,either at the time he filed his suit or during the events that gave rise to it.on the contrary,throughout the sale proceedings,pearce acted as a bidder interested in acquiring the company.he was barred from all board discussions of the sale and instead received information as did any other potential buyer.consistent with his role in the bidding dispute,pearce advanced each of the allegations in his complaint related to his spurned attempt to purchase ami as an ami shareholder,or as a bidder seeking to acquire ami in the auction process.emphasis added.thus,ami contention is certainly correct that,in filing the,pearce was seeking redress for harm he suffered in his capacity as a bidder and not for harm he suffered in his capacity as a director.the question we must decide is whet
