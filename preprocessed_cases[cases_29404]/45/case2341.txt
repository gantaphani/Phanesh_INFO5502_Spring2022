two insurers shared indemnification costs to settle claims made against mutual insureds in underlying construction defect litigation brought by third parties.but one insurer defendant arch specialty insurance company arch refused to share the costs to defend the insureds in the underlying litigation.the other insurer plaintiff certain underwriters at lloyds,london underwriters paid all defense costs and now seeks equitable contribution from arch.in ruling on for summary code civ,the trial court concluded arch had no duty to defend the insureds in the underlying litigation,because arch insurance policy expressly stated it had a duty to defend provided no other insurance afforded a defense,and underwriters policy did afford a defense.underwriters appeals from summary judgment entered in favor of arch and also challenges the trial court denial of underwriters motion for summary adjudication of arch responsibility to contribute to defense costs.
we conclude arch other insurance clause can not be enforced in this equitable contribution action between successive primary insurers.enforcement of such a clause in a primary cgl policy would violate public policy.we also conclude arch did not successfully circumvent this result by including the clause in the coverage section of the insurance policy as well as the limitations section.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and direct the trial court to enter an order denying summary judgment to arch and granting underwriters for summary adjudication that underwriters is entitled to equitable contribution.on remand,the trial court will determine the amount.
facts and proceedings 
the parties assisted the trial court by agreeing to a joint stipulation of undisputed material facts.
underwriters and arch were both primary insurers of framecon,framecon but at different times.
underwriters issued a commercial general liability cgl policy to framecon effective october,to october,and another cgl policy effective october,to october.these were the only cgl policies issued to framecon for that period,and underwriters was the primary insurer for that period.the policies provided coverage for property damage only if caused by an occurrence in the coverage territory and the damage occurs during the policy period.
arch issued a cgl policy to framecon effective october,to october.that was framecon only cgl policy for that time period,and arch was the primary insurer for that year.the arch policy applied to property damage if caused by an occurrence during the policy period,whether or not such occurrence was known to the insured,and damage resulting from such occurrence first took place during the policy period.claims involving continuous or progressively deteriorating property damage alleged to have occurred throughout successive policy periods may trigger coverage by all such primary cgl policies in effect during those periods.montrose chem.admiral ins.cal th.we need not address the matter because arch does not dispute its duty to indemnify the insured in this case.
between and april,framecon entered subcontracts to do carpentry and framing work on homes being developed by kb home sacramento,and kb home north bay,collectively kb home.
in october,owners of some of those homes sued kb home for construction defects,including some defects allegedly attributable to framecon work the allen action.kb home filed a against framecon,seeking a defense and indemnity under the subcontracts.
framecon tendered the to both underwriters and arch.kb home tendered the complaint to both underwriters and arch,asserting it was an additional insured under framecon insurance policies.no one disputes that kb home qualified as an additional insured.
underwriters agreed to defend framecon with a reservation of rights.underwriters also agreed to defend kb home as an additional insured,with a reservation of rights.
in september,arch sent a letter to framecon,stating it was investigating the claim and further stating that,even if the policy afforded coverage for the claim,arch would not pay for a defense.based on the coverage terms of arch insuring agreement,in the event framecon,is already being afforded a defense in this matter by another insurer,even if coverage were found to apply,arch policy would be excess with regard to defense of framecon.the letter further noted the intent of arch policy to be excess to any other insurance providing a defense under the excess provision of the conditions section of arch insurance policy.arch sent a similar letter to kb home,invoking the other insurance provisions to deny a defense.
arch insurance policy contains two sections about the effect of other insurance on the duty to defend the coverage section and the conditions section.the coverage section provides 
coverage bodily injury and property damage liability 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that an insured becomes legally obligated to pay as tort damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we have the right and duty to defend you,the named insured,against any suit seeking tort damages provided that no other insurance affording a defense against such a suit is available to you.our duty to defend you is further limited as provided below or in the section of the policy entitled exclusions coverages a and b italics added orig.emphasis omitted.
this provision goes on to state that,in cases where arch has no duty to defend,it nevertheless has the right to intervene in any suit in which the insured requests a defense or indemnity,and we will also defend you if you are not being defended by any other insurer.
the conditions section of arch policy states 
section iv commercial general liability conditions 
other insurance,deductibles and self insured retentions 
if other insurance is available to an insured for a loss we cover under coverage a or b of this policy,our obligations are limited as follows 
excess insurance 
this insurance is excess over any other insurance,and over deductibles or amounts applicable to the loss,damage,or injury,whether such other insurance is primary,excess,contingent or contributing and whether an insured is a named insured or additional insured under said policy.
when this insurance is excess,we will have no duty under coverage a or b to defend any claim or suit that any other insurer has a duty to defend.orig.emphasis omitted.
as indicated,arch stipulates it was the primary insurer and the only cgl policy issued to framecon for the period from october to october.
in contrast to the foregoing provisions,underwriters policies stated 
coverage bodily injury and property damage liability 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages to which this insurance does not apply.we may,at our discretion,investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result 
underwriters policies also contain as an endorsement the following 
other insurance clause 
in consideration for the payment of premium,it is hereby understood and agreed that subsection.other insurance,of section iv commercial general liability conditions,is deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following 
other insurance 
coverage provided under this policy is excess over any other collectable insurance,except 
when an insured contract specifically states that this insurance shall be primary and the policy is endorsed to be primary with respect to operations performed under that insured contract then this policy will be primary only with respect to those operations,performed under such insured contract,or 
in the event that an excess or umbrella policy is purchased which lists this policy in the schedule of underlying insurance.
b.when this insurance is excess we will have no duty to defend any claim or suit covered by other collectable insurance until the obligation of such other insurance to provide a defense has been met in its entirety.
based on its other insurance provisions,arch did not provide a defense to framecon or kb home.
in october,the claims against framecon in the allen action were settled.underwriters and arch both agreed to indemnify framecon for damages covered under each of their policies on a time on the risk basis for homes completed during each carrier policy period.underwriters paid,and arch paid.
in,other homeowners in the same development filed a complaint against kb home the carter action.kb against framecon and sought a defense and indemnity as an additional insured.as with the allen action,underwriters defended framecon and kb home with a reservation of rights,while arch refused to share defense costs,invoking the other insurance language.in,all claims against framecon in the carter action were settled.underwriters and arch both agreed to indemnify framecon for damages covered under their respective policies on a time on the risk basis for homes completed during each carrier policy period.underwriters paid and arch paid on behalf of framecon.
homeowners at a different development filed suit in the lamb action.again,underwriters provided a defense to framecon and kb home,and arch refused to provide a defense based on the other insurance policy language.the lamb action settled in,with both carriers agreeing to indemnify framecon for damages.underwriters paid,and arch paid.
underwriters filed this lawsuit for declaratory relief and equitable contribution from arch for the defense costs incurred in the underlying litigation.the operative amended complaint seeks declaratory relief that arch had a duty to defend framecon in the underlying lawsuits,equitable contribution from arch to reimburse underwriters for a portion of the costs underwriters incurred to defend framecon,declaratory relief that arch had a duty to defend kb home as an additional insured,and equitable contribution from arch for underwriters costs to defend kb home.
underwriters filed a motion for summary adjudication that arch had a duty to defend the insureds in the underlying litigation.
arch filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing its other insurance provisions relieved it of any duty to defend.
the trial court denied underwriters motion for summary adjudication and granted summary judgment in favor of arch.in its written order,the trial court adopted arch use of the term exclusive defense to refer to the provisions of its policy purporting to relieve it of a duty to defend if another insurance carrier has a duty to defend.we refer to them as other insurance clauses.the trial court accepted arch reliance on one case as assertedly holding that placing the other insurance clause in the insuring agreement portion of the insurance policy defining coverage,as opposed to merely placing it in the portion of the contract,makes the other insurance clause an enforceable exception from coverage for defense costs rather than a disfavored escape clause against public policy.the trial court disregarded cases invalidating such clauses,on the grounds they assertedly involved clauses placed only in the portion of the contract or were otherwise distinguishable.
discussion 
igeneral legal principles and standard of review 
equitable contribution is the right to recover from a who shares a liability with the party seeking contribution.underwriters of interest subscribing to policy number probuilders specialty ins.th,underwriters of interest,citing north american capacity ins.claremont liability ins.th.t he right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,fireman fund.the right to seek equitable contribution is predicated on the commonsense principle that where multiple insurers or indemnitors share equal contractual liability for the primary indemnification of a loss or the discharge of an obligation,the selection of which indemnitor is to bear the loss should not be left to the often arbitrary choice of the loss claimant,and no indemnitor should have any incentive to avoid paying a just claim in the hope the claimant will obtain full payment from another coindemnitor.citations.equitable contribution thus assumes the existence of two or more valid contracts of insurance covering the particular risk of loss and the particular casualty in question.id.at.
the reciprocal rights and duties of multiple insurers who cover the same event do not arise out of contract,for their agreements are not with each other.commerce industry ins.chubb custom ins.th.their respective obligations flow from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice.since these principles do not stem from agreement between the insurers,their application is not controlled by the language of their contracts with the respective policy holders.ibid.
although equitable contribution may call for judicial discretion,here the trial court expressly stated it decided the matter as a question of law,and our review is de novo.underwriters of interest,supra,th at guideone mutual ins.utica national ins.group th.
arch had duty to defend despite other insurance provisions 
underwriters argue arch policy terms excusing it from a duty to defend when another insurer has a duty to defend are unenforceable escape clauses against public policy,regardless of their location in the insurance policy.arch does not dispute that its insurance policy required it to indemnify the insureds for the damages at issue in the construction defect litigation.and arch did pay its share of the indemnification costs.although arch insurance policy afforded coverage for this risk,arch maintains its policy did not afford coverage for defense costs related to this risk,because arch included the other insurance language in the coverage section of its policy.we conclude underwriters has the better argument.
the original purpose of other insurance clauses was to prevent multiple recovery by insureds in cases of overlapping policies providing coverage for the same loss.dart industries,commercial union ins.cal th,dart.on the other hand,other insurance clauses that attempt to shift the burden away from one primary italics added insurer wholly or largely to other insurers have been the objects of judicial distrust.p ublic policy disfavors escape clauses,whereby coverage purports to evaporate in the presence of other insurance.citations.this disfavor should also apply,to a lesser extent,to clauses,by which carriers seek exculpation whenever the loss falls within another carrier policy limit.citations.partly for this reason,the modern trend is to require equitable contributions on a pro rata basis from all primary insurers regardless of the type of other insurance clause in their policies.citations.ibid.dart rejected a primary insurer contention that its obligations were cancelled by the insured inability to prove the type of clause in the lost contract.even if the primary insurer had a null and void with excess clause,that would merely entitle the primary insurer to seek contribution from other insurers it would not affect its obligation to its insured.id.at.
arch does not dispute that its policy was primary,not excess.primary coverage is insurance coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches immediately upon the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to liability.citation.primary insurers generally have the primary duty of defense.excess or secondary coverage is coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches only after a predetermined amount of primary coverage has been exhausted.citation.century surety united pacific ins.th,century,italics omitted.
in century,an insured subcontractor tendered defense of a lawsuit to four successive cgl insurers that provided coverage over a period.three insurers accepted the tender and ultimately settled the suit,but the fourth insurer century refused to provide a defense on the ground its policy contained an other insurance clause that if other valid and collectible insurance is available to any insured for a loss we cover under coverage a or b of this coverage part,then this insurance is excess of such insurance and we will have no duty to defend any claim or suit that any other insurer has a duty to defend.id.th at.the other carriers policies stated that,if other primary insurance applied,costs would be shared.id at.in century declaratory relief action,the appellate court held century was required to contribute.century contract was the only policy that expressly provided the insured with coverage during that part of the period.since the underlying suit involved continuing loss liability,there were multiple insurers involved.but century was not a true excess or secondary insurer,but rather was one of the primary insurers on the claim.id.at.
e xcess insurance is insurance that is expressly understood by both the insurer and insured to be secondary to specific underlying coverage which will not begin until after that underlying coverage is exhausted and which does not broaden that underlying coverage.citation.that is not the kind of excess insurance involved in this case.the excess insurance problem before us arises when one insurer attempts,through the use of a other insurance clause,to reduce a primary coverage obligation into a more limited excess liability.insurance policies commonly include other insurance provisions which attempt to limit the insurer liability to the extent that other insurance covers the same risk.citation.one subcategory is known as pro rata provisions,which look to limit the insurer liability to the total proportion that its policy limits bear to the total coverage available to the insured.citation.there is another subcategory known as excess only clauses,which require the exhaustion of other insurance in effect,this insurer does not provide primary coverage but only acts as an excess insurer.citation.a final subcategory of escape clauses extinguishes the insurer liability if the loss is covered by other insurance.citations.citation.century,supra,th at,orig.italics.
escape clauses came to be so named because they permit an insurer to make a seemingly ironclad guarantee of coverage,only to withdraw that coverage and thus escape liability in the presence of other insurance.citation.when excess only clauses are found in primary italics added liability policies,they are treated the same way as escape clauses.citations.because these types of provisions are disfavored,courts have developed a method of overriding them when two or more applicable policies contain such clauses,both liability and the costs of defense should ordinarily be prorated according to the amount of coverage afforded.citation.the reason for this rule is that the conflicting provisions are deemed essentially irreconcilable if given effect competing clauses would strand an insured between insurers disclaiming coverage courts have found for the pro rata solution when confronted by a variety of conflicts between differing types of other insurance provisions a predicate for prorating policies with conflicting other insurance provisions is that the policies operate on the same level of coverage,that is to say,two or more policies apply to the same damage or loss suffered by the same party.citations.put another way,an other insurance dispute can only arise between carriers on the same level,it can not arise between excess and primary insurers.citation.century,supra,th at.
in travelers casualty surety century surety th travelers,century issued a primary cgl policy to a framing contractor,containing an endorsement that if other insurance was available for a loss covered by the century policy,century policy would be excess of such insurance,and century would have no duty to defend any claim that the other insurer had a duty to defend.id.at.home buyers sued the contractor,alleging continuing damage to their properties from defective construction work.century declined to provide a defense because travelers which had issued cgl policies for prior years provided a defense under a policy calling for sharing costs with any other primary insurer.ibid.the appellate court held travelers was entitled to equitable contribution from century for defense and indemnification costs.the court said the insured had no other liability insurance during the time that century policy was in effect.both carriers policies covered the same type of loss but had conflicting other insurance clauses.giving effect to century clause,which was in the nature of an escape clause,would result in imposing on travelers a burden of shouldering that portion of a continuing loss attributable to the time when century was the only liability insurer covering the insured.id.at.
here,arch persuaded the trial court and argues on appeal that the california cases invalidating other insurance clauses are distinguishable because the clauses in those cases were located only in the conditions section of the insurance policies,not in the coverage section.however,even assuming the clauses in the california cases relied upon by underwriters were located in the exclusions section rather than the coverage section of the policies,none of the cases discussed or decided that the location mattered.underwriters did cite one federal district court case usf ins.clarendon am.ins.d usf which declined to enforce an other insurance clause that was located in the coverage section of an insurance policy.there,however,the same clause appeared in the coverage section of the other insurers policies.id.at identical provisions in the policies are mutually irreconcilable.here,the clauses were not identical,and we therefore do not rely on usf.
arch invokes general principles that an insurer duty to defend is not absolute but is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy rosen nations title ins.th,no duty to defend because loss was not covered under the policy,that limitations on a promised defense duty must be conspicuous,plain,and clear maryland casualty nationwide ins.th,subcontractor insurer had duty to defend contractor as additional insured despite policy language that the insurance applied only to the extent the contractor was held liable for subcontractor conduct,and that coverage under an insurance policy is determined in the first instance by referring to the policy insuring agreement,which defines the risk undertaken by the insurer.delaware continental land title th,title policy failure to disclose conditional use permit came within insuring clause affording coverage against loss sustained by reason of any encumbrance on the property and was not expressly excluded under any policy exclusions.
however,none of these general principles answer the more specific public policy questions presented in this case.
while this appeal was pending,the fourth appellate district published underwriters of interest,supra,th,which held unenforceable an other insurance clause purporting to relieve a primary insurer probuilders of its duty to defend,despite clearly having a duty to indemnify.probuilders contributed toward the indemnification costs in the construction defect case against the insured contractor but resisted defense costs,based on its clause that probuilders had the duty to defend against any suit seeking damages to which the insurance applied provided that no other insurance affording a defense against such a suit is available to you.id.at.the plaintiff policy said it would be excess over any other primary insurance available to the contractor as an additional insured.id.at,fn.the courts have repeatedly addressed and rejected arguments by insurers that an other insurance cla
