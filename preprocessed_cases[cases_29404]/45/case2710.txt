after a court trial,defendants steven thompson,aster,and the corporations they had formed were found to have violated insurance code section,subdivision b,by submitting fraudulent claims for compensation proscribed by penal code section.on appeal,defendants contend that the case should have been dismissed because it belonged exclusively in a workers compensation forum,the people failed to meet the statutory prerequisites for bringing the lawsuit,and defendants conduct was not unlawful.defendants further contend that the trial court should have applied a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof,that joint and several liability was inappropriate on the facts of the case,and that the damages imposed were unauthorized and excessive.we find no error and affirm the judgment.
procedural history 
the people initiated this action against defendants for restitution,civil penalties,and an injunction under insurance code section of the insurance frauds prevention act and under business professions code section,et.the people alleged that the individual thompson his wife,aster charles salzberg,joseph greenspan,and julius mueller,participated in a scheme in which they submitted false claims for workers compensation payments from relator monterey mushrooms,a employer according to the complaint,thompson,who had been convicted in of seven counts of filing false workers compensation claims,subd.a,had organized two corporations,peninsula medical group,pmg,and integrated family medical group,ifmg,using salzberg and greenspan,respectively,as medical directors.contrary to laws governing the structure of medical corporations and medical practice,these physicians exercised absolutely no control,supervision or management of the corporations they purported to own and operate.meanwhile,thompson and represented these corporations and their affiliated clinics to the public and to monterey mushrooms as providers of medical services.in billing for treatment of monterey mushrooms employees,defendants prepared fraudulent claims for workers compensation payments for unnecessary and excessive chiropractic treatment,frequently submitting at least two,and often three separate claim forms for a single patient visit.meanwhile,thompson and maintained control of pmg and ifmg,respectively,through their management corporation,nevada practice management systems,in order to siphon off the profits earned by pmg and ifmg.
defendants demurred,asserting lack of jurisdiction and collateral estoppel.they argued that insurance code section,subdivision h a,barred the action the workers compensation appeals board wcab had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims asserted and the issue of entitlement to benefits as to one employee had already been decided by the wcab,and therefore the issue as to any employee was precluded by collateral estoppel.
the trial court overruled the demurrers,and defendants answered.both sides then moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication.the court denied summary judgment but limited plaintiff claims to insurance code section,subdivision b.the cause of action for violation of business and professions code section was determined to be preempted by the workers compensation act wca.
a court trial on liability took place between september and.the court granted nonsuit in favor of mueller,and both greenspan and salzberg settled with plaintiff.however,thompson,and the corporate defendants were found to be liable for having set up sham corporations,with medical doctors as ostensible owners,that presented to the public as medical clinics.in reality,the medical doctors were essentially a series of absentee figureheads who gave no consideration for their ownership interests and,for the most part,had no meaningful role in the direction of patient care or general clinic operation.the purpose of these corporations was to allow these defendants to acquire patients and refer them for chiropractic treatment and to present fraudulent claims for services to payors.the result was that patients were inevitably being directed to chiropractic treatment,where they were grossly over treated.bills were generated for these patient visits,and in some cases more than one claim was made for a single session.the court found this to be a sophisticated,formalized and strategy that enabled thompson and to maximize the number of patients and the amount that could be billed for visits,without due regard for patient care and needs.
trial on the remedies portion of the litigation was held on november.on december,the court ruled that the thompson defendants were jointly and severally liable for civil penalties in the amount of.the court also granted plaintiff request for injunctive relief and subsequently awarded plaintiff attorney fees in the amount of.
discussion 
workers compensation as an exclusive remedy 
citing labor code sections,and,defendants first renew their argument that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over this lawsuit because all of the issues of alleged billing fraud arose from a workers compensation claim and had to be resolved by the wcab defendants rely on charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d,vacanti,where the supreme court set forth a analysis to help determine whether a cause of action is barred by the exclusivity of the wca.a court is called upon first to determine whether the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.vacanti,at,d.if the injury is collateral to or derivative of a personal injury sustained and arising out of the course of employment,then a cause of action arising from that injury may be subject to the exclusivity bar.id.at,d.secondly,the court will consider whether the alleged acts or motives that establish the elements of the cause of action fall outside the risks encompassed within the compensation bargain.id.at,d.where the acts are a normal part of the employment relationship citation,or workers compensation claims process citation,or where the motive behind these acts does not violate a fundamental policy of this state citation,then the cause of action is barred by the exclusivity provisions of the wca.id.at,d.as we will explain,however,vacanti does not bar the present action brought under the insurance frauds prevention act.
defendants maintain that this case amounted to a billing overcharge dispute that had to be litigated within the confines of the workers compensation system.in their view,this case proved nothing more,than that the plaintiff was unhappy with the defendants billing practices.defendants point out that labor code section,subdivision d,already provides for civil penalties for fraudulent claims but in that provision the legislature expressly acknowledged that other penalties may exist,and it stated that the penalty set forth in subdivision d may be imposed in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law.and in subdivision a of labor code section the legislature expressly recognized that the conduct prohibited by this section is,for the most part,already subject to criminal penalties pursuant to other provisions of law.
the application of insurance code section,subdivision b,was clearly authorized in this case.as the trial court recognized,this statute was intended to encompass fraudulent claims for workers compensation benefits.it specifically provides for civil penalties for claims for compensation under labor code section,which is part of the wca indeed,in enacting the insurance frauds prevention act,the legislature clearly expressed its intent to promote the investigation and prosecution of insurance fraud,including workers compensation fraud,which harms employers by contributing to the increasingly high cost of workers compensation insurance and and harms employees by undermining the perceived legitimacy of all workers compensation claims,subd.d.prevention of workers compensation insurance fraud may reduce the number of workers compensation claims and claim payments thereby producing a commensurate reduction in workers compensation costs.prevention of workers compensation insurance fraud will assist in restoring confidence and faith in the workers compensation system,and will facilitate expedient and full compensation for employees injured at the workplace,subd.e.lest there be any residual confusion over the authority to proceed,insurance code section,subdivision k,makes it clear that the remedies it provides are in addition to any other remedies provided by existing law.
furthermore,penal code section,on which the insurance code section allegations were predicated in this case,prohibits the knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment of health care benefits.the statute specifically defines a claim for payment of a health care benefit to include a claim for payment submitted by or on the behalf of a provider of any workers compensation health benefits under the labor code,subd.a.
the express inclusion of workers compensation claims thus demonstrates the legislature intention to allow civil actions under insurance code section arising from fraudulent acts made unlawful by penal code section,notwithstanding applicability of the wca.none of the cases cited by defendants compels or suggests a different conclusion.we therefore agree with the trial court conclusion that the exclusivity provisions of the wca did not bar this action.
res judicata 
at trial defendants relied on the theory that all of the treatment and charges targeted by the people lawsuit had already been found reasonable and necessary by the wcab.defendants asked the court to enter a finding consistent with that result.the people responded that in this context the conduct could not be considered reasonable and necessary if the treatment and billing had been performed by an illegal medical corporation.the trial court agreed with the people that collateral estoppel did not apply,as this case was based on insurance code section,and t he workers compensation board did not have before it the broad pattern of conduct that is alleged here.subsequently the court declined defendants request to admit workers compensation records of four patients showing the issues that were presented to,or could have been presented to the work ers compensation court that the court actually decided,or that the court could have decided,had they been argued in those cases.
on appeal,defendants contend that the principles of res judicata preclude this action because monterey mushrooms had already litigated the claims of patients treated at the thompson clinics and those claims had been decided in a workers compensation forum.beyond this vague assertion defendants do not explain how the court erred in rejecting a res judicata defense on the facts of this case.they have not supplied pertinent authority,record references,or reasoning to show that these were the same causes of action that were addressed in the wcab proceedings.their claim that plaintiff was entitled to one,and only one,remedy for its alleged injuries,and to one judgment is not helpful,as this action involved a different plaintiff seeking a different remedy under a different statutory scheme.
as to collateral estoppel,defendants do not address the requirements for establishing this theory or even acknowledge the distinction between the claim preclusion and issue preclusion aspects of res judicata they complain about the trial court exclusion of the patient records,but they fail to argue,much less show,how the evidentiary ruling constituted an abuse of discretion,nor do they discuss how those records would have established not just the substantial,but the complete,likeness of the issues litigated in the workers compensation proceedings.the action was properly allowed to go forward notwithstanding defendants assertions of res judicata.
among the motions in limine presented by the parties was a defense request for an order of abatement,based on the pendency of two claims then pending in workers compensation proceedings.the trial court eventually denied the request.on appeal,defendants argue that abatement was called for here,as the wcab had long since acquired jurisdiction over every case described by the complaint,and it was empowered to dispose of an entire controversy.
this argument must be rejected for the same reasons that pertain to defendants theory of res judicata.this was a different controversy involving different alleged wrongs which were prosecuted in accordance with a different statutory authority.defendants have failed to show that abatement was required or even appropriate in these procedural circumstances,or that they would have obtained a more favorable disposition of this action had their abatement request been granted.see plant insulation fibreboard d.abatement not appropriate where the first action can not provide the relief sought in the second people ex rel.garamendi american autoplan,th,d trial court error in determining application of the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction is reversible only where the error results in a miscarriage of justice or prejudice to the party asserting the rule.
jurisdiction under insurance code section,subdivision h 
defendants further contend that this action was unauthorized under the insurance frauds prevention act because its strict requirements for jurisdiction were not met.insurance code section,subdivision h a,on which defendants rely,states that a court has no jurisdiction over an action brought under that section if the action is based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in a legislative or administrative report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.italics added.defendants argue that this action was beyond the trial court jurisdiction because it was derived from the public records of workers compensation proceedings,publicly disclosed information in patient treatment records,or publicly disclosed transactions involving the corporate defendants.
the trial court ruled that monterey mushrooms was an original source of the information on which this case is based.the term original source as used in insurance code section,subdivision h a,means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the district attorney or commissioner before filing an action under this section which is based on the information,subd.h b.defendants fail to point to anything in the record that refutes or even acknowledges the trial court factual finding that monterey mushrooms had direct and independent knowledge of the defendants conduct and therefore met the jurisdictional threshold of the statute as an original source.
defendants opposition to the court assumption of jurisdiction resembles that of the defendants in people ex rel.allstate ins.weitzman,supra,th,d.there,construing the same provision at issue here,the second appellate district,division five,held that the relator,allstate insurance company,had surmounted the jurisdictional bar of subdivision h and could be deemed an original source of the information leading to its allegations of insurance fraud.the court discerned the purpose of this provision to be to prevent qui tam actions brought by persons who,like the relator in ex rel.marcus hess,simply copied allegations from a criminal indictment on file,learned of the specific fraudulent conduct at issue through public channels,and had not contributed or assisted in a material way in exposing the fraud.citations.the california legislature,in adopting subdivision h,intended to bar parasitic or opportunistic actions by persons simply taking advantage of public information without contributing to or assisting in the exposure of the fraud.id.at.allstate had not simply taken advantage of publicly disclosed information from another insurer prior lawsuit it met the legislative goal of encouraging insurers to help combat insurance fraud by conducting its own investigation and expending its own resources to expose hundreds of fraudulent insurance claims.id.at.although the public disclosure of the fraud ring at issue may have prompted allstate to investigate whether it had been a target of the fraud,it was only through allstate own considerable efforts that the facts specific to frauds perpetrated on it came to light.id.at.to bar allstate from the action would be contrary to the legislative goal of encouraging insurers to participate in the battle against automobile insurance fraud by bringing section actions would undermine the legislative intent that insurers assist in the prevention,identification,investigation,and prosecution of automobile insurance fraud and would diminish realization of the legislative goal of coordinated efforts by law enforcement agencies and insurers to deal with the serious and prevalent insurance fraud problem.id.at.city of hawthorne ex rel.wohlner h c disposal th,d applying similar provision in california false claims act.
in their reply brief,defendants illogically and irrelevantly argue that monterey mushrooms can not be deemed a relator because it is not an individual and only an individual can be an original source.correspondingly,only an original source can be a relator.as this point was not urged in their opening brief and was only indirectly and unnecessarily addressed by the people,we need not consider it.we parenthetically observe,however,as did the trial court,that the legislature specifically designated an insurer as a person bringing the action under insurance code section,subd.e.in our view,to construe original source to be solely a human individual would render meaningless the condition that the person bringing the action be an original source of the information,subd.h a.although the question was not raised in weitzman,the implicit premise of its holding was that an insurance company can be deemed an original source even though it is not a live person.
defendants thus offer no reason to reach a different result in this case.we conclude,therefore,that the trial court correctly applied insurance code section,subdivision h,consistently with the purpose of the provision and the facts before it,to find that it had jurisdiction to rule on the allegations against defendants.
legal basis for liability 
defendants next contend that the complaint should have been dismissed because plaintiff failed to show that defendants knowingly presented false or fraudulent claims.according to defendants,the corporations code does not mandate any specific method of billing or form for use in submitting a health provider invoice.the only restriction that applied to them,they insist,was the limitation on the number of shares they could own,as set forth in corporations code section 
in making this argument defendants ignore the essence of the allegations against them.they were charged not merely with corporate procedural irregularities,but with serious violations of penal code section,which the trial court found true.defendants fail to address these elements except to protest,contrary to the trial judge factual findings,that plaintiff failed to prove intent to deceive because defendants conduct was legal.they also assert,again contrary to the verdict and without acknowledging the standard of review on appeal,that the uncontroverted evidence showed that the physicians affiliated with the medical corporations delivered medical services of all kinds at the clinics,though without question the offices specialized in the type of complaint.having generated a straw man argument instead of accurately citing the pertinent facts and applicable law,defendants provide no basis for finding error based on the allowable billing methods,style of business operation,and delivery of medical services at their clinics.
corporate control 
defendants further argue that plaintiff failed to establish that california law requires a particular system of control over the daily operation of a medical corporation.the corporations code,they claim,does not proscribe sic rules for operation of an corporation.defendants also maintain that plaintiff failed to introduce evidence that the medical treatment of any of the patients involved in the case was at all affected by the control systems that in fact were used at peninsula medical group.
their assertion is supported by neither citation to pertinent authority nor the facts found true by the trial court.as in the previous argument,defendants fail even to acknowledge the substantial evidence rule.only in their reply brief do they attempt to challenge the adequacy of plaintiff proof.this belated effort,however,does not comport with this court function on review it consists of rhetorical challenges to the plaintiff representation of the facts and presents a slanted account of the evidence more appropriate in a closing argument to the trier of fact.nwosu uba th,d attack on the evidence without a fair statement of the evidence is entitled to no consideration when substantial amount of evidence was received on behalf of the respondent.were we to address defendants untimely argument on the merits in accordance with the proper standard of review we would nonetheless conclude,having examined the extensive testimony and exhibits in the record,that substantial evidence supported the factual findings of the trial court.
liability of nontreating defendants 
defendants next contend that and ifmg should have been dismissed as defendants because they had not treated any of the patients who were identified in the complaint.again they ignore the allegations,the evidence presented,and the trial court findings.this case was not merely about the submission of false or excessive treatment claims regarding specific employees it embraced an entire scheme in which,on her own and through ifmg,helped defraud monterey mushrooms,the workers compensation system,and the public.the trial testimony and documentary evidence convinced the trial court as fact finder that and her husband had set up illegal corporate medical practices,affecting not just a single patient or employer or even solely patients with industrial injuries.they gave physicians ostensible ownership of these corporations while retaining full control over the structure,finances,and operation of each corporation,including patient care.they managed to deceive the secretary of state and the medical board by representing that pmg and ifmg would be engaged in the practice of medicine and then portrayed these entities as medical clinics to the public,to insurers,and to the wcab.
it is clear from the record that was an active part of the conspiracy enabling them to achieve these objectives through pmg,ifmg,and nevada practice management systems,their management service or shell corporation.defendants do not mount a challenge asserting insufficient evidence to support this factual conclusion.because their argument is premised on a version of the facts that is inconsistent with the evidence and findings of the court,it must be rejected.
standard of proof 
echoing a motion in limine made by mueller and their own motion for a new trial,defendants contend that the trial court should have applied a higher standard of proof,that of clear and convincing evidence.we disagree.evidence code section,which describes the applicable burdens of proof states except as otherwise provided by law,the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.see conservatorship of wendland cal th,d,default standard of proof in civil cases is preponderance of the evidence.generally,a higher burden of proof applies only where particularly important individual interests or rights,which are more substantial than the loss of money,are at stake.citations.thus,for example,the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof has been applied where constitutional due process rights or important general public policy considerations are implicated.baxter healthcare denton th,d.
defendants suggest no,decisional,or imposes a burden to show liability under insurance code section by clear and convincing evidence.they cite liodas sahadi cal d,but only for the observation that statutory exceptions may elevate the standard for civil fraud from preponderance of the evidence.defendants merely assert that insurance code section,subdivision b,is
