the question presented is whether an insurance company owes a duty to defend its insured,under a commercial general liability cgl policy,against a suit brought by employees of another business,which has a subcontracting relationship to the insured,alleging assorted labor violations as well as a cause of action for false imprisonment.the insurance company argues there is no duty to defend because the cgl policy includes an exclusion for claims.the parties filed for summary adjudication.the trial court ruled in favor of and granted judgment for the insurance company.we will reverse.
facts and proceedings 
north american building maintenance,nabm,which has its principal place of business in fresno,provides commercial janitorial services to other companies throughout california.one such company was target stores,operated by the target corporation,target,with which nabm had a floor maintenance service agreement starting december,and continuing until target cancelled the agreement on august.nabm,in turn,subcontracted with california building management services cbms to perform the actual work at individual target stores,including those in santa barbara county.it was employees of cbms who brought the underlying lawsuit against nabm and,as well,target and others.
the santa barbara complaint 
in september of,three former janitorial workers at a target store in santa barbara filed a first amended class action complaint for damages and injunctive relief the santa barbara action against target,dayton hudson identified as target parent company,and north american building maintenance,california building management services.the complaint,which asserted causes of action,alleged generally that the defendants had failed to pay janitorial workers the promised hourly wage pay them for all the hours they worked they had failed to give the workers an accurate report of their hours and wages they had failed to provide workers with required meal breaks and they had falsely imprisoned workers by locking them inside the stores at night while they were working,and sometimes after their shifts had ended.
in paragraph,the complaint in the santa barbara action alleged that 
w hile working for defendants,plaintiffs were frequently locked in the business premises without exit keys and without a exit available and against their will.defendants demanded,as a condition of work and employment,and without notification prior to employment,that plaintiffs remain locked in the store where they were performing their janitorial services,throughout their entire work shifts,against their will,and kept plaintiffs locked in the facility even after the janitors work shifts had ended,until an agent of the defendant arrived with a key or otherwise unilaterally decided acted sic to release the janitor crew from the store premises.
nabm tendered defense in the santa barbara action to the fireman fund insurance company fireman fund,on the theory there was potential liability and,thus,the potential right to indemnification and a duty to defend on the false imprisonment claim.fireman fund denied it had any duty to defend nabm on any cause of action,including the alleged false imprisonment 
the insurance policy 
nabm had a cgl policy cg with fireman fund covering the period from february,to february,coverage b in the policy applied to nabm liability for personal and advertising injury as opposed to bodily injury and property damage liability in coverage a,and it provided in part as follows the boldfaced terms were defined elsewhere in the policy 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal and advertising injury to which this insurance part applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for personal and advertising injury to which this insurance does not apply 
b.this insurance applies to personal and advertising injury caused by an offense arising out of your business but only if the offense was committed in the coverage territory during the policy period.
exclusions 
this insurance does not apply to 
personal and advertising injury 
caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict personal and advertising injury 
for which the insured has assumed liability in a contract or agreement.this exclusion does not apply to liability for damages that the insured would have in the absence of the contract or agreement.italics added.
personal and advertising injury was defined in the policy as follows 
personal and advertising injury means injury,including consequential bodily injury,arising out of one or more of the following offenses 
false arrest,detention or imprisonment 
malicious prosecution or abuse of process 
c.the wrongful eviction from,wrongful entry into,or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room,dwelling or premises that a person occupies,committed by or on behalf of its owner,landlord or lessor

oral,written,televised or videotaped publication of material that violates a person right of privacy 
f.the use of another advertising idea in your advertisement or 
infringing upon another copyright,trade dress,trademark or slogan in your advertisement.
discrimination.
the policy coverage exclusions relating to coverage for personal and advertising injury were supplemented by an practices liability exclusion epl exclusion set out in an endorsement cg.that exclusion provided 
b.the following exclusion is added to paragraph,exclusions of section and advertising injury liability 
this insurance does not apply to 
personal and advertising injury to 
a person arising out of any 
a refusal to employ that person 
b termination of that person employment or 
c practices,policies,acts or omissions,such as coercion,demotion,evaluation,reassignment,discipline,defamation,harassment,humiliation or discrimination directed at that person or 
the spouse,child,parent,brother or sister of that person as a consequence of personal and advertising injury to that person at whom any of the practices described in paragraphs a,b,or c above is directed.
this exclusion applies 
whether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity and 
to any obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury.
the policy also included an practices liability endorsement epl endorsement ep providing coverage for wrongful employment practices very similar to the practices specifically excluded from the policy personal and advertising injury liability coverage by the epl exclusion the epl endorsement provided coverage for claims made against the insured during the policy period or during an extended reporting period if the insured had elected to purchase one.nabm had not purchased such an extension,and the santa barbara action was filed after the policy expired.
the refusal to defend 
the refusal by fireman fund to defend nabm was based principally on the epl exclusion.in a letter rejecting nabm tender offer,fireman fund stated 
all of the causes of action in the santa barbara action,including the false imprisonment claim,are specifically alleged to arise out of employment related practices,policies,acts or omissions.thus,the exclusion applies to all of them.it is also noteworthy that this exclusion applies whether the insured is liable as an employer or in any other capacity.thus,whether this exclusion is applied to nabm or target were it an insured,coverage would be excluded.
nabm argued the epl exclusion did not apply.in a letter to the attorney for fireman fund,nabm attorney asserted t he epl exclusion only applies to nabm employees.the named plaintiffs in the santa barbara action are actually employees of an independent contractor,california building management services cbms.that is the reason plaintiffs amended their complaint.cbms is not a dba of nabm as alleged in the previous pleadings.they are two separate companies.
the complaint 
on october,nabm filed the present action against fireman fund for breach of contract,insurance bad faith,unfair business practices,and declaratory relief.
fireman fund answered the complaint on november.
the motions for summary adjudication 
on march,nabm and fireman fund each filed a motion for summary adjudication as to nabm claims for breach of contract and declaratory relief,limited to the question whether fireman fund had a duty to defend nabm in the santa barbara action against the claim for false imprisonment irrespective of any duty to indemnify the parties respective positions looked again to the applicability of the epl exclusion and the question whether the exclusion for practices applied to claims brought by persons who were not nabm employees.
the parties submitted a joint statement of undisputed facts while each reserved the right to argue some of the facts were irrelevant or immaterial.they agreed that the plaintiffs in the santa barbara action worked for cbms rather than nabm,that cbms was an independent contractor hired by nabm,and that nabm was not a dba of cbms or vice versa.
the competing motions came to a hearing on july.
the trial court order 
the trial court issued a written order on september,granting the summary adjudication motion by fireman fund and denying the one by nabm.the court explained 
fireman fund argues that because the claim of false imprisonment would not be covered if the santa barbara action plaintiffs were clearly nabm employees,the fact that nabm claims that the plaintiffs allegations are false should not trigger coverage of claims that,if true,would not be covered.as fireman fund notes,there would be no other basis for finding nabm liable to the santa barbara action plaintiffs other than the intentionally ambiguous employment relationship.
nabm claims the language whether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity must reasonably be restricted to situations where the insured is a potential an actual employer,while fireman fund argues,in the court view more reasonably,that this language was intended to include vicarious liability in joint employment or contractor situations.
given that neither party has introduced any facts to show any other basis on which nabm could potentially be liable to the santa barbara action plaintiffs other than as an employer or,it appears there is no potential liability because the only pleaded or plausible liability is as an employer or as one obliged to repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury.
the court then concluded 
based upon the foregoing,the court denies summary adjudication to nabm as to the first and fourth causes of action for breach of contract and declaratory relief,respectively,and grants summary adjudication to fireman fund,since the unambiguous language of the epl exclusion bars coverage if any listed personal injury arose out of employment related practices.the court finds,as a matter of law,that any alleged false imprisonment arose out of an employment practice,and if nabm only defense is that it was not the employer,that would not trigger any duty on the part of fireman fund,since nabm only possible liability would be as an employer.
judgment in favor of fireman fund was entered on october.fireman fund served notice of entry of judgment on october.nabm filed a timely notice of appeal on december.
discussion 
the duty to defend 
it has long been a fundamental rule of law that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller.
the insurer must defend any claim that would be covered if it were true,even if in fact it is groundless,false,or fraudulent.gray zurich insurance cal d,gray.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.horace mann,supra,cal th at,d.
t he determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint will give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.citations.conversely,where the extrinsic facts eliminate the potential for coverage,the insurer may decline to defend even when the bare allegations in the complaint suggest potential liability.citations.this is because the duty to defend,although broad,is not unlimited it is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy.citations.waller,supra,cal th at,d.
stated in another way,the insurer need not defend if the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose.thus,when the duty to defend is the subject of an action for declaratory relief,the parties have differing burdens.
to prevail,the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage,while the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.in other words,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.facts merely tending to show that the claim is not covered,or may not be covered,but that are insufficient to eliminate the possibility that resultant damages or the nature of the action will fall within the scope of coverage,therefore add no weight to the scales.any seeming disparity in the respective burdens merely reflects the substantive law.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.
further,in determining whether a potential for coverage is present,potential amendments to the third party complaint must be considered.as stated in montrose,supra,cal th,d,the insured is entitled to a defense if the underlying complaint alleges the insured liability for damages potentially covered under the policy,or if the complaint might be amended to give rise to a liability that would be covered under the policy.id.at,d,citing gray,supra,cal d at.
it follows that,in a summary judgment proceeding,an insurer may prevail only upon a showing that eliminates any potential for coverage under the policy as a matter of law.maryland casualty national american ins.th,d.
the epl exclusion 
as we have said,the present dispute focuses on the epl exclusion insofar as it precludes coverage for claims that otherwise would fall within the insuring agreement for personal and advertising injury.see waller,supra,cal th at,d,cgl policy has two essential parts an insuring agreement that identifies covered risks,and exclusions that remove coverage for some such risks.the parties thus seem to agree as a threshold matter that the false imprisonment allegation in the santa barbara action comes within the insuring agreement.see ibid.risks not covered in first instance need not be specifically excluded initial burden is on insured to show claim is within scope of coverage,then on insurer to show exclusion applies.
nabm argues the exclusion does not apply because the plaintiffs in the santa barbara action were not nabm employees fireman fund argues this fact is immaterial.we will agree with nabm.
a.did the trial court misapply the law regarding potential coverage 
nabm begins by challenging what it claims was a finding by the trial court that,notwithstanding undisputed facts to the contrary,the santa barbara action plaintiffs actually were employed by nabm.this assertion is based on the following excerpt from the trial court order 
here,the santa barbara action plaintiffs have alleged that nabm exerted significant control over them,but nabm denies this and fireman fund appears to concede,without any reference to an investigation concerning this factual issue,that nabm is not the employer.however as noted above,that does not necessarily mean that
