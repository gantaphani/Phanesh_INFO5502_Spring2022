darlene kerns appeals from summary judgment entered in favor of respondent cse insurance group upon the latter motion pursuant to code of civil procedure section and the denial of her for summary judgment.appellant,the assignee of respondent insureds,had filed suit to enforce respondent alleged duty to defend its insureds in a personal injury lawsuit.at issue on this appeal are the following contentions a the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by entertaining and ruling on respondent motion for summary judgment when a different judge had previously denied the identical motion and the renewed motion was in violation of the controlling procedural requirements set forth in section b the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that there was no potential for coverage under respondent policy and thus no duty to defend the insureds,appellant assignors and c the undisputed facts demonstrate that appellant herself was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of respondent duty to defend.
on the procedural and factual record presented,we conclude that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining respondent renewed motion for summary judgment,because in so doing it violated the exclusive and controlling procedural prerequisites set by section for the reconsideration or renewal of a previously denied motion.the trial court left unaddressed and undecided important triable issues of material fact on the basis of which summary judgment had previously been denied.for these reasons,we must reverse.
factual and procedural background 
on february,respondent issued a personal homeowners policy the policy to,effective for the policy period from january,to january.in the portion dealing with coverage for personal liability,the policy specified that respondent would defend and indemnify claims made against the insured on account of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence.the policy specifically defined occurrence as an accident,including continuous and repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,which results,during the policy period,in bodily injury or property damage.the specified limit of liability on coverage for all damages resulting from any one occurrence was,regardless of the number of insureds,claims made or persons injured.among the standard endorsements expressly incorporated in the policy were exclusions from liability coverage for a any bodily injury which is expected or intended by an insured or which is the forseeable sic result of an act or ommission sic intended by an insured and any illegal act commited sic by or at the direction of an insured.
in the early morning hours of march,daughter,was arrested for vandalizing a house with a crowbar.when searched by a contra costa county deputy sheriff,she was found in possession of two hypodermic syringes.she was released to the custody of her father.approximately two hours later,she broke a window of appellant house and entered.according to own deposition testimony,she had been using c rank,or methamphetamine,for at least two months,and found it addicting.at the time of the incident she was feeling temporarily schiz,paranoid,and was hearing voices,as she had for some t wo months or so.even when she made a conscious attempt to stop using crank,she continued to hear voices and have visual and auditory hallucinations.appellant had some plants and stuff hanging.when heard the hanging plants,s omething triggered her,causing her to break into appellant house,grab a knife from the kitchen,go into appellant room,and stab her.had never met or known appellant before this incident.did not know whom she was attacking,and actually thought she was attacking a man.she n ever intended to hurt appellant if i would have known it was a woman,although she intended to injure the person who was putting the symbols the hanging plants up in the front porch.that what i intended to do.
was arrested outside appellant home.she told police that she had recently resumed her heavy methamphetamine use,and was feeling paranoid before the incident,as though people were following her.she entered appellant house because the hanging plants reminded her of a man who had sexually attacked her.a doctor who examined her at juvenile hall opined that she may be psychotic.entered a plea of no contest to attempted second degree murder with personal use of a deadly weapon and infliction of great bodily injury.she was sentenced to a california youth authority facility.
in september,appellant filed a complaint against and her parents the family,alleging four causes of action and seeking damages for assault,battery,negligence and negligent supervision in the first cause of action,for assault,appellant alleged that placed her in fear for her personal safety by threatening her with bodily injury with a knife,and that i n doing the acts as alleged above,intended to cause or place appellant in apprehension of a harmful and offense sic contact with appellant person,as a result of which appellant suffered injuries and damages.each of the three subsequent causes of action incorporated by reference and thereby realleged these particular allegations of intentionality on part the same as if they had been expressly repeated in the other causes of action.
appellant also made additional specific allegations that behavior was intentional in the second cause of action,for battery.thus,in count two appellant alleged that stabbed appellant multiple times in the area of appellant head and shoulders i n doing the acts as alleged above,defenants sic,and each of them,acted deliberately and with the intent to make a contact with appellant person and t he aforementioned conduct of was willfull sic and malicious and was intended to oppress and cause injury to appellant.in the third cause of action,appellant realleged the earlier allegations that acted deliberately and with the intent to make contact with appellant person,adding allegations that in doing so she negligently injured appellant and negligently consumed drugs,alcohol,medication,or failed to consume medication,such that she was unable to control her own behavior.finally,in the fourth cause of action against parents for negligent supervision,appellant again realleged the earlier allegations that acts were intentional,and added specific allegations that her parents were liable for the aforementioned intentional and negligent acts based upon california civil code section.
notified respondent of appellant claim against him and on march.on april,respondent sent a letter reserving its rights under the various applicable endorsements of the policy,including the exclusions for bodily injury expected or intended by an insured or which is the foreseeable result of an act or omission intended by an insured,and for any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.after an investigation,respondent informed its insured by letter dated october,that it would not defend or indemnify appellant claims and lawsuit.respondent letter stated that it had determined that the actions of were willful,intentional,malicious and illegal,and therefore excluded by the provisions of the policy and by insurance code section on november,through his attorney,asked respondent to reconsider its decision not to defend.respondent thereafter obtained the independent legal opinion of outside coverage counsel that there was no coverage or duty to defend any of the insureds under the policy.on this basis,respondent again denied claim by letter dated december.
appellant case against the family proceeded to settlement.attorney notified respondent in writing of an impending settlement conference scheduled for april,and informed respondent that appellant had proposed a stipulated settlement judgment in the amount of,with a covenant not to execute against the family in exchange for an assignment of their rights against respondent.attorney stated that he would recommend the family accept the offer,with a reservation of their right to seek attorney fees and costs from respondent.on the day of the settlement conference,appellant settled with the family without a trial on the merits,on the terms outlined in the letter of attorney to respondent.thereafter,the trial court entered judgment in favor of appellant and against and and in the amount of,pursuant to appellant covenant not to execute on or enforce the judgment and the concurrent assignment by the family of their rights against respondent,with the exception of their rights to attorney fees incurred as a result of respondent failure to defend them.
on december,appellant filed this action against respondent for declaratory relief,breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,seeking to recover the amount of the underlying stipulated judgment from respondent based on the family assignment of rights against respondent.on july,respondent moved for summary judgment on the grounds it had no duty to defend or indemnify the family because the acts of on which appellant underlying claims were based were intentional and willful under section.in addition,respondent cited and relied upon the policy exclusions for bodily injury intended by an insured or which is the foreseeable result of an act or omission intended by an insured,and for any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.respondent separate statement of undisputed facts,filed in connection with the motion,specifically set out these policy exclusions for intentional and illegal acts.appellant did not dispute respondent citation of these exclusions 
in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,appellant submitted argument and evidence to the effect that was legally insane at the time of her attack on appellant.among other things,appellant evidence included the declaration of a psychologist,dwight murray.on the basis of his review of juvenile records and the transcript of her videotaped deposition,murray opined that was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as to not know the nature and quality of the act she was doing when she attacked appellant,or if she did know,that she could not distinguish right from wrong when she was committing the act.in reply,respondent argued that appellant had failed to introduce any credible evidence that was legally insane for purposes of section,and had therefore failed to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact on that question.
by order filed september,the trial court denied respondent motion for summary judgment.in its decision,the trial court ruled that respondent objections to psychologist murray declaration go to the weight of the expert opinion and would require an assessment of his credibility,which was precluded in the summary judgment context respondent failed to address the issue of whether was capable at the time of the attack of distinguishing right from wrong and even assuming arguendo that murray declaration was inadmissible,there was sufficient evidence in the record to raise triable issues of material fact as to whether was legally insane when she attacked appellant,whether her conduct was willful for purposes of section,and therefore whether respondent owed the family a duty to defend or indemnify respondent did not seek reconsideration of this order.instead,it filed a petition for writ of mandate to this court which we denied without opinion on october.
the case proceeded to trial.at pretrial conference,judge william kolin bifurcated proceedings on legal and factual issues.the parties waived the right to a jury trial.on the first day of trial to the court,march,an evidentiary dispute arose regarding whether,in response to appellant discovery requests,respondent had produced a complete copy of the policy in force at the time of the loss.judge kolin continued the trial to resolve this issue.in the interim the parties stipulated to,and the trial court permitted,the filing of for summary judgment or summary adjudication 
in april,appellant and respondent filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of coverage.respondent second motion for summary judgment was a verbatim duplication of its earlier motion.respondent separate statement of undisputed facts was also identical to the statement it filed in connection with its first motion for summary judgment.both separate statements specifically called the trial court attention to the policy exclusions for injuries intended by an insured and for any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.
in her motion for summary judgment,appellant argued that judge zuniga prior denial of respondent earlier motion for summary judgment amounted to a dispositive ruling that respondent owed the family a duty to defend.in opposition to appellant motion,respondent argued that there was no potential for coverage under the policy because appellant injury was not the result of an accident,conduct and actions were illegal,and subjective intent to harm someone other than appellant was irrelevant to the willfulness of her act.in reply to appellant procedural argument that respondent second summary judgment motion was barred by section,respondent argued that appellant had essentially waived that hurdle by stipulating to the filing of cross motions for summary judgment asserted that the second motion was proper under the statute because judge zuniga did not have the complete policy before her at the time of the earlier motion for summary judgment and contended that because both parties had waived jury trial,the trial court would in any event be required to decide the coverage issues as a matter of law at the very outset of trial 
after the trial court issued a tentative ruling in favor of respondent,oral argument on the took place on may.at the hearing,appellant attorney again argued that respondent motion for summary judgment was procedurally barred by section as a tardy motion for reconsideration that failed to raise any new factual or legal arguments and was in fact identical to the earlier such motion and the undisputed facts of drug use and psychological instability at the time of the attack established at least a potential for coverage under the policy,thereby triggering respondent duty to defend.respondent replied that its renewed motion for summary judgment was not procedurally barred because appellant had stipulated to its filing the trial court was required to decide the issues raised by the motion because it was being heard at the outset of the bifurcated portion of trial on legal issues much like a motion to dismiss or for nonsuit and the evidence regarding mental condition did not contradict the fact that her acts and conduct were intentional,willful and illegal,and thus excluded from coverage both contractually and by statute.
following the hearing,the trial court issued an order sustaining the tentative ruling.the trial court found that as a matter of law stabbing of appellant was an illegal act,coverage of which was precluded by the illegal act exclusion of the policy her pleas sic of no contest to the charge of attempted murder is admissible in this action as an admission of an intentional act,since attempted murder is a specific intent crime t herefore,there was no potential for coverage,since the policy excludes intentional acts and respondent had no duty to defend or to indemnify on this basis,judge kolin granted respondent motion for summary judgment.this appeal timely followed entry of judgment on june.
jurisdiction to rule on respondent second summary judgment motion 
before we analyze the substantive correctness of the order granting summary judgment,we must address the important procedural issue of whether the trial court erred in even considering respondent second summary judgment motion.appellant argues that respondent failed to comply with the statutory prerequisites of section when it simply refiled the identical motion for summary judgment before judge kolin in april that it had previously filed in law and motion in july,and which had been denied by judge zuniga in september based on the finding that there were triable disputed issues of material fact.because respondent motion failed to comply with the requirements of section,appellant contends the trial court,acting through judge kolin,lacked jurisdiction to rule on,much less grant,respondent second motion for summary judgment.
respondent replies that its second motion was in compliance with section because,in responding to appellant arguments in favor of her for summary judgment,respondent had gone beyond its initial reliance on section to argue that coverage was additionally barred by the policy exclusions for intentional and illegal acts even if respondent second motion was in violation of section,the trial court still had jurisdiction to correct an earlier erroneous summary judgment ruling under cases holding that trial courts have inherent jurisdiction to reconsider their interim rulings and in any event,any alleged violation of section could not have been prejudicial because a judge zuniga denial of respondent first summary judgment motion was erroneous on its merits b the parties had waived jury trial and judge kolin was required to try the issue of coverage as a matter of law and c it was ultimately immaterial whether the trial court made its ruling in the context of a renewed motion for summary judgment or a court trial under the factual and procedural circumstances presented on this record,we must agree with appellant contention that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant respondent second motion for summary judgment.
section,subdivision a states the procedure for seeking reconsideration of a previous order.section,subdivision b sets out similar prerequisites for filing a renewed motion for an order that has previously been denied.although the two subdivisions differ in certain minor details,each sets out the same essential requirements.subdivision a provides that any party affected by a previous trial court order may,within days after service of notice of entry of the order,make a motion for reconsideration thereof based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,on condition of filing an affidavit stating what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown.similarly,subdivision b states that a party who has previously made an application for an order which was refused in whole or part,or granted conditionally or on terms,may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,provided a showing is made to the court by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown.subdivision d in turn states that a violation of section may be punished as a contempt and with sanctions.most significantly,subdivision e provides that section applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court,or for the renewal of a previous motion,and specifies the court jurisdiction with regard to this subject matter and specifically declares that n o application to reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless made according to this section.
appellant contends that respondent second motion constituted a flagrant attempt to circumvent the trial court earlier order denying the same motion,and the trial court was jurisdictionally barred by section from entertaining it.as appellant correctly points out,respondent second summary judgment motion before judge kolin was identical in all respects to the one it had earlier filed before judge zuniga in the law and motion department.even the separate statements of undisputed facts respondent submitted in connection with each motion were identical.contrary to respondent assertion on appeal,respondent renewed motion for summary judgment did not raise any additional circumstances and grounds establishing the absence of coverage under specific terms of the policy that had not already been raised in the previous motion.significantly,respondent original motion for summary judgment before judge zuniga specifically cited the policy exclusion provisions for intentional and illegal acts,and expressly set out these two exclusions in the separate statement of undisputed facts filed in conjunction with that motion.thus,the two exclusion provisions upon which judge kolin based his decision granting respondent second motion for summary judgment were also before judge zuniga at the time she denied the identical motion several months previously.
without question,respondent second motion for summary judgment did not qualify as a motion for reconsideration under section,subdivision a,having been brought more than days after service of written notice of entry of judge zuniga order denying the first motion,and before a different judge.neither did respondent renewed motion for summary judgment comply with the statutory requirements set out in section,subdivision b for an application for an order that had previously been refused in whole or in part.the statute dictates that such an application must be upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law.in addition,case law interpreting section has specifically held that a moving party must give a satisfactory explanation for the previous failure to present the allegedly new or different evidence or legal authority offered in the second application.baldwin home savings of america th,d baldwin garcia hejmadi th,d.as seen,respondent did not introduce any new or different facts,circumstances,or law in support of its second motion which it had not already raised in the first motion.indeed,the record shows respondent simply submitted to judge kolin an exact copy of the same motion it had already argued to judge zuniga,without any additions,subtractions or modifications,much less any explanation for the fact the two motions were identical.
section was amended in to add,among other things,the current subdivisions c and e it was amended again in to add current subdivision g.stats,ch,stats,ch,see kollander construction,superior court th,d kollander.in adding these provisions,the legislature expressly intended to make section both jurisdictional and applicable to all motions for reconsideration of interim orders,as well as all renewed motions for interim orders previously denied.stats,ch,kollander,supra,th at,d morite of california superior court th,d morite.prior to those amendments,s ection purported to be neither jurisdictional nor exclusive.kollander,supra,th at,d.
amended section has generated a considerable body of law,and some disagreement,in the appellate courts.case lazben financial th,d.indeed,as respondent correctly points out,there is a split among the appellate courts of the state on the issue of the extent to which section operates to jurisdictionally preclude a trial court from granting a renewed for summary judgment or for some other form of denying an earlier such motion based on the same facts,circumstances and law.some courts,including division two of this district,have concluded that section is jurisdictional and prescribes the sole procedural mechanism for renewal of a previously denied motion,or for reconsideration of prior interim orders.
the first such reported case was morite,supra,th,d,from division seven of the second appellate district.morite concerned a writ petition to compel vacation of a lower court order setting a declaratory relief action for trial,and to compel reinstatement of a prior order of the same trial court staying trial of that action pending trial of another underlying lawsuit.concluding that section is the exclusive means for modifying,amending or revoking an order,and is expressly jurisdictional,id.at,d the morite court held that section,as amended,denies trial courts jurisdiction to reconsider,modify,amend or revoke their prior orders,whether final or interim,except pursuant to the procedure set forth in the statute.id.at,d.on this basis,the appellate court issued a writ of mandate commanding the trial court to vacate the order setting the declaratory relief action for trial,finding that r espondent trial court circumvented the jurisdictional limits of section,subdivision e by consciously ignoring the stay order which had been entered by a predecessor judge of the same court i f courts may simply ignore interim orders instead of modifying,amending or revoking them after due consideration,then the procedural,substantive and jurisdictional requirements of section are meaningless.by making section expressly jurisdictional,the legislature clearly intended to prevent courts from modifying,amending or revoking prior orders without due reconsideration.ignoring,implicitly revoking interim orders,such as the prior stay order,undermines the legislative intent behind section,subdivision e.id.at,d.
the leading published opinions in this appellate district,all from division two,have expressly followed morite in affirming that section is both jurisdictional and the exclusive procedural means for renewal of a previously denied motion or reconsideration of an interim order.pazderka caballeros dimas alang,th,d pazderka trial court had no jurisdiction to grant motion for reconsideration of attorney fees award in absence of showing of new and different facts and satisfactory explanation for failure to present such new facts at the time of first motion baldwin,supra,th at,d trial court acted in excess of jurisdiction in granting motion for reconsideration of attorney fees award where party moving for reconsideration failed to present any new or different law that could not have been cited in the original motion garcia hejmadi,supra,th at,d trial court lacked jurisdiction to vacate earlier grant of summary judgment under section because movant failed to present newly discovered evidence or a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the mistakenly omitted evidence earlier crotty trader th,d section does not give trial court authority to reevaluate or reanalyze facts and authority already presented in the earlier motion gilberd ac transit th,d section is jurisdictional,and the exclusive avenue for reconsideration of interim court orders whether initiated by a party of the court itself trial court acted in excess of jurisdiction when it granted motion for reconsideration of earlier order denying motion for summary judgment without an adequate showing of new or different facts,circumstances or law.
more recently,several courts have reconsidered and rejected this line of authority,concluding that to the extent it restricts a trial court inherent power to reconsider and correct its own interim rulings,section may be unconstitutional.see wozniak lucutz th,d wozniak second,div.seven w e choose to follow that line of cases which recognizes that section notwithstanding,the trial court retains the ability to reconsider its interim rulings and to change those rulings at any time prior to entry of judgment remsen lavacot th,d remsen fourth,div.three the court inherent power to correct its own rulings is based on the california constitution and can not be impaired by statute case lazben financial,supra,th at,d second,div.three trial court inherent authority to reconsider its own earlier ruling sua sponte is derived from the california constitution,and its jurisdiction to do so can not be impaired by section kollander,supra,th at,d second,div.four courts have inherent constitutional power to control their order and business,including the power to correct their own interim rulings darling,hall rae kritt th,d darling second,div.seven section does not govern the court ability,on its own motion,to reevaluate its own interim rulings,and trial court retains the inherent authority to change its decision at any time prior to the entry of judgment people castello th,d fourth,div.one a court has broad power,inherent in the california constitution,to rehear,reconsider and correct its own interim rulings,and section can not impair the exercise of this inherent power.
several of these cases have distinguished between a trial court inherent power to reconsider and correct its own prior rulings sua sponte,and the limitations imposed by section on the ability of parties to bring motions for reconsideration or to renew an application for an order previously denied.thus,in darling,supra,th,d,the same division of the second appellate district that had issued the decision in morite six years earlier held that section does not govern a trial court inherent authority and jurisdiction to reevaluate its own interim rulings on its own motion,and can only be understood to apply to motions for reconsideration brought by litigants.in darling,the trial court had initially denied the plaintiff motions for summary judgment.subsequently,upon its own rereading and reconsideration of papers previously filed with the motions,it vacated its own earlier ruling and granted summary judgment.id.at,d.on appeal,the defendant argued the trial court had acted in excess of its jurisdiction under section.the darling court considered and found inapplicable the line of cases from division two of this appellate district holding section jurisdictional,reasoning instead that because a trial court has inherent constitutional power to change its decision at any time before entry of judgment,section can not govern the court jurisdiction or authority,on its own motion,to reevaluate and change its own interim rulings at any time before entry of judgment on this basis the appellate court upheld the trial court jurisdiction to reconsider and grant sua sponte a motion for summary judgment it had previously denied,even in the absence of new facts or law.id.at,d see also people castello,supra,th at fn,d section,by its express terms,governs only a litigant ability to renew a motion or advance an application,not the court inherent power to reconsider its own interim rulings in re jamika th,d section did not affect trial court jurisdiction to vacate prior order setting juvenile petition for hearing because it was not acting on a motion for reconsideration,but was correcting an erroneous ruling bernstein consolidated american ins.th,d bernstein,disapproved on other grounds in vandenberg superior court cal th,d,fn.second,div.five section does not preclude trial court inherent power to correct,on its own motion,its own prior ruling erroneously denying summary adjudication reconsideration upheld because court was not entertaining a motion by a party for reconsideration of the prior ruling,but was correcting an erroneous ruling on its own motion.
since darling,however,at least two appellate courts have gone further and rejected the distinction between a court reevaluation of its interim orders upon its own motion,versus such a reconsideration upon the motion of the parties.in remsen,supra,th,d,the trial court had originally ruled that trust beneficiaries were entitled to interest on their bequests.upon the motion of the trustees for reconsideration,the court later modified the order to hold the reverse.acknowledging that the trustee motion for reconsideration of the prior order was on its face in violation of section because it was not based on new or different facts,circumstances or law,the remsen court nevertheless affirmed the trial court modification and reversal of its own interim order upon the trustee motion.division three of the fourth appellate district specifically held that section could not restrict the trial court inherent power to reconsider and change its own interim ruling even though it did so upon the motion of a litigant,rather than upon its own motion sua sponte.id.at,d.similarly,when division seven of the second appellate district revisited this issue recently in wozniak,supra,th,d,it expressly followed remsen to hold that it is irrelevant whether the court acts sua sponte or pursuant to a party motion in either case,the ability of the trial court to correct what it perceives to be an incorrect interim ruling can only further the policy of conserving judicial resources.id.at,d kollander,supra,th at,d.
we agree with the principle enunciated in darling,people castello,and their progeny that trial courts have the inherent power to reconsider and correct their own interim decisions in order to achieve substantial justice.phillips phillips cal d,trial court may change its decision on law or facts at any time before judgment is entered harth ten eyck cal d,trial court had power to change previous order to serve the ends of justice,subject to review for abuse of discretion bernstein,supra,th at,d same nave taggart th,d same ziller electronics lab gmbh superior court d.ziller a trial court has jurisdiction to reconsider and correct its erroneous interim rulings to achieve justice.it is clear to us that this power is derived from the california constitution.cal,art.iii,art.iv,art.v,art.vi,providing for legislative,executive and judicial branches of government manduley superior court cal th,d,people bunn cal th,d,case lazben financial,supra,th at,d.
although the legislature may enact statutes regulating the inherent powers of the courts,it may not do so in a way that would defeat or materially impair the courts exercise of their core constitutional powers and functions.people bunn,supra,cal th at,d,superior court county of mendocino cal th,d.to the extent section bars trial courts from sua sponte reconsidering their own interim orders and decisions,it clearly hinders the core power of the judiciary to decide and resolve controversies between litigants.we agree with division three of the second appellate district that if interpreted to eliminate a court jurisdiction to reconsider its interim orders on its own motion,section violates the separation of powers doctrine embodied in the california constitution.case lazben financial,supra,th at,d.consequently,we hold that the separation of powers doctrine precludes an interpretation of section that would deprive a trial court of jurisdiction to reconsider its own interim orders sua sponte.
nevertheless,we must also conclude that by eliminating the distinction between a trial court action taken sua sponte and that made in response to a litigant motion,the more recent cases such as remsen and wozniak go too far toward eviscerating the clear jurisdictional language of section,essentially rendering the provisions of the statute meaningless.we are constrained by two essential principles of statutory interpretation.first,in order to avoid encroaching on the legislative function,we may not simply disregard the language of a statute in defiance of the clear intent and policy judgments of the legislature.kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,kollander,supra,th at,d razeto city of oakland d.second,if and when possible,a legislative enactment must be construed in such a way as to preserve its constitutionality.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,fair employment housing com.cal d,case lazben financial,supra,th at,d kollander,supra,th at,d rowe superior court th,d.
applying these principles,we conclude that section may reasonably be construed as intended to regulate the actions of parties to a civil litigation rather than the inherent powers of the trial court itself both the plain language of the statute itself and the uncodified expressions of legislative intent in the original legislation and the legislative counsel digest consistently refer to applications for reconsideration or renewals of previous motions brought by parties,with no reference whatsoever to restrictions on a trial court reconsideration of its own orders sua sponte or on its own motion.stats,ch,legis.counsel,bill,stats,summary,case lazben financial,supra,th at,d people castello,supra,th,fn,d.clearly,trial courts do not make applications,motions,or renewals of motions themselves.the language chosen by the legislature strongly suggests it intended to restrict the actions of parties in bringing motions to reconsider,but did not contemplate restricting the discretion of a trial judge who realizes he or she has erred in making a ruling and wishes to remedy the mistake.this statutory language unambiguously confines the procedural requirements of section to applications or motions for renewal brought by parties,and does not purport to govern a court reconsideration of an order on its own motion.case lazben financial,supra,th at,d.
we believe that this construction of section may be reconciled with the reported decisions,largely from division two of this court,holding that the requirements of section are jurisdictional and exclusive.significantly,all of these cases involved situations in which the disputed reconsideration,modification or reversal of a prior interim order was brought about upon the motion of a party litigant,and not by the trial court acting on its own motion.pazderka,supra,th at,d defendant moved for reconsideration of attorney fees award without compliance with section baldwin,supra,th at,d same garcia hejmadi,supra,th at,d trial court erroneously vacated summary judgment previously granted to defendant upon motion for reconsideration by plaintiff filed without a satisfactory showing of compliance with section gilberd ac transit,supra,th at,d without complying with section,trial court entered judgment dismissing plaintiff complaint after granting motion to reconsider previous order granting plaintiff relief morite,supra,th at,d without following section,trial judge set insurance coverage action for trial after insurer asked the judge to do so in status conference statement,despite previous order entered by different judge staying that action pending disposition of underlying wrongful termination case.none of these cases addressed the specific question of whether and to what extent section may impair a trial court inherent constitutional power sua sponte to reconsider,correct and change its own interim decisions.
in sum,and construing the language section in a manner consistent with the requirements of the california constitution,we hold that the procedural prerequisites set forth for reconsideration of orders and renewal of motions previously denied are jurisdictional as applied to the actions of parties to civil litigation.as applied to the circumstances of this which judge zuniga previous denial of summary judgment was clearly put in issue not on the trial court own motion but instead by the parties for summary judgment and,more specifically,respondent verbatim reapplication for summary provisions of section were jurisdictional and controlling.
on this record,then,we conclude that appellant jurisdictional argument is meritorious.the undisputed record shows there were no new facts,circumstances or legal authorities cited in respondent renewed motion for summary judgment filed in april which it had not previously presented in its original motion of july.significantly,respondent original motion for summary judgment before judge zuniga specifically cited the same two policy exclusions for intentional and illegal acts upon which judge kolin subsequently based his decision granting the motion.respondent gave no satisfactory explanation whatsoever for its failure to offer any new facts,circumstances or law,much less for its resubmission of the identical motion before a different judge.on their face,it is difficult to distinguish respondent proceedings below from the kind of brazen forum shopping section is specifically intended to bar.case lazben financial,supra,th at,d.we hold the trial court was jurisdictionally barred from considering respondent renewed motion for summary judgment,because it was not in compliance with the requirements of section.
respondent nevertheless urges that,even if its renewed motion for summary judgment was in technical violation of section,under the particular facts and circumstances presented here the trial court did not err in entertaining and granting it.its argument may be summarized as follows.unlike the situation addressed by the opinions of this court upon which appellant relies,the renewed motion for summary judgment in this case was not made as a motion for reconsideration in a law and motions context prior to trial.instead,it was made at the outset of trial,after the parties had waived a jury,and before the trial judge who would actually be trying the case.the motion was made on the mixed legal and factual issues of coverage that the trial court itself of necessity had to address and decide before proceeding to any other determinations of liability.thus,respondent contends,its renewed application was not so much an attempt to obtain reconsideration of the earlier denial of summary judgment by circumventing the requirements of section,as it was a kind of motion for nonsuit or for judgment made at the outset of trial on the very issues which the court was required to decide anyway.that these issues of coverage were the same ones embraced by the earlier motion for summary judgment itself was the necessary result of the trial court previous denial of that motion,a denial that required those issues to be decided at trial.had the trial court denied or refused to consider respondent renewed motion for summary judgment,it would only have been putting off for a few days a determination it would be required to make shortly thereafter.in practical effect,respondent argues,this appeal is thus not from a trial court order undoing an earlier interim order without compliance with the statutory requirements for such a reconsideration,but from the final disposition of the case.gilberd ac transit,supra,th at,fn,d remedy for any substantive error in the trial court original ruling denying summary judgment lies in an appeal from the final disposition of the case.
despite the surface appeal of respondent argument,it ultimately founders on the actual record.at the point the parties submitted their for summary judgment on the issue of coverage under the policy,judge kolin was prepared to try that issue as a matter of law.the fact that judge zuniga had previously ruled there were triable issues of material fact connected with coverage did not change judge kolin responsibility to decide those triable issues himself to the contrary,because the earlier decision clearly stated that underlying facts were in dispute,the trial court was required to make a determination of those issues at trial.yet it was precisely the issues identified in the trial court earlier order that judge kolin decision did not address.
thus,the earlier denial of respondent first motion for summary judgment was based on judge zuniga express finding that there were triable issues of fact regarding mental capacity and sanity.the existence of these disputed facts prevented a decision on the issues of coverage and duty to defend in the summary judgment context.yet judge kolin subsequent order granting the identical on the eve of not even mention these factual issues,much less decide them.nor could it,since the trial court never had the opportunity to weigh the credibility of the parties conflicting evidence on this issue by hearing testimony and argument.by the same token,the order granting summary judgment did not address or analyze the controlling decisional law on the effect of cognitive incapacity on willfulness and intent for purposes of insurance coverage,and the impact of that law on the facts of this case.penney casualty ins,supra,cal d at,clemmer hartford insurance cal d,jacobs fire ins.exchange,supra,th at,d shell oil winterthur swiss ins,supra,th at,d.
although respondent now asserts we should uphold the grant of summary judgment because judge zuniga denial of the motion for summary judgment erroneously gave undue emphasis to the role an alleged insanity might play in determining liability insurance coverage,this very argument simply serves to underscore the trial court complete failure even to address this precise issue.moreover,one trial judge may not reconsider and overrule the previous interim ruling of a predecessor judge of the same court by the expedient of simply ignoring the existence of that prior ruling.not only would such a procedure render inoperative the procedural,substantive and jurisdictional requirements of section,but it would completely undermine the general rule that one trial court judge may not reconsider and overrule an interim ruling of another judge.ziller,supra,d at.see morite,supra,th at,d.
in short,the grant of respondent second motion for summary judgment can not be upheld by the simple expedient of construing it as a grant of nonsuit or judgment on the merits.there was never any trial on the specific triable issues of material fact identified by the trial court earlier order denying summary judgment.the trial court did not even purport to address those issues at all for all intents and purposes it simply ignored them.the only practical interpretation of the trial court order granting respondent second motion for summary judgment was that it was simply a reversal of the earlier order by a different judge denying the identical motion upon reconsideration thereof,and not a final determination on the merits of the disputed factual issues identified in that earlier order.section bars the reconsideration of an earlier order denying summary judgment under the circumstances presented here.as such,the order granting summary judgment was in violation of section and in excess of the trial court jurisdiction.baldwin,supra,th at,d garcia hejmadi,supra,th at,d gilberd ac transit,supra,th at,d.
substantive error 
aside from the procedural and jurisdictional issues of its noncompliance with section,the trial court grant of summary judgment upon respondent second motion also suffered from substantive errors which would independently require reversal.because we must remand for further proceedings,we now address those issues for the guidance of the trial court.
in granting summary judgment,the trial court relied first on the policy exclusion for any illegal act commited sic by or at the direction of an insured in determining as a matter of law that stabbing of appellant was an illegal act for which insurance coverage was precluded.under the recent decisional authority of our supreme court,this determination can no longer stand.in safeco ins.robert,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court concluded that an insurance policy provision excluding coverage for an illegal act for all intents and purposes identical to the one at issue in this unenforceable under the controlling principles for the construction and interpretation of insurance contracts.the supreme court found the phrase illegal act may reasonably be construed either broadly to mean an act prohibited by any law,whether civil or criminal or more narrowly,to imply a violation of criminal law only.on this basis,the supreme court concluded the exclusion was inherently ambiguous and incapable of being given any enforceable meaning.the court held,i n short,because the illegal act exclusion can not reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract,it must be rejected as invalid.citation.id.at,d,italics added.although this decision of our supreme court was issued after the trial court grant of summary judgment in this case,it must be applied retroactively as a bar to the enforcement of the illegal act exclusion here.garcia hejmadi,supra,th at,d with rare exceptions,the general rule is that statutes operate only prospectively,while judicial decisions operate retrospectively.
the other basis for the trial court grant of summary judgment was its apparent determination that plea of no contest to the charge of attempted murder constituted conclusive evidence of the intentionality of her act of stabbing appellant.the trial court declaration that plea was admissible in this action as an admission of the crime of attempted murder was,or course,a correct statement of the law.interinsurance exchange flores th,d a plea of nolo contendere is admissible in a subsequent civil action as an admission of the crime.however,because such a plea may reflect a compromise or a choice not to undergo prosecution,it is not a conclusive admission,and has no collateral estoppel effect.thus,it does not necessarily establish the underlying factual matters at issue in the civil litigation.id.at,d.to the extent the trial court grant of summary judgment on respondent motion was based on the assumption that plea of nolo contendere by itself established the intentionality of her act,it was in error.on its face,all plea meant was that she would not contest the charge of doing the deed.whether the admitted stabbing was willful or intentional for purposes of section and the policy exclusion for intentional acts,however,depends on the resolution of the disputed factual issue of legal sanity.clemmer hartford insurance,supra,cal d at,shell oil winterthur swiss ins,supra,th at,d penney casualty ins,supra,cal d at,jacobs fire ins.exchange,supra,th at,d.as seen,that issue has not yet been decided by the trial court.
appellant not entitled to entry of judgment in its favor 
appellant next argues that the trial court initial order in august denying respondent first motion for summary judgment established respondent duty to defend its insureds as a matter of law,and that this court should therefore direct entry of judgment in appellant favor.the argument is premised on the principle that the duty to defend arises whenever there is a potential for indemnification coverage.gray zurich insurance cal d.based on this principle,appellant asserts that the trial court finding of triable issues of material fact on the issue of coverage affirmatively established such a potential for coverage,and with it,the existence of a duty to defend.the contention is without merit.
in the first place,appellant offers no authority for the novel proposition that the denial of a defendant motion for summary judgment can affirmatively require entry of judgment for the plaintiff.at best,appellant points to case authority for the proposition that a duty to defend exists as long as there is any potential for coverage.buss superior court cal th,d,montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.however,judge zuniga denial of respondent initial motion for summary judgment established nothing more than the existence of triable issues of material fact to be finally determined at trial.the actual weighing of conflicting evidence by the factfinder is a process which can never take place in the context of a summary judgment motion.only after the actual process of factfinding takes place can the ultimate issue be decided,whether the claim was actually covered.if the ultimate decision on that question is negative,then the duty to defend is necessarily also extinguished.appellant is no more entitled than is respondent to entry of judgment on an issue that at this point remains to be decided 
turning from appellant procedural arguments to those of substance,she contends the trial court erred in denying her own motion for summary judgment because respondent failed to demonstrate that the potential for indemnification coverage had been eliminated.in essence,she argues that respondent duty to defend the family was necessarily established by respondent failure to disprove the potential for coverage under the policy,based on evidence of alleged mental disorder or incapacity.this argument,like appellant argument based on the denial of respondent motion for summary judgment,ignores the fact there has not yet been any final determination of the disputed factual issues upon which she bases her claim.the evidence of mental incapacity,whatever its strength,must be weighed against the opposing evidence,if any,respondent may offer.until that takes place,the issue of respondent duty to defend simply remains unresolved.
in short,appellant request for entry of judgment regarding any duty to defend is premature.until the trial court actually weighs the conflicting evidence on the material factual issues identified in judge zuniga order denying respondent motion for summary judgment,there can be no final determination of the questions of policy coverage and respondent alleged duty to defend thereunder.as seen,the trial court has not yet tried these factual issues.
disposition 
the superior court lacked jurisdiction either to reconsider the earlier denial of summary judgment on respondent motion,or to consider and rule upon respondent reapplication therefor.the order granting respondent motion for summary judgment is accordingly vacated,the judgment entered thereon is reversed,and the cause is remanded for consideration of the triable disputed issues of material fact identified in the original order denying summary judgment.respondent shall pay appellant costs on this appeal.
