this case presents an especially weak title vii sex discrimination claim.the plaintiff,griff argo,was fired by blue cross blue shield of kansas,blue cross blue shield following nearly a year of declining performance and disciplinary problems,one day after arriving late for work and failing to complete assigned work.he alleges that his termination was the product of reverse sex discrimination,citing a handful of flirtatious comments by his female supervisor over a period of several years.in the alternative,he alleges that he was terminated in retaliation for his decision to file an internal sex discrimination complaint.both claims fall painfully short on summary judgment,and we affirm the decision of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
griff argo started work as an individual enrollment specialist ies for blue cross blue shield in january.iess spend of the day on the phone,selling health,dental,and life insurance policies to new and existing customers.blue cross blue shield sets monthly and annual performance goals for each ies,including a number of individual health and dental policies and a dollar volume of life insurance.the company uses those performance goals as a basis for evaluating its employees.on annual review forms during argo tenure at blue cross blue shield,between and of the overall rating for an ies depended on the three categories of performance goals.
on january,within his first few weeks of work,argo was introduced to brenda oliva,who then worked in a different department.they had met socially on a previous occasion,but argo did not immediately remember oliva name.according to argo,she kind of chuckled and said,oh,so you too good to remember my name app.he did not consider the comment a line,but maintains that her tone of voice impl ied a form of attraction,and i have to say sexual harassment.id.
between and the beginning of,argo performance ranged from commendable to distinguished.see app.despite occasional problems with tardiness he was praised as an excellent employee and an asset to the ies team.id.at.in,oliva became argo supervisor.on both his and annual reviews,she described argo as a team player,and wrote that she was glad to have him in my department.id.at.in december,her monthly goal attainment status report for argo was effusive you had a great year.i very proud of you.you made all of your goals for.i look forward in sic working with you next year.id.at.argo alleges that throughout this period he endured a pattern of sexual harassment,id.at,but cites only a single incident in three years once,upon seeing argo in the office dressed in shorts and a tank top on his way to the gym,oliva joked,whoa,nice legs.id.at.
beginning in april,argo performance began a steady slide.oliva comments on her monthly reports reveal her increasing anxiety.from april you did meet your monthly goal on health but since you were up the other three months,you are meeting your health goal year to date keep up the good work.id.at.from june you did make your monthly goal for health and life what can we do to help you meet your monthly goals is there anything i can do to help id.at.from july this is your second month you did make your monthly goal for health we need to overcome this let get together and see what we can do.id.at.from september y ou had months that you did not make your monthly goal.can you please share with me what you plan on doing to assure me you will make your health goal id.at.from october this is your sixth month for not making your monthly goal let me know what i can do id.at.from november you did not make your monthly goal for the month this year.you need to start using your time wisely.id.at.
during the same period,argo tardiness problems worsened.since june,oliva had required argo to send her an email message upon arriving at work,warning him further late starts would result in formal written probation.id.at.on march,she gave him a written warning,admonishing him again for the consistent amount of the time you were coming into work after.id.at.she cautioned that if this continues it will be a performance issue.id.in,argo was caught reading a book at his desk during the work day,and continued reading for fifteen minutes before oliva confronted him.phone records revealed that he had not made a call in minutes.the next day oliva directed him to call some old prospective customers,but he refused.on november,she issued a written reprimand for poor performance,specific to your attitude and not using your time correctly,and a blunt warning if your attitude does not improve in days and if directives continue to be ignored then i have no alternative but to terminate you from blue cross blue shield of kansas.id.at.
meanwhile,oliva campaign of exceedingly mild flirtation continued.on one occasion in july,after monitoring one of argo calls and offering constructive criticism,oliva smiled and winked at him.two months later,oliva gave him a birthday reproduced for us in full color by the a picture of a buxom woman dressed in black lingerie.the cover says,a birthday riddle why do men like women in leather inside,it continues,because they smell like a new car happy birthday,guy.id.at.the joke,you see,is that the sexually suggestive setup is followed by a completely nonsexual punch line.finally,while he was being reprimanded on november for his time management and attitude problems,argo says that oliva placed the tip of her shoe slightly over the tip of his shoe,making him feel slightly awkward,and did so a second time after he moved his foot away.id.at.
despite repeated warnings,argo failed to meet his performance goal for health insurance in.in her december monthly report,oliva noted that he had missed his performance goals for eight consecutive months,and said,we need to look at and see what you can do differently so we do have a repeat of this year.id.at.on january,argo called in sick at am,more than an hour after he was expected at work.the next day,in a written memorandum entitled performance,oliva reminded argo of his earlier warnings regarding tardiness and said,this is your last warning.if you continue to not follow company or departmental policies which include but are not limited to tardiness,time utilization,not following directives,not calling in prior to am,we will have no alternative but to terminate your employment at blue cross and blue shield of kansas.id.at.
three days later,on january,argo filed an internal complaint regarding a persistent and increasing hostile work environment that i have endured for several months as a result of the conduct of the manager of individual sales,brenda oliva.id.at.the complaint described the handful of incidents of sexual harassment he had endured at the hands of oliva,including the birthday card,the shoe tip touching,the wink,and the comments whoa,nice legs and oh,so you too good to remember my name id.at.these incidents,according to the complaint,exemplif y oliva objectification of men in general and her concentration on me in particular as an object of attraction.id.at.later argo added vague allegations of a control thing.id.at.he told the company that he dread ed coming to work and felt miserable sometimes in not wanting to come to work to face brenda.id.at.to remedy the situation,he asked for a transfer to a different supervisor and for m y to be removed from my file.id.at.for her part,oliva reacted with t otal shock.id.at.she denied touching argo foot,and did not remember saying nice legs to him years earlier.id.at.she acknowledged that the birthday card was probably inappropriate,but explained that she thought he would only see the humor in it.id.at.asked to speculate as to why argo would accuse her of sexual harassment,she said,b ecause i have written him up.id.at.
an internal company investigation commenced immediately,but was not able to substantiate anything and ended on january.id.at.apparently oliva received counseling from her manager on what is appropriate behavior for someone in a management position,but the company took no other official action.id.
argo missed all three of his monthly targets for january.on her monthly report,dated january,oliva issued an ultimatum if you do not met sic your february and march monthly goal s you will be terminated from blue cross blue shield of kansas.id.at.on january,argo arrived late for work and failed to work on old leads as directed.the next day,january,he was fired.a memorandum describing the decision cited the infractions of january as the precipitating events.as he left the office after packing his belongings,argo told a,you know what this is about.id.
argo filed a lawsuit against blue cross blue shield in federal court,alleging reverse sex discrimination and retaliation under title vii.during his deposition,counsel for blue cross blue shield pressed argo to explain why he believed his termination was the product of discrimination because of sex as required under a.when asked if any other iess,male or female,ever had that difficulty with the job and either quit or were fired,argo replied,there could have been,and i do recall specifically any one person.is possible,yeah.app.asked whether any other iess were fired for poor performance with respect to their sales goals,argo replied,i do recall it could very well have happened.id.at.
blue cross blue shield moved for summary judgment,noting that there was no evidence in the record to suggest that female iess received preferential treatment.in response,argo filed an affidavit stating,in paragraph,that n o female individual enrollment specialists was sic terminated during my employment for failing to make monthly or yearly goals.id.at.the affidavit recited that argo was personally familiar with the matters contained within this affidavit.id.at.the district court struck paragraph of the affidavit,disregarding it as a,sham affidavit,calculated to manufacture a sham issue of fact.id.at.specifically,the court found that paragraph could not be based on personal knowledge and that it contradicts his deposition testimony.id.at.with no other evidence to support a claim of reverse sex discrimination,the district court held that argo had failed to establish a prima facie case.as to the retaliation claim,the district court found that blue cross blue shield had easily satisfied its burden to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the termination,and that argo had failed to establish that its reasons were pretextual.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment for blue cross blue shield on both claims.
argo now appeals,not only from the summary judgment rulings but also from the district court decision to strike paragraph from the affidavit and to disregard that evidence.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court decision granting summary judgment de novo,resolving all factual disputes and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.fuerschbach southwest airlines,cir.summary judgment is warranted only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
at the summary judgment stage,evidence need not be submitted in a form that would be admissible at trial.celotex catrett,d.parties may,for example,submit affidavits in support of summary judgment,despite the fact that affidavits are often inadmissible at trial as hearsay,on the theory that the evidence may ultimately be presented at trial in an admissible form.bryant farmers ins,cir.nonetheless,the content or substance of the evidence must be admissible.thomas int l bus,cir.thus,for example,at summary judgment courts should disregard inadmissible hearsay statements contained in affidavits,as those statements could not be presented at trial in any form.see hardy phosphates,cir.the requirement that the substance of the evidence must be admissible is not only explicit in rule,which provides that s upporting and opposing affidavits shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence.e,but also implicit in the court role at the summary judgment stage.to determine whether genuine issues of material fact make a jury trial necessary,a court necessarily may consider only the evidence that would be available to the jury.see truck ins.exch.magnetek,cir affirming summary judgment,in light of the available evidence,because j ury verdicts may not be based on speculation or inadmissible evidence or be contrary to uncontested admissible evidence.we review a district court evidentiary rulings at the summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion.jones barnhart,cir.
paragraph of argo affidavit 
as an initial matter,argo appeals from the district court decision to strike and disregard paragraph of his affidavit opposing summary judgment,which reads no female individual enrollment specialists sic was terminated during my employment for failing to make monthly or yearly goals.app.the district court cited three related grounds for disregarding paragraph that a affidavit is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on summary judgment that paragraph contradicts argo deposition testimony and attempts to create a sham fact issue and that the allegations of paragraph are not based on personal knowledge.app.we focus on the district court third reason for excluding paragraph.
in finding that the allegations were not based on personal knowledge,the district court relied on district of kansas rule d,which requires that a ffidavits or declarations shall be made on personal knowledge,but it might just as easily have relied on rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,which requires that s upporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge,or rule of the federal rules of evidence,which requires that testifying witnesses ha ve personal knowledge of the matter.under the personal knowledge standard,an affidavit is inadmissible if the witness could not have actually perceived or observed that which he testifies to.united states sinclair,cir quoting fed.credit union cumis ins.soc y,cir.accordingly,at the summary judgment stage,statements of mere belief in an affidavit must be disregarded.tavery united states,cir.
argo affidavit recites in paragraph that he is personally familiar with the matters contained in the affidavit based on his over years of employment with the defendant,blue cross blue shield.app.yet the claim in paragraph,that n o female individual enrollment specialists was sic terminated during my employment for failing to make monthly or yearly goals,id.at,requires knowledge about the performance and discipline of every female ies at the company.as a,and not a human resources official,argo simply was not in a position to acquire such comprehensive knowledge.in his deposition,he named only seven female iess who worked at blue cross blue shield during his tenure,and he admitted that two of them resigned for reasons he did not fully understand while another may in fact have been terminated.moreover,nothing in the record indicates that these women were the only seven females employed by blue cross blue shield as iess during the relevant time period.at best,argo has personal knowledge that a handful of female iess,whose performance and disciplinary history he happened to learn through workplace discussions,were not terminated for missing performance goals.he may well believe the different,stronger claim in paragraph of the affidavit,but his personal knowledge does not extend so far in fact,his deposition testimony acknowledges as much asked directly whether there could have been iess,male or female,who were fired for performance problems,argo said,there could have been i t is possible,yeah.id.at.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in striking and disregarding paragraph of the affidavit for purposes of summary judgment.
b.argo reverse sex discrimination claim 
argo principal claim is that his termination was the product of reverse sex discrimination,in violation of title vii.see a making it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge any individual because of such individual sex.under the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d,the plaintiff bears the initial burden of estab
