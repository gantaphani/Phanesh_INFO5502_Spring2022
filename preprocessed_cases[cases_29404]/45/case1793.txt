in august,just three months after he had begun a new job at thomas weisel partners twp,plaintiff appellant mark stephan stephan had a bicycling accident that resulted in a spinal cord injury,rendering him quadriplegic and thus permanently disabled.stephan was insured under twp disability insurance plan,underwritten and administered by defendant appellee unum life insurance company unum.stephan disputes unum calculation of his earnings,upon which his disability benefits were based.in calculating his earnings,unum included only stephan monthly salary but not his annual bonus.stephan earnings,and therefore his disability benefits,would be considerably higher if the bonus were included.
the central issue in this appeal is whether the bonus should have been counted.the district court reviewed unum decision and upheld unum benefit determination.the court also denied stephan motion to compel discovery of a series of internal memoranda created by unum counsel regarding stephan claim.stephan appeals from each of the district court rulings.
we agree with the district court that the applicable standard of review is abuse of discretion.the district court also correctly held that because unum was responsible both for evaluating benefits claims and paying them,it operated under a conflict of interest,which must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion quoting metro.life ins.glenn,d.however,in determining what weight ought to be given the conflict,the district court erred in three ways first,it failed to apply the traditional rules of summary judgment to its analysis of whether and to what extent a conflict of interest impacted unum benefits determination.second,it incorrectly held that certain internal memoranda between unum claims analyst and its counsel were not discoverable.finally,it did not take into account substantial evidence that unum conflict of interest infiltrated the entire process and therefore ought to be accorded significant weight.montour hartford life accident ins,cir.
we remand to the district court to reconsider the impact of unum conflict of interest correspondingly,what weight to accord the conflict in determining whether unum abused its discretion and ultimately whether unum did indeed abuse its discretion in failing to include stephan bonus in his predisability earnings.
factual and procedural background 
a.the plan 
the disability insurance policy the plan issued by unum to twp,stephan employer,provide d financial protection for twp employees should they become disabled,by ensuring that disabled employees would continue to receive sixty percent of their monthly earnings up to a maximum of.the plan authorized unum to interpret its provisions and to determine claimants eligibility for benefits.
stephan claim 
on april,twp offered stephan a position as managing director in its institutional sales department.stephan offer letter stated,in relevant part 
your salary rate will be annually.your salary will be paid,less payroll deductions and all required withholdings.you will be eligible to participate in thomas weisel partners discretionary bonus program.although bonuses are generally discretionary,you will be guaranteed a bonus for your first months of employment,provided you perform at the level both you and we anticipate and that you have not voluntarily terminated your employment or been terminated for cause prior to the relevant payment dates.
when he accepted his new position,stephan became insured under twp policy,underwritten by unum.
four months later,stephan suffered a severe spinal cord injury in a bicycling accident,as a result of which he became quadriplegic.shortly thereafter,he applied for disability benefits under the plan.on december,unum sent stephan a letter stating that his disability claim had been approved and specifying that stephan would receive disability benefits of per month.unum based this amount on stephan annual salary of per year.later that month,twp paid stephan the bonus promised in his offer letter.
stephan appealed unum benefits determination,arguing that his benefits should have been based not on his annual salary of per year but on an annual income of his base salary plus the annual bonus guaranteed to him in his offer letter.in support of his appeal,stephan pointed to the disability claim form submitted by twp human resources,which stated that stephan annual earnings were the insurance premiums twp paid unum based on that rate of compensation and stephan offer letter guaranteeing him a bonus of.stephan also attached several additional documents to his appeal he provided unum a memo from twp explaining that in each month prior to the date of stephan disability,twp recorded compensation expense,associated with the cash component of his guaranteed bonus payment another memo from twp explaining how the company calculated its insurance premiums and a letter from accountant and former unum director of financial assessment,carol poulin,analyzing stephan claim and finding that stephan monthly income,on which his disability benefits should be based,consists of both his salary and guaranteed bonus.
unum rejected stephan appeal,maintaining that the original basic monthly earnings calculation was correct.the letter from unum rejecting stephan appeal observed 
as stephan began working in april and stopped working in august he did not work a full months and it is apparent that twp went outside their own employment agreement when stephan received a bonus in december.this is consistent with the information provided in a december,conference call with twp representatives when they indicated that they intended to morally honor his contract.
further,unum stated that it did 
not appear stephan bonus was a true accrual as indicated by twp.if it were truly an accrual,the bonus would have been paid monthly,which would have been reflected in stephan payroll records.
unum noted that contrary to stephan claim that twp paid insurance premiums on a salary of,unum premium billing department confirmed that premiums for stephan disability coverage were based on earnings of not his salary at the time of disability and not including any bonus.finally,unum rejected the analysis of accountant carol poulin.poulin,unum stated,did not take into account the fact that stephan bonus was contingent on a level of performance over the months of employment,which stephan did not complete.accordingly,unum continued,we have determined that his analysis and conclusions are flawed.
procedural history 
this case was initially filed in the superior court of california and then removed by unum to federal court.the district court resolved it in three stages.
first,the court ruled on the parties for summary adjudication regarding the standard of review to be applied to the case.because the plan contained a provision delegating discretionary authority over its interpretation to unum,the court held that the proper standard of review was abuse of discretion.the court rejected stephan contention that the discretionary provision was void either because of a settlement agreement between unum and the state of california or because it was in violation of california public policy.
in addition,the district court initial decision held that,absent privilege,certain memoranda between unum counsel and the claims analyst responsible for stephan claim were discoverable,because they might help demonstrate whether and to what extent unum was operating under a conflict of interest.the court withheld any determination,however,on whether the privilege protects these documents pending briefing on the applicability to the documents of the fiduciary exception to privilege.
second,after the parties briefed the issue,the district court ruled on the discoverability of these memoranda.although the court assumed without deciding that the fiduciary exception to privilege generally applies to erisa plans such as twp,it held that the exception did not apply in this case,because the interests of plaintiff and defendant had sufficiently diverged at the time the disputed memoranda were created.therefore,it held,unum need not produce the documents.
finally,on for summary judgment on the merits,the district court ruled that unum conflict of interest did not weigh heavily upon its process in this case,and more generally,that unum had not abused its discretion in excluding stephan bonus from its calculation of the monthly earnings upon which it based its disability payments.the court therefore granted unum motion for summary judgment,and denied stephan.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
erisa benefit determinations are reviewed de novo,unless the benefit plan provides otherwise.glenn,at.where the plan grant s the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits,trust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate.id.internal quotation marks,citations,and alteration omitted.
the benefit plan in this case delegates discretionary authority to unum stephan contends,however,that,for two reasons,the plan discretionary authority provisions must be disregarded and unum benefits determination reviewed de novo.first,stephan maintains that the california settlement agreement,an agreement between unum and the california department of insurance,prohibits the discretionary authority provision.second,he argues the discretionary provision is contrary to california state law and therefore void.both arguments fail.
background 
cal.b provides that the california insurance commissioner shall not approve any disability policy for insurance or delivery in california that does not meet certain requirements.in particular,b prohibits the commissioner from approving a policy 
i f the commissioner finds that it contains any provision,or has any label,description of its contents,title,heading,backing,or other indication of its provisions which is unintelligible,uncertain,ambiguous,or abstruse,or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered,delivered or issued.
the insurance code provides not only that the commissioner may deny approval to policies that do not meet this standard,but also that 
t he commissioner may withdraw approval of filing of any policy or other document or matter required to be approved by the commissioner,or filed with him or her,by this chapter when the commissioner would be authorized to disapprove or refuse filing of the same if originally submitted at the time of the action of withdrawal.
id.f.finally,the code states that any insurance policy issued 
on a form approved by the commissioner,and in accordance with the conditions,if any,contained in the approval,at a time when that approval is shall,as between the insurer and the insured,or any person claiming under the policy,be conclusively presumed to comply with,and conform to,this section.
on february,the commissioner issued a notice that it intended to withdraw approval of several insurance forms,including the form upon which twp disability policy was written,because they contained discretionary authority provisions.such provisions,the commissioner explained,render a policy fraudulent or unsound insurance within the meaning of california insurance code because they make insurance payments contingent on the unfettered discretion of the insurer,thereby rendering the contract potentially illusory.the notice stated that the withdrawal of approval would be effective within days unless,within days,an adversely affected insurer requested a hearing.
unum requested such a hearing.after the hearing,the administrative hearing officer issued a proposed decision upholding the commissioner notice of withdrawal.the decision stated that the discretionary provisions included in the policies at issue create a legal ambiguity and are likely to mislead the insured,in violation of cal.in eliminating discretionary clauses in disability insurance policies,the decision reasoned,the commissioner is fulfilling the statute direction that he is to assure that all insurance policies can be readily understood and interpreted.the commissioner adopted the opinion,stating that it would take effect on april,unless the affected insurers agree in writing before that date to amend all insurance product forms to delete all discretionary clauses or other language having the same legal effect.
unum filed a writ of mandate with the san francisco superior court challenging the commissioner notice and his order adopting the hearing decision.on october,unum and the california department of insurance reached a settlement agreement,the california settlement agreement csa.pursuant to the csa,unum withdrew its writ of mandate and agreed to make various changes to its insurance forms.
california settlement agreement 
the csa requires unum to 
discontinue use of a ny provision that has the effect of conferring unlimited discretion on unum or other plan administrator to interpret policy language,or requires an abuse of discretion standard of review if a lawsuit ensues in any california contract sold after the date set forth in section 
the agreement defines california contract as a policy of disability income insurance which is subject to the jurisdiction of and approved by the department of insurance.section v of the csa provides that 
a ny language having the effect of a discretionary authority provision shall not be applied to any california contract sold after the csa effective date november.a discretionary authority provision shall not be included in any new policies issued as california contracts or included in summary plan descriptions spds in plans generated or issued by the company,after the csa effective date so long as its omission from the policy form or spd is consistent with what is permitted by applicable california statutory and case law.discretionary authority provisions in existing california contracts that were issued prior to the date of the order of the commissioner are not affected by the csa.
whereas the csa provisions relating to discretionary authority apply to policies sold after the csa effective date,the csa requires that other changes,such as,for example,exclusions for conditions,be made in all new policies as well as all policies upon renewal after the csa effective date.thus,by its terms,the csa distinguishes between changes,like the prohibition on discretionary authority provisions,that apply only to new policies,and those that apply to both new policies and policies upon renewal.both parties interpret the csa as providing that policies already extant on the csa effective date and renewals of such policies are not subject to the agreement prohibition on discretionary authority provisions,whereas new policies sold after the csa effective date are subject to the prohibition 
stephan argues that the policy under which he was insured was a new policy,issued after the csa effective date,and that therefore its discretionary authority provision is void.we disagree.
unum first issued the relevant disability insurance policy to twp in,years before the effective date of the csa.twp renewed the policy annually.between and,the plan was amended six times.the amendment stated that it form ed a part of group policy,the policy originally issued to twp in.it also stated that t he entire policy is replaced by the policy attached to this amendment.the attached policy was the same as the previous version,issued in,with the exception of a few changes to provisions that insurance companies are explicitly permitted to amend upon renewal without seeking permission of the commissioner while the effective date of the amendment was listed as january,the policy as a whole retained its original effective date,june.
stephan contends that because the amendment stated that it replaced the previous policy,the contract can not be understood as a renewal but must be viewed as an entirely new policy.unum responds that the language does not indicate an intent to create a new policy,but rather was included simply to avoid confusion rather than requiring policyholders to read both the policy and any amendments,unum inserted the amendments into the text of the policy,such that all policy information was contained in a single document.reviewing the contract as a whole,we agree with unum characterization and hold that the policy under which stephan was insured constituted a renewal within the meaning of the csa.
first,as noted,any changes between the and policies were minimal and permitted under california law.
second,the language of the amendment itself indicates that the policy to which it is attached is a renewal.the amendment states that t he policy terms and provisions will apply other than as stated in this amendment.were the policy entirely new and not a renewal,this language would make little sense,as the reference to the policy would have no meaning.furthermore,the repeated use of the word amendment in the contract indicates that it did not constitute a new policy,but rather a continuation of the old policy with minimal,permitted changes.
the amendment also states that t his amendment forms a part of group policy issued to the policy holder thomas weisel partners llc,the policy issued to twp in,and that t he effective date of these changes is january,emphasis added.this language further confirms that the policy was not a renewal by indicating that while the changes were effective as of january,the remainder of the policy as a whole retained its original effective date.indeed,the effective date of the policy continued to be listed as june.
the csa refers to existing california contracts as those issued prior to the order of the commissioner emphasis added.the retention of the effective date on the amended policy is the strongest indicator that the policy was issued in,prior to the csa.
overall,then,the language and structure of the contract,taken together,indicate that the original policy remained in effect.in support of his position to the contrary,stephan relies on cases holding that t he renewal of a policy is a new contract of insurance citing borders great falls yosemite ins,d.but the cases stephan cites are and inapplicable to the question at issue here.as we noted above,the csa explicitly differentiates between new policies and renewals.if all renewals constituted new policies under the csa,the csa differentiation between the two would be meaningless.stephan reliance on cases where no such distinction was made is therefore misplaced.
because the language and structure of the policy clearly indicates that it is a renewal of the existing policy,initially effective june,its discretionary authority provisions are unaffected by the csa.
california public policy 
stephan alternative position is that in,the inclusion of discretionary provisions in insurance polices violated california law and that any such provisions in the plan are therefore void.this argument is also unavailing.
under california law,insurance policies are governed by the statutory and decisional law in force at the time the policy is issued.such provisions are read into each policy thereunder,and become a part of the contract with full binding effect upon each party.interins.exch.of the auto.club of cal.ohio cas.ins,cal d,internal quotation marks omitted.this principle governs not only new policies but also renewals each renewal incorporates any changes in the law that occurred prior to the renewal.see modglin state farm mut.auto.ins,d.steven plitt,daniel maldonado joshua rogers,couch on insurance ed.so,even though the policy under which stephan was insured was a renewal,it was nevertheless subject to any relevant california law in place at the time it was issued.the law in effect at the time of renewal of a policy governs the policy even if that law is subsequently changed or repealed.see interins.exch.of the auto.club,cal d at.
in,there was no california statute explicitly prohibiting discretionary provisions.stephan relies on cal.b which provided then and provides now that 
t he commissioner shall not approve any disability policy for insurance or delivery in this state i f the commissioner finds that it contains any provision,or has any label,description of its contents,title,heading,backing,or other indication of its provisions which is unintelligible,uncertain,ambiguous,or abstruse,or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered,delivered or issued.
this reliance is misplaced.
as we explained above,the commissioner notice that he would withdraw approval from policies containing discretionary clauses,the administrative hearing officer proposed decision approving such notice,and the commissioner order adopting that decision together,the commissioner decision or the decision held that discretionary clauses create uncertainty about how a policy will be enforced and therefore what entitlements it ultimately guarantees.for that reason,the commissioner decided such clauses render insurance policies misleading and ambiguous in violation of cal.b.
this decision did not,as stephan contends,render void all discretionary provisions contained in policies issued or renewed after it was made.section b does not directly void any policy or policy provision,even those that fail to conform with its strictures.rather,b provides the commissioner grounds for refusing to approve or withdrawing approval from any policy.see id.b id.f.specifically,the statute provides that any policies that are approved by the commissioner and are in accordance with the conditions,if any,contained in the approval shall be conclusively presumed to comply with,and conform to.id.k emphasis added.thus,r egardless of whether the insurance commissioner should have approved the policy,an otherwise valid policy is a binding contract and governs the obligations of the parties until the commissioner revokes his approval.peterson am.life health ins,cir.
the policy form upon which the plan was written was approved by the department of insurance in after unum and the california department of insurance reached a settlement agreement,the policy form was,subject to the terms of the csa.as discussed above,because it was a renewal,the plan could contain a discretionary authority provision and remain in compliance with the csa.because the plan was approved by the commissioner,under k,it must be conclusively presumed to comply with california law.
in sum,the plan discretionary authority provision did not violate the terms of the csa,nor is the provision void under california law.we therefore review unum decision for abuse of discretion.see glenn,at.
iii.conflict of interest 
as we have explained,because the plan grants discretionary authority to unum,we review unum benefits decision for an abuse of that discretion.see glenn,at firestone tire rubber bruch,d salomaa honda long term disability plan,cir.under this deferential standard,a plan administrator decision will not be disturbed if reasonable.conkright frommert,d internal quotation marks omitted salomaa,at internal quotation marks omitted.this reasonableness standard requires deference to the administrator benefits decision unless it is illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.salomaa,at internal quotation marks omitted.
this abuse of discretion standard,however,is not the end of the story.instead,the degree of skepticism with which we regard a plan administrator decision when determining whether the administrator abused its discretion varies based upon the extent to which the decision appears to have been affected by a conflict of interest.id.
under erisa,unum has a duty to process claims solely in the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries.glenn,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.but because unum both decides who gets benefits and pays for them,it also has a direct financial incentive to deny claims.saffon wells fargo.long term disability plan,cir see also glenn,at,abatie alta health life ins,cir en banc.unum dual role as plan administrator,authorized to determine the amount of benefits owed,and insurer,responsible for paying such benefits,creates a structural conflict of interest.see glenn,at.
while not altering the standard of review itself,the existence of a conflict of interest is a factor to be considered in determining whether a plan administrator has abused its discretion.id.at.the weight of this factor depends upon the likelihood that the conflict impacted the administrator decisionmaking.where,for example,an insurer has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy,the conflict may be given minimal weight in reviewing the insurer benefits decisions.id.at.in contrast,where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that the conflict affected the benefits decision,the conflict should prove more important perhaps of great importance.id.
the district court held that unum conflict of interest did not weigh heavily upon its process in this case and therefore does not tip the scale towards a finding of an abuse of discretion.in reaching this conclusion,the district court erred by failing to apply traditional principles of summary judgment denying stephan motion to compel discovery of certain internal memoranda between unum claim analyst and its counsel and ignoring evidence that unum has a history of biased decisionmaking that indicates that its conflict of interest in this case ought to be given more weight.
traditional summary judgment principles have limited application in erisa cases governed by the abuse of discretion standard.nolan heald college,cir.where,as here,the abuse of discretion standard applies in an erisa benefits denial case,a motion for summary judgment is,in most respects,merely the conduit to bring the legal question before the district court and the usual tests of summary judgment,such as whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists,do not apply.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
consideration of a conflict of interest is,however,an exception to this feature of erisa cases as the traditional rules of summary judgment do apply.id.as to issues regarding the nature and impact of a conflict of interest,summary judgment may only be granted if after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,there is no indication that the district court viewed the evidence of bias in the light most favorable to stephan.rather,as in nolan,without evidentiary hearing or bench trial,the district court considered and rejected stephan bias argument by weighing the documentary evidence of bias,and ignoring the protections that summary judgment usually affords the party.id.this was error.
on remand,the district court may,but need not,hold a bench trial to determine the impact of unum conflict of interest.see id.such a trial would ensure the full bias inquiry necessary to determine what weight to give a conflict of interest.id.the district court may,however,rule once again on summary judgment if a renewed motion is made.but it must do so in accordance with the traditional summary judgment principles.
in particular,it should,where relevant,permit the admission of evidence outside the administrative record.although,for the most part,judicial review of benefits determinations is limited to the administrative record that is,the record upon which the plan administrator relied in making its benefits decision the evaluation of a conflict of interest is not so limited.id.evidence outside the administrative record is properly considered in determining the extent to which a conflict of interest affected an administrator decision.id.
here,as explained further below,the district court should consider any relevant evidence about unum history of biased decisionmaking any evidence that its decisionmaking was biased in this case,including the internal memoranda between stephan claim analyst and its counsel as well as any evidence that unum took steps to reduce the potential impact of a conflict of interest,either in general or in this case.and,if considered on summary judgment,the district court should view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.id.
in an effort to demonstrate to the district court that unum operated under a conflict of interest,stephan sought to discover a series of internal memoranda created between december and february by unum counsel,at the request of unum claims analyst.stephan argues that although ordinarily such memoranda would fall under the privilege,unum is a fiduciary of twp erisa plan,and therefore the fiduciary exception to the privilege permits his discovery of the memoranda.
the district court assumed without deciding that the fiduciary exception applied to erisa plans like twp.but it held that the exception did not apply in this case because the interests of plaintiff and defendant had sufficiently diverged at the time the disputed memoranda were created.we agree that the fiduciary exception applies to erisa plans but disagree with the district court holding that it is inapplicable here.
as applied in the erisa context,the fiduciary exception provides that an employer acting in the capacity of erisa fiduciary is disabled from asserting the privilege against plan beneficiaries on matters of plan administration.united states mett,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although the ninth circuit has held that the fiduciary exception applies generally in the erisa context,see id.at,whether it applies to insurance companies in particular is a question of first impression in this circuit 
the justifications for excepting erisa fiduciaries from privilege apply equally to insurance companies.in particular,courts have cited two rationales for applying an exception to the privilege to erisa fiduciaries s ome courts have held that the exception derives from an erisa trustee duty to disclose to plan beneficiaries all information regarding plan administration.mett,at.on this view,the privilege is subordinated to the fiduciary disclosure obligation.see id.citing in re long island lighting,cir.
other courts have reasoned that because the erisa fiduciary is a representative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is administering,it is not the fiduciary,but rather the plan beneficiary that is the real client.mett,at internal quotation marks omitted.on this view,the fiduciary exception is not really an exception at all.privilege is maintained there is only a different understanding of the identity of the client.id.
neither of these theories provides any basis for distinguishing erisa trustees,to whom the ninth circuit has already extended the fiduciary exception,from insurance companies also serving in the role of erisa fiduciary.the duty of an erisa fiduciary to disclose all information regarding plan administration applies equally to insurance companies as to trustees.
erisa has broad disclosure requirements it requires that every employee benefit plan afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.because t he opportunity to review pertinent documents is critical to a full and fair review,ellis metropolitan life insurance,cir,the regulations implementing this provision require that upon request,a claimant be provided all information relevant to the claimant claim for benefits,h ii.neither the statute nor the regulations provide any reason why the disclosure of information is any less important where an insurer,rather than a trustee or other erisa fiduciary,is the decisionmaker.
similarly,the obligation that an erisa fiduciary act in the interest of the plan beneficiary does not differ depending on whether that fiduciary is a trustee or an insurer.there is therefore no principled basis for excluding insurers from the fiduciary exception.
the district court held that even if the fiduciary exception applies to erisa plans,the particular documents requested by stephan do not fall within this exception because they were created after stephan counsel contacted unum and an adversarial relationship had begun.after reviewing these documents in camera,we disagree.
the fiduciary exception has its limits by agreeing to serve as a fiduciary,an erisa trustee is not completely debilitated from enjoying a confidential relationship.mett,at.mett addressed these limits,considering whether the fiduciary exception applied to two memoranda written by a law firm that wore many hats,serving at various times as counsel to two erisa trustees personally and in their capacities as erisa plan trustees,to a corporation as a corporation and in its role as plan administrator,and to the erisa plans themselves.id.at.the memoranda were written to the trustees and relate d to the potential civil and criminal consequences the trustees might face due to illegal actions they had taken in administering an erisa plan.id.
in analyzing whether the documents fell within the fiduciary exception,mett explained 
t he case authorities mark out two ends of a spectrum.on the one hand,where an erisa trustee seeks an attorney advice on a matter of plan administration and where the advice clearly does not implicate the trustee in any personal capacity,the trustee can not invoke the privilege against the plan beneficiaries.on the other hand,where a plan fiduciary retains counsel in order to defend herself against the plan beneficiaries or the government acting in their stead,the privilege remains intact.
id.at.the memoranda at issue in mett,we held,fell within the latter category.they were not rendering advice on a matter of plan administration,but were plainly defensive on the trustees part and aimed at advising the trustees how far they were in peril.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
here,the documents sought fall on the other end of the mett spectrum.the documents at issue are notes of conversations between unum claims analysts and unum counsel about how the insurance policy under which stephan was covered ought to be interpreted and whether stephan bonus ought to be considered monthly earnings within the meaning of the plan.unlike the memoranda in mett,the disputed documents offer advice solely on how the plan ought to be interpreted.they do not address any potential civil or criminal liability unum might face,nor is there any indication that they were prepared with such liability in mind.
unum argues that,nevertheless,the fiduciary exception ought not apply to the documents because of the context in which they were created.the memoranda,unum contends,were all created after unum had received correspondence from stephan counsel,and therefore after there was an indication that the parties may become adverse.there is no binding precedent in this circuit delineating precisely when the interests of a plan fiduciary and its beneficiary become sufficiently adverse that the fiduciary exception no longer applies.courts that have considered the issue,however,have repeatedly rejected the argument that the prospect of litigation is enough to overcome the fiduciary exception.allen honeywell ret.earnings plan,d,internal quotation marks omitted see,geissal moore med,klein,d at collecting cases.most courts have held that it is not until after the final determination that is,after the final administrative appeal that the interests of the plan fiduciary and the beneficiary diverge for purposes of application of the fiduciary exception.see klein,d at.we agree with the weight of authority.the context of the documents at issue here communications in advance of unum decision on stephan appeal indicates that their goal was the determination of stephan earnings,a matter of plan administration,and was not preparation for litigation.
the content of the documents confirms this conclusion.whereas the mett memoranda were prepared to advise erisa trustees regarding their own personal civil and criminal exposure in light of undocumented withdrawals that had already occurred,mett,at,the documents here were prepared to advise unum claims analysts about how best to interpret the plan,and were communicated to the analysts before any final determination on stephan claim had been made.the content of the documents was thus about plan administration,a topic to which,under mett,the fiduciary exception applies.
in sum,advice on the amount of benefits stephan was owed under the plan,given before unum had made any final determination on his claim,constitutes advice on plan administration.such advice was given before the interests of stephan and unum became adverse.the fiduciary exception to the privilege therefore applies to the documents at issue here.absent some other basis for withholding them,the district court,on remand,should permit discovery of the documents.
the supreme court instructed in glenn that a conflict of interest should prove more important perhaps of great importance where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.glenn,at.in so stating,glenn cited a law review article detailing such a history for one large insurer.id.citing john langbein,trust law as regulatory law the scandal and judicial review of benefit denials under erisa,nw.that insurer was unum.id.
numerous courts,including ours,have commented on unum history of erroneous and arbitrary benefits denials,bad faith contract misinterpretations,and other unscrupulous tactics,mccauley first unum life ins,cir quoting radford trust first unum life ins,d,rev on other grounds,cir.indeed,in saffon,we attributed the trend of state prohibitions on discretionary provisions in insurance contracts to the cupidity of one particular insurer,unum provident,which boosted its profits by repeatedly denying benefits claims it knew to be valid.unum provident internal memos revealed that the company senior officers relied on erisa deferential standard of review to avoid detection and liability.at see also radford trust,d at collecting cases.moreover,the csa notes that unum was subject to a multistate targeted examination of its claims handling practices,which resulted in a settlement agreement similar to the csa.and the csa was the product of investigations by the state of california into unum claims handling practices.
the district court held that stephan had not demonstrated a history of biased claims administration.given the public record and the record in this case,that conclusion is incorrect.
furthermore,unum did not present any evidence indicating that it made any effort to mitigate its conflict of interest.unum was not required to present evidence demonstrating its efforts to achieve claims administration neutrality.montour,at.but the supreme court decision in glenn placed it on notice as to the potential significance of such evidence in defense of a suit by a claimant challenging an adverse benefits determination.id.glenn explained that a conflict of interest would 
prove less important perhaps to the vanishing point where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy,for example,by walling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances,or by imposing management checks that penalize inaccurate decisionmaking irrespective of whom the inaccuracy benefits.
at.so far,unum has presented no such evidence.
in reconsidering the weight to accord to unum conflict of interest,the district court should take into account the public record of unum history of biased decisionmaking as well as any evidence of such history stephan produces.in addition,it should allow unum the opportunity to demonstrate that,before making the decision on stephan claim,it implemented procedures to mitigate possible bias.
as we have explained,on remand,the district court should reconsider what weight to give unum conflict of interest in its analysis of whether unum abused its discretion.in particular,the court must determine whether the conflict may have tainted the entire administrative decisionmaking process and therefore the stated bases for unum decision ought to be reviewed with enhanced skepticism.montour,at.although we express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of this inquiry,we note that there are several aspects of unum decision that might well indicate that bias infiltrated the entire decisionmaking process.id.at.
first,unum interpretation of the language of the plan rests on terms that do not appear in the relevant text.the plan entitled stephan to sixty percent of his monthly earnings up to a maximum of.it specified that 
monthly earnings means your average gross monthly income as figured 
from the income box on your w form which reflects wages,tips and other compensation received from your employer for the two just prior to your date of disability or 
for the period of your employment with your employer if you have been employed less than two full calendar years prior to your date of disability.
average gross monthly income is your total income before taxes.it is prior to any deductions made for contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan,section plan,or flexible spending account.it does not include income received from car,housing or moving allowances,employer contributions to a qualified deferred compensation plan,or income received from sources other than your employer.
as stephan worked for less than a year before becoming disabled,his plan benefit was to be calculated based on his average gross monthly income for the period of his employment at twp.
as noted above,in the letter offering stephan employment,twp provided 
your salary rate will be annually you will be eligible to participate in thomas weisel partners discretionary bonus program.although bonuses are generally discretionary,you will be guaranteed a bonus for your first months of employment,provided you perform at the level both you and we anticipate and that you have not voluntarily terminated your employment or been terminated for cause prior to the relevant payment dates.
the plan is silent as to whether and how such a bonus ought to be included in stephan gross monthly earnings if he is disabled before the bonus is received 
unum insists that the monthly earnings upon which disability benefits are based must be limited to earnings received up to the date of disability.but the language limiting earnings to income already received appears in section a of the definition,applicable after two years of employment,not in section b,which applies to employees disabled after fewer than two years of work.as stephan had worked for less than a year before becoming disabled,it is section b that applies to him.section b contains no reference to when income is received.unum reliance on the term received to interpret section b is therefore misplaced.
furthermore,unum interpretation would make arbitrary distinctions based on an insured length of employment,distinctions not supported by the text of the plan.for example,if stephan had become disabled the day he received his bonus,it would be included in the earnings upon which unum disability payments were based.but if he had become disabled one day before his first bonus was received,it would not be so included,even if he had worked for twelve months at an adequate level and his bonus was,therefore,guaranteed.
in addition,the plan definitions of monthly earnings and gross monthly income are the same total income before taxes regardless of how long an insured has been employed.such earnings are not defined differently based on length of employment,but merely figured differently emphasis added.on unum interpretation,however,for those employees who have received their bonuses,total income would include salary and bonuses.for those whose bonuses are guaranteed but have yet to be paid,such income would include salary only.this result is at odds with the policy language,which defines monthly earnings without regard to length of employment.
finally,interpreting gross monthly income to include only income actually received would mean that employees who became disabled before receiving their first paycheck would receive no disability payments at all.similarly,the disability payments for an employee whose paycheck was incorrect for example someone who had been accidentally underpaid due to a payroll error or intentionally underpaid due to discrimination would be calculated based on this erroneous figure.
the district court expresse d no opinion on these matters,and limit ed its holding to the facts of this action.but the plan applies to all twp employees,not merely stephan,and unum is required by law to ensure that the plan provisions are applied consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.b.unum interpretation of the plan as limiting monthly earnings to income actually received either disregards this obligation or reaches an unsupportable result.
similarly,unum relies on a questionable interpretation of stephan offer letter.as noted above,stephan offer letter provided that his compensation included a guaranteed bonus for his first twelve months of employment emphasis added.stephan bonus was thus a nondiscretionary part of his income,so long as he met the conditions of the offer letter.the letter required only that stephan perform at the level both he and twp anticipate d and that stephan not voluntarily terminate his employment or be terminated for cause prior to the relevant payment dates.
unum decided that because stephan did not work a full months it is apparent that twp went outside their own employment agreement when stephan received a bonus in december.such a conclusion is far from clear from the language of the offer letter.
stephan was certainly not terminated for cause.nor is it sensible to understand his inability to work due to disability as a voluntary termination of employment.and although the bonus was contingent on stephan maintaining a particular level of performance in his first twelve months,the letter does not specify that level.nor is there any indication that stephan fell below any requisite performance standard.finally,the letter does not indicate that periods of disability can not count toward the requisite period of employment.
moreover,the central question at issue in this case is not whether stephan was entitled to receive his bonus in its entirety,but whether he earned it on a pro rata basis each month as part of his income.unum interpretation of the offer letter does not answer that question.in relying on stephan offer letter,unum thus relied on a contractual interpretation that is,at best,only weakly supported by the contractual language.
in support of its decision,unum repeatedly cited a telephone call during which twp general counsel mark fisher stated that twp intended to morally honor stephan contract by paying him his annual bonus even though he had not yet worked twelve months.unum argues that this statement indicates that twp did not consider the bonus a portion of stephan income it was contractually obligated to pay instead,unum contends,twp gave stephan,none of which he was actually owed,out of sympathy for his situation.
unum took this quotation out of context and then proceeded to give it undue weight in its determination of stephan earnings.the text of the notes from which the quotation was drawn states more completely 
received a call from twp they are going to continue payment and honor their contract with the claimant and continue his salary along with the bonus payment and they want a statement in writing that this wil l n ot affect the ltd bens disability benefits and we will not consider this an offset to his earnings.he says as their company is set up and the way most wall street corps are the main income ee employees receive is from bonus and the base salary is a set amount.they want a statement that continued payment of his contract they are going to morally honor will be treated as s al ary cont inuation and not affect his benefits.
emphasis added.in contrast to unum implication,this conversation demonstrates that twp understood stephan bonus not as a discretionary addition to his income,but rather as an integral in fact,the main part of his payment for each month work,despite the fact that it was not to be received until later.twp counsel therefore most probably meant not that it was giving stephan his bonus to be charitable,but rather that it considered the bonus an essential part of stephan salary.
other evidence in the record confirms that twp understood stephan bonus as part of his monthly earnings,and therefore as earnings upon which disability payments ought to be calculated.for example,the claim form twp submitted for stephan listed as his prior to date last worked,a salary of as well as a bonus of for.and in the same conversation upon which unum relies to support its earnings determination,twp also stated that they have an issue with the m
