defendant california fair plan association fair plan seeks a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent trial court to vacate its order denying fair plan motion for summary judgment and to enter a new order granting summary judgment.real party in interest barbara darwish,as trustee of a trust holding real estate,sued fair plan to recover vandalism loss to the property under an insurance policy issued to a third party to whom darwish had assigned a of one percent ownership interest.we issued an alternative writ requiring respondent court to either grant summary judgment or alternatively show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue,and we temporarily stayed all trial court proceedings until further order.we conclude that the failure of the named insured to submit to an examination under oath,pursuant to the policy terms,barred the action against fair plan.accordingly,we grant the peremptory writ of mandate.
plaintiff darwish is the trustee of a trust which holds real property.she unsuccessfully applied for an insurance policy to cover the trust real estate.darwish was advised that fair plan,a fire and vandalism insurance carrier,would not insure real property owned by a trust.thus,she assigned of one percent interest in the property to maurice rivera,who then applied for coverage without telling fair plan he was an assignee and owned only a small portion of the property.fair plan issued to rivera the insurance policy requested.
the property suffered a vandalism loss and rivera filed a claim.fair plan asked rivera to attend an examination under oath as required by the policy and to produce documents and records to adjust the claim.he failed to comply.thereafter,darwish,as trustee,sued fair plan and sought to recover for the vandalism loss.
fair plan demurred to darwish first amended complaint on the ground that darwish lacked standing to sue because she and the trust were not insureds under the policy.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend to allege that rivera had assigned his rights to darwish.darwish then obtained an assignment of the policy from rivera and filed a second amended complaint based on the assignment.
fair plan moved for summary judgment on four grounds that darwish is not entitled to payment because rivera failed to submit to an examination under oath and thus never established a right to payment that darwish action is barred by the policy suit limitation that her action is barred because rivera failed to comply with policy provisions and thus did not establish a right to bring suit and that darwish lacked standing to maintain her suit because rivera purported assignment of his fair plan policy was invalid.
the trial court denied the motion concluding fair plan failed to show it was prejudiced by any delay in rivera submitting to an examination under oath.it also determined that rivera could recover the entire vandalism loss despite his minuscule ownership interest and thus the assignment did not subject fair plan to any greater risk had rivera not assigned his policy rights.this petition followed.
discussion 
our order granting the alternative writ requested that respondent show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue on the ground the failure of a named insured to submit to examination under oath concerning a loss claim under the policy negates the duty of the insurer to pay on the claim and thus bars a suit to compel such payment,without a showing of resulting prejudice by the insurer,because submission to examination is a condition precedent to the duty to pay on the claim.we cited four cases,hickman london assurance cal,globe indemnity superior court th,d,robinson national auto.ins.d,and west state farm fire and cas.cir.
hickman concerned an insured lawsuit to recover for fire loss on multiple insurers policies.hickman london assurance,supra,cal.at.the insured and his employee were charged with arson as a result of the fire,but the charges against the insured were eventually dismissed.the employee was convicted of arson.id.at.the insurance policies provided that the insured shall submit to examination under oath no suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustained until full compliance by the insured with all of the foregoing requirements.id.at.insurers made a written demand that the insured submit to examination while the arson charge was still pending.although the insured appeared at the examination,he refused to answer questions on advice of counsel.instead,he offered to submit to examination after the conclusion of the criminal case,and if appellants or their designated adjuster would cause the arson charged to be dismissed,the insured offered to submit to examination any time.id.at.the trial court entered a judgment for the insured.id.at.
the california supreme court reversed the judgment.hickman london assurance,supra,cal.at.because the demand for examination was made pursuant to the insurance policies,insurers had the right to demand compliance by insured as often as required,and the performance was a condition precedent to any right of action.id.at.the court determined that since the insured was in default after dismissal of the arson charge,insurers were under no duty to reopen their demand for examination.id.at.
in globe indemnity superior court,supra,insureds michael and roberta guarnieri sued their insurer for bad faith.th at,d.they made a claim pursuant to their uninsured motorist coverage after their daughter was injured while riding as a passenger on a stolen motorcycle involved in a police chase.id.at,d.the policy excluded coverage for use of a vehicle without a reasonable belief that the person was entitled to do so.the insurer investigated the circumstances surrounding use of the motorcycle by the insureds daughter.the insureds and their attorney did not cooperate with the insurer attempts to question the daughter.id.at,d.eventually,a few months after the insureds suit was filed,the daughter appeared for deposition.upon her testimony that she did not know the motorcycle was stolen,insurer acknowledged coverage.id.at,d.it then moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication,and the trial court denied the motion.ibid.
the insurer successfully petitioned for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues.globe indemnity superior court,supra,th at,d.as a matter of law,the insurer delay in processing the claim at issue was reasonable in that plaintiffs failed to timely provide the information required under the terms of the insurance policy.ibid.the policy at issue required a person seeking insurance coverage to cooperate with the insurer in the investigation,settlement or defense of any claim or suit.id.at,d.it required the insured to s ubmit,as often as we the insurer reasonably require to examination under oath and subscribe the same.id.at,d.the right to require the insured to submit to an examination under oath concerning all proper subjects of inquiry is reasonable as a matter of law.the contractual duty to pay policy proceeds did not arise until plaintiffs provided the information necessary to allow insurer to determine whether the accident was covered under the terms of the policy there can be no unreasonable delay until the insurer receives adequate information to process the claim and reach an agreement with the insureds.insurer did not receive adequate information to process the claim until after aimee submitted to examination under oath pursuant to the terms of the insurance policy.globe indemnity superior court,supra,th at,d.
