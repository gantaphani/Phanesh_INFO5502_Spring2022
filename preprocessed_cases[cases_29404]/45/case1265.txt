we have consolidated for purposes of disposition two cases that require us to determine whether an amendment to the fair credit reporting act fcra eliminating private rights of action has an impermissible retroactive effect when applied to fcra claims that accrued prior to the amendment effective date.linda killingsworth received a prescreened credit card offer from household bank,sometime prior to august.she claims the offer contained fcra disclosures that were not clear and conspicuous.the plaintiff in the second suit,eric sawyer,applied for auto insurance with ensurance insurance services,ensurance in october.ensurance obtained his credit report in connection with that application.sawyer contends ensurance violated the fcra by charging him a higher rate based on negative information in his credit report without giving him notice of that adverse action,and also by using his initial credit information for subsequent renewals of his policy when corrected credit information would have qualified him for a lower rate.
both plaintiffs filed class action lawsuits in the northern district of illinois.both complaints were dismissed based on section of the fair and accurate credit transactions act of facta,which amended the fcra to eliminate enforcement of certain fcra provisions by private civil suit.see h.sawyer and killingsworth argue that the amendment,effective december,impairs rights they possessed prior to the new statute effective date and therefore has an impermissible retroactive effect if applied to them.
as to killingsworth claim,we agree and therefore reverse.in sawyer case,however,the retroactivity question can not be decided at the pleading stage because the conduct alleged in his complaint straddles facta effective date.the allegations,if true,could establish that an fcra violation occurred before facta effective date,and this is enough to survive the motion to dismiss.
background 
on december,congress enacted facta,which amended portions of the fcra.facta section added subsection h to of the fcra.paragraph of that subsection provides 
enforcement 
a no civil actions.sections and of this title pertaining to private civil remedies shall not apply to any failure by any person to comply with this section.
b administrative enforcement.this section shall be enforced exclusively under section of this title by the federal agencies and officials identified in that section.
h.congress authorized the federal trade commission and the board of governors of the federal reserve system to set the effective dates of various facta provisions,including section.fair and accurate credit transactions act of,stat,at.on february,the board of governors promulgated regulations setting an effective date of december,for h.c xiii.
sometime prior to august,linda killingsworth received a prescreened offer of credit from household bank.this offer was based on killingsworth credit report,though she never gave household authorization to access that information.these mailings,sent to at least illinois residents,targeted people with poor credit or who had recently obtained bankruptcy discharges.enclosed with the offer was a pamphlet containing disclosures about credit terms and a statement of compliance with d fcra notice provision.
in october killingsworth filed a class action against household bank now known as hsbc bank nevada,household credit services,and hsbc north america holdings,collectively household,claiming a violation of d killingsworth alleged the statutorily required disclosures were buried in an insert and were neither clear nor conspicuous.household answered and moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that h,which eliminated private rights of action for violations,applied to killingsworth claim and required dismissal of the suit.the district court granted the motion,holding that h applied to all cases filed after december,the amendment effective date,provided the noncomplying disclosure was received after december,the amendment date of enactment.
eric sawyer applied for auto insurance with ensurance in october.as part of the application process,ensurance pulled sawyer credit report and used information in that report to determine the cost of his policy.sawyer insurance took effect on december,and was renewed twice thereafter at intervals.
sawyer filed a class action alleging ensurance violated a of the fcra by offering him a less favorable rate based on negative information in his credit report without providing him with an adverse action notice.sawyer also alleged that ensurance failed to consider interim changes to his credit rating and instead relied on his initial credit score when subsequently renewing his policy.his corrected credit report,he alleged,showed an improved credit score and would have resulted in a more favorable insurance rate.the district court granted ensurance motion to dismiss,holding that facta eliminated private causes of action under a and this amendment to the fcra applied to sawyer claim.
ii.analysis 
in sawyer case,the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for failure to state a claim.we review the court dismissal order de novo,accepting the complaint allegations as true and drawing all favorable inferences for the plaintiff.savory lyons,cir.rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that a complaint contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.this short and plain statement must be enough to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.bell atlantic twombly,d quoting conley gibson,d.in bell atlantic,the supreme court retooled federal pleading standards,retiring the conley formulation that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley,at.see bell atlantic.at conley famous observation has earned its retirement.
the court explained in bell atlantic that the plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.bell atlantic.at.instead,the court held,the factual allegations in the complaint must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.at see also eeoc concentra health,cir airborne beepers video,v.at t mobility llc,cir.although this does not require heightened fact pleading of specifics,it does require the complaint to contain enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atlantic.at see also john united church of christ city of chicago,wl at cir.in airborne beepers we read twombly together with the supreme court decision two weeks later in erickson pardus,d,and observed that we understand the court to be saying only that at some point the factual detail in a complaint may be so sketchy that the complaint does not provide the type of notice of the claim to which the defendant is entitled under rule.airborne beepers,at.
here,ensurance primarily raises a legal the facta amendment to the fcra eliminated sawyer right to bring a private civil it also challenges the complaint factual sufficiency.
in killingsworth case,the district court entered judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.like rule b dismissals,we review judgments on the pleadings de novo.forseth vill.of sussex,cir.household argued,as did ensurance,that the repeal of private rights of action for violations meant that killingsworth had no statutory cause of action,essentially a rule b argument.if a defendant raises a rule b defense in a rule c motion,a rule b type analysis applies.alexander city of chicago,cir.household argued in the alternative that its disclosures were clear and conspicuous as required by the fcra,an argument that also warrants rule b type analysis.see id.
a threshold issue in both appeals is whether facta eliminated private causes of action for the particular violations of m asserted by the plaintiffs.killingsworth claims household violated d sawyer claims ensurance violated a.in perry first national bank,we addressed the question whether the newly added h was designed to preclude private enforcement of the entirety of,or just h,holding that t he unambiguous language of h demonstrates that congress intended to preempt private causes of action to enforce,cir.section h thus eliminates both plaintiffs it applies.this brings us directly to the question of the statute retroactivity,as the conduct alleged in each complaint or in sawyer case,at least some of it predates the statute effective date 
in landgraf usi film products,the supreme court explained the antiretroactivity principle the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place,d quotation omitted.the court observed that this principle is in tension with another the rule that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.id.at.quoting bradley sch.bd.of richmond,d.landgraf reconciled the conflict by establishing a presumption of antiretroactivity,but the presumption is applicable only where there is ambiguity about a statute temporal reach 
when a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit,the court first task is to determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.if congress has done so,of course,there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.when,however,the statute contains no such express command,the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if the statute would operate retroactively,our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.

landgraf requirement of clear congressional intent assures that congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and allocates to congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes.landgraf,at.when it is not clear whether a statute is meant to apply retrospectively,prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule.id.at.see also labojewski,at.where congress has not made a clear policy judgment about retroactivity,applying the presumption against retroactive legislation accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate and generally coincide s with legislative and public expectations.labojewski,at quoting landgraf,at.
household and ensurance argue that congress specified facta reach,although by negative implication.see,lindh murphy,d hamdan rumsfeld,d.they point to section f of facta,codified as a note to,which states that n othing in any provision of this act shall be construed to affect any liability under or of the fair credit reporting act,that existed on the day before the date of enactment of this act.they contend that congress intent not to affect liability that existed on or before facta enactment date means that congress intended liability to be extinguished after that liability arising between the statute date of enactment and its effective date.that is,private claims arising before the statute was enacted are preserved,but private claims arising after the statute enactment date but before its effective date are not.we think this line of reasoning reads too much into too little.
in lindh murphy,the supreme court addressed the question of whether amendments in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa to chapter of title of the united states code governing federal habeas corpus proceedings applied to cases pending when aedpa was enacted or only to cases filed after its enactment date.the court noted that aedpa amended the habeas procedures in chapter of title and also created an entirely new chapter of title to govern habeas proceedings in certain state capital cases.the court found it significant that aedpa creation of chapter was expressly made applicable to all cases pending on or after the date of enactment,while the amendments to chapter were not.lindh,at.the court read aedpa express retrospective application of chapter as indicating implicitly that the amendments to chapter were assumed and meant to apply to the general run of habeas cases only when those cases had been filed after the date of the act.id.by relying on this negative principle of statutory court did not reach landgraf second step.the court held that congress intended aedpa amendments to chapter to apply prospectively only.id.at.
the third circuit has characterized lindh as establishing an intermediate step in the landgraf framework,requiring courts to examine a statute under normal rules of statutory construction for evidence of congressional intent to apply the statute prospectively only.mathews kidder,peabody,cir.while landgraf reaffirmed the traditional rule requiring retroactive application to be supported by a clear statement from congress,lindh established that general rules of statutory interpretation apply to determine whether congress has clearly spoken either to prospective or retrospective application.lindh,at.mathews,at.
in hamdan the court relied on the lindh principle that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,see hamdan.at,and found prospective intent by implication.section e of the detainee treatment act of dta stripped courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions from detainees at guantanamo bay,cuba.another part of the dta specified that e and also to all claims pending on or after the date of the act enactment.the court held that the omission of e from the provision making e and retrospective meant that e was intended to apply prospectively only.id.at.
here,in contrast,facta section f preserves private causes of action for liability that accrued prior to facta date of enactment,but because facta enactment and effective dates are different,the negative implication argument loses its logic.drawing a negative inference from facta section f fails to distinguish between facta enactment and effective dates or account for claims arising between the two dates.if applied here,the negative implication argument simply conflates facta enactment and effective dates if all claims accruing after the date of enactment are extinguished without regard to the effective date,the latter date has no meaning.we think this stretches the adaptation of landgraf too far.
we conclude congress has not clearly spoken to the question of whether h applies to fcra claims that arose between facta enactment and effective dates,and thus move on to the second inquiry of the landgraf analysis.this requires us to determine whether the elimination of private rights of action would have an impermissible retroactive effect if applied to the events in these suits.more specifically,we ask whether the application of the facta amendment eliminating private rights of action would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf,at.if the statute would have any of these effects if applied here,the traditional presumption of prospectivity applies.id.
killingsworth cause of action accrued between facta enactment and effective dates.while a plaintiff sustaining an injury is usually a necessary part of a claim accrual,see trw andrews,d in re copper antitrust,cir barry aviation,land mun.airport comm n,cir cada baxter healthcare,cir,the fcra contemplates possible awards of statutory damages where the violation is willful,see a a,an allegation found both in killingsworth and sawyer complaints.see safeco ins.of am.burr,d.thus,actual damages are not necessarily a precondition for suit killingsworth cause of action arose from household alleged willf
