this appeal and follow a judgment in favor of a trucking company and its owners,and against the company liability insurer.we find the facts do not support a tort cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and that the trial court erred when it failed to stay proceedings while the parties exhausted administrative remedies before the insurance commissioner.as a result of these conclusions,the judgment must be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
the trucking company and its liability insurance 
in and,freddie and mildred jones owned a trucking company,known as fred jones trucking.in august of,the joneses formed a corporation,fred jones trucking,and assigned to it all of their interest in fred jones trucking.we will refer to the joneses individual and corporate identities as the joneses,unless the particular context requires a further distinction.the joneses operated under the authority of the california public utilities commission puc they performed both contract and hauling consisting mostly of day trips of less than miles.
the joneses owned two tractor units and five trailers.of their gross receipts of about per year in,about was paid to subhaulers.subhaulers are individual who have their own puc certificates of authority and their own liability insurance,required as a condition of certification by the puc.
the puc also requires the insurer of any regulated trucker to cover any injury or damage to third parties caused by any vehicle used in the trucker business,although this coverage permits the insurer to seek reimbursement from its insured if the risks have not been disclosed to the insurer.thus,because the joneses were themselves holders of a puc certificate for their trucking company and subhaulers held their own certificates,two insurance companies could be responsible for payment if a subhauler had an accident while hauling for the joneses.
the joneses had liability insurance for the policy year with edison insurance.edison went out of business and the joneses needed to find a new insurer.their insurance agent,johnsey insurance company johnsey,suggested they obtain insurance through the state assigned risk plan because it might save the joneses some money.the joneses agreed.
johnsey obtained an application for the assigned risk plan.the application contained a statement to the effect that any policy issued as a result of the application would be subject to the rules and regulations of the assigned risk program this application shall be evidence of temporary insurance subject to the following conditions.the insurance afforded hereunder shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the plan and of the policy form prescribed for use.
the joneses application was assigned to insurance company by the program office.issued a policy in a form required by the department of insurance.it charged the joneses an initial estimated annual premium of,based on the joneses use of their own,specified vehicles in the business.added the minimum permissible premium of for the puc endorsement coverage,based on the information set out in the joneses application.over the term of the policy,assessed additional premiums as the joneses added equipment to their fleet.the total of premiums charged and paid during the policy year was.
the policy issued to the joneses included the following language 
premium changes 
the premium for this policy is based on information we have received from you or other sources.you agree 
that if any of this information material to the development of the policy premium is incorrect,incomplete or changed,we may adjust the premium accordingly during the policy period.
to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete,and to advise us of changes in this information.
any adjustment of your premium will be made using the rules in effect at the time of the change.premium adjustment may be made as a result of a change in 
autos insured by the policy 
drivers,driver age or driver marital status.
coverages or coverage limits.
rating territory.
eligibility for discounts or other premium credits.
after the policy expired,did a routine audit of the joneses to make sure all of the vehicles used in the business had been accounted for in the calculation of premiums.the audit took place pursuant to the following provision of the policy the estimated premium for this coverage form is based on the exposures you told us you would have when this policy began.we will compute the final premium due when we determine your actual exposures.
the auditor discovered the joneses extensive use of subhaulers,and assessed the joneses under old rule of the california commercial automobile assigned risk plan manual of rules and rates,explained below another in insurance premiums for the coverage period that had just expired.this additional premium was subsequently adjusted to under new rule,also explained below.
the joneses declined to pay the additional premium.assigned its claim to jonathan neil associates,a collection agency,which sued freddie jones for the balance due on the premium.the joneses responded with a,initially for bad faith and subsequently amended to state other tort causes of action.
the commercial automobile insurance procedure caip 
the basic assigned risk program 
section of the insurance code requires the insurance commissioner to approve or issue a reasonable plan to provide liability insurance for those who are in good faith entitled to but are unable to procure that insurance through ordinary methods.in general,the plan assigns such insureds to the various companies who write insurance in california and regulates the premiums that can be charged to such insureds.this insurance is generally issued at the minimal levels required by the financial responsibility law.see.
prior to adoption by referendum in of proposition,the assigned risk plan was operated by a governing committee formed by the insurers,subject to review by the insurance commissioner.see former,amended by stats,ch.this committee is known as the caarp committee,an acronym reflecting the name of the program it administers,the california automobile assigned risk program.
after,the caarp committee became advisory to the insurance commissioner see,subd.a.the insurance commissioner is required to consult with the advisory committee on a regular basis on policy matters affecting the operation of the plan,subd.a.nevertheless,the committee with the approval of the commissioner shall appoint a manager to carry out the purposes of this article,employ sufficient personnel to provide services necessary to the operation of the plan,and contract for the provision of statistical and actuarial services.ibid.the caarp committee apparently has contracted with an organization called aipso to manage the plan.aipso is a nationwide operator of such plans aipso provides policy and endorsement forms,as well as interpretive advice.
the caarp committee is,by statute,composed of eight employees of insurance companies that write policies,four public members,two representatives of insurance agencies,and the insurance commissioner or designee,subd.a.curiously,n otwithstanding this act,which changes the status of the governing committee to that of an advisory committee,the committee shall have the right to retain counsel of its choice and the right and necessary standing to bring and defend actions in judicial and administrative proceedings related to the plan in the name of the plan,subd.b.
the commercial assigned risk procedure.
there are certain classes of vehicle users whose financial exposure and potential danger to the public is much greater than is contemplated by the ordinary placement.among these is the class of commercial truckers.in order to accommodate these higher risk vehicle users,the insurance commissioner in promulgated by regulation at,tit,et the commercial automobile insurance procedure caip.the assigned risk plan for truckers is also administered by the caarp committee of which there is a separate caip subcommittee that handles policy issues arising from truckers insurance.
caarp hires two servicing carriers,tit,subd.e,who provide all of the insurance policies issued under caip.these carriers have a contract with caarp by which they are paid a percentage of the premium as a fee for their services.they turn all premiums over to caarp and charge all claims to caarp,which then distributes the charges among automobile liability carriers in california.thus,the servicing carriers are not typical insurance companies in the sense of a company putting its own assets at risk through its underwriting and premium practices.instead,risk is borne by the insurance industry at large,underwriting and premium practices are specified by caarp and the department of insurance doi,and the servicing carrier is paid a commission for implementing and administering the program.
became one of the servicing carriers on march,and it issued the joneses a policy for a term beginning march.
caarp and doi promulgated a california commercial automobile assigned risk plan manual of rules and rates for servicing carriers use in determining premiums and otherwise administering the commercial plan.of primary importance in the present case is rule,in both its original form and as revised by doi in.
there was testimony to the effect that the manual was created by aipso,the national organization that caarp had hired to manage caip.the testimony indicated that california was somewhat unique in issuing puc certificates directly to subhaulers,with the attendant requirement that the subhauler have its own insurance.in other states,according to the testimony,only the primary trucking company had insurance and the hired carriers were covered under that insurance.in its original form,california rule was the generic,nationwide rule published by aipso.because of the unique requirement that subhaulers have their own insurance,there had long been controversy and uncertainty concerning the way rule applied in it applied at all.at the very least,it can be said that the original rule did not,in its language,take account of the california situation.
the provision relevant to the present discussion is subdivision c of rule as it existed during the term of the insurance policy and the initial audit.subdivision c,written in the form of a directive to the servicing carriers,stated in an initial,unnumbered paragraph premium determination rate automobiles transporting exclusively for one concern on the same basis as though owned by such concern for both territory and classification.
the rule then provided two alternatives.in subparagraph,the rule said truckers may be written on a specified car basis according to the trucks,tractors and trailers classifications rule.the classifications rule,rule,provided the basis on which calculated the premiums for the trucks and trailers owned and operated by the joneses directly.if had applied this portion of the rule to the joneses subhaulers,it would have resulted in a listing in the joneses policy of each tractor and trailer used by any of their assessment of the full rated premium for each truck.
rule provided an alternative.cost of hire basis.truckers may be written on the cost of hire basis to cover their liability because of a contract involving the hire of trucks,tractors and trailers.in order to determine the premium on this basis,the servicing carrier was required to first determine the average premium for listed tractors and trailers under the policy as determined from application of rule,then multiply that average rate by to obtain the cost of hire rate.the servicing carrier was then to determine the insured total cost of hiring the subhaulers and compute the insurance premium by multiplying each of the total amount estimated for the cost of hire by the cost of hire rate.nowhere in the rule was the word subhauler used the relevant portion of the rule referred only to a contract involving the hire of trucks,tractors and trailers.
rule was rewritten by doi after a period of study and consultation with the insurance industry.the revised rule specifically applied to exposure based on a subhauling agreement involving the hauling of goods on behalf of an insured trucker by a hired carrier.
the revised rule recognized that in some circumstances the primary trucker insurance would be called upon only to provide excess coverage if a claim exceeded the limits of liability of the subhauler insurance.thus,the revised rule stated at subparagraph.a the insured trucker may request and the caip servicing carrier shall provide coverage for the hired carrier exposure on an excess basis where an insured trucker demonstrates at the time of application or upon renewal that all of the following criteria are satisfied and such criteria remain satisfied throughout the policy period.the five criteria address both the form and the substance of the relationship between the trucker and the subhauler the criteria are set forth in the margin the premium applicable if the insured trucker is able to satisfy all criteria is percent of the premium.
the revised rule also modified the premium.although the premium was based on cost of hiring the subhaulers,as had been the premium under the original rule,the base multiplier was reduced from to.the revised rule required that the total cost of hiring was to be calculated on the basis that each subhauler vehicle was hired for a minimum of of work per year.
as the revised rule was implemented from september of forward,certain problems revealed themselves.some of the problems occurred because doi required the carriers to implement the rule on a retroactive basis if requested by insureds.most the not have the detailed records readily available to satisfy the five criteria for excess coverage.further,smaller truckers like the joneses did not use any particular subhauler for anywhere near of work per year.
through oral and written interpretations,written instruction letters in particular cases,and written directives,doi over time shaped the application of the rule to try to achieve a fair and reasonable premium commensurate with the risks against which caip insured.in particular,doi eventually decided substantial compliance with the five criteria was sufficient to permit reduction of the premium to the rate and it decided that the minimum charge per subhauler should be prorated on a daily basis.
the evidence was conflicting concerning when and how doi implemented the postrevision interpretations of rule.
the insurance application form 
the application for insurance filed by the joneses was a form specified by doi and made available to insurance agents.there was a section in which the applicant listed all operators that usually drive specifically insured vehicles and a section in which the applicant provided detailed information concerning all tractors and trailers covered by the policy.
another section entitled hired car coverage said,check here if desired.cost of hire section must be completed.this section of the application inquired whether the joneses used in their business nonowned vehicles that would be covered under the puc endorsement.the joneses,through their insurance agent,checked the box desiring such coverage and entered in a box headed estimated annual cost of hire.
the next page of the application had a section called cost of hire,containing two subparts.part i was for automobiles including trucks leased or hired on a long term basis over mos.such vehicles which the joneses did not utilize were required to be specifically insured as an owned automobile.part ii,critical to the parties approach to the present case,required the following of the applicant indicate the total cost of hire including wages,for automobiles,which are not specifically insured by the applicant as an owned automobile.this is referred to as short term cost of hire.the application contained blanks for insertion of the cost of hire for the current year and the first through fourth prior years.the joneses left this section of the application completely blank.
the joneses spent some each year on subhaulers.if these subhaulers were considered hired cars,the relevant figures for the current and prior years should have been entered in the short term cost of hire section.would have been entitled to assess an estimated premium for this coverage based on the formula in rule,and it would have established the actual premium through an audit of or report by the insured at the end of the policy term.
interpreting the applicability of rule to the premiums that could be assessed for the use of subhaulers and the relationship between the language of the application form and rule,the trial court concluded t he joneses subhaulers are not within the cost of hire provision because the subhaulers trucks are not hired vehicles.the next day,the court explained this ruling further i n spite of all the testimony and the possible ambiguities and conflicting arguments subhaulers are within the cost of hire provision.cost of hire is a word of art i guess by this time in the insurance industry and so is a term hire of autos another word of art or term of art,and i concluded that neither of those terms include subhaulers.in instructions to the jury,the court stated subhaulers trucks are not hired vehicles for the purpose of this action 
the bureaucratic players 
although the statute provides that caarp will directly operate the plan,and although contract nominally was with caarp,doi on behalf of the insurance commissioner also considered itself to have direct supervisory authority over the servicing carriers,including.the servicing carrier contract between and caarp provided that will comply with all written bulletins,directives or interpretations of the procedures issued by the commissioner nevertheless,doi personnel testified they had authority under the contract to direct that take specific actions.further,they testified,at one point,doi threatened to cancel servicing carrier contract.
former and current doi employees testified that the department,in its normal role of regulator of the insurance industry,maintains a consumer complaint office.that office has the power to seek resolution of complaints and to institute administrative enforcement proceedings if informal resolution is not possible.doi has administrative hearing officers and an appeal process.
additionally,former and current doi employees testified caarp has an appeal process specific to assigned risk insureds.the committee has the authority to hold hearings and issue decisions,which are subject to review by the insurance commissioner.on occasion,caarp referred complaints to doi for initial hearing.
the joneses filed a complaint with the doi consumer affairs office after issued the adjusted bill for,complaining that demanded too many records.doi responded that was correct to ask for these records and that the joneses should try to provide them.doi invited the joneses to recontact doi if,upon providing the records,they got no relief from.in its response to doi inquiries investigating the joneses complaint,failed to disclose that the joneses already had asked for extra time to recreate the necessary records,and that auditor had refused on the basis that the audit had to review only the records now in existence.the joneses did not pursue the matter through doi.
although had a general policy to inform its insureds about administrative appeals through caarp,it did not inform the joneses about the availability of such an appeal when the joneses insurance agent and their lawyers complained to about the additional premium.the joneses did not file an appeal with caarp.
proceedings in the trial court 
moved for summary judgment on two bases that the joneses failed to state a tort cause of action for bad faith and that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.the trial court denied the motion.petitioned this court for writ relief.this court summarily denied the petition.
the trial was divided into three phases.phase i was a trial to the court without a jury on certain matters of interpretation of statutes,regulations,rules,and policy language.phase ii was the trial to the jury of the complaint and.phase iii was the trial to the jury concerning the amount of punitive damages to be awarded.the jury found the joneses owed no additional premiums on jonathan neil complaint,awarded the joneses in compensatory damages from and assessed punitive damages against in the amount of.in posttrial proceedings the trial court conditioned its denial of a new trial motion on remittitur of the punitive damages award to.while preserving their right to,the joneses consented to the remittitur.
and jonathan neil associates,filed timely notices of appeal,as did the joneses.and jonathan neil associates,subsequently filed a notice of appeal from the order on costs that appeal was consolidated with this case by order of the court.
discussion 
appeal raises issues of jurisdiction and standing,failure to state a cause of action,trial and instructional error,and substantive issues concerning the award of damages and attorney fees.the joneses challenges the trial court reduction of the jury punitive damages award,certain substantive and evidentiary rulings during the trial,and certain rulings concerning attorney fees.
we conclude the trial court committed two fundamental errors that require reversal of the judgment.as a result of our holdings on these two issues,any retrial of this matter will have a wholly different texture and many or most of the substantive and procedural issues raised by the parties will not recur on retrial.accordingly,we have addressed only the issues we consider dispositive of this appeal.those issues are whether the joneses have stated a tort cause of action for bad faith and whether judicial consideration of this case is precluded by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.
the facts of this case do not support a tort cause of action for bad faith.
after motion for summary judgment was denied,it filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court.in addition to the exhaustion of remedies issue,the petition contended the joneses had failed to state a tort cause of action for insurance bad faith.this court summarily denied the writ.
on this appeal from the judgment,does not renew,in the same terms,the argument that the joneses failed to state a tort cause of action for bad faith.instead,it raises the issue in the context of instructional error the trial court instructed the jury that incorrect billing statements may deprive an insured of an insurance benefit and may breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.this was prejudicial error.record citation and fn.omitted.we perceive this as essentially the same argument raised in the writ petition.
the joneses perceive the argument in the same manner.in response,they state a number of decisions have confirmed that a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing may be predicated solely on the insurer conduct causing a higher premium.in a footnote,they list seven cases and state this same conclusion was presumably reached by this court in denying petition for writ of mandate 
the joneses presumption is incorrect.our summary denial of the writ petition was neither an adjudication of the issues nor did it reflect any view of this court concerning the issues presented.see kowis howard cal th,d.in considering the issue for the first time on this appeal,we conclude the circumstances of the present case do not give rise to a tort cause of action for insurance bad faith.
the tort of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing has a venerable history in california,but that doctrine has enjoyed relatively broader and narrower application over the years.the cases finally appear to have settled on a relatively narrow application of the doctrine as a result,earlier cases that contain dicta that might support the expansion of the doctrine as proposed by the joneses are an unreliable guide to the law as it must be applied to the current facts.we will begin by summarizing the familiar principles established in the seminal cases.
there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.comunale traders general ins.cal d.this principle applies equally to insurance policies,which are a category of contracts.kransco american empire surplus lines ins.cal th,d.
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied as a supplement to the express contractual covenants,to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct that frustrates the other party rights to the benefits of the agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the covenant is reciprocal,binding both the insurer and the insured.commercial union assurance companies safeway stores,cal d.in gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,the court stated in broad terms that the breach of the covenant sounds in both contract and tort.
in the insurance context,the early cases arose primarily in the context of a breach of the insurer duty to accept reasonable settlements and the duty to act reasonably in investigating and paying the claims of its insured,two different aspects of the same duty.gruenberg aetna ins,supra,cal d at.tort liability for an insurer bad faith is centered on these aspects of the insurer duty under the insurance contract.the parties are bound by a reciprocal obligation of good faith and fair dealing,but the particular duties differ given the differing performance due under the contract of insurance.a fundamental disparity exists between the insured,which performs its basic duty of paying the policy premium at the outset,and the insurer,which,depending on a number of factors,may or may not have to perform its basic duties of defense and indemnification under the policy.citation.an insured is thus not on equal footing with its relationship between insured and insurer is inherently unequal,the inequality resting on contractual asymmetry.an insurer tort liability for breach of the covenant is thus predicated upon special policy factors inapplicable to the insured.kransco american empire surplus lines ins,supra,cal th at,d.
outside the insurance context,the bad faith is,a tort action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair initially recognized in a variety of circumstances.court of appeal cases held,and supreme court cases suggested in dicta,that bad faith breach of an employment contract or of any contract in which the parties enjoyed a special relationship would give rise to a tort cause of action.foley interactive data cal d.the supreme court held that a tort cause of action would arise from bad faith denial of the existence of a contract.seaman direct buying service,standard oil cal d,overruled in part by freeman mills,belcher oil cal th,d.in koehrer superior court d,the court of appeal broached the possibility of obtaining tort damages for the breach of any term of a contract whether for employment or otherwise.foley interactive data,supra,cal d,disapproving koehrer superior court,supra,d.
koehrer,however,probably represents the high tide line for the tort of bad faith in california.in a series of decisions beginning with foley interactive data,supra,cal d,the supreme court began a dramatic restriction of the applicability of the bad faith tort.in foley,the court held that tort damages were unavailable for bad faith breach of an employment contract.id.at.in hunter,cal th,d,the court held that tort damages were unavailable when an employer had used misrepresentations to induce termination of employment.in applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,the court held that tort damages were not available when a contracting party conspired with another to interfere with his own contract.finally,in freeman mills,belcher oil,supra,cal th at page,d,the court overruled seaman direct buying service,standard oil,supra,cal d,and held that tort damages were not available for bad faith denial of the existence of,or denial of liability under,a contract.freeman mills established a general rule precluding tort recovery for noninsurance contract breach,at least in the absence of violation of an independent duty arising from principles of tort law citation other than the bad faith denial of the existence of,or liability under,the breached contract.freeman mills,belcher oil,supra,cal th at,d.more recently,the supreme court reiterated that it has cautioned courts to exercise great care in considering whether to extend the exceptional approach taken in the insurance cases to another contract setting.cates construction,talbot partners cal th,d.
thus,the cases from foley through freeman mills and to the present indicate an unmistakable insistence that judicial creation of the bad faith tort not stray beyond the insurance cases.nevertheless,in freeman mills,the court emphasized that nothing in this opinion should be read as affecting the existing precedent governing enforcement of the implied covenant in insurance cases.freeman mills,belcher oil,supra,cal th at,d.
we turn now to the question of what is meant by the insurance cases.does this refer to every aspect of an insurance contract,to the limited issues of bad faith payment of claims and unreasonable failure to settle,or to some range of issues between those two poles 
in the recent case of state comp.ins.fund superior court cal th,d,the supreme court considered a complaint in which the insured alleged facts quite analogous to those before us.the complaint alleged the insurer had misstated financial information received from the insured in order to cause the rating bureau to classify the insured at a higher risk level,thereby producing higher premiums for the insurer.id.at,d.after the trial court refused to grant the insurer motion for judgment on the pleadings based on an issue of statutory immunity,the supreme court considered the matter on a petition for review from the appellate court denial of a writ of mandate.id.at,d.
in considering the issue of immunity,the court discussed in detail security officers service,state compensation ins.fund th,d,and many of the other workers compensation cases upon which the joneses have relied in the present appeal.in those cases,the insured typically alleges the insurer handled claims in bad faith in order to assess higher insurance premiums against the insured.we discuss these cases in some detail at a later point in this opinion.although approving the rule of law established by those cases,and even though concluding state compensation insurance fund was not immune from suit,the court stated we emphasize that in reaching this result we are not asked to and do not reach any conclusion as to whether schaefer the insured employer has stated a valid cause of action against scif.we merely determine whether a civil suit based on schaefer allegations is precluded by the statutory immunity.state comp.ins.fund superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
as noted above,the facts of state comp.ins.fund superior court,supra,cal th,d,are analytically very similar to those of the present case.and,as noted,the supreme court discussed with approval the line of workers compensation cases upon which the joneses rely in the present case.from these two facts,the joneses conclude there is no analytically logical distinction between those workers compensation cases and cases such as the present one and state comp.ins.fund superior court,supra,cal th,d.were this so,there would have been no reason for the supreme court to emphasize that it was not deciding whether the complaint in state comp.ins.fund superior court,supra,cal th,d,stated a cause of action.reserving an issue,clearly,is not deciding an issue nevertheless,reserving an issue in these circumstances is a recognition that,however the issue is ultimately decided,the workers compensation cases are sufficiently different that the facts before the supreme court required a separate analysis of the issue.
in state comp.ins.fund superior court,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court was not required to decide the open question whether the tort of insurance bad faith should be extended beyond the claims and settlement area.in the present case,we are asked to and are required to determine whether to do so.we turn to that task.
we are satisfied the insurance cases exception preserved in freeman mills does not extend to every breach of an insurance contract.as noted above,the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is reciprocal,binding both the insurer and the insured.commercial union assurance companies safeway stores,supra,cal d at.nevertheless,an insured is not guilty of the tort of bad faith when the insured breaches the covenant in those circumstances the insurer is limited to contract remedies.kransco american empire surplus lines ins,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we may reject any interpretation of the preserved insurance cases exception in freeman mills that would permit a tort action for every bad faith breach of an insurance contract.
in addition,however,the logic and language of foley and other supreme court cases persuades us that not every instance of bad faith conduct by an insurer gives rise to a tort cause of action.in particular,we perceive that the general administration of an insurance policy is not sufficiently similar to the duties involved in investigating,defending,and settling claims to justify imposition of tort liability on an insurer who acts in bad faith.see foley interactive data,supra,cal d at.rather,in the performance of such contract administration duties,the obligations of the insurer are much closer to the normal contract duties of the in many pay premiums,provide information to the insurer,and maintain adequate records to facilitate administration of the contract.see kransco american empire surplus lines ins,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court has taken care to qualify the particular nature of the relationship between an insurer and its insured that justifies imposition of tort liability we explained in gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,that t he duty to comport with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is immanent in the contract whether the company is attending on the insured behalf to the claims of third persons against the insured or the claims of the insured itself.accordingly,when the insurer unreasonably and in bad faith withholds payment of the claim of its insured it is subject to liability in tort.foley interactive data,supra,cal d at,brackets in original.
when an insurer is called upon to act as an is,to defend,settle,or pay a aspects of its relationship with its insured are most distinctive.first,the insurer has virtually sole control of the proceedings,including the decision to settle claims see crisci security ins.cal d,and the decisions to investigate and pay claims by its own insured see egan mutual of omaha ins,cal d.second,the insured is subject to financial pressures that the insurance was intended to mitigate.see mclaughlin national union fire ins.th,d.third,the insured must initiate action against the insurer in order to obtain the benefits of the insurance policy.the insurer may simply refuse action unless the insured has the financial resources and the perseverance to force the insurer hand the insured can not just go out into the marketplace and purchase replacement coverage for a loss that has already occurred.see foley interactive data,supra,cal d at.
none of these factors is present in the case of a premium dispute such as the one in the present case.in this case the insured can do nothing and make the insurer prove its entitlement to additional premiums in litigation initiated by the insurer see old republic ins.fsr brokerage,th,d or,in the alternative,the insured can present its records in comprehensible form to the insurer and the insurance commissioner for resolution of the dispute.the insured can not be pressured by the loss of coverage,since the policy term has expired already.while the insured is under the financial pressure shared by any potential litigant with an inchoate claim on the horizon,the insured has not suffered the calamity of property or income loss or of a trying to collect a large judgment against it.see see also crisci security ins,supra,cal d at.further,as to the disputed premium,the insured has a fast and affordable administrative remedy before an agency that has both formal and informal control over the insurer.
we do not question that an insurer abuse of its rights to audit the financial records of its insured and to collect an additional premium under an approved rate structure may constitute a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.such a breach,however,is fully remediable in a contract action with damages measured according to traditional contract principles.
nor does protection of the public support allowing tort damages in this type of insurance case.normally,the motivation of a party in breaching a contract is immaterial the law of contract normally awards those damages within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract is made or at least reasonably foreseeable by them at that time.cates construction,talbot partners cal th,d,see.by contrast,it would be highly relevant in an administrative proceeding before the insurance commissioner that the commissioner chosen provider for commercial insurance was engaging in predatory practices.see,tit.given the availability of effective administrative oversight as a means of implementing the public policy favoring good faith and fair dealing in assessing insurance premiums,there is no compelling need to extend the bad faith tort beyond the area of breach of the duties to defend,settle,and pay claims,and into the area of ordinary premium disputes.see foley interactive data,supra,cal d at.
the joneses assert that policyholders do not enter into insurance contacts seeking to gain a commercial advantage but rather are only seeking protection against calamity,citing egan mutual of omaha ins,supra,cal d at page,and cates construction,talbot partners,supra,cal th at page,d.from this premise,they conclude that california courts have long recognized that tort actions against insurers for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing are not limited to those based on policy provisions promising payment of a claim,but instead may be predicated on violation of other policy provisions as well.
although there certainly is language in earlier cases that supports the joneses contention,we do not believe that language withstands scrutiny in the light of the more recent supreme court cases.these more recent cases include,for example,cates construction,talbot partners,supra,cal th at page,d,where the court recites the distinctions drawn in the cases between insurance contracts generally and most other contracts for goods or services.then the court adds in addition,we have observed that the tort duty of a liability insurer ordinarily is based on its assumption of the insured defense and of settlement negotiations of third party claims.the assumption of those responsibilities obligates the insurer to give at least as much consideration to the welfare of its insured as it gives to its own interests so as not to deprive the insured of the benefits of the insurance policy,italics added.this focus on the duties to defend and settle does not support a broad application of tort law to all bad faith breaches of an insurance contract.
we have reviewed carefully the cases upon which the joneses rely for a broad application of the tort of bad faith.those cases largely fall into two categories.in the first group,cases employ language that was a part of the initial tide of enthusiasm for a universal tort of bad faith,the very tide foley and its progeny sought to turn.the second group involves the unique field of workers compensation insurance,where concepts of experience factor and reserve rating cause the insurers claims settlement practices to result in higher premiums that is,the higher premiums are a,of the underlying bad faith in handling claims.
a.the universal bad faith tort cases.
the joneses rely on spindle travelers ins.companies d.in that case,a medical malpractice insurer had a master contract with a regional association of physicians.according to the allegations of the complaint,the insurer wanted to raise rates for individual doctors by an amount that exceeded the increases permitted by the master contract.when the medical society resisted,the insurer canceled the plaintiff insurance in order to coerce and intimidate the medical society into permitting the rate increases.id.at.
in the course
