denny denny petitions this court by a writ of review challenging the decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab to dismiss the california insurance guarantee association ciga as a party to a workers compensation claim.denny contends ciga is statutorily required to guarantee a proportionate share of an insolvent insurer disability obligation when a permissibly employer is jointly and severally liable for the claim.
unfortunately,one of denny employees suffered a cumulative injury over a period that overlapped two months with the time denny elected to insure itself for workers compensation purposes.the balance was the responsibility of a private insurance company which became insolvent.denny fervently argues that it should only have to pay its percent proportionate share of the disability award and ciga should pick up the balance.
we agree with the wcab and find the claim outside ciga indemnification responsibility.essentially,denny made the business decision to opt for over private insurance and to not purchase an excess workers compensation policy.to use an annoying proverb,pro tali numismate tales merces.you get what you pay for.rogers,the dictionary of clich√©s.
background 
esther bachman bachman claimed a cumulative injury to her wrists while working as a cook for denny restaurant in bakersfield between may,and may.denny admitted the injury was work related and provided bachman with appropriate medical treatment.
during bachman injury period,denny insured itself for workers compensation purposes through july.thereafter,denny obtained private workers compensation insurance from hih america.
in may,hih america was judicially declared insolvent,triggering ciga statutory obligation to guarantee hih america covered claims under the provisions of article of the insurance code.et.
bachman disability claim proceeded to trial,and a workers compensation judge wcj concluded bachman wrist injury caused a percent level of permanent disability.the wcj also found the disability award did not constitute a ciga covered claim because denny remained jointly and severally liable.the wcj dismissed ciga as a party to the action,thereby absolving ciga from any liability and leaving denny solely responsible for bachman workers compensation award.in november,the wcab denied denny petition for reconsideration and adopted the wcj reasoning as its own.
discussion 
denny contends the wcab erred by dismissing ciga as a party to the workers compensation proceedings and requiring denny to pay the full amount of bachman disability award.denny believes ciga,as the guarantor of insolvent hih america,should have assumed hih america approximate percent proportionate share of the award.
under the california workers compensation system,a compensable injury may be either specific or cumulative.a specific injury results from one incident or exposure which causes disability or need for medical treatment,while a cumulative injury results from repetitive mental or physically traumatic activities extending over a period of time,the combined effect of which causes any disability or need for medical treatment.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
when an employee suffers a cumulative injury over time,the employee may claim workers compensation benefits against any one or more of successive employers or insurance carriers that employed or insured the employee during a maximum injury period,industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the wcab will hold the multiple employers or insurance carriers in the chain of causation jointly and severally liable for the entire award and allow them to apportion their relative liabilities in separate wcab proceedings.industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals,supra,at,d see also flesher workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,marsh workmen.bd.d.

cases interpreting this language have established that where an insured has overlapping insurance policies and one insurer becomes insolvent,the other insurer,even if only a secondary or excess insurer,is responsible for paying the claim.in other words,ciga is an insurer of last resort and does not assume responsibility for claims where there is any other insurance available.citation.the legislative intent was to create a protection for the public against insolvent insurers when no secondary insurer is available.reynolds california ins.guarantee d,d.
