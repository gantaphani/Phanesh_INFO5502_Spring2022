phillip morris,reynolds tobacco company,brown williamson tobacco corporation,lorillard tobacco company,liggett group,and liggett myers,appellants appeal from a decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,judge denying them judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict in favor of empire healthcare,empire blue cross blue shield empire empire alleged that defendants engaged in a scheme to distort public knowledge concerning the risks of smoking,knowing that the public would act on the misinformation,and that this behavior resulted in empire paying increased costs for medical services provided to subscribers with medical conditions that were either causally related to,or exacerbated by,smoking.at trial,the jury found that all defendants except british american tobacco company,were liable under new york consumer protection statute,and awarded in compensatory damages the jury rejected empire other claims,and empire has not appealed those decisions.the district court subsequently awarded attorneys fees to empire.judgment was initially entered on november,and an amended judgment was entered on april.appellants now appeal.
for the reasons set forth below,we reverse judgment on empire subrogation claim and will,in due course,remand the matter to the district court to enter judgment for appellants on that claim.we reserve decision on the award of attorneys fees,which may be affected by the outcome of the certification process.finally,we certify two related questions to the new york court of appeals.
background 
underlying facts 
in april,twenty blue shield plans and their subsidiaries and affiliates the plans filed suit against defendant tobacco companies in the eastern district of new york seeking to recover costs of providing health care to plan subscribers plan members as a result of medical conditions causally connected to,or exacerbated by,tobacco use.the plans alleged that because of defendants deception of the public as to the negative health consequences of cigarette smoking,the plans health care expenditures rose as a result of spending on subscribers who were harmed by defendants products.the factual underpinings of these claims are set forth in great length in three underlying district court opinions.see blue cross blue shield of new jersey,philip morris,d granting in part,and denying in part,defendants motion for summary judgment blue cross i blue cross blue shield of new jersey,philip morris,d denying defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law and granting plaintiffs motion for judgment on the jury award blue cross ii blue cross blue shield of new jersey,philip morris,d awarding attorneys fees blue cross iii.we will therefore assume familiarity with the factual allegations and supporting evidence and not recount them here.
district court proceedings 
in april when the plans commenced this action,they sought recovery under federal law,including the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.common law and state statutory law,including new york consumer protection statute,bus.section.defendants unsuccessfully moved for dismissal on the grounds that the claims were remote and therefore barred as a matter of law.defendants then unsuccessfully renewed their motion after this court found similar common law and rico claims were too remote to permit suit in laborers local health benefit fund philip morris,cir.that motion was also denied.see national asbestos workers med.fund philip morris,d distinguishing the plans from the health care insurers involved in laborers local,and explaining that the plans had amended their complaint to assert a subrogation claim as an alternative basis for recovery.
in september,the district court ruled that empire claims would proceed to trial alone,and that the other plans claims would be stayed pending resolution of the empire trial.see blue cross i,d at.a jury trial was then held during which the jury heard from witnesses.blue cross ii,d at.empire put forth significant evidence that smoking causes cancer,that smoking increases medical costs,and that defendants engaged in deceptive practices,which included lying to the public about the link between cancer and smoking and misrepresenting their commitment to finding such a link,if any.
the jury found empire federal law and common law claims to be unsupported,but found that empire claims under section were supported by the evidence against all defendants except the british american tobacco company.the jury awarded empire on their direct claim under section,and on their subrogated claim under section.
appellants then moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court denied the motion in an extensive opinion which explains both the underlying evidence and the district court reasoning in great depth.we,therefore,will not recapitulate the district court reasoning,choosing instead to refer the reader to the opinion blue cross ii,d.the district court subsequently awarded empire nearly million in attorneys fees.blue cross iii,d.an amended judgment combining the verdict and award of attorney fees was entered in march.appellants now appeal from that judgment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law because empire section subrogation claim was not proper because empire did not identify its subrogors and detail each subrogor claim empire lacked standing to sue under section because it was not acting as a consumer empire claim on its own behalf was too remote to be actionable under section empire did not provide sufficient evidence to prove causation and damages under section and empire was not entitled to rely on aggregate proof of causation and damages in proving its claim under section.in addition,appellants challenge the district court award of attorneys fees to empire.we address each argument in turn.
propriety of empire subrogation claim 
appellants contend that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on empire subrogation claim because empire failed to prove that any subrogor was entitled to recover.
in laborers local,we held that rico and common law claims brought by a labor union health and welfare trust fund against tobacco companies and public relations firms,alleging that the companies conspiracy to deceive the general public about the dangers of smoking caused the funds to pay out more money than they otherwise would have,were too remote to permit suit because they were purely contingent on harms to third party smokers.we noted,however,that while the claims were too remote to be viable under rico or common law,t he funds may still bring a subrogation action to recover the medical costs paid out for the individual smokers id.at.thus,an insurance company may bring a subrogation action against tobacco companies to recover certain medical costs resulting from smoking.nevertheless,empire subrogation claim must fail.
empire never identified the actual number of subrogors or their names,much less provided any individualized information about the claims to which empire alleged it was subrogated.in addition,defendants were not permitted to obtain individual discovery about any such claims.as such,the subrogated action was virtually identical to the action on empire own behalf the direct action.this is clearly contrary to the common law understanding of the nature of subrogation claims.we have explained that a s a general matter,a subrogation claim by an insurer depends upon the claim of the insured and is subject to whatever defenses the tortfeasor has against the insured.allstate ins.mazzola,cir quoting great am.ins.united states,cir.at the very least,a subrogation claim would require empire to identify its subrogors and those subrogors claims so that defendants would have the opportunity to assert defenses against those claims.accordingly,two new york cases have held that claims such as these can not properly be considered to be subrogated claims.see fox mem l hosp.american tobacco,dep t eastern states health welfare fund philip morris,misc d.there is no reason to believe that the new york court of appeals would find differently.
accordingly,we hold that allowing empire claim to proceed under the guise of subrogation was improper as it was not a true subrogation claim.
effect of empire status as a on its standing to sue on its own behalf under section 
section prohibits d eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business,trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service bus.law a.section currently contains a private right of action such that any person who has been injured by reason of any violation of this section may bring an action in his own name to enjoin such unlawful act or practice,an action to recover his actual damages,or both such actions.bus.h.
appellants argue that empire lacked standing to sue on its own behalf under section because empire is not a consumer and is not standing in the shoes of a consumer.however,a plaintiff need neither be a consumer nor be someone standing in the shoes of a consumer to have an actionable claim under section.see securitron magnalock schnabolk,cir.accordingly,this court has allowed a corporation to use section to halt a competitor deceptive consumer practices.see securitron,at.we explained in securitron that a lthough the statute is,at its core,a consumer protection device it does provide a right of action to any person who has been injured by reason of any violation of this section.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore held that a party has standing under section when its complaint alleges a consumer injury or harm to the public interest.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,t he critical question is whether the matter affects the public interest in new york,not whether the suit is brought by a consumer id.here,appellants deceptive practices involved serious harm to the public.empire presented evidence that by using deceptive practices,appellants induced consumers to smoke and discouraged them from quitting smoking,thus significantly increasing their risk of illness and even death.accordingly,we find that the fact that empire was not a consumer of defendants products does not prevent it from having standing to sue on its own behalf under section.
possible remoteness bar to empire direct action 
plaintiff direct action is derivative of injuries to third parties and is,therefore,essentially indirect.laborers local,at.relying heavily on laborers local,appellants argue that the phrase by reason of in section h incorporates principles of proximate cause and thus that empire direct claim is not actionable under section because it is too remote.if the by reason of clause does amount to common law proximate cause then appellants are correct.however,the issue is far less clear than appellants claim.
in laborers local,we addressed parallel language in rico,which states that a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue,c emphasis added,and we held that that language incorporated common law principles of proximate cause.at.we also acknowledged,however,that state statutes may reject common law proximate cause requirements and may provide the basis for allowing suit on such derivative claims.id.at.we have subsequently cautioned against the broad application of the proximate cause requirement set forth in laborers local to state statutes,noting that the proximate cause requirements of rico are more stringent than those of most states.desiano,cir.
while it is clear that our precedent would not prevent empire direct claim from being brought under a state statute,it is not clear that the claim can be brought under section specifically.merely looking to the language of section does not resolve this question.the key phrase,by reason of,has been interpreted to not require proximate cause in the context of the new york state dram shop act,oblig.law.catania,dep t finding that it is sufficient that there was some reasonable or practical connection between the sale of alcohol and the resulting injuries but that proximate cause is not required citation omitted.
section the dram shop act and unlike other common law tort requirements.see stutman chemical bank,justifiable reliance and intent to defraud are not required to establish liability under section see also oswego laborers local pension fund marine midland bank,intent to defraud or mislead and justifiable reliance are not required to establish liability under section.
since,like the dram shop act,section does not require all elements of a traditional common law tort,it would be reasonable to interpret section by reason of phrase as consonant with the interpretation of the by reason of phrase in the dram shop act.indeed,consistent with such an interpretation,the new york supreme court for richmond county has allowed suit for indirect injuries to proceed under section.see vitolo dow corning,misc d,allowing a physician to sue silicon breast implant manufacturers under section for injuries that would not have occurred but for injuries to implant recipients.
there are,however,two new york state cases addressing claims similar to those in the case at hand which can be read to suggest a different interpretation.in eastern states,health and welfare fund philip morris,misc d,the new york supreme court for new york county considered a variety of tort claims by health and welfare employee benefit and trust funds against tobacco companies.plaintiffs sought a refund of monies incurred by their participants and beneficiaries who suffered from health care problems.the court,without mentioning the claims by name or discussing them separately,held that all failed because there can be no direct link between the alleged misconduct of defendants and the alleged damage to the funds,as the damage to the funds is remote,indirect,and derivative of third parties.id.at,misc d at.while appellants make much of this case,eastern states never discussed section and it is not even clear from the opinion whether a section claim was part of that action.
similarly,in fox memorial hospital american tobacco,the second judicial department considered a claim brought under section by nonprofit hospitals and a trade association to recover certain costs of health care provided to tobacco users.that court held that the case was properly dismissed because plaintiffs purported economic injury is entirely derivative of the harm suffered by the individual patients and therefore too remote to permit recovery.id.however,the court supported its holding by simply citing three cases which did not address section.nowhere did the court explain why those cases holdings would also apply in the section context,and nowhere did the court discuss the text,history,or purpose of section.similarly,nowhere did the court discuss prior case law regarding how section should be interpreted and thus did not distinguish either the dram shop act case catania or stutman and its progeny.accordingly,neither eastern states nor fox provides us with much guidance in predicting how the new york court of appeals would decide this issue 
in short,we can not predict whether the new york court of appeals would find empire direct claim sufficiently direct to be actionable under section.given this uncertainty,we believe that the most prudent approach is to certify the underlying question to the new york court of appeals.
we may certify unsettled and significant question s of state law that will control the outcome of a case.prats port auth.of new york new jersey,cir quoting cir.the mere fact that the new york court of appeals has not ruled on a legal issue does not mean that we should certify that issue.see goodlett kalishek,cir indicating that the key question is not whether the new york court of appeals has actually considered the issue,but rather whether sufficient precedents exist for us to make a prediction of how the new york court of appeals would decide the question before us.accordingly,as a general matter,w e are bound to apply the law as interpreted by new york intermediate appellate courts unless we find persuasive evidence that the new york court of appeals,which has not ruled on this issue,would reach a different conclusion.pahuta,cir.thus,in pahuta we chose not to certify because the plaintiff had not provided us with any reason to believe that the new york court of appeals would disagree with lower court cases,which were consistent with precedent in other jurisdictions.id.
however,certification is appropriate where with respect to the question asked there is a split of authority or,if there is a statute implicated,its plain language does not answer the question or when what is presented is a complex question of new york common law for which no state authority may be found.hamilton beretta,cir.
as explained above,the plain language of section does not provide us with guidance in resolving this question because that language is open to varying interpretations.similarly,although there are lower court cases touching on the issue,it is possible that the new york court of appeals might not follow their lead given the objectives of section,the fact that section clearly relaxes other common law tort requirements,and the decisions in vitolo,desiano,and catania.
the fact that resolution of this case will require analysis of important policy considerations of the state of new york also favors certification.see new york first fin.ins,cir certifying a question to the new york court of appeals because it is likely to recur and involves import public policy considerations for the state of new york mark varrichio,mark varrichio chicago ins,cir same.as the district court reasoned,allowing recovery could further the remedial and deterrent objectives of section by forcing violators to absorb the full economic costs of their wrongs.the district court opined that a llowing manufacturers to shift billions of dollars in medical costs to first party insurers is inconsistent with the design of the new york consumer protection statute it weakens consumer safety,dilutes incentives to make the marketplace more transparent,and ultimately shifts health care costs to innocent insured nonsmokers.blue cross ii,d at.on the other hand,there are also policy reasons for not allowing indirect suits including the difficulty of apportioning damages the risk of multiple recoveries and the fact that indirect claims may not be necessary where the directly injured party can seek a remedy.see laborers local,at.
for the above reasons,we will respectfully certify the following question to the new york court of appeals are claims by a third party payer of health care costs seeking to recover costs of services provided to subscribers as a result of those subscribers being harmed by a defendant or defendants violation of bus.law too remote to permit suit under that statute 
sufficiency of the evidence as to causation and damages,assuming that individualized proof of harm was not required 
appellants argue that empire proof was insufficient to prove causation and damages because no liability could be imposed for appellants alleged failures to disclose information empire offered no proof that misrepresentations caused it damages empire failed to provide a model of damages that adequately segregated its costs for providing health care that resulted from defendants violation of section as opposed to defendants lawful conduct and empire failed to provide sufficient evidence to allow the jury to apportion damages.
liability for failures to disclose 
appellants argue that because they complied with the public health cigarette smoking act of,they can not be held liable under section for failing to disclose information about the health effects of cigarettes.the jury instructions,however,stated that for the challenged acts or practices to result in liability,empire must prove that the challenged acts or practices were misrepresentations and were misleading in a material way.given these instructions,we are content that liability was predicated on appellants affirmative misrepresentations rather than on their alleged failures to disclose.
sufficiency of proof of misrepresentations causing harm 
appellants argue that empire claims must fail as a matter of law as there was no proof that empire was damaged by misrepresentations because empire offered no proof that specific subscribers were induced to smoke or to not quit smoking by any such misrepresentations empire offered no proof that specific subscribers who were so induced were the same subscribers to incur health care costs and empire experts offered no proof that empire itself was damaged by misrepresentations notably,appellants do not argue that they did not make misrepresentations 
we find that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.we will upset a jury verdict only if there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture.norton sam club,cir quoting stratton department for the aging,cir.accordingly,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the verdict was rendered,giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that the jury might have drawn in his favor.id.needless to say,a party seeking to overturn a verdict based on the sufficiency of evidence bears a very heavy burden.id.
although empire concedes that it did not provide specific evidence that misrepresentations induced specific subscribers to smoke and that these were the same subscribers to incur health care costs,this does not compel judgment as a matter of law for appellants.if individualized proof is not necessary a question which we hold later in this opinion is best answered by certifying it to the new york court of appeals,the jury,charged with making credibility determinations and weighing the evidence,was entitled to draw these inferences based on the testimony before it.the jury heard subscribers testify about being induced to smoke by appellants misrepresentations,and heard testimony about what the misrepresentations were and when they occurred.from such testimony,we think that it is reasonable that the jury could have determined that subscribers were in fact induced by those statements.similarly,if individualized proof is not required,the jury was free to use the statistical evidence offered by empire experts to draw this conclusion.finally,we find evidence in the record to suggest that empire did sustain injury.thus,appellants claim that empire experts offered no proof that empire itself was damaged by misrepresentations is merely one view of that evidence,not a necessary view of that evidence,and we reject appellants invitation to the evidence.
in short,appellants fail to satisfy the heavy burden required for judgment as a matter of law.
sufficiency of empire proof as to damages caused by unlawful conduct as opposed to lawful conduct 
appellants argue that even if empire showed that it was damaged by misrepresentations,empire proof of such damages was insufficient as a matter of law because empire model of damages did not adequately segregate its costs for providing health care services caused by appellants misconduct from costs that it would have incurred even if appellants had not violated section.appellants contend that the model,created by jeffrey harris,who was one of empire expert witnesses,assumed that defendants would have engaged in an campaign and that they would have warned the public that smoking can be lethal and that it causes lung cancer,emphysema,and heart disease.
appellants mischaracterize the portions of harris testimony regarding the assumptions behind his model that they cite to support their contentions.according to that testimony,harris calculated and testified about two types of damages.the first type of damages stemmed from defendants alleged failure to innovate as the result of an conspiracy not to compete on the basis of health claims.harris testified that he believed that if the defendants had not engaged in such a conspiracy,they would have competed with one another to make safer cigarettes.it was in the context of discussing a world with such innovation that harris testified that tobacco companies would have publicized health information about cigarettes in an effort to show that their own products would minimize negative health consequences.
the second type of damages harris calculated were damages resulting from defendants alleged dissemination of misinformation regarding the health effects of cigarettes harris did not testify that his calculations as to these damages were based on an assumption that the defendants would have waged an campaign or any assumption that the defendants themselves would have provided the public with accurate information.while harris did assume better information and more correct information about smoking and less misinformation when calculating the damages that resulted from appellants dissemination of misinformation,this does not mean that empire provided insufficient proof of damages to support the jury verdict.harris appears to have assumed that in the absence of the misinformation provided by defendants,there would have been more accurate information this is not an unreasonable assumption.the proliferation of false information can well have the effect of stifling the proliferation of accurate information.similarly,many of the examples empire gave of defendants providing misinformation were in response to specific requests for information,testimony before congress and responses to interview questions.it is not unreasonable to assume that in such situations,had defendants not given misinformation,they would have given accurate information.
in the end,however,it was the jury responsibility to determine whether or not harris assumptions were reasonable and whether his estimates were reliable,and to evaluate the damages information before it.given that defense counsel extensively explored on the assumptions behind harris calculations,we find no reason to believe that the jury was not able to evaluate harris testimony in this way.
sufficiency of empire proof of damages caused by each appellant 
the jury found that the defendants were not jointly and severally liable.given this finding,appellants argue that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that the jury had no basis for apportionment because empire statistical model of its claimed damages did not apportion damages among defendants.we disagree,finding that the jury had a sufficient,albeit perhaps less than ideal,basis for assessing relative liability.when the jury was told about particular misrepresentations,the party making those misrepresentations was identified,thus allowing the jury to assess the relative blameworthiness of each defendant.appellants argue that any apportionment based on the frequency and egregiousness of appellants misconduct would be improper speculation as to the effects of such behavior on subscribers.appellants offer no support for this assertion and we find it to be without merit.in determining damages,the jury was allowed to act on probable and inferential as well as upon direct and positive proof.see bigelow rko radio pictures.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,in a slightly different context,the supreme court explained that in the absence of more precise proof,the jury could conclude damage as a matter of just and reasonable inference from the proof of defendants wrongful acts and their tendency to injure plaintiffs business id.moreover,when allocating liability to a defendant,a jury can take into consideration the relative blameworthiness of that defendant.see kreppein celotex,cir.
appellants also suggest that the jury was not permitted to take market share into account when assessing liability because there is no reason to believe that defendants with higher market shares engaged in more misconduct.it is possible,however,that the new york court of appeals would permit market share liability in this case moreover,regardless of whether the new york court of appeals would allow pure market share liability in the case at hand,liability was not,in fact,imposed according to market share.as empire points out,while the jury was informed of the defendants relative market shares,its assessment of relative liability differed significantly from those shares.
for the above reasons,we conclude that appellants have failed to show that empire did not offer sufficient proof to allow the jury to apportion damages.
propriety of empire reliance on aggregate proof of causation and damages 
while empire provided some information about individual subscribers,empire relied on aggregate,statistical proof of causation and damages.appellants argue that aggregate proof was not permissible because it violated appellants constitutional right to a jury trial it violated appellants constitutional right to due process and section requires individualized proof.we find that the first two arguments are without merit,while the third merits certification to the new york court of appeals.
right to a jury trial 
as the district court recognized in blue cross ii,d at,the supreme court has explained that the seventh amendment was designed to preserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most fundamental elements,not the great mass of procedural forms and details,varying even at the time of the adoption so widely among jurisdictions,galloway united states.as justice brandeis explained,the seventh amendment 
does not prohibit the introduction of new methods for determining what facts are actually in issue,nor does it prohibit the introduction of new rules of evidence.changes in these may be made.new devices may be used to adapt the ancient institution to present needs and to make of it an efficient instrument in the administration of justice indeed,such changes are essential to the preservation of the right.the limitation imposed by the amendment is merely that enjoyment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed,and that the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be not interfered with.
in re peterson.
nevertheless,appellants argue that their seventh amendment rights were violated by allowing aggregated evidence of causation and harm as opposed to separate evidence about each individual subscriber.first,appellants rely on two fifth circuit opinions,neither of which would be controlling even if we were bound to follow them.not only do both cases address class action claims,not direct actions,but neither held that aggregate evidence of causation violates the seventh amendment.in the first case,in re fibreboard,cir,the fifth circuit explicitly declined to decide whether appellants right to a jury trial was violated when the district court consolidated over separate,personal injury cases.id.at.in the second,cimino raymark,cir,the fifth circuit struck down a revised trial plan for the same cases on seventh amendment grounds,but not because the cases were consolidated or because causation was based upon aggregated evidence.rather,the fifth circuit determined that the seventh amendment was violated because under the trial plan the jury was not to determine damages of the group as consolidated,but was only to consider the damages of certain members of the plaintiff class.id.at accordingly,these cases do not support appellants argument.
appellants next argue that their right to a jury trial was violated because,by consolidating snippets of testimony from a variety of subscribers,empire was able to create a perfect subscriber and to litigate the case on that basis.they argue that because empire chose excerpts of subscriber depositions rather than presenting the complete depositions to the jury,the jury was not allowed to fully evaluate the testimony,and therefore appellants did not receive a true jury trial.appellants rely primarily on broussard meineke disc.muffler shops,cir,in which the fourth circuit considered whether it should allow the claims of named plaintiffs to go forward after decertifying a class.in deciding that such claims should not proceed,the fourth circuit wrote plaintiffs enjoyed the practical advantage of being able to litigate not on behalf of themselves but on behalf of a perfect plaintiff pieced together for litigation.id.at.the court explained that plaintiffs had used the method of a class action to present a case that was much stronger than any individual claim,apparentl
