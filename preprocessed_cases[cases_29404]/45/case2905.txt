the procedural convolutions of this case have resulted in what appears to be a question of first impression in insurance subrogation law when the amount of an insured recovery from a tortfeasor is capped due to an error in the insured complaint,does this cap also limit the recovery of an insurer that intervenes to claim subrogation while we recognize the rule that a subrogated insurer stands in the shoes of its insured and is subject to all defenses that may be asserted against the insured claim,under the unique circumstances of this case we conclude the insurer default judgment against a tortfeasor for subrogation may not be reduced in a later proceeding under insurance code section,subdivision b because of a pleading error that limited amounts the insured parties could recover.
in this appeal,claimants fred gluckman and margot aiken seek relief from a judgment denying their application for an order to show cause against the california insurance commissioner,as conservator of golden eagle insurance company golden eagle.claimants contend the trial court erred in limiting the amount of their recovery on one default judgment and in disallowing recovery on a second default judgment,which they had obtained by an assignment from their insurer.they also claim they were wrongly denied a full hearing on their bad faith claim against golden eagle.we reverse the judgment insofar as it precludes claimants from recovering the full amount of the default judgment they obtained by assignment from their insurer and we affirm the remainder of the judgment.
background 
in february,s w associates s w negligently started a fire while constructing a roof on claimants home,causing approximately in damage.claimants filed claims for this loss with allstate insurance allstate,their homeowners insurer,and golden eagle,the insurer of s upon investigating the claim,golden eagle determined s w had fraudulently obtained coverage by misrepresenting itself as a janitorial service,rather than a roofing business.golden eagle denied the claim and rescinded the s w policy.claimants did successfully obtain from allstate under their homeowners insurance policy.
claimants sued s w and others,alleging in property damage and in lost property value and praying for compensatory damages in an amount in excess of.allstate intervened in this lawsuit.in its against s w,allstate claimed a priority right of subrogation and sought to recover the it had paid to claimants.after golden eagle refused to defend s w,claimants obtained a default judgment against s w for slightly over million.allstate later obtained its own default judgment against s w for representing the payment to claimants plus costs and interest.
seeking to recover on the million default judgment,claimants filed suit against golden eagle under section,subdivision b,which allows a judgment creditor to bring a direct action for recovery against the liability insurer golden eagle answered the complaint but successfully moved to reduce the amount of the judgment to the sum set forth in the prayer of claimants complaint against s w.during the next four months,claimants obtained an assignment of allstate rights against s w and amended their complaint against golden eagle to pursue collection of the default judgment as allstate assignees.the case proceeded to trial.a jury found that s w had made material misrepresentations to golden eagle in applying for coverage,but golden eagle was estopped from rescinding the policy because golden eagle continued to accept premiums and even increased the policy limits after it had notice of s w roofing activities.however,the jury also found claimants were not entitled to recover from golden eagle under section.
claimants appealed the judgment entered on this jury verdict.they claimed the trial court erred in reducing the amount of their default judgment against s w to the set forth in the prayer of their complaint,and permitting golden eagle to litigate the issue of s w liability.division one of the fourth district court of appeal upheld the reduction in claimants default judgment but reversed on the second ground because the default judgment conclusively established s w liability.the court of appeal opinion did not mention the default judgment obtained by allstate,or any rights claimants might have had to recover on this judgment by assignment.in a petition for rehearing,claimants asserted the court approval of the reduction of their default judgment was at odds with greenup rodman cal d.they also stated the court opinion overlook ed the housekeeping issue of claimants right to recover on the allstate default judgment.since golden eagle never sought to reduce this judgment,claimants asked that the opinion be modified to instruct the trial court to enter judgment against golden eagle and for claimants for the full amount of allstate default.after the court of appeal denied rehearing,claimants renewed these arguments in a petition for review in the supreme court,which was also summarily denied.
while claimants case was on appeal,the insurance commissioner seized golden eagle and instituted conservation proceedings.in august,the san francisco county superior court issued an order approving golden eagle rehabilitation plan.pursuant to the rehabilitation plan,the newly created golden eagle insurance corporation geic was responsible for covered claims arising under the insurer policies,and the golden eagle liquidating trust gelt was established to administer uncovered claims such as claims for damages or bad faith pending against the company.the san francisco county superior court retained jurisdiction to supervise the rehabilitation plan and adjudicate all third party claims asserted against golden eagle and the liquidating trust.accordingly,the court adopted procedures for adjudicating orders to show cause arising from the rejection by geic or gelt of covered and uncovered claims 
upon remand of claimants case from the court of appeal,the trial court the san diego county superior court transferred the matter to the san francisco county superior court pursuant to that court order approving the golden eagle rehabilitation plan.claimants had previously submitted a proof of claim in the conservation proceedings for plus,and on february,they submitted a supplemental proof of claim,which described the procedural posture of the case and argued claimants entitlement to actual and default damages and a recovery of unspecified amount on their bad faith claim after claimants claims were denied they applied to the san francisco county superior court for an order to show cause.the court denied the application and denied claimants motion for reconsideration or for new trial.this appeal followed.
discussion 
claimants right to recover on allstate default judgment 
claimants assert the trial court erred in denying their claim for recovery of the approximately default judgment,which was originally obtained by allstate against s w and which allstate later assigned to them.because this judgment was never reduced,as claimants own default judgment was,claimants insist they have a right to recover the full amount as allstate assignees.in response,geic argues allstate subrogation rights were limited to the rights claimants had as allstate insureds,and claimants may not recover this same amount twice.further,geic contends res judicata bars claimants from relitigating the issue,since claimants previously asked the fourth district court of appeal and the supreme court to approve their right to recover on the allstate judgment and these courts declined to do so.
we do not believe principles of waiver or estoppel bar claimants from litigating their right to recovery for the allstate default judgment.there is no indication in the record that this issue was presented to the jury,or otherwise litigated,in the first trial.more importantly,it appears no judgment was ever entered against golden eagle for the amount of the allstate judgment.the judgment claimants appealed to the fourth district court of appeal simply reflected the jury verdict that claimants could recover nothing from golden eagle under section.although claimants asked the court of appeal and the supreme court to vindicate their position that,upon remand,their recovery from golden eagle should encompass the allstate judgment as well as their own default judgment,these courts properly declined to decide this collateral issue.
we therefore address the merits of geic subrogation argument.as the trial court observed in ruling on claimants application for an order to show cause,there has been no prior adjudication of golden eagle liability for allstate judgment against s thus,the only way claimants may recover the allstate judgment from golden eagle is by asserting allstate rights which claimants obtained by assignment.allstate intervened in claimants suit against s w to assert a claim for subrogation.specifically,allstate claimed a right to recover in subrogation the it had paid claimants,plus assorted costs and prejudgment interest.
in general,two avenues of recovery,equitable contribution and subrogation,are available to an insurer who pays for its insured loss.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d fireman fund.in the case of insurance,subrogation takes the form of an insurer right to be put in the position of the insured in order to pursue recovery from third parties legally responsible to the insured for a loss which the insurer has both insured and paid.citations.id.at,d.equitable contribution,however,describes the insurer right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.footnote in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk,each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured.id.at,d,italics omitted.
unlike the situation in fireman fund,allstate and golden eagle clearly insured different parties.compare fireman fund,supra,th at,d.indeed,although the trial court considered the availability of equitable contribution,claimants here do not purport to assert a right of equitable contribution against golden eagle,and they have offered no evidence or argument to show the allstate and golden eagle policies covered the same risk.rather,claimants insist that,by virtue of an assignment from allstate,they own a default judgment worth close to,and they claim they should be allowed to recover this entire sum from golden eagle as judgment creditors under section,subdivision b 
as claimants apparently recognize,the judgment represents a recovery for allstate in subrogation.but allstate subrogation claim was entirely derivative of claimants substantive claims against s w the right of subrogation is purely derivative.an insurer entitled to subrogation is in the same position as an assignee of the insured claim,and succeeds only to the rights of the insured.the subrogated insurer is said to stand in the shoes of its insured,because it has no greater rights than the insured and is subject to the same defenses assertable against the insured.thus,an insurer can not acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured has no rights,and may claim no rights which the insured does not have.citations.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.
because a subrogated insurer stands in the shoes of the insured and has no greater rights than the insured truck ins.exchange superior court th,d,allstate was subject to all the defenses s w and,by extension,golden eagle either raised or could have raised against claimants.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d a subrogated insurer is subject to all defenses the third party could have asserted against the insured.arguably,one such defense was that claimants could recover no more than the sum stated in the prayer of their complaint.geic contends allstate was also bound by this finding because it stood in claimants shoes as a subrogated insurer.according to geic,allstate was not entitled to recover in subrogation any amount exceeding the established value of its insured claims.
in response,claimants observe that an insurer may attempt to recover subrogation from a third party tortfeasor by intervening in a suit brought by the insured or by filing its own,independent action.claimants also insist an insurer who intervenes in an action should not be held accountable for every pleading flaw in the case brought by its insured.they rely on deutschmann sears,roebuck d,which permitted an intervening insurer to proceed with its subrogation action even after the insured case was dismissed for failure to file proof of service of the summons.the court in deutschmann stated an intervener is not limited by every procedural decision made by the plaintiff and observed that,despite the plaintiff wishes,an intervener may move to disqualify a judge,or object to pleadings or the court jurisdiction,or demand a jury trial.id.at.however,although an intervener enjoys the same procedural rights as any other party in litigation,the intervener remains bound to substantive limitations on its recovery imposed by the law of subrogation.see bright american termite control d.indeed,the deutschmann court observed,it is true that the failure of the plaintiff to recover from a defendant would likewise deprive an intervener of the right to recover,since a decision on the merits would affect the rights of both plaintiff and intervener to collect from defendant.deutschmann sears,roebuck,supra,at.
courts have held a subrogated insurer has no right to recover from a third party who has been released from liability by the insured.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d see also continental underwriters at lloyds london d,insurer had no right of subrogation where insured had contractually released defendant from liability for negligence.nor may an insurer pursue a subrogation recovery if the insured is itself barred from filing suit.see truck ins.exchange superior court,supra,th at,d insurer could not intervene to claim subrogation where insured lacked capacity to sue due to its failure to file tax returns.however,these cases merely illustrate the unremarkable proposition that subrogation is available only if the insured has an existing,legally enforceable cause of action against the tortfeasor.see couch,insurance ed,to.they do not decide the precise question before,whether an intervening insurer is subject to the same limitation on damages that has been imposed on its insured due to a jurisdictional flaw in the insured complaint.neither party has directed us to a case addressing this question.
we conclude the rule that a subrogated insurer stands in the shoes of its insured,and is subject to defenses against claims by the insured,can not be applied to limit allstate recovery for subrogation amounts appropriately pleaded in its complaint against s w.in accordance with code of civil procedure section and becker construction cal d,claimants default judgment against s w was reduced to the stated in their complaint prayer for relief even though the body of the complaint described many thousand dollars more in damages.the purpose of the rule that a plaintiff relief on default can not exceed the amount prayed for in the complaint is to insure that defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against them.citation.becker construction,supra,at.but,while application of the becker rule limited claimants damages on default to,allstate put s w on notice that the actual damages were much greater thus,allowing allstate to recover the full amount of its subrogation default judgment does not frustrate the purpose of the rule limiting the amounts recoverable in default judgments.under the contrary view urged by geic,a defaulting party who had actual notice could hide behind one plaintiff pleading flaw to avoid paying the full extent of damages claimed by another.suc
