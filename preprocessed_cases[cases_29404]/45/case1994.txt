berry murphy,and timothy berry,plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to carolina casualty insurance company carolina casualty on plaintiffs claim for insurance coverage for a malpractice lawsuit.plaintiffs filed their action in state court and carolina casualty removed the case to federal court,alleging diversity jurisdiction under.the district court concluded that carolina casualty had no duty to defend or indemnify plaintiffs because a claim was first made against an insured in january than one year prior to the policy period.
we have jurisdiction over plaintiffs timely appeal pursuant to and affirm.
oksana and william burkhardt the burkhardts hired seth murphy,a of the law firm of berry murphy,to represent them in a personal injury suit arising out of an alleged assault by joseph ciri the ciri lawsuit.in january,murphy filed a complaint on behalf of the burkhardts in colorado state court.the ciri lawsuit was governed by colorado simplified procedure rule.civ,and murphy did not opt out of proceeding under rule.
over a year later,in march,murphy left berry murphy,and joined the law firm of richmond,neiley,sprouse,murphy,llc.murphy took the ciri lawsuit with him to his new law firm.about the same time,however,murphy filed a motion to withdraw as counsel from the ciri lawsuit because he was allegedly having a difficult time getting the burkhardts to cooperate in the prosecution of their claims.
in april,the defendants in the ciri lawsuit filed a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.the motion to dismiss alleged failure to supplement initial disclosures regarding damages as required by.civ.a failure to respond to a november letter from defendants counsel regarding additional disclosures failure to produce a release for medical records for the previous five years failure to produce complete billing information from medical providers failure to produce employment records in violation of.civ.k b ii failure to disclose any expert witness before the deadline set forth in rule k and failure to produce witness information pursuant to rule k.at the end of may,the court orally granted murphy motion to withdraw as counsel from the ciri lawsuit.shortly thereafter,on june,the court granted,without prejudice,the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute and entered a written order granting murphy motion to withdraw.
the burkhardts then hired new counsel and moved for reconsideration of the order dismissing their lawsuit and for reinstatement of the case.in november,the court granted the burkhardts motion.the court also ordered the burkhardts to file new witness disclosures which complied with rule k by december.
on january,cindy tester,the burkhardts new attorney in the ciri lawsuit,sent the following letter to murphy at richmond,sprouse murphy,llc formerly richmond,neiley,sprouse murphy,llc 
dear murphy 
this is to advise you to put your legal malpractice insurance carrier on immediate notice a sic legal malpractice claim that i plan on filing against you on behalf of my clients,william burkhardt.the court recently found that your conduct in handling the burkhardts case was so egregious and so woefully inadequate that the case was nearly dismissed.only through over hundreds of hours of pleadings practice,thousands of dollars paid to experts to obtain expert reports and innumerable hours of work put into this case since i took it over,were we able to somewhat resurrect this case to give the plaintiffs a chance at their day in court.
moreover,the court made certain findings as to your conduct and culpability regarding the manner in which you handled this case and the way you flagrantly disregarded your duties as an attorney.as such,put your carrier on notice immediately and give me the name of your insurance adjuster,so i may forward your adjuster a complete copy of the transcript of the court findings,the recent pleadings that have been filed in this case,which is still very minimally on tract sic at best given the plethora of the defendants recent pleadings trying yet again to have it dismissed and it was already dismissed once due to your conduct.
the plaintiffs shall hold you entirely liable for all your misfeasance and malfeasance concerning your egregious inaction in handling and mishandling this case and the extreme amount of mental anguish,hours put into this case and the precarious position that you have put them in through failing to even remotely properly even the most mediocre attorney could handle a case sic.
i expect to hear from your carrier shortly.
app.at sic throughout hereinafter the tester letter.the tester letter was not sent to murphy former,timothy berry,and berry was not given notice of the letter at the time.murphy,upon receipt of the tester letter,put his law firm malpractice happened to be carolina notice of the claim.
defendants in the state court ciri lawsuit,having not received the recently material by the end of december deadline,next renewed their request for dismissal of the ciri lawsuit.in february,the court denied the defendants request to dismiss,but struck all but eight of the burkhardts potential witnesses and required rule k compliant witness disclosures for these eight witnesses by march.the burkhardts failed to comply with the court order by this new deadline and defendants then filed a second renewed motion to dismiss.the court granted,with prejudice,the second renewed motion to dismiss in december 
on january,the burkhardts filed a legal malpractice claim against seth murphy and berry murphy,in the pitkin county,colorado district court the malpractice lawsuit.the malpractice lawsuit generally alleged that seth murphy and berry murphy,missed the deadline for filing a notice to elect exclusion from simplified procedures pursuant to.civ.in the ciri lawsuit.the malpractice lawsuit also generally alleged that seth murphy and berry murphy,were negligent and breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty to the burkhardts.the malpractice lawsuit claimed damages were loss in the value of a chose,plus litigation costs,attorney fees,and interest.app.at.
berry murphy,was the predecessor firm to timothy berry,timothy berry,is a leadville,colorado professional corporation engaged in the practice of law.as regards the insurance policy for timothy berry,timothy berry,was the named insured on a lawyers professional liability insurance policy issued by carolina casualty,an iowa insurance company.the insurance policy was effective from february,to february.on july,timothy berry accepted service of the malpractice lawsuit,and he gave notice to carolina casualty of the filing of the malpractice lawsuit on that date.berry alleges he had no knowledge of either the tester letter or the malpractice lawsuit until he accepted service of the malpractice lawsuit on july.
plaintiffs filed this action to resolve the parties dispute regarding insurance coverage for the malpractice lawsuit.carolina casualty denied coverage for the malpractice lawsuit on the grounds that the alleged malpractice claim was first made against an insured,seth murphy prior to the inception of the insurance policy,via the tester letter,thereby falling outside the coverage of the policy.plaintiffs complaint asserts claims for declaratory relief,injunctive relief,breach of contract,and bad faith.
before the district court,plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and a motion for leave to add additional claims.carolina casualty and plaintiffs then filed for summary judgment.the district court,orally at a motions hearing,granted carolina casualty motion for summary judgment,denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,and found plaintiffs remaining motions moot.in granting carolina casualty motion,the district court stated 
i going to grant carolina casualty motion for summary judgment.murphy is an insured.he had notice from this tester letter that he was going to be accused,or was directly accused of malpractice in the representation of the burkhardts in the pitkin county case,and that it had been dismissed.and,it is just a question of his failing to timely make this election under colorado rule,it really the failure to proceed with that lawsuit and make the disclosures,whatever the rule was.and,i think that his further conduct in not notifying his former partner,or firm,that this claim was going to be made for his conduct while he was with that firm,you know,the burden does fall on the insurance company for that.
app.at.the district court later awarded costs to carolina casualty based on its finding that carolina casualty was the prevailing party.
we review de novo the district court summary judgment decision,applying the same standard as the district court.butler compton,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we examine the record and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the party.antonio sygma network,cir quotation omitted.
in addition,we review the district court interpretation and determination of state law de novo,hartford cas.ins,cir.because this is a diversity action,we apply the substantive law of the forum state,including its choice of law rules.bottling of pittsburg,pepsico,cir.colorado is the forum state in this appeal.under colorado rules,an insurance contract is governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the insurance contract.see fire ins.exch.bentley,citing wood.homes,walker adjustment bureau.
although the record does not address the issue directly,we conclude that colorado law applies.the insurance contract was apparently negotiated and entered into in colorado and the insured place of business is in colorado.see wood.homes,at nn.listing factors to be taken into account to determine the state with the most significant relationship.colorado therefore has the most significant relationship to the insurance policy.
colorado courts construe an insurance policy terms according to principles of contract interpretation.thompson.cas.in thompson,a duty to defend insurance policy case,the colorado supreme court said 
in interpreting a contract,we seek to give effect to the intent and reasonable expectations of the parties.accordingly,unless the parties intend otherwise,terms in an insurance policy should be assigned their plain and ordinary meaning.
we also recognize that unlike a negotiated contract,an insurance policy is often imposed on a basis.therefore,we assume a heightened responsibility in reviewing insurance policy terms to ensure that they comply with public policy and principles of fairness.accordingly,ambiguous terms in an insurance policy are construed against the insurer.
id.at internal citations omitted.
a.the policy language.
we turn then to the language of the insurance policy at issue.see state farm mut.auto.ins.nissen,our starting point is the plain language of the contract and the intent of the parties as expressed in that language.the insurance policy contains the following insuring agreement 
this policy shall pay on behalf of the insured all damages and claims expense that the insured shall become legally obligated to pay,arising from any claim first made against an insured during the policy period and reported to the insurer in writing during the policy period or within days thereafter,for any wrongful act,provided that prior to the inception date of the first lawyers professional liability insurance policy issued by the insurer to the named insured,which has been continuously renewed and maintained in effect to the inception of this policy period,the insured did not know,or could not reasonable foresee that such wrongful act might reasonably be expected to be the basis of a claim.
app.at the insurance policy also provides that t he insurer shall have the right and the duty to defend any claim to which this insurance applies id.at.
the insurance policy defines the terms.claim is defined as a written demand for monetary or relief including,but not limited to,a civil,criminal,administrative or arbitration proceeding a claim shall be deemed to have been first made at the time notice of the claim is first received by any insured.id.at.the insurance policy defines wrongful act as any actual or alleged act,omission,or personal injury arising out of professional services rendered by an insured or by any person for whose act or omission the insured is legally responsible and related wrongful act as wrongful acts which are logically or causally connected by reason of any common fact,circumstance,situation,transaction,casualty,event or decision.id.at.and finally,the insurance policy has a section titled notice of claim and multiple claims which states in pertinent part 
a.as a condition precedent to their rights under this policy,an insured shall give the insurer written notice of any claim as soon as practicable.
b.if during the policy period an insured becomes aware of any fact,circumstance or situation which may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim being made against any insured and shall give written notice to the insurer,as soon as practicable but prior to the expiration or cancellation of the policy,of 
the specific fact,circumstance or situation,with full details as to dates,persons,and entities involved and 
the injury or damages which may result therefrom and 
the circumstances by which the insured first became aware thereof 
then any claim subsequently made arising out of such fact,circumstance or situation shall be deemed to have been made when notice was first given to the insurer.
all claims based upon or arising out of the same wrongful acts or any related wrongful acts,or one or more series of any similar,repeated or continuous wrongful act or related wrongful acts,shall be considered a single claim.each claim shall be deemed to be first made at the earliest of the following times 
when the earliest claim arising out of such wrongful act or related wrongful acts is first made,or 
when notice pursuant to section of a fact,circumstance or situation giving rise to such claim is given.
id.at underlining emphasis added.
we do not find any of the terms above to be all have plain and ordinary meanings that can be applied to the language of the insurance policy.see cary united of omaha life ins,an insurance policy is ambiguous if it is susceptible on its face to more than one reasonable interpretation a mere disagreement between the parties concerning interpretation of the policy does not create an ambiguity.to determine whether a policy contains an ambiguity,we must evaluate the policy as a whole.internal citations omitted.therefore,we will enforce the insurance policy as written.see hoang,at in interpreting a contract,we give effect to the intent and reasonable expectations of the parties.we must enforce the plain language of the policy unless it is ambiguous.internal citations omitted.
do the tester letter and the malpractice lawsuit involve a single claim 
we must first determine whether the tester letter and the malpractice lawsuit allege related wrongful acts which would be considered as one claim under the policy.here,the insurance policy required that,as a condition precedent to triggering rights under the policy,an insured must give the insurer written notice of the claim as soon as practicable.app.at and,a claim is deemed to have been first made at the time notice of the claim is first received by any insured.id.at emphasis added.further,all claims based upon or arising out of the same wrongful acts or any related wrongful acts,or one or more series of any similar,repeated or continuous wrongful act or related wrongful acts,shall be considered a single claim.id.at.and,a claim is first made when the earliest claim arising out of such wrongful act or related wrongful acts is first made.id.
therefore,the first step in untangling the factual scenario in this case is to analyze the insurance policy definition of related wrongful act.if the tester letter makes a claim that is a related wrongful act to the malpractice lawsuit,then the tester letter was the first notice of the claim.as stated above,a related wrongful act is defined as wrongful acts which are logically or causally connected by reason of any common fact,circumstance,situation,transaction,casualty,event or decision.id.at.therefore,we must determine whether the acts alleged in the tester letter and the malpractice lawsuit are logically or causally connected.
plaintiffs cite the federal district court case of professional solutions ins.mohrlang,wl,in support of their position that the claim asserted in the tester letter and the claims asserted in the malpractice lawsuit are not logically or causally connected.in mohrlang,an insurer filed suit seeking a declaration that the relevant insurance policy did not require payment to the defendants,harry and lenora mohrlang,and bruce mohrlang,who became trustee of their various trusts.wl,at.the insurer provided professional malpractice insurance to an attorney and the defendants were clients of that attorney.id.
the attorney was sent a letter and draft complaint from bruce mohrlang which indicated a professional negligence action would be brought against the attorney for the attorney allegedly deficient advice in negotiating and structuring the sale of the defendants business.id.at.the attorney was then sent a letter and draft complaint from harry mohrlang alleging professional negligence for advice concerning the sale of stock in the defendants business and breach of fiduciary duties of loyalty,disclosure,candor regarding release of promissory notes.id.the insurance policy at issue was limited to per claim with a aggregate term limit all related claims were considered to be a single claim by the policy.id.at.
the insurance policy defined claim as a demand you receive for money or services,including suit or institution of arbitration proceedings against you.id.at internal quotations,alterations,and emphasis omitted.the insurance policy then defined related claim as claims arising out of a single act or omission or arising out of related acts or omissions in the rendering of professional services.id.internal quotations and emphasis omitted.and finally,the insurance policy defined related acts or omissions as all acts or omissions in the rendering of professional services that are temporally,logically or causally connected by any common fact,circumstance,situation,transaction,event,advice or decision.id.internal quotations and emphasis omitted.
the district court in mohrlang first found that the language of the insurance policy was not ambiguous and that the policy terms should be given their plain and ordinary meaning.id.at.the district court then went on to define the temporally,logically or causally connected phrase used in the related acts or omissions definition of the insurance policy.the district court found no temporal connection between the sale of the business and the breach of fiduciary duties because there was a temporal break between the two events.id.at.
the district court then defined logically connected as connected by an inevitable or predictable interrelation or sequence of events,noting that for two things to be logically connected,one must attend or flow from the other in an inevitable or predictable way.id.the district court found no logical connection between the two alleged acts of malpractice because the sale agreement did not account for the promissory note and deed of trust that were the subject of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties they were independent obligations.id.
finally,the district court defined causally connected.id.the district court defined causally connected as where one person or thing brings about the other.id.the district court also noted that the common understanding of causation requires a showing of causation and a situation where the first thing leads to the second in a direct and traceable way,and where no independent,significant thing interrupts the causal chain between the two.id.the district court found that the two alleged acts of malpractice were not causally connected because the sale of the business did not directly or certainly did not to the attorney violation of his fiduciary duties.id.at.
because the district court in mohrlang found that the alleged acts of malpractice were not temporally,logically,or causally connected by any common fact,circumstance,situation,transaction,event,advice,or decision,the district court concluded that the two claims were not related claims under the insurance policy.id.at.plaintiffs ask us to adopt the result reached in mohrlang to the facts of this case.while we agree that,like the insurance policy in mohrlang,the terms of this insurance policy are not ambiguous and should be defined by their plain and ordinary meaning,we conclude that the acts of malpractice alleged in the tester letter and the malpractice lawsuit are logically or causally connected.
here,using the common definition of logically connected expressed in mohrlang,the alleged acts of malpractice in the tester letter and the malpractice lawsuit are connected by an inevitable or predictable interrelation or sequence of events.id.at.the tester letter faults murphy for not submitting rule required witness disclosures.the malpractice lawsuit flows from murphy decision to proceed under rule.surely these two acts attend or flow from the other in an inevitable or predictable way.see id.a required disclosure under rule and the decision to proceed under rule are predictably interrelated because the decision not to opt out of rule resulted in a timeline for witness disclosures under that rule.
both parties then also discuss the case of bay cities paving grading,lawyers mut.ins,cal th,d,which determined the meaning of claim and related under a legal liability insurance policy.in bay cities,the alleged malpractice was an attorney failure to serve a stop notice on a construction project lenders and a failure to timely foreclose on a mechanic lien.d,at.the insurance policy provided coverage for each claim and further provided that t wo or more claims arising out of a single act,error or omission or a series of related acts,errors or omissions shall be treated as a single claim.id.
bay cities argued that it was entitled to the policy limits for two claims because the attorney two omissions resulted in separate injuries to bay cities.id.at.the insurer argued that bay cities had a single cause of action and a single injury stemming from the attorney conduct.id.the california supreme court in bay cities determined that the insurance policy definition of claim limited bay cities to only one claim under the policy.id.at.the court stated 
w hen,as in this case,a single client seeks to recover from a single attorney alleged damages based on a single debt collection matter for which the attorney was is a single claim under the attorney professional liability insurance policy.
i f an attorney single error harmed two clients and gave each of them a separate claim,those two claims would be treated as a single claim under the policy limitation of liability.it would be anomalous to limit liability in that circumstance but to disregard the limitation when,as in this case,a single client suffers a single injury as a result of multiple errors.
the bay cities court then went on to determine,in the alternative,whether the insurance policy related acts,errors or omissions language would limit bay cities to the policy per claim limit.id.at.the court found that the term related was not ambiguous and that it was broad enough to encompass both logical as well as causal relationships id.at.the court found that the alleged acts of malpractice were related.id.at.the court noted that the acts arose out of the same specific transaction,the collection of a single debt,that the acts arose as to the same client,that the acts were committed by the same attorney,and that the acts resulted in the same injury.id.
carolina casualty argues that bay cities reasoning should be applied here,and urges us to conclude that plaintiffs have one malpractice claim and that the alleged acts of malpractice in the tester letter and the malpractice lawsuit should be deemed related.carolina casualty analogizes bay cities because here there is a single burkhardts there is a single.murphy and there is a single tort claim for which murphy was retained.appellee br.at.carolina casualty also contends that the burkhardts suffered a single harm from murphy alleged acts of malpractice the lost opportunity to recover some or all of their damages in the ciri lawsuit.id.we agree with carolina casualty that the burkhardts suffered one injury in the facts underlying this case.where there is one injury flowing from multiple acts of malpractice,it seems logical to connect those multiple acts of malpractice as related.see,gregory home ins,cir t he common understanding of the word related covers a very broad range of connections,both causal and logical.because the insurance policy here treats as one claim all related wrongful acts,we therefore conclude the burkhardts state one claim.
and finally,a case cited by carolina casualty discusses the determination of whether a single claim or multiple claims have been made under a legal liability insurance policy.see eagle am.ins.nichols,so d.in nichols,the insurance policy limited coverage per claim for related wrongful acts.so d at.the alleged acts of malpractice were the attorney failure to name a hospital and each individual physician from that hospital as defendants in a medical malpractice lawsuit.id.at.nichols asserted that he had multiple claims because his attorney committed multiple wrongful acts by failing to join several defendants,depriving him of a claim against each defendant for that defendant maximum liability coverage.id.at.the insurer alleged that nichols had only one malpractice claim and one loss of a complete recovery.id.
the court concluded that the negligent acts alleged by nichols were logically related.the court stated 
i n this case,the claim was for the entire amount of nichols uncollected damages as a result of the failure to join several defendants in the suit,and all of the acts of negligence caused or contributed to the inability of nichols to collect the entire amount of his damages.
id.at.similar to our discussion regarding the bay cities case above,we conclude that the burkhardts one malpractice cause of action resulting in the one claim for injury encompasses all alleged acts of malpractice related to that malpractice cause of action.here,an alleged failure to comply with colorado rules for disclosure of witnesses is related to an alleged failure to opt out of those same rules.we conclude that the tester letter and the malpractice lawsuit allege related wrongful acts under the insurance policy.therefore,they should be considered one claim under that policy.
was murphy an insured under plaintiffs policy 
the insurance policy covers claims that were first made to an insured during the policy period.thus,we must now determine whether murphy was an insured under the definitions of the policy when he received the tester letter.
as stated above,per the terms of the insurance policy,a claim shall be deemed to have been first made at the time notice of the claim is first received by any insured.app.at.an insured is defined as 
insured means 
the named insured and any predecessor firm 
any individual or professional corporation who is or becomes a partner,officer,director,stockholder,or employee of the named insured,but solely while acting within the scope of their duties on behalf of the named insured 
any individual or professional corporation who was a partner,officer,director,stockholder,or employee of the named insured or predecessor firm,but solely while acting within the scope of their duties on behalf of the named insured or predecessor firm 
any individual or professional corporation designated counsel or of counsel to the named insured,but solely while acting within the scope of their duties on behalf of the named insured for which a fee inured to the named insured 
the heirs,executors,administrators,and legal representatives of each insured in the event of death,incapacity or bankruptcy,but solely with respect to the liability of each insured as otherwise covered by this policy.
id.underlining emphasis added.
again,we find no ambiguity in the language of the insurance policy.all the terms have ordinary,common meanings associated with them.the plain meaning of the applicable definitional subsection covers a very broad swath of individuals,and then narrows that swath.it begins with the phrase any individual and is then limited by a requirement that the individual was a partner,officer,director,stockholder,or employee of the named insured,which was timothy berry,id.emphasis added.it is undisputed that murphy was a in berry murphy,and was therefore an individual who was a partner of the named insured.
the second limit on the insured definition is the language but solely while acting within the scope of their duties on behalf of the named insured.id.this clause,when read in context with the rest of this definitional subsection,can not mean that an individual is an insured only while acting on behalf of the named insured,but must mean that an individual is an insured only if the claim being made is related to that individual duties on behalf of the named insured.otherwise,no former employee of the named insured could ever be an insured.if insured were interpreted to mean that an individual was an insured only while acting within the scope of business of the named insured,it would be paradoxical to define insured to include former individual who was a partner,officer,director,stockholder,or employee of the named insured,timothy berry,id.emphasis added.
in our opinion,the better view is that insured is defined to include an individual after he has left the law firm if the claim involves that individual acts or omissions that occurred while at the law firm here,that is the case,because murphy withdrew from the ciri lawsuit almost simultaneously with leaving berry murphy.we therefore conclude that notice of the claim was given to murphy,an insured via the tester letter,before the policy period as a result,carolina casualty had no duty to defend or indemnify plaintiffs.
because carolina casualty had no legally cognizable duty to defend or indemnify a claim,plaintiffs bad faith claim also can not survive.leprino nationwide prop.cas.ins.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
we acknowledge that this is a harsh result for thomas berry.murphy was apparently no longer in communication with berry after he left their law firm and murphy did not give berry notice of the tester letter by which berry could have notified his insurer of the malpractice claim.but the insurance policy language requires this result,and that is the language berry agreed to when he entered this contract with carolina casualty.the colorado supreme court has given a summary of its rules for the interpretation of an insurance contract,which is particularly applicable here 
an insurance policy is a contract which should be interpreted consistently with the well settled principles of contractual interpretation.this approach acknowledges that 
a n insurance contract is a mutual agreement,ratified by the insured by his acceptance,both parties are bound by its provisions,unless waived or annulled for lawful reasons.in the absence of statutory inhibition,an insurer may impose any terms and conditions consistent with public policy which it may see fit.
chacon am.family mut.ins,internal quotations and citations omitted.
in addition,the colorado courts recognize the utility of insurance policies 
i n a policy,the notice provision provides a certain date after which an insurer knows it no longer is liable under the policy and,accordingly,allows the insurer to fix more accurately its reserves for future liabilities and compute premiums with greater certainty it is because of this significant role of notice in policies that numerous courts have held that excusing a delay in notice beyond the policy period should not be done,because to do so would alter a basic term of the insurance contract which expresses the parties agreement.
estate of hunt,at.the same reasoning applies to refusing to excuse the failure to give notice of a claim when the initial notice of that claim was given prior to the st
