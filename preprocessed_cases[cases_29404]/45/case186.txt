background 
we review the facts in the light most favorable to ralph.see,mcadams.mut.life ins,cir recounting the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.
in,guardian issued a disability insurance policy to ralph the policy was and guaranteed renewable to age and was issued in consideration of the payment of premiums,which were to be paid on a quarterly basis.the policy listed only one condition for its renewal the premiums had to be paid as the policy required.and,the policy provided that t he payment of any premium will not continue this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium is due,except for a day grace period 
from to,ralph timely paid his premiums.however,he failed to pay his quarterly premium that was due in december and failed to make subsequent payments due in march,june,and september.
late in the summer of,ralph and his wife,jean cimon jean,moved from massachusetts to maine.prior to moving,jean mailed a change of address card to guardian.at the time of the move,jean also called gaffney to inform him of the move.during the call,jean gave gaffney their new maine address and telephone number,and she attempted to schedule an appointment for ralph so that he and gaffney could discuss his insurance coverage.gaffney,however,told jean that he was busy and would call her back at a more convenient time.gaffney never called jean back,and jean did not make any further attempt to contact gaffney.
on november,guardian sent ralph a letter stating that he had a premium payment due on december.the premium due date came and went without guardian receiving a payment.on january,guardian sent ralph a second letter in which it offered to accept a late payment.then,on march,having still not received the december,payment,guardian sent ralph a third letter informing him that his policy had lapsed ralph did not receive any of the letters,which were apparently sent to an incorrect address in maine.
from to,ralph had received letters on a quarterly basis alerting him of his premium payment due dates.by,ralph had become accustomed to,and relied on,receiving such letters.in fact,ralph paid his premiums only after receiving notice that payments were due.thus,because ralph never received a letter reminding him to pay his december,premium,he never paid that premium or the three premiums due thereafter.
in october of,ralph became disabled.on november,jean called guardian and learned that the policy had been cancelled.on november,ralph sent a letter to guardian requesting that the policy be reinstated and giving notice that he intended to file a claim pursuant to.laws ch,if guardian refused his request ralph also sent guardian a check for the unpaid premiums.guardian refused to reinstate the policy.
as a result,in october,ralph sued guardian and gaffney in maine,claiming that he was entitled to damages because the two breached numerous duties of care they owed to him under the policy in connection with their failure to ensure that premium notices were sent to his correct address.in addition,ralph alleged that he was entitled to recover under.laws ch,for guardian and gaffney refusal to settle his claim and reinstate the policy ralph also asserted that the two breached the policy,and should be estopped from terminating the policy,due to their failure to send premium notices to his correct address.
in response,guardian filed a motion for summary judgment and gaffney filed a motion to dismiss.guardian,citing.laws ch,insisted that it was entitled to summary judgment because the policy had lapsed as a matter of law the district court agreed and allowed guardian motion gaffney moved for dismissal based on lack of personal jurisdiction ralph responded by filing a motion to transfer the action against gaffney to massachusetts pursuant to in granting gaffney motion to dismiss,the district court ruled that it lacked personal jurisdiction and that transfer would not be in the interest of justice ralph seeks review of the district court grant of guardian motion for summary judgment and refusal to transfer the action against gaffney 
ii.discussion 
we first consider whether the district court erred in granting guardian motion for summary judgment and then decide whether it erred in denying ralph motion to transfer.
a.the grant of guardian motion for summary judgment 
we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.gte wireless,cellexis int l,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the record reveals that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.see geffon micrion,cir.
the district court granted guardian motion for summary judgment based on its finding that,under.laws ch,ralph policy automatically terminated when he failed to pay the december premium within three months of its due date.we think that the district court was wrong to interpret section as providing for automatic termination of a policy after three months for nonpayment of a premium.we read the statute as providing a degree of protection for the insured by putting limits on an insurance company contractual ability to cancel a policy based on nonpayment of a premium we do not read it as providing for termination as a matter of law.still,the statute does not prohibit an insurance company from terminating a accordance with the policy nonpayment of a premium.rather,it simply provides that a policy can not be terminated for nonpayment of a premium until three months after the date on which the premium was due unless notice was sent in accordance with the statute.see supra note.
here,the policy stated that it would terminate due to a missed premium payment the payment of any premium will not continue this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium is due and,starting with the december,payment,ralph missed four consecutive premium payments and did not attempt to tender a late payment until november of.thus,regardless of whether guardian sent notice of the december,payment deadline,the policy terminated pursuant to its terms on march,months after the due date of the first missed premium and well before ralph attempted to tender a late payment in november of that year 
ralph argues that guardian should be estopped from terminating the policy pursuant to his nonpayment of the december,premium because he relied on guardian to send notices of premium payment deadlines before making such payments and guardian failed to send proper notice of the december,deadline to establish that guardian should be estopped from terminating the policy due to the missed premium,ralph must convince us that,among other things,there is an equitable defense available to an insured who violates a contractual obligation and he acted reasonably in relying on guardian to remind him of the december,payment deadline before making that payment.see turnpike motors,newbury group,it is necessary that the reliance of the party seeking the benefit of estoppel must have been reasonable.
we think that even if there were an equitable defense available,ralph would not be entitled to invoke it because his reliance on guardian to remi
