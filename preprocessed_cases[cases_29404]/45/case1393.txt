this case pits a surviving husband and child against a sister in a fight over the proceeds of three insurance policies.brenda combes was the insured person she died suddenly at the age of.her husband,david combes,was surprised to discover that brenda had changed the beneficiaries on these policies or had tried to do so from himself and the couple daughter ashley to brenda sister,linda davis.in time,two of the insurance companies filed interpleader actions one in the eastern district of north carolina and one in the northern district of illinois to determine the rightful beneficiaries of their respective policies,and deposited the policy proceeds with the court.the third policy was part of a benefit plan established under the employment retirement income security act,or erisa.linda filed her own suit in the eastern district of pennsylvania against the issuer of that policy and against david and ashley to whom we refer collectively as david,since their interests are aligned for present purposes,seeking a declaration that she was the sole beneficiary of that policy as well and demanding payment of the proceeds.
the pennsylvania and north carolina actions were later transferred to the northern district of illinois,the three cases were consolidated,and all contested proceeds were deposited with the court.after a bench trial,the district court ruled in favor of david,relying principally on an alleged oral agreement described by david under which brenda promised to maintain insurance for his benefit.while we do not doubt that david and ashley were sympathetic figures,we conclude that the oral agreement is not sufficient under the law of illinois to override a written designation of a beneficiary on an insurance policy.we also conclude that the flaws david identifies in the erisa change of beneficiary form were not enough to defeat its effectiveness.we therefore reverse.
before brenda and david were married in february,each had life insurance policies that named family members as beneficiaries.brenda had a policy issued by life investors,and david had a policy issued by equitable life assurance society.less than a week before the wedding,brenda made david the beneficiary on her life investors policy,and david increased his equitable policy to and made brenda the beneficiary.david testified that they took these steps to begin fulfilling their oral agreement to provide for each other through the purchase and maintenance of life insurance.
apart from this alleged oral agreement,david and brenda kept their financial lives almost entirely separate after the marriage.for example,they did not have a joint checking account,joint credit cards,or joint investments they did not file a joint tax return and until july of,when they a mortgage for a home,they had no joint interest in any assets.instead,they covered joint expenses by repaying one another for particular expenditures.this was,however,something of a street.until,david had very little to contribute to the household.he was a rather unsuccessful insurance salesman,with an income in of less than,and a income of less than.his financial picture brightened in,when he took a position with a company that paid just under per year.brenda,in contrast,had advanced degrees in physical therapy and public health,including a from the university of illinois,and regularly earned more than david her income was about her income was roughly and her income in,the year of her death,was about.
a year after their marriage,brenda and david purchased additional life insurance.brenda acquired a policy from continental assurance company and named david as the sole beneficiary,while david acquired a policy from continental and designated brenda as the sole beneficiary.according to david,these actions amounted to further performance of the oral agreement.
in may the couple first child,ashley,was born,and a few months later,brenda began to work for novacare.through novacare erisa plan,she purchased a policy on david life naming herself as the beneficiary and ashley as the beneficiary.she also purchased a policy on her own life,under which she named ashley the beneficiary and designated the remaining for her sister linda.a month later,david modified the beneficiary designations on his equitable policy.he removed brenda altogether from the policy and split it among ashley,his daughter from a previous marriage,danielle,and his mother.in november of the same year,brenda tinkered further with her novacare policy she raised the amount to,she removed linda as a beneficiary,and she designated an share for ashley and the remaining for david.
when david started his job at industrial risk in january,he took out a policy on his life with brenda as the sole beneficiary.in july of that year,he acquired a credit life insurance policy for,in which he named brenda the residual beneficiary.the last insurance policy he purchased before brenda death was a policy from security mutual life insurance company of new york.he bought that policy in july and once again named brenda the sole beneficiary.
brenda,in the meantime,had begun making changes to her beneficiary designations,without telling david what she was doing.on august,she removed david from the continental policy and named linda the sole beneficiary.she did the same thing on september,to her life investors policy.finally,she attempted to complete a change of beneficiary form for her novacare policy which was issued by reliance standard life insurance company,although the effectiveness of that effort is in dispute here.she filled her own form novacare gave her.on that form,she provided all the necessary information,including her designation of linda as the new beneficiary and september,as the effective date.she did not,however,sign and date the form on the lines provided for that purpose.novacare benefits coordinator,linda dean,accepted the form and entered the beneficiary change in novacare computer files.dean placed the hard copy of the form in brenda benefits file.finally,dean generated a letter entitled confirmation of your flex benefit choices.unfortunately,the record does not indicate whether brenda received her copy of that letter,but it does show that brenda never received anything that would have suggested a problem with her effort to change the beneficiary on that policy.
to sum up,as of the fall of brenda and ashley were the beneficiaries of several policies on david life,but brenda had removed david and ashley from her own policies or attempted to do so,in the case of the novacare policy and substituted linda in their place.the couple had a second child,julius,in november,but he was not a beneficiary on any policy carried by either parent.david,as we have already noted,did not know about the changes brenda had made.he discovered them only after her death.
relying heavily on the alleged oral agreement,david challenged linda right to collect on the policies.the three insurers left the contestants to resolve this problem among themselves.with respect to the life investors and continental policies,which brenda had unambiguously amended,david argued that the district court should impose a constructive trust on the proceeds because brenda committed fraud when she cut him and ashley out of the picture.he also argued that the constructive trust was justified under a theory of promissory estoppel.with respect to the novacare policy,he urged that the attempted change of beneficiary was ineffective because it lacked brenda signature on the signature line of the form and that she was equitably estopped from effecting the change.after a bench trial,the district court found for david on all three policies the court awarded david of the life investors policy proceeds,of the continental proceeds,and of the novacare policy.ashley received the remaining of the novacare policy.linda has appealed.
the district court concluded that the parties disputes over the life investors and continental policies are governed by illinois law,while federal law controls the erisa claims concerning the novacare policy.no one has objected to this ruling on appeal,and we will thus proceed on that basis.see mcfarland general am.life ins,cir reilly blue cross blue shield united,cir.
a.the life investors and continental policies 
as we just noted,the district court concluded that david was entitled to have a constructive trust imposed upon the proceeds of the life investors and continental policies.in so ruling,it found that he had successfully proven the elements of fraud,constructive fraud,and promissory estoppel,and that on the equities his claim to the proceeds was superior to linda.linda counters that the district court,among other things,failed to assess the evidence under the proper legal standards,under which she claims she should have prevailed.
the doctrine of constructive trust pits fundamental principles of property against equally fundamental principles of equity.cardozo recognized the tension when he noted that a constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression.beatty guggenheim exploration,quoted in scott and fratcher,the law of trusts.but the right to dispose of one property is also firmly ensconced in our legal traditions,and so it is only w hen property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest,that equity converts him to a trustee.id.illinois decisively favors the property side of the balance and recognizes a strong presumption that the named beneficiary of a life insurance policy is entitled to its proceeds.travelers ins.daniels,cir.the presumption is not,however,irrebuttable it can be overcome on equitable grounds if the contesting party can show that she was deprived of the proceeds by fraud or constructive fraud,breach of a fiduciary duty,or duress,coercion,or mistake.suttles vogel,smithberg.mun.ret.fund.the district court referred to this line of cases and properly focused on the three theories of fraud,constructive fraud,and promissory estoppel.the problem with its analysis arose at the next stage,when it considered the proper burdens of proof.
the burden of proof on the issue whether a constructive trust should be imposed in this kind of case is a matter of state,not federal law.see,shapiro rubens,cir applying indiana clear and convincing evidence burden of proof ohio four seasons nursing centers of america,cir applying oklahoma clear and convincing evidence burden of proof.illinois courts have stressed that a party seeking to do so bears a heavy burden of proof.the grounds for imposing a constructive trust must be so clear,convincing,strong,and unequivocal as to lead to but one conclusion.suttles,at schultz schultz,d.each element of the wrongdoing giving rise to the constructive trust must be established by clear and convincing evidence.rapp bowers,d,see also martin heinold commodities,fiduciary relationship must be established by clear and convincing evidence.to be clear and convincing,the evidence presented must leave no reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the truth of the proposition in question.parker sullivan,cir,citing estate of ragen,d.
this heightened evidentiary burden exists to implement illinois substantive law emphasizing the paramount right of property owners while they are alive to dispose of their belongings including the proceeds of life insurance policies as they see fit,even if their decisions impair a marital partner future interest in the property.wood wood,d,title holder may dispose of home even if it might be considered marital property or spouse represented that it would be marital property schultz,at unless wife rights vested,husband was free to change beneficiary on life insurance on his own whim if he reserved the right to do so.
applied too liberally,the device of a constructive trust could undermine these rules of private property rights.it is our obligation,sitting in diversity,to respect the balance illinois has established.the task is especially delicate in a case like this one,where the party whose disposition of the property has been challenged is dead and thus can not counter the surviving party version of the relevant events.see parham hughes,d.with few exceptions,therefore,see,ziarko ziarko,d,parties that succeed in imposing a constructive trust on life insurance proceeds have powerful evidence such as a written agreement to show how the property was intended to be distributed.see lincoln ins.watson,d,agreement to maintain life insurance in marital settlement agreement creates equitable right perkins stuemke,d,judicial decree ordering maintenance of life insurance creates equitable right smithberg,at marital settlement agreement created vested contingent right in survivor benefit.illinois has made this policy explicit for the case of prenuptial agreements regarding the disposition of life insurance policies they must be in writing if they are to be enforceable.see,illinois uniform premarital agreement act,ilcs mina lee central bank trust,written document of oral prenuptial agreement sufficient to take agreement out of statute of frauds.
nothing in the district court opinion indicates that it evaluated david evidence under the required clear and convincing evidentiary standard.had it done so,we conclude,the verdict in his favor could not have been sustained.to qualify for a constructive trust,david needed to establish fraud or constructive fraud,or to make out a valid claim of promissory estoppel.the record shows that he did none of these things.to establish his claim for fraud,david had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that brenda assured him that he was and would remain,to some unspecified degree the named beneficiary of her policies even after she knew that he was not.siegel levy org.dev,setting out elements of common law fraud.to prevail on his constructive fraud claim,david had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that brenda promised to provide for him through life insurance and that this promise,together with the trust he placed in her as his wife,imposed upon her a fiduciary duty to disclose any changes in her beneficiary designations.see in re estate of neprozatis,d,constructive fraud results from act,statement,or omission that constitutes a breach of legal or equitable duty.finally,his promissory estoppel theory required him to establish again under the demanding standard of proof the existence of brenda alleged unambiguous promise.see cullen distributing,petty,d.
other than his own testimony about brenda statements to him,david presented no direct evidence in support of any of these essential elements of his claim.the evidence is devoid of any writings suggesting the existence of the alleged oral agreement,either before or after brenda began changing her beneficiary designations.furthermore,not a single witness other than david mentioned an agreement or promise that david and brenda had made to name one another as beneficiaries on their respective life insurance policies.somewhat to the contrary,both david mother and his close friend and insurance agent admitted that neither david nor brenda ever mentioned such an agreement.the only support the district court identified for a finding that the agreement existed beyond david testimony was brenda statements to friends and relatives that the children would be taken care of in the event of her death,and the couple pattern of beneficiary designations starting just before the marriage in.we find the latter two circumstances to be unhelpful at best the pattern the court mentioned lasted just over two years and shifted during that time period,and the statement about providing for the children does not give any detail about who would be caring for the children or how this would be accomplished,and is consistent with a beneficiary designation of someone other than david.
this leaves david testimony.while the admissibility of the testimony does not seem to be disputed,and is in any event controlled by the federal rules of evidence,the weight to which the evidence was entitled is in part a function of the substantive law of illinois.see milam state farm mut.auto.ins,cir where a state in furtherance of its substantive policy makes it more difficult to prove a particular type of state
