kirsten majeski was employed by metropolitan life insurance company metlife and participated in metlife short term disability plan,which is governed by the employee retirement income security act erisa.this appeal concerns metlife decision to reject majeski claim for disability benefits.metlife determined that majeski had failed to submit enough evidence to support her claim.majeski filed suit,but the district court granted summary judgment against her.although metlife determination is entitled to deferential review,we conclude that there are such significant gaps in the evidence supporting its decision that further proceedings are necessary.
majeski worked for metlife as a nurse consultant,which required her to sit at a desk and use a computer and telephone throughout the normal workday.in june,after complaining of pain and numbness in her shoulders,arms,and hands,majeski was diagnosed with cervical radiculitis,a disorder of the spinal nerve roots.see stedman medical dictionary ed.she applied for benefits from metlife short term disability plan,which defines a participant as disabled when,as the result of illness or accidental injury,she is receiving appropriate care and treatment from a doctor on a continuing basis and unable to earn more than of her earnings at her own occupation for any employer in the local economy.the plan grants discretionary authority to the plan administrator to interpret its terms and determine a participant entitlement to benefits.metlife initially approved a temporary award of disability benefits to allow majeski to pursue treatment,but eventually it determined that she was not eligible for benefits beyond august,because,in its view,her medical records did not objectively establish any functional impairments that would prevent her from continuing her work as a nurse consultant.
majeski appealed.in response to metlife assertion that she had not presented objective evidence establishing any functional impairments,she submitted newly obtained medical evidence.david weiss,a physiatrist that is,a rehabilitation specialist,completed a cervical spine residual functional capacity questionnaire that documented majeski significant limitations in repetitive reaching,handling,and fingering.weiss indicated that majeski could use her hands to grasp,turn,and twist objects for percent of the workday,that she could use her fingers for fine manipulation percent of the time,and that she could not use her arms for reaching.weiss also reported that majeski could not sit in a competitive work situation any longer than minutes without needing to take a break.but in another part of the questionnaire,weiss reported that majeski did not have significant limitation of motion.majeski later explained to metlife that weiss had misinterpreted the part of the questionnaire where he was asked to document majeski limitations in repetitive reaching,handling,and fingering.weiss amended the questionnaire simply by crossing out percent under the column fingers fine manipulation and writing instead percent,indicating that majeski could not use her fingers for fine manipulation at all.
in addition,susan hardin,a physical therapist,examined majeski,tested her functional capabilities,and then submitted a functional capacity evaluation summary that documented her findings.hardin concluded that majeski limitations on sitting and typing made it impossible for her to return to her job as a nurse consultant.hardin conclusion was based on a physical work performance evaluation,which consists of tasks,including a sitting test.the evaluation revealed that,although majeski was capable of performing physical work at the medium level of exertion,she could sit only occasionally and could not type more than minutes without experiencing significant pain.in other words,in hardin view,although majeski was able to perform at the greater exertional level of medium,she could unlike most a more sedentary position.hardin also observed that majeski cervical spine,shoulders,wrists,and elbows were capable of a range of motion within functional limits.
metlife then asked phillip marion,an independent physician consultant who is in physical medicine,rehabilitation,and pain management,to review majeski medical records and evaluate whether she had any functional limitations that would preclude sedentary work,particularly sitting and using a telephone and computer.marion responded on march,that there were minimal objective findings on physical and neurological examination to support a finding of functional limitations.he added that majeski was otherwise independent with activities of daily living,ambulation,and not restricted from driving a motor vehicle.although marion acknowledged hardin finding that majeski could perform work,he did not address either the limitations hardin had identified on majeski ability to sit and type or hardin conclusion that majeski could not work as a nurse consultant.nor did marion mention weiss questionnaire,which is not listed among the medical records metlife submitted to marion.marion issued a second report on march in which he concluded that additional medical evidence submitted by majeski neurologist did not change his opinion.
on march,metlife forwarded marion reports to weiss and asked him to respond with comments by april.metlife also alerted majeski counsel to the deadline.weiss responded unhelpfully on april with a single sentence i disagree with the decision of marion.on april,after metlife deadline for comment on marion reports had passed,majeski counsel faxed a letter to metlife seeking to introduce deposition testimony that marion had recently given in an unrelated case allegedly this testimony revealed marion predisposition to rule in favor of employers and against claimants,regardless of the evidence.because the deposition testimony ran more than pages,the attachment did not accompany the fax but was instead contained on a cd that majeski counsel mailed that same day.but without reviewing and possibly before receiving marion deposition testimony,metlife determined on april that majeski was not disabled.metlife cited marion conclusion that majeski medical records neither contained objective findings nor supported an inference of functional impairments.
under the terms of metlife plan,majeski disability benefits could be reduced by the amount of social security disability benefits she was eligible to receive,whether or not she actually applied for those benefits.majeski accordingly submitted an application to the social security administration in may and received a favorable determination in march.
majeski sued metlife in federal court,challenging the denial of disability benefits under erisa.see a b.after the parties agreed that a magistrate judge could handle the case,the district court granted summary judgment against majeski.because metlife plan grants discretionary authority to the plan administrator,the district court ruled that it would review metlife determination under the standard.in so doing,it rejected majeski argument that metropolitan life insurance glenn,d,requires a heightened standard of review in light of metlife conflict of interest as both the plan administrator and payor of benefits.the district court also rejected majeski attempt to introduce marion deposition testimony and majeski social security award,neither of which was part of the administrative record.but the district court did consider general evidence that marion had an ongoing financial relationship with metlife,reasoning that this must have been known to metlife.even so,the district court determined that there was no evidence that marion was predisposed to rule against claimants and that it was not unreasonable for metlife to have asked him to review majeski medical records.after considering all the medical evidence that was before metlife,as well as metlife conflict of interest,the district court concluded that it was reasonable for metlife to determine that majeski was not disabled.
majeski begins with an argument that we have rejected glenn,she urges,requires a reviewing court to apply a heightened standard of review whenever a plan administrator is,
