ben jazzabi jazzabi sued allstate insurance company allstate for breach of contract because allstate did not honor his claim under his fire insurance policy.allstate argued that jazzabi set the fire that gave rise to his claim,and therefore,allstate had no obligation to honor jazzabi claim.jazzabi prevailed in a jury trial in which the only issue was whether jazzabi had burned down his own house.allstate appeals the judgment,and jazzabi separately appeals the district court award of attorney fees.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
jazzabi house burned down,and he filed a claim under his fire insurance policy with allstate.allstate rejected the claim on the grounds that jazzabi had either started or consented to the fire,or had concealed material facts regarding it.jazzabi sued allstate for breach of contract allstate did not dispute that jazzabi had a valid policy and that allstate had refused to honor his claim.rather,allstate relied on the affirmative defense of arson at trial,the parties stipulated to the fact that arson had caused the fire.the only question in genuine dispute was whether jazzabi was the arsonist.
accordingly,the district court instructed the jury to determine whether jazzabi had started the fire.the court told the jurors that the case was over if they decided that jazzabi was the arsonist,but that if they decided jazzabi had not started the fire,they should award damages.the district court also instructed the jury that its verdict had to be unanimous.
the jury sent a note to the district court after deliberating for several hours,informing the court that there was some confusion regarding how the jury was to make its determination in favor of one or the other party.the note also requested clarification of the unanimity requirement.in essence,the note asked whether the jury had to unanimously agree that jazzabi had not started the fire before the jury could reach the issue of damages.
the district court discussed the note with counsel and concluded that the jury could not reach the issue of damages until it had unanimously rejected allstate affirmative defense.the court recalled the jury for a supplemental instruction and instructed the jury that it had to come to unanimous agreement regarding liability.the district court also specifically told the jury that it had to unanimously agree that jazzabi was not the arsonist before it could reach the issue of damages.the instruction session was punctuated by questions from the jury and also was interrupted more than once when the court paused to discuss the substance of the instruction with a law clerk.
after the jurors again retired to deliberate,the district court reconsidered the unanimity issue and decided that the supplemental instruction had been incorrect.the court concluded that anything less than a unanimous jury finding that jazzabi was the arsonist would constitute a failure of proof on part.under this reasoning,jazzabi would prevail unless the jury unanimously found that he was the arsonist.
before the district court had an opportunity to again recall the jury,the jury returned a unanimous verdict for allstate.the court then gave the jury a second supplemental unanimity instruction,telling the jury that if it could not unanimously agree that jazzabi was the arsonist,there a failure of proof and you go ahead and decide the plaintiff damages.the jury again retired for further deliberations,and shortly thereafter returned a unanimous verdict for jazzabi.the district court entered judgment for jazzabi.jazzabi moved for an award of in attorney fees of which the district court awarded him only.
allstate appealed the judgment,arguing that the district court should have accepted the jury first verdict and that the court second supplemental unanimity instruction was incorrect as a matter of law.jazzabi also appealed,arguing that the district court erred in awarding him attorney fees in an amount significantly less than what he sought.
we conclude that the district court first instruction was correct as a matter of law and,correspondingly,that the second instruction was erroneous.we therefore reverse the judgment for jazzabi.because we reverse,we do not reach jazzabi appeal.we decline to reinstate the first verdict,however,because we conclude that cumulative error renders that verdict unreliable.we therefore remand the case for further proceedings.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court decision to give a supplemental jury instruction,and the formulation of such an instruction,for abuse of discretion however,we review de novo the question of whether a jury instruction misstates the law 
jury unanimity as to affirmative defenses 
we conclude that the district court first supplemental instruction concerning jury unanimity in regard to affirmative defenses was correct as a matter of law.
neither party disputes that the jury ultimate verdict had to be unanimous,or that allstate would win if the jury unanimously decided that jazzabi started the fire.the issue is whether the jury could find allstate liable even if the jury did not unanimously reject allstate contention that jazzabi had started the fire.allstate arson argument is an affirmative defense under substantive oregon law which controls in this diversity case.thus,the legal question presented is whether a jury can find for a plaintiff even if the jury has not unanimously rejected a defendant affirmative defense.
allstate argument reduces to the contention that the jury can not find allstate liable in breach until the jury unanimously disposes of all issues affecting liability,including allstate affirmative defense.jazzabi argues that because it is undisputed that he has established a prima facie case of breach,anything less than unanimous jury agreement that jazzabi started the fire is a failure of proof on allstate part and the jury must return a unanimous verdict for plaintiff.
relatively few cases have addressed this precise issue,but those we have located have ruled that a defendant can not be held liable until the jury unanimously rejects an affirmative defense thus,the weight of existing authority favors.
most of these cases do not analyze the issue in any depth,however,and there does not seem to be any one rationale underlying the cases holdings.still,some of the cases deal with arguments advanced here.sanchez relied on one of the same arguments allstate makes that permitting juries to find a defendant liable even in the absence of a unanimous rejection of an affirmative defense may discourage thorough jury deliberations and promote verdicts based on a simple majority vote this court has similarly recognized the importance of the unanimity requirement in fostering thorough jury deliberations 
a rule which insists on unanimity furthers the deliberative process by requiring the minority view to be examined and,if possible,accepted or rejected by the entire jury.the requirement of jury unanimity thus has a precise effect on the process,one which gives particular significance and conclusiveness to the jury verdict.both the defendant and society can place special confidence in a unanimous verdict,and we are unwilling to surrender the values of that mode of,or to examine the constitutional implications of an attempt to do so,absent a clear mandate in the federal rules of criminal procedure or a controlling statute 
in addition,two cases explicitly rejected the failure of proof theory that jazzabi makes and upon which the district court relied.one of these,baxter healthcare spectramed,dealt with the argument in a conclusory fashion the other,state miyashiro has the most extensive discussion of the affirmative defense unanimity issue of all the cases we have located.
in miyashiro,the jury sent the court a note asking if unanimity was required to establish the defendant affirmative defense of entrapment the court sent a response to the jury that could have been read to indicate that lack of unanimity on entrapment disposed of the defense and cleared the way for a finding of guilt the jury returned a guilty verdict shortly thereafter the hawaii intermediate court of appeals considered the argument that liability is presumptively established before the jury reaches an affirmative defense and that anything less than unanimous juror acceptance of an affirmative defense is therefore a failure of proof,necessarily resulting in a verdict against the defendant 
the miyashiro court rejected this argument and instead held that a defendant guilt is the ultimate finding that a jury must make after determining whether the defendant has committed all the elements of the offense charged and considering any affirmative defenses raised.the court reasoned that because jurors who accept the defendant affirmative defense must vote to acquit,while those who reject it must vote to convict,a jury split over an affirmative defense necessarily results in a hung jury this is essentially the same argument that allstate advances.
we find the reasoning of miyashiro persuasive.under the miyashiro rationale,elements and affirmative defenses are components of the jury liability determination liability can not be established until after the jurors unanimously agree that the elements are satisfied and they unanimously reject the affirmative defenses.this approach comports well with the constitutional and statutory mandates that federal juries return unanimous verdicts in civil trials while it is true that these mandates do not mean that civil juries must reach unanimous agreement on all the preliminary factual issues which underlie the verdict,it is nonetheless safe to say that civil juries must render unanimous verdicts on the ultimate issues of a given case,not just the final verdict itself 
affirmative defenses often present ultimate issues because,as in this case,they frequently determine whether the defendant will be liable.accordingly,requiring civil juries to come to unanimous agreement regarding affirmative unanimous agreement that the defendant has failed to prove the defense,or unanimous agreement that the defendant has proved the defense,but nothing consistent with the seventh amendment to the constitution and federal rule of civil procedure.
under the approach that jazzabi urges,however,a jury can return a unanimous verdict even when the jury is split on a affirmative defense.this rule defeats the intent and rationale underlying the mandate that jury verdicts be unanimous,because liability might attach even though the jury had not unanimously agreed that a basis for liability exists.such a result would render the requirement of unanimity a hollow one.it would also provide a disincentive for thorough jury deliberations and could undermine confidence in jury verdicts 
thus,requiring a civil jury to come to unanimous agreement one way or the other on an affirmative defense is more consistent with the requirement of overall jury unanimity than is jazzabi theory.therefore,the better rule is to require a jury to unanimously reject an affirmative defense before the jury can conclude that the defendant is liable and go on to determine damages.
this rule makes particular sense in this case.allstate relied exclusively on an affirmative defense.the ultimate issue in the case,and the question presented to the jury,was whether jazzabi had started the fire.because the overall jury verdict hinged exclusively on whether jazzabi had started the fire,the jury could not logically be split in regard to the affirmative defense and still unanimously find allstate liable.accordingly,the district court first supplemental instruction was correct.the court second supplemental instruction was correspondingly incorrect.we therefore reverse the judgment for jazzabi 
b.the first supplemental unanimity instruction 
normally,the foregoing conclusion might well lead us to simply instruct the district court to reinstate the first jury verdict.however,the record indicates that the first supplemental instruction ultimately may have created as much jury confusion as it dispelled.we therefore have no confidence in the first verdict,even though the district court first supplemental instruction was legally correct.accordingly,we remand the case for further proceedings.
after the jury requested clarification,the district court had an obligation to clear away the confusion with concrete accuracy.the jury confusion was in regard to how the unanimity requirement applied to the affirmative defense of arson.as previously discussed,in terms of the liability determination,an affirmative defense is analogous to an element.ordinarily,a general unanimity instruction is sufficient to instruct the jury that its verdict must be unanimous as to each element.in most cases,therefore,an unanimity instruction is not necessary.indeed,this court has held that such an instruction should be given only when it appears that there is a genuine possibility of jury confusion or that liability may occur as the result of different jurors concluding that the defendant committed different acts.
this case is not one where the jurors could have based liability upon different acts.to the contrary,the liability determination here was factually straightforward the jury plainly understood that liability hinged on whether jazzabi had started the fire on a particular day,at a particular time,and in a particular place.furthermore,the jury confusion here probably did not warrant a specific unanimity instruction,because jury confusion refers to confusion over the factual basis for liability,not confusion over a legal standard such as the unanimity requirement thus,this case does not present the type of circumstances we normally require to justify a specific unanimity instruction.
nonetheless,the district court could hardly have avoided giving an unanimity instruction in this case.the only issue for the jury was whether the element of arson had been satisfied.we therefore find no error in the giving of an unanimity instruction.however,the district court instruction went beyond the element level and took the unanimity requirement to the next level of specificity and,in doing so,created jury confusion rather than dispelling it.
in its first supplemental instruction,the district court told the jury that you first have to decide liability one way or another before you consider the issue of damages.this instruction was correct and,probably,adequate.the district court could have been more specific,and instructed the jury that it was required to unanimously decide the arson question one way or another before considering the issue of damages.
the district went even further,however,and attempted to specifically explain to the jury the two different ways in which the unanimity requirement applied to the arson defense,that the jury had to unanimously agree that jazzabi was the arsonist in order to find for allstate,and that the jury had to unanimously agree that jazzabi was not the arsonist in order to find for jazzabi.a review of the transcript of the instruction session shows that taking the unanimity instruction to this next level of specificity created confusion.
despite our hopefully clear formulation of the two ways in which the unanimity requirement applies to an affirmative defense the legal distinction between the two,and their application to the questions facing the jury in this case,does not readily reduce to succinct and concise terminology indeed,the transcript reveals that the district court struggled to find language to clearly and concisely instruct the jury.the slipperiness of the distinction the court attempted to draw for the jury is also illustrated by the fact that the court instruction was punctuated by questions from the jury demonstrating that the jurors had difficulty following the court explanation 
other aspects of the instruction session also indicate that the session engendered juror confusion.for instance,at several points during the instruction,the court discussed the substance of the instruction with a law clerk in a way that seemed to add to the jurors uncertainty.in addition,questions regarding the relationship of the unanimity requirement to the burden of proof and the preponderance of the evidence standard arose simultaneously,further complicating the issue.
