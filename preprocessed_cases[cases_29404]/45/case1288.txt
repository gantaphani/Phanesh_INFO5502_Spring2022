on april,a fire swept through the premises of the auto repair business that john talmage operated in new richmond,wisconsin.after he notified his insurance carrier of the loss,talmage made extensive repairs to the business.the present case arose after the insurance company decided that it had paid enough,and the lawyer talmage hired agreed to a settlement of his claims against the insurer.the lawyer,charles harris,did not handle matters to talmage satisfaction,however,which led talmage ultimately to file a legal malpractice action.the district court dismissed some claims and others went to trial before a jury,which ruled in talmage favor in part and awarded him modest damages.the district court reduced those damages further.on appeal,talmage complains that the district court made a number of evidentiary errors and unduly restricted his damages.harris from the district court refusal to order judgment as a matter of law in his favor.we conclude that the district court evidentiary rulings were within the scope of its discretion and that it did not err otherwise in its handling of the case,and we therefore affirm.
talmage business,the talmage auto center,offered complete auto services and collision repair.at the time of the fire,it was insured by united fire casualty company united fire.the policy provided coverage for fire loss,with an aggregate limit of.the day after the fire,talmage properly notified united fire of the event.united fire assigned an adjuster named john holt to handle the file.holt was new to the task he had never adjusted a claim as large as talmage,nor had he previously worked with a fire claim involving an auto repair facility.holt told talmage to find a contractor to perform the necessary repair work,but neither holt nor talmage was able to find someone suitable.at that point,united fire neither prepared its own estimate of the amount of the claim nor asked a contractor to prepare one.talmage thought that the loss was approximately,including damage to the building,damage to business personal property,loss of income,employee tools,and other miscellaneous items.talmage and holt agreed that talmage and his employees would perform the repair work themselves.holt told talmage to document the time that they devoted to the work and to save the receipts for the materials they purchased united fire,holt promised,would reimburse talmage.later,united fire hired an accountant,jennifer bestul,to review and organize the records that talmage had submitted bestul recommended that united fire adjust the loss on a basis.
although talmage regularly submitted the time records and receipts that were accumulating,united fire did not reimburse him in accordance with holt promises.nevertheless,it did make significant partial payments between april,and may,it paid him.dissatisfied because he thought that more was due,talmage turned to holt supervisor,kelly hart,but hart was no help.later,united fire removed holt from the job and replaced him with stan stensrud by this time,talmage had done enough repairs to enable him to reopen the business.stensrud took a fresh look at the entire claim and decided,at a time when the repairs were complete,to change the method of calculating the fire loss.instead of a straight system,stensrud decided to rely on an outside estimate.
in the meantime,on may,talmage retained doar,drill skow,the law firm of attorney charles harris,to represent him in settling his claims against united fire.on talmage behalf,harris prepared a proof of claim statement for united fire that itemized the losses,documented them,and presented a total claim of.with a large gap separating the parties assessments of the amounts due,talmage and united fire agreed to submit to an appraisal proceeding in december,as required by the policy.there were three selected by talmage,one by united fire,and a third selected by the first two.
the appraisal proceeding dragged on for quite some time,while the parties collected documents and deposed witnesses.in april,harris filed a lawsuit against united fire on talmage behalf in wisconsin state court,asserting claims for breach of contract and bad faith.more than a year later,on july,the parties attended an appraisal hearing.rather than proceeding to the merits,however,they decided to explore settlement.ultimately,united fire offered to settle all of talmage outstanding claims for an additional over and above the it had previously advanced.harris recommended that talmage accept this offer,even though it was lower than the that talmage believed he was owed.according to talmage,harris assured him that he could accept the and still pursue his bad faith claim separately.relying on that advice,talmage took the,and the state court approved the settlement.
afterward,talmage believed that harris and his law firm were pursuing the reserved bad faith claim.between september and november,he called harris office many times to inquire about the status of his case,but apparently no one gave him any information.only on november,did harris inform talmage for the first time that the firm was not willing to handle this claim.in the meantime,the statute of limitations in wisconsin for the intentional tort of bad faith committed by an insurance company had expired.harris did not mention this fact either in his letter to talmage or otherwise.as a result of harris inaction,talmage was unable to pursue his bad faith claim against united fire.he filed this malpractice action on november,relying on the district court diversity jurisdiction.by that time,talmage was a citizen of montana harris was a wisconsin citizen the firm is a service corporation incorporated in wisconsin with its principal place of business there and cna insurance the law firm carrier is incorporated in delaware and has its principal place of business in illinois.
at various points before the trial,the district court narrowed the scope of talmage case.it ruled that talmage had not pointed to enough evidence to proceed on his claims for additional fire loss,the expenses allegedly due to him from interest charges that he had paid on his credit cards while awaiting reimbursement from united fire,and punitive damages.in the final order,the court rejected talmage objection to certain evidence relating to appraisals or valuation of the property,and it decided to grant the defendants request that talmage be precluded from claiming a net fire loss expense of the difference between his alleged proof of loss and the amount he accepted in settlement from united fire.chief judge crabb explained that the only way talmage could prevail would be if he could have persuaded a jury to award him an amount over the policy limit.she concluded that talmage had no evidence to support either that or any other number,and he had no expert testimony indicating that harris advice to take the net offered in the settlement was negligent legal representation.
the claim that harris committed malpractice by failing to pursue the bad faith action against united fire went to trial before a jury.as the district court pointed out,in order to prevail talmage had to prove first that he had a winning claim against united fire for bad faith denial of coverage,and second that harris acted improperly in failing to pursue that claim.talmage wanted to prove united fire bad faith through the testimony of russell bohach,a lawyer,who was prepared to testify about the standard of reasonableness for handling an insurance claim.the district court permitted that testimony,although it later regretted the decision,finding in a ruling that bohach lacked sufficient knowledge of the insurance industry to qualify as an expert on those matters.nonetheless,the court also found that its error in permitting bohach testimony was harmless,because the jury was able to understand this case on its own.the crux of the case,as the court saw it,was whether united fire reasonably believed that talmage invoices were unreliable,and if its decision to delay additional payments until it could resolve its concerns was also justified.the jury resolved the underlying dispute about united fire as well as the malpractice claim in talmage de
