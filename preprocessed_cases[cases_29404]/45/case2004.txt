plaintiff protocols,llc and the law firm sagrillo hammond dineen and kastetter,llc collectively,protocols provide consulting services for the settlement of workers compensation claims.protocols claimed expertise is structuring settlements that comply with medicare particular,regulations designed to assure that medicare is treated fairly in settlements of workers compensation claims by persons eligible for medicare benefits.protocols brought this action against defendants michael leavitt,the secretary of the united states department of health and human services hhs,and mark mcclellan,then the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,which is an agency within hhs.the suit claims that a cms memorandum issued in misinterprets the medicare statute and regulations and exposes protocols to unexpected liabilities arising out of settlements it has structured.
defendants moved for summary judgment on several grounds.the district court granted the motion but on a ground not raised by,that protocols lacked constitutional standing because it had not suffered the requisite injury.protocols appeals.we reverse because protocols potential liability presents a sufficient injury to confer standing under article iii of the united states constitution.we remand to the district court for further proceedings,including consideration of defendants other arguments for summary judgment.
background 
a.the regulatory scheme 
to explain how protocols may be exposed to liability arising out of its consulting services in workers compensation cases,we begin by outlining some of the law governing the relationship between medicare and workers compensation medical benefits.the medicare secondary payer statute,b,provides that medicare will ordinarily not pay medical expenses if workers compensation insurance has paid or can reasonably be expected to pay for the expenses.id.b a ii.medicare may,however,pay for an expense when the availability of workers compensation insurance is unknown or prompt payment under such coverage is not expected.see id.b b i permitting conditional medicare payment when prompt insurance payment is not expected defining conditional payment to include a medicare payment made because of lack of knowledge of other coverage.if such a medicare payment is made,cms may seek reimbursement from the insurer or from one who receives payment from the insurer,if the insurer was responsible for the expense.see b b ii.if reimbursement is not made,cms may sue the insurer or the recipient of a workers compensation payment,see b b iii,although cms may waive its rights in the best interests of medicare,see b b v.
of course,when a worker makes a workers compensation claim,there may be doubt concerning whether the worker medical expenses are compensable.the insurer may question whether the worker was injured,whether the injury arose in the course of employment,or whether the medical expense relates to the injury.such questions may be litigated,but they are often settled.the settlement is likely to affect medicare responsibility to pay for the worker medical expenses.so long as workers compensation medical benefits are available,medicare is relieved of responsibility.but if the settlement limits or eliminates the duty of the workers compensation insurer to pay medical benefits,medicare would be responsible for the payment.
as a result,the settling parties have an incentive to structure their settlement in a way that transfers liability from the insurer to medicare,because such an arrangement can make both of them better off.this incentive can result in a settlement that is unfair to medicare.for example,assume that a fair allocation of the settlement payment would be x to the worker for lost wages and y set aside to pay for medical benefits.further assume that the y would pay for medical services that would otherwise be payable by medicare,so the worker gets no benefit from the y.the worker and the insurer would be better off if the settlement is restructured so that no part of the settlement is allocated to medical benefits and the allocation is correspondingly increased even if not increased by the full y,but by,say.the worker is better off by the increase in benefits and loses nothing by having medicare,rather than the insurer,pay medical benefits.the insurer for its part saves z because it is replacing a payment of y in medical benefits by an increase of in its payment of benefits.but medicare now must incur y of expenses that would have been paid by the insurer under a fair allocation of settlement proceeds.
to avoid this subsidization by medicare,the regulations under the medicare secondary payer statute permit cms to refuse to recognize a workers compensation settlement.see b.medicare then would not pay for treatment that should have been covered by workers compensation.and if medicare had paid for such treatment before realizing that workers compensation should have paid for it,cms could seek reimbursement from the workers compensation insurer or from someone who had received part of a workers compensation settlement.protocols,which typically receives a fee from the settlement proceeds,might therefore have to relinquish its fee to cms.
on the other hand,if cms recognizes approves a workers compensation settlement,the workers compensation the recipients of the settlement no liability for medical expenses beyond what is provided in the settlement.one regulation,describes an acceptable method for apportioning a settlement payment between benefits and medical benefits.for purposes of this appeal,we need not describe the specifics of.suffice it to say that protocols asserts that it has structured settlements involving future medical benefits that is,payments for medical expenses that have not been incurred by the time of the settlement by following.
this suit arose after cms clearly rejected such use of,declaring that it applies only to medical expenses incurred before the workers compensation settlement.in a memorandum issued on july,the memo,it said 
compromising of future medical cms compromise or reduce future medical expenses related to a workers compensation injury 
no.some submitters have argued that justifies reduction to the amount set aside for medicare in a workers compensation settlement.the compromise language in this regulation only addresses conditional past medicare payments.the cms does not allow the compromise of future medical expenses related to a workers compensation injury.

proceedings below 
on august,a month after the issuance of the memo,protocols filed suit against defendants in the united states district court for the district of colorado.the complaint alleged that the memo was contrary to the prior practice of cms and sought a declaratory judgment that,among other things,the memo is invalid because it conflicts with the medicare secondary payer statute and provides a valid method for structuring settlements to account for future medical expenses the government bears the burden to prove noncompliance with and,contrary to the memo,there is a constitutional right to an appeal of an adverse decision and the memo was promulgated without compliance with the rulemaking procedures established by the administrative procedure act apa.protocols complaint also seeks relief because cms no longer reduces the amount to be recovered by medicare out of a settlement by taking into account the costs including legal fees of procuring the settlement.
defendants moved for summary judgment.with respect to protocols challenges to the memo,they primarily argued that protocols lacked standing,but on prudential,rather than constitutional,grounds the district court lacked jurisdiction because the memo was not a final agency action under the apa,see the court also lacked jurisdiction because g is the exclusive waiver of sovereign immunity for claims und
