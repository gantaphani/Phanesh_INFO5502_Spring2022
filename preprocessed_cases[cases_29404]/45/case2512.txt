this case presents the issue of the notice required to trigger a claim for equitable contribution for defense costs brought by an insurer against other insurers of common insureds.onebeacon america insurance company onebeacon,fireman fund insurance company ffic,and insurance company of the west icw are primary coinsurers under liability insurance policies of common insureds who were sued in for damages and other relief arising out of the insureds alleged contamination of real property.onebeacon undertook the defense of the insureds and began paying defense costs in,but ffic and icw agreed to share the defense costs incurred only after certain dates in.
onebeacon sued ffic and icw for declaratory relief under an equitable contribution theory,alleging that ffic and icw received adequate notice or were tendered the defense of the underlying action in and were thus obligated to share in the defense costs incurred from to.finding defects as to notice and tender,the trial court concluded that onebeacon was not entitled to equitable contribution from ffic and icw before various dates in.
as explained below,based on california shoppers,royal globe ins.d.california shoppers and our decision in truck ins.exchange unigard ins.th,d unigard,we hold that an insurer obligation of equitable contribution for defense costs arises where,after notice of litigation,a diligent inquiry by the insurer would reveal the potential exposure to a claim for equitable contribution,thus providing the insurer with the opportunity for investigation and participation in the defense in the underlying litigation.here,had icw and ffic diligently pursued the requisite inquiry california shoppers,at,they would have discovered their potential exposure to onebeacon claims for equitable contribution in,thus providing them with the opportunity for investigation and participation in the defense in the underlying action.accordingly,onebeacon is entitled to equitable contribution from ffic and icw starting in.
background 
from to,oil company mloc operated an oil refining and recycling business on real property in compton.in,rev llc purchased the compton property at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale and brought suit,later removed to federal court,alleging that the property was contaminated with petroleum products.rev llc oil company dist,ex rev action.rev llc sought cleanup costs,injunctive relief,and damages.the defendants named in the rev action included mloc john john and his wife,mireille mireille john as administrator of the estate of joseph,estate and emma emma,the surviving spouse of joseph,joseph.in the rev action,the second amended complaint,filed in december,the third amended complaint,filed in march,and the fourth amended complaint,filed in april,each alleged that the defendants were the partners,joint venturers,agents,employees,fiduciaries,servants and successors of each of the other defendants.the fifth amended complaint in the rev action,filed in june,alleged that john,mireille,joseph,and emma were legal or equitable owners of mloc,and directors,officers,or agents of mloc.
onebeacon insured mloc,estate,emma,john,and mireille sometimes referred to as the insureds under general liability insurance policies.in february,onebeacon began defending them in the rev action under a reservation of rights.ffic and icw insured some of the insureds under various policies,discussed in more detail below.in or,ffic and icw agreed,with reservation of rights,to share the defense costs those insureds incurred after various dates in but not any defense costs incurred from through various dates in 
the basis for icw agreement to share the defense costs of emma and estate is a primary liability policy,no.add policy,which was in effect beginning december.icw agreed,for purposes of this action,that it has a duty to defend emma and estate under the add policy.
the basis for ffic agreement to share the defense costs of mloc,emma,and estate is ffic commercial liability and automobile policy,no.issued to mloc mloc policy,which afforded coverage from september,to september.
in october,onebeacon filed the instant action for equitable contribution against ffic and icw.onebeacon alleged that between february and april,the defense of the rev action was tendered to icw by one or more of the insureds,and in june,the defense of the rev action was tendered to ffic by one or more of the insureds.based on an application of a allocation formula for defense costs agreed to by the parties,onebeacon alleged that ffic owed it approximately and icw owed it approximately for defense costs for the period from to september.
the parties asked the trial court to determine when onebeacon was entitled to contribution for defense costs incurred in the rev action from icw with respect to estate and emma and from ffic with respect to mloc,emma,and estate.the matter was tried to the court on the following documents and stipulations of facts.

the following icw documents reveal the existence of the add policy 
a.a declarations page from an icw commercial umbrella liability policy,no,for the period december,to december,listing the named insured as joseph and the add policy as an underlying liability policy.
b.a declarations page from an icw commercial umbrella policy,no,for the period december,to december,listing the named insured as joseph and the add policy as an underlying liability policy.a handwritten note on the declarations page stated that mloc was added to the policy effective december.
c.a declarations page from the add policy itself which lists the limits of liability for various coverages and the addresses of the compton properties.

e.an undated printout of icw policies per listing various policies issued to mloc and joseph between and.the add policy is listed under joseph name with effective dates of december,to december.
evidence of emma as an additional insured 
a declarations page shows that icw issued an umbrella policy,no,for the period may,to may.mloc is listed as the insured with an underlying onebeacon comprehensive general liability policy.another icw document,an endorsement,shows that in,joseph emma were added as additional insureds on policy no.
insureds discovery of existence of add policy 
by letter of february,james artiano,the attorney for estate,wrote to icw in pertinent part that joseph was an insured under three icw umbrella policies as well as a policy issued by the predecessor to onebeacon.i have enclosed a copy of the second amended complaint which has been served on the estate regarding claims that have been made against joseph it is requested that your company provide indemnification and defense to estate in this matter.currently,onebeacon has agreed to participate in the defense of the estate under a reservation of rights.the letter included the policy numbers of three icw umbrella policies,as to which emma was an additional insured,and.the letter stated that enclosures accompanied the letter.
on march,artiano sent another letter to icw,which repeated the information conveyed in february and also indicated that the second amended complaint in the rev action was enclosed with the letter.on april,icw,by its senior claims analyst charles coune,sent a letter to artiano acknowledging receipt of the march,letter,stating that rev llc second amended complaint was not enclosed,and requesting a copy of the complaint.icw letter listed the insured as mloc.icw also wrote that d ue to the age of the policies,it may take some time to retrieve them.if you have the declarations page,or any portions of these policies,we would likewise appreciate receiving a copy.
artiano replied to icw on april,stating that enclosed was a copy of the recently filed third amended complaint in the rev action and copies of documents in our possession that make reference to your policies.these are not declaration pages,but are part of the declaration pages of onebeacon.
on april,trutanich michel,llp trutanich,the attorney for mloc,john,and mireille,sent a letter tendering the defense of the rev action to icw.the letter identified the rev action by title,court,and case number and also referred to one of icw umbrella policies,no.the insureds asked that icw locate and provide us with a copy of the subject policy and any related policies you locate.on june,trutanich sent a letter to icw,stating that icw had not yet responded to the tender of defense by mloc,john,and mireille.
on june,artiano wrote a letter to coune at icw,inquiring about icw position on the commencement of defense and indemnification by icw for estate and mloc.
coune,on behalf of icw,replied to artiano on june,that as an umbrella carrier,icw has no obligation to participate in the defense,particularly when one is being provided,whether under reservation of rights or not,by onebeacon.coune also wrote that he had reviewed the pleadings in the rev action and that such review led him to conclude that rev llc claims were subject to unspecified policy exclusions.notwithstanding icw denial of any obligation to participate in the defense,icw stated that it continued to monitor the rev action.on june,coune also replied to trutanich that icw was not going to participate in the defense of mloc at that time.
on july,trutanich wrote to coune that trutanich had discovered documents which prove that the insureds mloc,john,and mireille maintained the referenced additional insurance policies and during we have reason to believe that the coverages under these policies apply to the lawsuit,thereby triggering on the part of icw a duty to defend and indemnify the insureds in connection with said action.accordingly,on behalf of the insureds we hereby tender the claims asserted against the insureds in the referenced action under the stated policies.the letter also asked icw to locate and provide us with a copy of the subject policies and any related policies.
on february,coune wrote to estate attorney,lynette klawon,that icw was passively monitoring the rev action in its capacity as an umbrella carrier icw also asked for information on the status of the rev action.on march,icw sent a letter to trutanich,setting out the policy limits of several of its umbrella policies and a list of the named insureds,which included mloc,emma,john,and joseph.icw also informed trutanich that icw was not providing a defense to your client mloc until such time as all primary policy limits have been exhausted.in august,icw wrote to trutanich,again declining to participate in the defense of mloc and noting that each of three umbrella policies issued to mloc contained a pollution exclusion.
on january,trutanich wrote to icw,reminding it that in prior correspondence mloc,john,and mireille had written to icw asking it to disclose all policies of insurance in icw possession.according to trutanich,icw chose to deny the existence of other policies and denied coverage.in addition you refused to afford your insureds a defense.recently,after relentless investigation,we were able to obtain copies of a number of icw policies that you failed to disclose.we obtained these copies from your agent william robinson under threat of proceedings.i have,of course,enclosed them for your perusal though i am confident that you have ready access to these policies.several of the policies including and have primary underlying coverage with icw including the add policy 
emma attorney in the rev action,timothy cronin,by letter dated january,tendered her defense to icw under policies issued by icw from through,including the add policy.cronin also wrote that as a matter of custom and practice emma was added as an additional insured under most,if not all of the policies purchased by mloc,joseph,john.to be certain,while a review of icw policy number does not disclose emma as an insured on its face,endorsement number to the policy does indeed confirm her status as an additional insured.with respect to the alleged excess nature of some of the icw policies,cronin stated that many of the underlying carriers are now defunct,dissolved or have simply ceased doing business altogether.for example,to the extent that icw policy number may have been excess to any reliance policy for the same time period,such is not the case given that reliance is now in liquidation.as such,icw obligation is now primary and its duties to defend indemnify emma in this litigation have been triggered.in addition,policy number,naming emma as an insured,provides for minimal underlying limits for property damage sufficient to trigger icw duty to defend in this case.contrary to icw earlier attempts to disclaim coverage,policy number does,indeed,exist and is not excess in nature.
icw attorney responded to cronin on march,that,although icw still did not have the policies,icw determined that emma was an insured on two umbrella policies on cronin list,as well as another umbrella policy not on the list however,icw was unable to verify that emma was an insured on any of the other twelve policies you have listed if you have information indicating your client was an insured on any policy other than those three umbrella policies,we would be pleased to review it upon your submitting same.unfortunately,icw is currently not able to locate the full textual provisions of any of the policies under which your client is apparently tendering,given the passage of time,however,with respect to the three policies as to which your client appears to have been an insured,icw has been able to determine that they contained,inter alia,the following policy provisions 
on may,icw attorney again wrote to cronin,i would like to schedule a time to review in your office whatever coverage materials you have in your files that you believe establish coverage for your client,emma.some of the documents you sent are not icw policy forms.i have no evidence that your client was ever added as a named insured on the add policy.i do show that emma was added to an icw umbrella policy,wherein onebeacon was the underlying comprehensive general liability carrier.icw attorney concluded by again requesting cronin assistance in reviewing file materials,documents or whatever other materials you contend may demonstrate current coverage rights for emma under some icw policy.
on may,estate attorney,artiano,wrote to coune at icw,now we have evidence that your company also issued the add policy to joseph,which is a primary comprehensive general liability policy.i believe that you and your company were aware of the existence of this policy,but you failed to disclose this information to our office when we previously tendered this claim for defense and indemnification it is our belief that there has been coverage since we first tendered this claim in,even though we had not found the policy.it is our belief that you had an obligation to disclose the existence of the underlying policy when i tendered this claim in.
by letter of june,icw attorney responded that icw accepted estate tender of defense under the add policy,with a reservation of rights.icw attorney also denied that icw failed to disclose information to artiano.
but icw continued to refuse emma tender of defense until emma provided icw with a declaration of william robinson,the agent who had sold the add policy to emma and joseph.in a july declaration,robinson declared that he was emma insurance from to and joseph from until his death in in,he brokered icw sale of the add policy to emma and joseph the add policy effective dates were from december,to december.robinson further declared that he did not have a complete copy of the add policy,but the declarations page from an icw umbrella policy and his typed notes made in memorialize its existence and issuance.his typed notes indicate that emma was a named insured,and emma would have been deemed a named insured under the add policy spouse provision,as well as under the spouse provision endorsement of the umbrella policy.robinson specifically recalled that the add policy provided coverage for liabilities arising out of emma and joseph ownership of the real property occupied by mloc,a family owned business.
icw,by letter dated august,agreed to defend emma under the add policy with a reservation of rights from the date it received robinson declaration,july.
notice of the rev action 
the parties stipulated that until,onebeacon itself was not aware that ffic was a possible insurer of mloc,emma,and estate.but the following correspondence between ffic and the attorneys for joseph,joseph a defendant in the rev action who was later dismissed shows that ffic learned in june about the rev action and that mloc,emma,and estate were defendants in that action.
on april,maya hamburger,an attorney for joseph,wrote a letter to ffic general counsel stating that joseph was the of mloc from until he left mloc in,that ffic was mloc insurer beginning in,and that because of current litigation brought against joseph,it is essential for him to get copies of all documents relating to any policy written by ffic benefitting mloc during the period of and.the letter also informed ffic that leon elster,ffic agent,handled mloc insurance policies with ffic and that elster sold his company to harvey schwartzman,also an ffic agent.
on april,a paralegal for ffic replied that in order for it to respond to the request,joseph would need to provide an authorization for release of records.joseph attorney sent a letter to ffic paralegal on april,enclosing the release,asking whether ffic insured mloc at any time before or after,and requesting copies of any policies issued to mloc or joseph.
on june,a claim file note by ffic employee colleen stated new loss for mloc who claims to be an insured of ours.they are claiming coverage from to.i checked atlas policies and could find a policy number.the site is compton,ca.the claim file note also stated rev mouren lauren leach oil.
arthur fine,another attorney representing joseph in the rev action,sent a letter dated june,to ffic,requesting defense and indemnification of joseph and purportedly enclosing copies of the third amended complaint and the pleadings in two in the rev action.the letter contained the title,court and case number of the rev action and informed ffic that mloc also was a defendant and in that action,that it is believed that mloc obtained from ffic comprehensive general liability insurance from before mloc was even incorporated in until possibly as late as,and that joseph should have been named as an additional insured under those policies.
by letters dated june,ffic responded to joseph attorneys,hamburger and fine,that ffic has performed a diligent search of its records but has been unable to locate any record of ffic policies issued to mloc.accordingly,ffic is unable to evaluate what coverage,if any,is available to mloc under the alleged policies.if you are in possession of any evidence of the alleged policies please forward same to my attention.barring contact from your office,ffic will close its file regarding this matter in days.ffic also wrote that it reserved its rights in the matter and that it was not waiving any rights and defenses available to ffic under any policy ies of insurance which may have been issued to mloc.
the parties stipulated that ffic has stated that even if letters identical to the maya hamburger arthur fine letters had been sent by counsel for mloc or the other named,the same denial would have been issued.
in august,ffic closed its files for the insureds but reopened them in.
insureds contact with ffic agent in 
on january,trutanich sent a letter to ffic,giving notice of the rev action and requesting the defense of mloc,john,and mireille based on the attached declaration of leon elster,ffic agent from through.elster declared that from through,as ffic registered agent,he handled the purchase of ffic comprehensive general liability policies and personal insurance policies for mloc and joseph.in each of the years from through,the policies issued by ffic to mloc and joseph were standard form comprehensive general liability policies without unusual or special limits or terms.elster sold his company in january and did not retain any files.
a january,letter from cronin on behalf of emma requested that ffic undertake her defense and indemnification.
ffic discovery of existence of mloc policy by march,
on march,ffic wrote to trutanich that,in response to elster declaration,ffic undertook an exhaustive search of its records and databases for evidence of the policies which elster alleges were issued by ffic.as a result of this search,ffic has been unable to locate evidence of any insurance policy issued to mloc,john or mireille which was issued during the period of time set forth in elster declaration.but in searching for the policies referred to in elster declaration,ffic found evidence a record of a premium payment showing that mloc had a commercial liability and automobile policy,no.mloc policy,which afforded liability coverage to mloc from september to september.although ffic had not located a copy of the actual policy,it had located sample forms which were likely incorporated into the mloc policy.ffic agreed to defend mloc under a reservation of rights and eventually reimbursed onebeacon for ffic share of the defense costs incurred on and after january.
in april,ffic agreed to defend emma as of january,under a reservation of rights,noting that emma attorney first tendered her defense to ffic in a letter dated january.
estate attorney,artiano,sent a letter to ffic on june,demanding estate defense and indemnification in the rev action based on elster declaration.thereafter,ffic agreed to provide a defense to estate under a reservation of rights.
ffic explanation of discovery of existence of mloc policy 
ffic claims specialist jeffrey hayes executed a declaration in stating that in he had reviewed ffic files from pertaining to certain communications from and to ffic regarding a claim for insurance coverage by joseph although hayes did not assert that he was involved in handling the matters in,hayes declared that,in response to fine june,letter,ffic again conducted a search for policies of insurance that may have afforded coverage to joseph according to the records that i have reviewed concerning ffic search in,ffic had attempted to contact the producer or broker,but was advised that copies of the alleged policies had not been maintained.ffic also searched the relevant ffic branch office,but determined that no policy information existed.ffic searched its archive claim lists,insured book,survey book,premium payments records,branch office,and producer,but was unable to locate any information.ffic searched for any policies of insurance based on the identification of agents that was provided to it,but ffic located no correspondence or other documents.
in his deposition,hayes testified that when he reviewed ffic claims file in,he did not find a copy of the third amended complaint in the rev action,purportedly attached to fine june,letter.but hayes declaration stated that in fine june,letter,fine advised that his firm is litigation counsel for joseph who was named as a defendant in an amended pleading which fine enclosed filed in the rev action.
hayes explained ffic march discovery of the existence of the mloc policy and ffic failure to discover it in as follows by,ffic had adopted and instigated measures to search for policies of insurance issued to its insureds that were not available in.in,ffic basic retrieval system was limited to searching for missing policies policies allegedly issued by it which can not be located by ffic,the insured,or any other person by policy number only.while ffic,when searching for missing policies,will examine its archives and other evidence that premiums were received or claims were paid,the absence of any identified policy number,as of,was a serious and often fatal impediment to locating any missing policies.by,however,ffic had updated its retrieval system,and had the capacity at that time to search for lost policies by keying in the insured name in,using the information supplied by mloc attorney,including the declaration of leon elster,and applying its new search capabilities,ffic located evidence that premium payments had been made on a commercial liability policy the mloc policy,which may have afforded liability coverage to mloc for the period of time from to.despite locating evidence that the policy existed,ffic had not located any copy of the alleged policy.
hayes further declared that the alleged policy would likely have incorporated a specimen form,and based on that specimen form,ffic sent its march,letter agreeing to defend mloc in the rev action.
trial court ruling 
after a hearing on the stipulated facts and documents,the trial court issued its order on onebeacon right to equitable contribution.as set out in the subsequent may judgment,the court determined that onebeacon was entitled to contribution from icw for the defense costs of emma and estate beginning on may,and onebeacon was entitled to contribution from ffic for mloc beginning on january,for emma beginning on january,and for estate beginning on june.
as to icw,the court order stated that onebeacon was entitled to contribution on the date that icw was first notified there was some evidence it had issued a primary policy to joseph emma gave icw notice of her claim to a defense on january,but icw had no record and was shown no record until may,indicating that the add p olicy cited by emma in january had been issued to joseph as to estate,the trial court acknowledged that it had tendered a defense to icw in february but found that icw did not know of its primary add policy until.the court reasoned that n o one has shown that a thorough search by icw of its records at any time would have revealed evidence of a primary policy issued to joseph,and no one contends that icw knew actually or constructively before that it had issued such a policy.moreover,the court is unaware of any authority that would hold icw to have breached a duty to defend the estate before it had actual or constructive notice of a policy providing a defense,or,to defend emma before it had actual or constructive notice that emma was seeking a defense.icw is not shown to have breached a duty to have inquired further of its insureds or,to have searched its records more thoroughly.the court concludes that icw did not have notice from to may,that it would be responsible to contribute to the estate defense 
with respect to onebeacon entitlement to contribution from ffic,the trial court explained its ruling as follows t he april and june,letters,read together say joseph is inquiring and is asking for defense and indemnity under any ffic policies issued to mloc.despite the loose read evidenced by the claims person colleen june,note,it can not be said that further inquiry by ffic to its correspondents would have caused it to discover that any insureds other than joseph had made the request for a defense.what might have happened in had ffic conducted an appropriate search and found evidence of the policy it issued to mloc,and so advised joseph,can only be imagined.both sides advised the court at oral argument that joseph was dismissed from the rev action.would he,with knowledge in of an ffic policy,have then alerted mloc,emma,and the estate,who were being defended by onebeacon,and would onebeacon have learned of this we can all speculate,but ffic did not breach a duty to joseph to make further inquiry.that it may have breached a duty to provide him with a defense does not,under the circumstances known here,make ffic recalcitrant insofar as mloc,emma,or the estate,or unjustly enriched insofar as onebeacon.joseph efforts can not be said,because of any principle of equity,to redound to mloc,emma,and the estate,or to onebeacon.the truth that ffic would have learned in,had it made further inquiry,was what it already only joseph was seeking a defense.
onebeacon appealed from the judgment,contending,among other things,that icw and ffic had sufficient actual or constructive notice in to trigger onebeacon rights to equitable contribution 
discussion 
equitable contribution 
equitable contribution is the right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk,each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured.equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d,fn.omitted fireman fund.
this right of equitable contribution belongs to each insurer individually.it is not based on any right of subrogation to the rights of the insured,and is not equivalent to standing in the shoes of the insured.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.further,as these principles do not stem from any contract between the insurers,the right of equitable contribution is not controlled by the language of their policies with their insureds.id.at,d.nevertheless,absent compelling equitable reasons,courts should not impose an obligation on an insurer that contravenes a provision of its insurance policy.unigard,supra,th at,d.because equitable considerations vary,our supreme court in signal companies,harbor ins.cal d,has declined to formulate a definitive rule for when contribution should be compelled between insurers.american internat.specialty lines ins.continental casualty ins.th,d.but in determining whether one insurer is entitled to contribution from another,courts should consider the nature of the claim,the relation of the insured to the insurers,the particulars of each policy,and any other equitable considerations.ibid.
the duty to defend is a continuing one,arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded citation,or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage,national union fire ins.cal th,d,phrased somewhat differently,t he duty to defend arises when the insured tenders defense of the third party lawsuit to the insurer.citation.the temporal limits of the insurer duty to defend fall between tender of the defense and conclusion of the action.citation.unigard,supra,th at,d see also transport indemnity cal th,d,temporal duty to defend insured runs from tender of defense to conclusion of action against insured.
tender can be either formal or constructive.citations.unigard,supra,th at,fn,d.thus,although the duty to defend ordinarily arises after receipt of an actual tender of defense,it may arise upon receipt of constructive notice of the contractual duty to defend.california shoppers,supra,d at.in california shoppers,an action by an insured against its insurer for breach of the contractual duty to defend,the insurer was held to have had constructive notice of tender of the defense when the insured sent to the insurer a copy of the summons and complaint naming the insured as a defendant,notwithstanding an envelope with the return name and address of another entity,also an insured under another policy but not named in the enclosed complaint,and the lack of a cover letter.the court concluded that,had the insurer made diligent inquiry,it would have concluded that tender came from the insured and not the other entity.the court summed up in other words,given the appropriate circumstances,the law will charge a party with notice of all those facts which he might have ascertained had he diligently pursued the requisite inquiry.ibid.
the concept of constructive notice was also developed in unigard,an equitable contribution action between coinsurers.in unigard,the defendant,unigard insurance company,did not participate in the underlying litigation due to a lack of tender by its insured.the plaintiff,truck insurance exchange,gave notice to unigard of its potential liability for equitable contribution only after the underlying litigation was resolved.the question presented was when does an insurer that is providing a defense have to raise the issue of contribution with potential coinsurers that are not participating in the litigation due to a lack of tender.unigard,supra,th at,d.we rejected truck argument that,regardless of when it learned the identity of potential coinsurers,notice to potential coinsurers was not necessary until the underlying action had concluded.we determined that notice should be given sooner,rather than later.id.at,d.under these circumstances,the imposition of contribution on stranger to the subject it to a significant financial burden even though it did not enjoy any of the concomitant benefits,the right to participate in and control the defense.truck decided to investigate and settle the underlying litigation without unigard involvement.having done so,truck should not be permitted to drag unigard into the picture after the fact.with prompt notice,the coinsurer can investigate the matter and decide whether to join in the defense.if,however,notice is given after the underlying litigation is over,the matter is more likely to end up in court.id.at,d.
in unigard we thus concluded that t he notice should have been made promptly after truck agreed to provide a defense.that is not to say that truck had to tender the defense to unigard.a simple notice regarding the possibility of contribution would have been sufficient.unigard,supra,th at,d.
unigard acknowledges that an insured lack of tender or compliance with a policy provision is not fatal to a coinsurer right of equitable contribution rather,adequate notice of the potential for contribution and the opportunity for investigation and participation in the defense in the underlying litigation will suffice.
unigard rule of constructive notice is consistent with the rule that has been adopted by the state supreme courts in minnesota,new hampshire,wisconsin,and illinois,as well as intermediate appellate courts in pennsylvania and louisiana.as explained by the supreme court of minnesota in home ins.national union fire ins.home ins,a case by one insurer against other insurers for reimbursement of defense costs or contribution while there are relatively few state supreme courts that have directly addressed the issue of what constitutes sufficient notice in a case for reimbursement or contribution,of the three state supreme courts that have,all have ruled that notice of suit is sufficient to tender a defense.in,the illinois supreme court held that an insured notice to the insurer of the lawsuit was enough to constitute tender.cincinnati west am.ins,holding the better rule is one which allows actual notice of a claim to trigger the insurer duty to defend,irrespective of the level of the insured sophistication,except where the insured has knowingly forgone the insurer assistance.new hampshire and wisconsin have also determined that putting an insurer on notice of a claim constitutes tender.white mountain cable constr.transamerica ins,holding that in order for an insured to tender the defense to the insurer,it need only put the insurer on notice of the claim towne realty,zurich ins,holding that a tender of defense occurs once an insure r has been put on notice of a claim against the insured.home,supra,at,fn.omitted.
intermediate courts in louisiana and pennsylvania appear to have reached the same result.see cobb empire fire marine ins,so d,widener fred james.home,supra,at,fn.
the court in home ins.reasoned that sound public policy does not support a rule that requires insureds to expressly request a defense in order to trigger the duty to defend.three broad reasons support defining tender as giving the insurer notice and opportunity to defend a covered lawsuit first,it clarifies the duties of the parties early in the litigation second,it acknowledges the greater knowledge and sophistication of the insurer and third,it places no significant burden on insurers.home,supra,at.once notice is given,even without an express request for a defense,it should be the responsibility of the insurer to contact the insured to determine whether the insurer assistance in the suit is required.the burden we are placing on the insurer with this rule is not onerous,as the illinois and wisconsin courts have noted.citations.when notified of the insured potential liability under the suit,the insurer can simply ask the insured if the insurer involvement is desired,thus eliminating any uncertainty on the question.citation.while in scsc allied mut.ins,we wanted to make sure that insurers could not be saddled with defense costs over which they had no control,this is not a concern here.the notice and opportunity to defend rule we adopt ensures insurers will not be surprised when defense costs are foisted on them.home,supra,at.
the court in home ins.further explained the benefits of defining tender as notice of a lawsuit and the opportunity to defend by disallowing the formation of a potential loophole for insurers around what constitutes an express request for defense,we clarify the duties of insurers and protect the bargain struck by the parties in the insurance policy.the insured paid for the insurer promise to defend the insured for covered claims,and the insured ignorance regarding the language the insured must use to invoke that coverage should not negate the bargain.citations.we will not create a legal rule that presumes an insured,whether a company or an individual,is equally sophisticated,knowing its contractual right to coverage and when and how to invoke it.nor will we create a rule that interpret s an insured silence as a statement of intent to forgo the insurer assistance.citation.indeed,insurers are better able to facilitate clear communication between the parties.citations.home,supra,at.
accordingly,home ins.held that once an insured provides its primary or umbrella insurer with notice of a suit and opportunity to defend,it has tendered the defense as required by scsc allied mut.ins,supra.home,supra,at.and,as explained in cincinnati companies west american,supra.at page,at page cincinnati,the requisite notice is notice sufficient to permit the insurer to locate and defend the lawsuit and in order to have actual notice sufficient to locate and defend a suit,the insurer must know both that a cause of action has been filed and that the complaint falls within or potentially within the scope of the coverage of one of its policies.
