appellant commercial union insurance company commercial union brought a declaratory judgment action against appellee dean pesante pesante in the united states district court for the district of rhode island,seeking a declaration that it was not liable under a marine insurance policy issued to pesante for losses incurred by pesante vessel.during the ensuing litigation,commercial union filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court denied.following the denial,the parties filed a joint motion for entry of final judgment.the district court then entered final judgment in favor of pesante.commercial union now appeals the district court entry of judgment for pesante and denial of its motion for summary judgment.after careful review,we reverse.
in,pesante purchased the oceana oceana.pesante used the oceana for fishing gill netting,which entails the use of entangling stationary nets to catch fish.until,pesante obtained his marine insurance from the ocean marine insurance agency.due to rising premiums,pesante decided to seek a new policy.he contacted philip christopher christopher of christopher regan insurance c r to help him obtain a policy with the lowest possible premiums.through christopher,pesante submitted an application for fishing vessel insurance the application to commercial union on march.the application identified the oceana as a lobster boat pesante has admitted that this was an inaccurate description of the vessel a document accompanying the application indicated that pesante was paying a yearly premium of and that c r needed to match that premium in order to secure pesante business.
on march,russell bond bond,an underwriter at commercial union,faxed christopher a quote which identified the oceana as a foot lobster boat and quoted a premium of.in an affidavit,bond stated that had he known the vessel was a gill net vessel,the quote would have been percent higher because gill net vessels pose a higher risk than lobster vessels.on march,christopher responded to bond via fax and requested certain changes.in his fax,christopher also identified the oceana as a foot lobster boat.
on april,commercial union issued the policy,which was renewed the following year.the policy contained an express warranty that the only commercial use of the insured vessel s shall be for lobstering.pesante has admitted that he never engaged in lobstering,which he described as radically different from gill netting.
on september,while returning to port from a gill netting trip,the oceana was involved in a collision with a boston whaler.occupants of the boston whaler sustained serious injuries and brought claims against the oceana.several months after the accident,pesante sought to correct the policy.he crossed out lobstering on the form and sent it to c r along with a handwritten note stating that he had never done lobstering and did not intend to engage in lobstering in the future.christopher faxed the form and note to bond on december.on december,commercial union issued a denial of insurance coverage based on pesante misrepresentation and breach of the express warranty found in the policy.commercial union,on january,issued a reservation of rights letter under which it agreed to defend the claims arising from the september,incident.
on may,commercial union filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the district court seeking a declaration of its rights and responsibilities under the policy.on july,pesante filed an answer and counterclaim.on november,commercial union filed a motion for summary judgment and statement of undisputed material facts.in its opposition to the motion for summary judgment,pesante stated that commercial union statement of undisputed material facts appears accurate.on march,the district court entered its memorandum and order denying commercial union motion for summary judgment.the court based its decision on a finding that there was no causal relationship between pesante breaches and the losses suffered.the court reasoned that,since pesante was steaming home when the accident occurred,he technically was not gill netting and therefore was not in breach of the warranty at the time of the loss.
on june,the parties executed a stipulation of dismissal as to pesante counterclaim,then filed a joint motion for entry of final judgment.in the motion,the parties stated that,based on the district court denial of commercial union motion for summary judgment and the stipulated dismissal of pesante counterclaim,there were no longer any factual matters to be resolved at a trial.on july,the district court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact that would prevent the entry of judgment.it therefore entered final judgment in favor of pesante.commercial union has timely appealed from this final judgment,arguing that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment and entering judgment for pesante.
we begin by noting that we do not have jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment motions where a genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute.pierluisi,cir.we thus often do not have jurisdiction over denials of motions for summary judgment,because a denial of a motion for summary judgment is merely a judge determination that genuine issues of material fact exist.it is not a judgment,and does not foreclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought.ortiz vélez,cir.here,however,following the denial of summary judgment and the stipulation of dismissal as to pesante counterclaim,the parties filed a joint motion for entry of final judgment in which they stated that there were no longer any factual matters to be resolved at a trial.the district court agreed and entered final judgment.it is from this final judgment,based on undisputed facts,that commercial union appeals,and we therefore have jurisdiction.see.
our review of a district court decision granting or denying a summary judgment motion is de novo.rodríguez am.int l ins.of puerto rico,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
commercial union makes two arguments on appeal.first,it argues that pesante made a material misrepresentation in his application for insurance and that the policy was therefore voidable under either federal or rhode island law second,it argues that pesante breached an express warranty in the using the oceana for gill netting and not that this breach rendered the policy voidable,regardless of whether there was any causal connection between the breach and the accident.because we find the first argument determinative,we do not address the second argument.
this case arises under our admiralty jurisdiction since it involves a marine insurance policy.windsor mount joy mut.ins.giragosian,cir.generally,in cases involving a marine insurance contract,we will apply state law unless an established maritime rule controls the disputed issue,and that rule is materially different from state law.id.emphasis in original.commercial union argues that the doctrine of uberrimae fidei is an established rule of maritime law and determines the outcome of this case.pesante argues that the doctrine of uberrimae fidei is not an established rule of maritime law and that rhode island law should therefore apply.
uberrimae fidei roughly means of the utmost good faith.grande paul fire marine ins,cir.under this doctrine,the insured is required to disclose to the insurer all known circumstances that materially affect the insurer risk,the default of which renders the insurance contract voidable by the insurer.giragosian,at.o ne treatise says that in the marine insurance context,a material fact is that which can possibly influence the mind of a prudent and intelligent insurer in determining whether it will accept the risk.appleman appleman,insurance law and practice ed.supp.grande,at.commercial union argues that pesante failure to disclose that the oceana was a gill netting not a lobster a material false statement because
