in this case,we once again apply the principle that any limitation on the coverage provided by a liability insurance policy must be express and consistent with the reasonable expectations of the insured.
here,the subject commercial general liability policy has a provision labeled retention sir that clearly makes the insured liable for the first in damages payable to any third party claimant.the policy also makes it clear the insured payment of defense costs count toward meeting the insured sir obligations.
however,the sir clause we are asked to consider does not expressly make payment of the sir a condition of the insurer broader obligation to provide a defense when an arguably covered claim is tendered.rather,the sir clause expressly applies only as a limitation on the insurer duty to indemnify the insured for covered damages for which the insured is found liable.given the language of the policy,an insured could quite reasonably interpret it as providing a defense to arguably covered claims as soon as such claims are tendered and before any sir has been paid.thus,like the trial court,we find the defendant insurer in this equitable subrogation action had a duty to defend its insureds when large soil subsidence claims were made against them and without regard to the sir provisions in their policies.
we recognize other liability insurance policies contain sir clauses that expressly and unambiguously make payment of a sir obligation a condition of any obligation under the policy,including any duty to defend.we also recognize those sir provisions have been enforced according to their terms.the policy in dispute here,however,does not contain such an express condition on the defendant insurer duty to defend.
because the defendant insurer had a duty to defend its insureds,principles of equitable subrogation required that it reimburse the defense costs another insurer,plaintiff herein,paid on behalf of the defendant insureds in the course of the underlying subsidence litigation.although the plaintiff insurer made the payments notwithstanding the fact the insureds were not covered under any policy the plaintiff issued,the circumstances under which the plaintiff made the payments did not impair the plaintiffs right to equitable subrogation.
factual and procedural background 
fessler lawsuit asic i 
this case and a related appeal we decided in,american safety indemnity company admiral insurance company.asic i,grow out of the same underlying subsidence litigation and involve the same insureds and their insurers.we briefly summarized the underlying litigation in asic i 
between the late and,zephyr newhall,lp,and its partner zephyr partners,llc collectively zephyr,worked with developer horton,los angeles holding company hereafter holding,to build housing on a tract of land in santa clarita which zephyr owned.holding hired ebensteiner ebensteiner to grade the tract pursuant to plans created by leighton and associates,leighton,a geological engineering firm.as part of their grading contract,ebensteiner agreed to indemnify holding against liability for any loss attributable to ebensteiner breach of duty even if holding conduct also contributed to the loss.
the grading began in february,but was not without incident.on or about march,a backcut slope failure occurred as a direct result of the grading,creating a by foot landslide and tension cracks that visibly extended to within feet of existing upslope homes.another similar backcut slope failure,resulting in a by foot slide,occurred april.
on or about april,several adjacent homeowners noticed physical damage to their property caused by the slides.on january,the homeowners sued holding,ebensteiner,zephyr and leighton,among others hereafter fessler lawsuit.
at the time of the work,holding was insured by defendant and respondent admiral insurance company admiral,while ebensteiner was insured by plaintiff and appellant american safety indemnity co asic.the respective policies limited coverage to million per occurrence.the admiral policy contained a provision which designated it excess over the asic coverage the asic policy contained a similar excess insurance disclaimer for those instances where the asic policy was not primary.the asic policy also covered holding as an additional insured.
holding tendered its defense of the fessler claims to asic,which initially declined the tender.holding then filed a lawsuit against asic.on may,holding and asic settled the lawsuit.under the terms of the settlement,asic agreed to pay holding defense costs and to not thereafter dispute its duty to defend holding.
the fessler lawsuit itself was settled on october.ebensteiner agreed to pay the fessler plaintiffs million,holding agreed to pay plaintiffs million,and leighton agreed to pay plaintiffs,for a total sum of million.pursuant to the agreement,holding and ebensteiner dismissed with prejudice their against one another,with the exception of claims either of their insurers had against the other insurer.asic and admiral each contributed their respective policy limits of million to the settlement.
while the fessler lawsuit was pending,asic asked admiral to contribute to the defense costs asic incurred on behalf of holding.admiral refused and asic filed a declaratory relief action.asic alleged admiral was obligated to reimburse asic a pro rata share of the million asic spent on holding defense.as we have indicated,asic and admiral filed for summary judgment.
among other matters,in opposing admiral motion,asic relied on expert and percipient witness deposition testimony that had been developed in the fessler lawsuit.in particular,asic relied on two experts retained by the fessler plaintiffs who concluded the slope failure was caused by defects in leighton grading plans and not by any deficiency in the grading performed by ebensteiner.asic also relied on a geologist employed by leighton who testified that,as far as he knew,ebensteiner asic named insured performed the grading according to leighton plans.asic i,supra,at pp.
in asic i,admiral argued the broad indemnity clause in the ebensteiner grading subcontract protected both holding and admiral from any indemnity claim by ebensteiner or asic.in asic i,we held that although the indemnity clause might provide a complete defense to the claims asic was making,it would only do so upon a showing ebensteiner was negligent.we found that the record did not establish ebensteiner negligence as a matter of law and reversed the summary judgment entered in admiral favor.
in addition to holding,the fessler plaintiffs also sued two holding related entities,horton,and horton,los angeles collectively the horton entities.the horton entities had no contractual relationship with ebensteiner,and ebensteiner owed them no duty of indemnity moreover,the horton entities were not additional insureds on ebensteiner asic policy.
the horton entities were named insureds under the admiral policy.
following holding bad faith lawsuit,asic paid the cost of not only holding defense in the fessler lawsuit but also the cost of defending the horton entities.all three entities were represented by the same law firm,which did not segregate its billings between the three.asic paid a total of in defense costs on behalf of holding and the two horton entities.
after the fessler litigation was settled,asic brought this separate declaratory relief action asic ii against admiral in which it sought reimbursement for the cost of defending the horton entities.asic alleged substantive causes of action for subrogation,indemnity and contribution.
by way of an order granting asic motion for summary adjudication,the trial court determined that,as a matter of law,admiral owed the horton entities a duty to defend them in the fessler action.in particular,the trial court determined that under the terms of the admiral policy,although the sir provision required that the horton entities pay the first in any damages recovered by a third party,admiral duty to defend the horton entities was independent of the policy sir provisions.
at a later bench trial,asic presented a witness who testified to the defense costs paid by asic on behalf of holding and the two horton entities,and to statements made by representatives of the horton entities that caused asic to conclude the horton entities had no insurance coverage for the fessler claims.asic also presented evidence that showed its settlement of the earlier holding bad faith action did not include any provisions with respect to defense of the horton entities.
admiral did not present any witnesses.
in its statement of decision,the trial court determined asic paid defense costs on behalf of the horton entities,which were in fact admiral obligation,and was therefore entitled to subrogation for those costs.the trial court rejected admiral contention asic had acted as volunteer or had otherwise waived its right to reimbursement from admiral.the trial court awarded asic a total of million in reimbursement of the defenses costs it had paid and interest.
admiral filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
in the case of insurance,subrogation takes the form of an insurer right to be put in the position of the insured in order to pursue recovery from third parties legally responsible to the insured for a loss which the insurer has both insured and paid.citations.as now applied the doctrine of equitable subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder,pays a debt for which another is primarily liable,and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.citations.citation.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,fireman fund.
the essential elements of an insurer cause of action for equitable subrogation are as follows a the insured suffered a loss for which the defendant is liable,either as the wrongdoer whose act or omission caused the loss or because the defendant is legally responsible to the insured for the loss caused by the wrongdoer b the claimed loss was one for which the insurer was not primarily liable c the insurer has compensated the insured in whole or in part for the same loss for which the defendant is primarily liable d the insurer has paid the claim of its insured to protect its own interest and not as a volunteer e the insured has an existing,assignable cause of action against the defendant which the insured could have asserted for its own benefit had it not been compensated for its loss by the insurer f the insurer has suffered damages caused by the act or omission upon which the liability of the defendant depends g justice requires that the loss be entirely shifted from the insurer to the defendant,whose equitable position is inferior to that of the insurer and h the insurer damages are in a liquidated sum,generally the amount paid to the insured.citations.fireman fund,supra,th at.
the right of subrogation is purely derivative.an insurer entitled to subrogation is in the same position as an assignee of the insured claim,and succeeds only to the rights of the insured.the subrogated insurer is said to stand in the shoes of its insured,because it has no greater rights than the insured and is subject to the same defenses assertable against the insured.thus,an insurer can not acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured has no rights,and may claim no rights which the insured does not have.citations.fireman fund,supra,th at pp.
in its principal argument on appeal,admiral contends it owed the horton entities no duty of defense and,hence,asic was not entitled to any subrogation because,contrary to the trial court determination,the sir provision in admiral policy applied not only to its duty to indemnify but also to its duty to defend.
we agree with the trial court.the sir was not a condition of admiral duty to defend.
admiral policy 
the insuring clause in admiral policy states we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance does not apply italics added.
the admiral policy contains the following definitions 
property damage means 
physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
suit means a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage or personal and advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged 
admiral duties are limited by an sir endorsement to its policy,which provides in part 
our total liability for all damages will not exceed the limits of liability as stated in the declarations and will apply in excess of the insured retention the retained limit.retained limit is the amount shown below,which you are obligated to pay,and only includes damages otherwise payable under this policy.
if the retained limit is subject to an annual aggregate,the aggregate amount shall be payable by the insured even if the policy is terminated prior to the expiration.
expenses incurred under the supplemental payments coverages a and b provisions of this policy are 
x included in the retained limit,
we have the right in all cases,at our expense,to assume charge of the defense settlement of any claim wherein your liability is reasonably expected to exceed the self insured retention and,upon written request from us,you will tender such portion of the self insured retention as we may deem necessary to complete the settlement of such claim.
the policy admiral provided the horton entities is written on a commercial general liability form.the face of the policy identifies it as providing primary coverage to its insureds.the policy makes admiral coverage excess only when other coverage is available to its insureds by way of other insurance acquired by the insureds or when the insureds are named as additional insured on another party policy.significantly,when such other insurance is available and admiral becomes an excess insurer,the policy states w e will have no duty under coverages a or b to defend the insured against any suit if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that suit.if no other insurer defends,we will undertake to do so,but we will be entitled to the insured rights against all those other insurers.
interpretation of sir endorsements 
the court in legacy vulcan superior court th legacy vulcan interpreted a policy that,like the admiral policy,contained an sir endorsement.in legacy vulcan,the court held the sir provisions only applied to the insurer duty to indemnify its insured for damages,not its duty to defend.
importantly,like the commercial general liability coverage admiral provided to the horton entities,the policy the court considered in legacy vulcan provided primary coverage rather than excess coverage.legacy vulcan,supra,th at.the distinct roles played by primary and excess carriers are important.as the court in signal companies,harbor ins.cal d explained,a primary insurer typically charges a greater premium than an excess insurer,because the primary insurer will normally bear the cost of providing the insured with a defense.when a settlement or judgment exceeds the limits of the primary insurer policy limits,the excess insurer will be required to contribute to the settlement or judgment but,typically,because a judgment or settlement ends the lawsuit,the excess carrier will not pay any of the insured defense costs.id.at.
the court in legacy vulcan recognized that,given the different roles primary and excess insurers play,there is a presumption an excess carrier has no obligation to pay defense costs until the underlying primary insurance has been exhausted or there is express policy language that imposes an earlier defense obligation on the excess carrier.legacy vulcan,supra,th at.however,the court in legacy vulcan held that in the c
