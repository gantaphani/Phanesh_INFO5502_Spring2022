defendant american international specialty lines insurance company american appeals an adverse grant of summary judgment in which the district court held american must provide coverage to plaintiff spirco environmental,spirco,for a separate judgment in which the same court held spirco and others were liable to pay a surety attorney and expert witness fees.we affirm.
background 
relevant background information is provided in our separate opinion in case.that case involved a claim by a surety against a group of contractors for payment of the surety attorney and expert witness fees under an indemnity agreement.in case we affirmed the district court holding that the were liable to the surety for approximately in fees incurred in the defense of a million claim by a new jersey property owner.the surety incurred these substantial attorney and expert witness fees in a protracted arbitration proceeding focused on the alleged release and spread of asbestos by one of the,spirco.the present case involves a claim by spirco against its general casualty and pollution insurer,american,for coverage of the fee award.
we incorporate by reference the facts set forth in case and also set forth the following,additional facts.when the property owner asserted its counterclaims in the arbitration,the property owner labeled the claims as breach of contract counterclaims.during the course of arbitration,when counsel for spirco sent a letter to the surety simultaneously advocating an aggressive defense and complaining about the surety participation in the arbitration,counsel for spirco described the property owner claims as follows 
my review to date reflects that many of the claims being presented would fall into the category of property damage rather than nonperformance of work.the property owner own mediation position paper reflects this fact 
the lion share of the contamination,as well as the cost of the second remediation,however,resulted from spirco negligent work practices that permitted asbestos containing material to contaminate areas in the building that did not contain asbestos and should have been protected.
as discussed in case,the arbitrators findings also demonstrate that the nature of the alleged harm stemmed from property damage rather than breach of contract.specifically,the arbitrators held that spirco performed under the contract and,after spirco left the site,other parties damaged the property owner building by exposing asbestos and causing its spread throughout the site.
when the surety later asserted a claim for fees against spirco and the other indemnitors,spirco sought coverage and a defense from american.american provided a defense under a reservation of rights,but,ultimately denied coverage spirco then brought the present declaratory judgment action seeking resolution of the coverage issue.
american argued below that the fee award was in the context of a dispute having its roots in fees were due under an indemnity agreement,and the underlying arbitration dispute between the property owner and spirco involved the alleged breach of a remediation contract between spirco and the property owner.spirco argued that the fee award had its roots in a claim of property property owner alleged not only that spirco breached a remediation contract,but that spirco spread asbestos to previously uncontaminated areas of the property,requiring the property owner to undertake a second,more expensive remediation of the building.
american argued in the alternative that even if the court were to accept spirco characterization of the underlying dispute between the property owner and spirco as one involving property damage,the indemnity award should not be covered by the american policy because the contractual indemnity award was too attenuated from the alleged property damage the indemnity award was economic loss rather than property damage and certain exclusions would prevent coverage even if american policy were otherwise found to apply.
regarding the attenuation argument,the american policy provided coverage for a loss as a result of claims for property damage.the policy defined loss in relevant part as.monetary awards or settlements of compensatory damages arising from property damage.costs or.claim expenses.american argued that the operative causation language in the coverage provision,as a result of,demanded a narrow construction that looked only to the immediate cause of the alleged expense according to american,this immediate cause was a contract claim on the indemnity agreement,and there was no coverage for contract claims.spirco argued that the operative causation language as a result of merited a broader construction and that it was permissible to look behind the contractual indemnity right to examine the facts of the underlying dispute between the new jersey property owner and spirco that gave rise to the expenses covered by the indemnity agreement.according to spirco,the underlying dispute was a claim for property damage.
the district court held the underlying dispute was a property damage dispute the indemnification award was not too attenuated from the property damage claim to trigger coverage and no policy exclusions applied.accordingly,the district court ordered american to provide coverage.american appeals.
ii.discussion 
coveragei.nature of the underlying dispute 
the property owner characterized its arbitration counterclaim against spirco as a breach of contract claim,but the substance of the property owner claim was an allegation of property damage.the nature of the was apparent to spirco attorney at the outset of the arbitration,apparent from the nature of the arguments presented in arbitration,and apparent from the arbitrators findings.the arbitrators found that spirco had completed the remediation contract and left the site in a clean condition.the arbitrators found further that the property owner allegations related to asbestos not exposed by spirco during spirco remediation of the site.rather,the arbitrators found that other contractors accessed the site after spirco left and that these other contractors were responsible for the asbestos contamination.the alleged damages of million that the property owner sought from spirco included the purported cost of,remediation,or destruction for a section of the property outside the scope of the original contract with spirco.ultimately,the property owner claim was not simply a breach of contract claim limited to the task of finishing a job commensurate in scope with the original contract between spirco and the property owner it was a claim for property damages shown to be unrelated to the work under the contract.
further,we note that the property owner dismissed a separate failure to pay claim against the surety before the surety incurred the bulk of its attorney and expert witness fees.accordingly,the only claim against the surety that survived into the expensive and protracted arbitration was derivative of the property owner claim against spirco.it was not an independent claim that might be viewed as more attenuated from the property damage claim.
we believe that for coverage purposes in the instant case,then,the district court properly characterized the underlying arbitration claim as a claim for property damage.this conclusion is based on the property owner factual assertions,the substance of the property owner claims,and the arbitrators findings rather than the label,breach of contract,that the property owner elected to attach to its claim.see.terrazzo iowa mut.ins,cir applying missouri law and looking to the facts behind a claim property damage rather than the label attached to a claim diminution in value to determine that insurance coverage existed for the claim see also lamar homes,cas,stating that the duty to defend is not determined by the labels attached to the underlying claims cont l ins.bones,iowa we start with the observation that coverage is controlled by the actual claim asserted against the insured,not the label the claimant chooses to put on his or her claim.ins.toole,nevertheless,this court declines to adopt any broad holding that claims sounding in contract are not occurrences.rather,the court agrees with the supreme court of vermont that,in determining whether there is coverage,the court should look to the specific kind of claim being asserted,regardless as to whether it is labeled a contract claim,a tort claim,or whatever,and the purpose of the general liability policy from which coverage is sought.quoting city of burlington union fire ins,first.bank,jackson hole cont l ins,wyo rejecting a duty to defend based on the substance rather than the label of claims and stating,although there is a claim in the complaints labeled negligence,the facts in the complaint do not demonstrate alleged loss resulting from negligence or alleged loss caused by an occurrence,but instead demonstrate alleged losses resulting from a breach of contract.
ii.interpretation of the operative language in the policy 
because we agree with the district court that it is appropriate to characterize the underlying dispute as one involving a claim for property damage,it is necessary to examine the operative,language of the american policy.the specific question we face is whether the loss,a contractual indemnity award for a surety fees incurred in defense of the property damage claim,falls within the scope of the policy definition of loss.spirco urges us to answer this question in the positive,while american argues the loss is too attenuated from the alleged property damage to justify coverage.the parties agree that missouri law applies to our interpretation of the american policy.the parties also agree that the operative language at issue in this case is as a result of,such that coverage exists for a loss that occurred as a result of property damage.finally,the parties agree that there is no missouri precedent exactly on point to provide clear guidance as to the scope of the operative language as a result of.
there are,however,several cases involving a similar phrase,resulting from.finding no convincing authority describing a meaningful basis to distinguish between the terms as a result of and resulting from,we presume that missouri would apply the same interpretation to both phrases.
in poage state farm fire casualty,the court interpreted causation language in a liability policy covering a recreational pontoon boat.the policy language at issue in poage was resulting from.the court in poage noted that the missouri supreme court previously had interpreted this language more narrowly than the phrase arising out of.id.at see also spirtas fed.ins,cir affirming a broad construction of the insurance policy language arising from.in an effort to better articulate the causal relationship described by the phrase resulting from,the court in poage reviewed the facts and policy language in several cases.the court held that the language resulting from was more narrow than the language arising out of,but was not so limited as to be synonymous with proximate or immediate causation.poage,at.rather,the poage court held that the language resulting from required the causative link between a harm and a covered occurrence or event to be reasonably apparent such that the harm could be considered a natural and reasonable incident or consequence of the covered event or occurrence.id.at.
in reviewing the earlier cases,the poage court described application of the resulting from language in several unique and unusual circumstances.read in light of poage,this collection of cases serves to illustrate the reasonably apparent or natural and reasonable incident or consequence test.typically,such a collection of cases would serve as a helpful tool for drawing the fine distinctions necessary to distinguish harms that are reasonably apparent from harms that are not.unfortunately,because the facts of poage and the cases cited therein differ dramatically from one another,the cases do not lend themselves to meaningful comparisons,and these important distinctions remain unclear.
for example,in poage itself,the question at issue in the coverage dispute was whether a liability policy for a pontoon boat covered injuries to a person who had been an occupant of the insured boat,but who was swimming in open water about feet from the insured boat when a different,passing boat struck her.id.at.the missouri court of appeals in poage held that the personal injury resulting from the collision between the passing boat and the swimmer was a natural and reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the insured boat.id.at.the result obtained in poage,therefore,sets forth a seemingly broad construction of the reasonably apparent test.
in reaching this conclusion,the poage court cited state farm mut.auto.ins.flanary,state farm mut.auto.ins.whitehead,and fidelity and cas.of new york wrather.in all three cases,the operative causation language was resulting from.whitehead and wrather,like poage,suggest a fairly broad meaning for the term resulting from flanary does not.in flanary the court found no coverage.flanary,at.the policy at issue in flanary was a liability policy insuring a truck.id.at.the policy insured against bodily injury to others caused by accident resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of the insured truck.id.the owner of truck had driven the truck to a construction site carrying a portable welder.at the site,the owner parked the truck next to a crane and operated the portable welder to fabricate a boom for a crane.the portable welder was not attached to the insured truck power supply at the time of its use.during construction of the boom,the crane collapsed and injured another person.the court held the causal relationship between the injury and the ownership,maintenance or use of the insured truck was too attenuated to justify coverage under the operative resulting from language.id.at.
in wrather,policy language that was materially the same as in flanary resulted in a finding of coverage.wrather,at.there,a farmer used an insured automobile to drag a burning tire through a field in an effort to light the field on fire to burn off vegetation.id.smoke from the resulting fire blew across a nearby highway,decreased visibility,and led to an accident and injury not involving the insured vehicle.id.similarly,in whitehead,the court found coverage under an automobile liability policy.whitehead,at.there,one passenger in an insured vehicle shot another passenger.the court in whitehead found coverage emphasizing that the vehicle was not simply the situs of the shooting,but that the vehicle was being used to transport the shooter and the victim at the time of the shooting.id.at.
while these cases clearly establish a causal nexus somewhere short of proximate cause,it is not clear how the causal nexus in each case can be said to be reasonably apparent.in poage,the insured boat had carried the injured swimmer to the general area where the collision occurred between the swimmer and an entirely separate vessel,and there was coverage.in flanary,the insured truck carried the welder and welding equipment to the general area where the construction accident occurred,but there was no coverage.in whitehead,one passenger in a vehicle shot another passenger,and there was coverage.in wrather,the insured vehicle was merely a tool for pulling a burning tire,but injuries causally related to the smoke from that fire were found to be covered.flanary is difficult to reconcile with the three other cases,but whitehead,wrather,and poage collectively suggest a broad construction for the term reasonably apparent under missouri law.
at the end of the day,it is not clear in the present case what result must flow from application of missouri reasonably apparent or natural and reasonable incident or consequence of test.missouri,however,applies a general rule of construction requiring courts to interpret ambiguities in an insurance policy in favor of coverage and against the insurer.poage,at it is important to note that insurance policies are designed to provide protection and will be liberally interpreted to grant,rather than deny,coverage if there is an ambiguity,it will be construed in favor of the insured.given this state of the law in missouri,and given the general rule that we must resolve ambiguities in favor
