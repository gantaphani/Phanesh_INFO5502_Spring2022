background 
the city of bangor,maine,sued citizens communications company citizens,claiming that citizens manufactured gas plant had been discharging pollutants into the penobscot river since.see city of bangor citizens commc ns,d.citizens then brought a third party complaint the citizens complaint against barrett and other neighboring facilities for contribution indemnification on the city claims,alleging that those facilities were to blame for the pollution.in its most detailed allegations,the complaint against barrett states 
barrett acquired the barrett plant in or about.
on one or more occasions since barrett has owned and operated the barrett plant,asphalt materials containing hydrocarbons,also known as pahs,were released from the barrett plant into the penobscot river.
upon information and belief,the soil at the barrett plant is contaminated with substances that contain pahs.
sewers historically located in or near the barrett plant drained,directly and without treatment,into the penobscot river.
tidal action of the penobscot river causes contamination from the barrett plant to be flushed into the river.
upon information and belief,releases of hazardous materials into the penobscot have occurred on one or more occasions at the barrett plant.
barrett,in turn,sued continental,michigan mutual,and first state in the united states district court for the district of maine,seeking a declaration that the three insurers were required to defend it against the citizens complaint,after its tender of the defense was rejected.barrett also sought money damages for the insurers failure to defend.
barrett claim against continental was based on three primary liability insurance policies.each of the policies contains an exclusion from coverage for liabilities except when a discharge,dispersal,release or escape is sudden and accidental.barrett stipulated that it was unaware of any sudden or accidental discharges from its plant into the penobscot river,but contended that nonetheless continental was obliged to defend barrett against the citizens complaint.
with respect to first state barrett claim was based on one of three excess umbrella liability policies.the relevant first state policy applied in excess of an underlying primary liability insurance policy issued by midland insurance company midland midland is now insolvent,such that the insurance is not collectible.barrett has no copy of the midland policy and no knowledge of its terms and conditions.even so,it is undisputed that the midland policy has not been exhausted as a result of claims paid on behalf of barrett.the first state policy states that the insurer has a duty to defend w ith respect to any occurrence not covered,as warranted,by the underlying policies listed in schedule a t hereof,whether collectible or not,or not covered by any other underlying insurance collectible by the insured,but covered by the terms and conditions of the first state policy.schedule a of the first state policy lists general categories of insurance policies and their respective liability limits.one of the general categories is comprehensive general liability insurance.the schedule does not list any specific policies by name or number.
first state and continental filed separate motions for summary judgment,and barrett filed a motion for partial summary judgment.a magistrate judge recommended that first state motion be granted,that barrett motion be granted as to continental,and that continental motion be denied.the magistrate determined that first state was not required to defend barrett because the midland policy was a scheduled underlying policy to the first state policy,even though schedule a did not specifically reference the midland policy.with respect to continental,the magistrate concluded 
the underlying complaint general allegations did not foreclose the potential that continental could have liability to citizens on the basis of any sudden and accidental discharge of pollutants that might be proved by citizens.that legal conclusion is virtually compelled by the law court opinion in travelers indemnity company dingwell,me.
the magistrate further recommended that barrett be awarded attorneys fees incurred in the declaratory judgment action against continental.the district court adopted the magistrate recommended decision.
after a bench trial on issues related solely to michigan mutual,the district court entered final judgment on may.the court ordered continental to pay barrett for defense costs incurred in defending the third party complaint and for attorneys fees incurred in the declaratory judgment action.continental appeals from the judgment against it,and barrett appeals from summary judgment in favor of first state.
ii.standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.ins.dagnone,cir.where there are no material facts in dispute,as here,summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.we review an award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.first state ins.group nationwide mut.ins,cir.
iii.discussion 
continental duty to defend 
both continental and barrett agree that maine law employs the comparison test to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend an insured.see travelers indem.dingwell,me.the reviewing court is required to lay the underlying damage complaint alongside the insurance policy and then determine whether the pleadings are adequate to encompass an occurrence within the coverage of the policy.id.quoting am.policyholders ins.cumberland cold storage,me.maine law is very clear that the inquiry is based exclusively on the facts as alleged rather than on the facts as they actually are.id.quoting cumberland cold storage,at.
continental reads the citizens complaint as alleging that barrett was responsible for discharges as a result of routine business operations over several decades,as opposed to a sudden and accidental discharge,which would trigger continental duty to defend.as such,continental argues that this case is analogous to johnson aetna cas.sur,cir applying maine law.in that case,we found no duty to defend under a sudden and accidental discharge exception to a pollution exclusion worded identically to the continental policy exception,because the underlying allegations make clear that pollution and contamination has taken place as a concomitant of the alleged polluter regular business activity over an extended period of time,rather than as a result of a sudden and accidental release.id.at.in support of its reading of the citizens complaint,continental points to barrett denial that any sudden and accidental discharges have ever occurred.
barrett,on the other hand,like the magistrate judge,believes that dingwell,compels the conclusion that continental has a duty to defend barrett against the citizens complaint.we agree.in dingwell,the supreme judicial court of maine held that an insurer had a duty to defend the insured pursuant to a sudden and accidental discharge exception,where the underlying complaint alleged only that wastes from the insured facility had permeated the ground and polluted the water table and a major watercourse.id.at.notably,the allegations against the insured did not specify how the wastes were released from the facility such that they were able to permeate the ground,whether the discharges were sudden and accidental or the r
