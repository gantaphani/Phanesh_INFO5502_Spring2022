these appeals arise out of a declaratory judgment action filed by charter oak fire insurance company charter oak against hedeen and companies,funmaker,hedeen fun city,hedeen fun factory,clemens hedeen,and patti jo hedeen,who we will refer to collectively as the hedeens.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the hedeens,but refused to award the full amount of damages the hedeens were seeking.the parties then filed these timely.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and appellate jurisdiction exists under.
background 
clemens hedeen,hedeen is a toy inventor from sturgeon bay,wisconsin,who has established various businesses the purposes of which are to develop toys and market toy concepts to toy manufacturers.clemens hedeen and patti jo hedeen are the general partners of hedeen and companies and funmaker.clemens hedeen is the sole proprietor of both hedeen fun city,and hedeen fun factory.charter oak entered into a series of commercial general liability insurance contracts with hedeen international,hedeen fun factory and those characters from wisconsin,and clemens hedeen.dba as the named insureds.these policies,which we will refer to collectively as the contract because they are identical in all applicable ways,were effective between january,and january,and provided liability coverage for covered claims of property damage,bodily injury,and advertising injury.
in june,hedeen,through funmaker,entered into a royalty agreement with lewis galoob toys,galoob,a large manufacturer and retailer of toys.under the agreement,galoob agreed to pay royalties to hedeen for the right to develop and market a line of miniature toy vehicles called micro machines.in,galoob became the exclusive marketer of micro machines,and at that time,galoob registered the micro machines name and logo with the united states patent and trademark office.
micro machines grew in popularity,ultimately becoming by some estimates a million line of toys.disputes arose between hedeen and galoob as to the scope of their royalty agreement,resulting in several supplemental royalty agreements.by may,galoob had paid hedeen approximately million in royalties for the micro machine line.the disputes between galoob and hedeen persisted throughout this royalty period.hedeen claimed a right to royalties in new micro machine products that were developed from images licensed from third parties,including star wars,star trek,and power ranger lines of micro machines.galoob asserted that these new products were outside the scope of the royalty agreements.in,hedeen began sending letters to galoob asserting breach of contract with respect to the royalty agreements.on june,galoob filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california the galoob lawsuit against the hedeens based on the royalty agreements.in addition to the declaratory judgment,galoob sought an injunction restraining the hedeens from using the micro machines trademark.
hedeen tendered the defense of the original galoob complaint to charter oak in june.charter oak refused to defend,and hedeen now concedes that charter oak did not have a duty to defend the original complaint.at the end of june,the hedeens filed their answer and a counterclaim against galoob,seeking damages including additional royalties.galoob filed a first amended complaint on september.the amended complaint alleged,among other things,as follows 
since approximately,the hedeens have used galoob micro machine micro machine logo trademarks in connection with their own business activities,despite having no right,title or interest therein.specifically,the hedeens,doing business under the name hedeen fun factory,have sent business letters under letterhead setting forth the words micro machine inside a drawing of a toy train locomotive.the hedeens use of this letterhead is without permission or authority from galoob,and has created actual confusion,mistake and deception among the commercial public,and is likely to cause further confusion,mistake and deception,as to the true and correct source,origin and sponsorship of the product line of toys and other goods sold under the micro machine and micro machine logo trademarks.
the amended complaint sought both an injunction and money damages for this alleged violation of the lanham act.hedeen requested that charter oak provide a defense for the amended complaint,asserting that potential coverage existed under the advertising injury provision of the contract.charter oak declined.
in january,charter oak filed the present lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin,seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not required to provide a defense in the galoob lawsuit.the hedeens filed a counterclaim,seeking a declaratory judgment in their favor as well as their costs and fees incurred in the galoob lawsuit and in the wisconsin action on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that charter oak was required to defend against galoob first amended complaint and granted declaratory judgment in favor of the hedeens.the parties then began discovery and briefing to determine the hedeens fees and expenses.in december,the district judge appointed a special master pursuant to.to review the parties submissions.
the special master filed her recommendation on may,concluding that the hedeens should recover plus interest for their fees and expenses in charter oak declaratory judgment action.neither party objected to this amount,and the district court adopted the special master recommendation.with respect to the galoob case,the hedeens sought in fees and costs.the special master recommended that the hedeens be awarded plus interest.both parties objected to this recommendation.the district court denied the hedeens objection and granted in part the objections raised by charter oak,reducing the award by after disallowing a portion of the recommended fees for one of the hedeens attorneys,robert vizas.the district court denied charter oak general objection that the recommended award improperly included fees and expenses incurred to pursue the hedeens royalty claims against galoob and awarded fees and expenses relating to the galoob lawsuit in the amount of plus interest.
charter oak filed this timely appeal,arguing that the district court erred in concluding that trademark infringement was covered under the contract.in the alternative,charter oak contends that even if it is required to defend against actions for trademark infringement,the alleged infringement in the galoob case did not occur in the course of the hedeens advertising and was,therefore,outside the contract.finally,charter oak challenges the district court fee award as it relates to the galoob case,arguing that the majority of the fees awarded arose from activity relating not to the defense of the trademark infringement claim but rather to the hedeens affirmative claims for additional royalties.the hedeens filed a timely,challenging the district court reduction of their fees and costs from the galoob action.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.ritchie glidden,cir.as a federal court sitting in diversity,we apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.id.citing erie tompkins.under wisconsin law,a n insurance carrier duty to defend insured in a suit is broader than its duty of indemnification and is predicated on allegations in a complaint which,if proved,would give rise to recovery under the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.elliott donahue.the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,because the duty to defend is triggered by arguable,as opposed to actual,coverage.general cas.of hills.in determining an insurer duty to defend,we apply the factual allegations present in the complaint to the terms of the disputed insurance policy.we liberally construe those allegations and assume all reasonable inferences.doyle engelke.any doubt as to the existence of the duty to defend must be resolved in favor of the insured.wausau tile,county concrete.as we have recognized,under wisconsin law,w hat is important is not the legal label that the plaintiff attaches to the defendant that is the insured conduct,but whether that conduct as alleged in the complaint is at least arguably within one or more of the categories of wrongdoing that the policy covers,sheboygan emergency med,cir citing cases.
the advertising injury provision of the contract provided,we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury or advertising injury to which this coverage applies.we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.the contract went on to state,this insurance applies to advertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods,products or services and defined adverting injury to include injury arising out of the m isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business and i nfringement of copyright,title or slogan.
charter oak first contends that trademark infringement is not a covered offense under the contract because the contract definition of advertising injury does not expressly reference trademark infringement,one of the oldest and best known intellectual property offenses.charter oak argues that the specific inclusion of infringement of copyright in the list of advertising injuries leads to the conclusion that the absence of an express reference to trademark infringement means that trademark infringement is not covered under the contract.however,the contract also references infringement of title or slogan,conduct which is not a distinct,recognized offense.as we recognized in interpreting identical language in,infringement of title presumably involves titles of books,songs,products,services,and so forth and is not clearly limited,as charter oak asserts,to the infringement of a noncopyrightable title of a creative work.see,at.in zurich insurance company amcor sunclipse north america,cir amcor sunclipse,in analyzing the word title in the phrase infringement of copyright,title or slogan,we held that r eading these words together implies that infringement means using someone else words,so that title refers to names and related trademarks,following the phrase copyright infringement.
in sholodge,travelers indemnity company of illinois,cir,cited by charter oak,the sixth circuit interpreted the word title in the phrase infringement of copyright,title,or slogan as unambiguously referring only to the noncopyrightable title of a book,film,or other literary or artistic work.the eighth circuit adopted the sholodge court reasoning in callas enterprises,v.the travelers indemnity company of america,cir.however,building on the comments in amcor sunclipse,at,and,at,we find that the term infringement of title as used in the contract is broad enough to encompass claims of trademark infringement as alleged in the amended galoob complaint,and reject the contrary holdings of sholodge and callas.we,therefore,need not address the applicability of the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business provision of the contract,and we turn our attention to an analysis of whether the injury as alleged was committed in the course of advertising the hedeens goods,products,or services as required for coverage under the contract.
the amended galoob complaint alleged that the hedeens sent business letters on letterhead which included the mirco machines trademark and that this practice created actual confusion,mistake and deception among the commercial public and resulted in unlawful profits for the hedeens.under the contract,in order for the advertising injury provision to apply,the alleged offense must have been committed in the course of advertising the hedeens goods,products or services,an element which charter oak contends is missing in the present case.the contract does not define advertising,however,the wisconsin supreme court has recognized the dictionary definition of advertise to be t o call the attention of the public to a product or business to proclaim the qualities or advantages of a product or business so as to increase sales and to call public attention to esp.by emphasizing desirable qualities so as to arouse a desire to buy or patronize.atlantic mut.ins.badger med.supply,citations omitted.charter oak cites amcor sunclipse,at,for the proposition that a series of customer solicitations does not constitute advertising under the advertising injury provision of the contract.the allegations of the galoob complaint,however,are broader than the facts in amcor sunclipse which involved the sale of an existing product,to established customers.id.at.in western states insurance company wisconsin wholesale tire,cir,cited in the amcor sunclipse case,this court noted the difference between advertising and marketing and recognized that wisconsin courts give advertising injury clauses an reading.the conduct alleged in the amended galoob complaint does not fall clearly under a marketing label.there is no mention of the number or identity of the recipients of the business letters.however,the complaint alleges that the use of the letterhead impacted the commercial public and resulted in unlawful profits for the hedeens.furthermore,the hedeens are involved in a business with a very limited commercial audience.we find that under the allegations of the complaint,liberally construed,it is at least arguable that the trademark was used in the course of the hedeens advertising,triggering charter oak duty to defend 
because charter oak breached its duty to defend,the hedeens were entitled to a fee award.both charter oak and the hedeens challenge the amount at which the district court set that award.after the district court found charter oak had breached its duty to defend,the court set a schedule for briefing on the issue of damages.the hedeens filed materials seeking all of their costs and expenses in the galoob action from august until its conclusion.the hedeens did not make any showing that the amount sought related to the defense of the galoob suit rather than their counterclaims.on september,the district court issued an order stating that the hedeens could recover only the fees and expenses relating to their defense and not to the counterclaims.if there was an overlap,the hedeens were required to submit a detailed narrative explanation of how the fees related to both the defense and the counterclaims.charter oak then had the opportunity to make specific objections to the hedeens submissions.
after receiving voluminous submissions from both parties,the district court referred the matter to a special master.the special master reviewed the parties submissions to determine whether the fees and expenses requested by the hedeens related to the defense of the galoob suit.on may,the special master issued a detailed,page recommendation.as previously noted,the district court reduced the special master recommended award in connection with the galoob case by after disallowing a portion of the recommended fees for robert vizas and awarded the hedeens.
charter oak asserts that the district court fee award as it relates to the galoob case was erroneous because the majority of the fees awarded arose from activity relating not to the defense of the trademark infringement claim but rather to the hedeens affirmative claims for additional royalties.charter oak first contends that the district court employed the wrong legal standard in making its fee award.charter oak urges us to apply the offensive versus defensive posture analysis set out in smart style industries,pennsylvania general insurance company.the district court,however,recognized the correct standard under wisconsin law,which holds that when an insurer breaches its duty to defend,the insured can recover damages which naturally flow from that breach,including costs and attorney fees incurred by the insured in defending the suit.towne realty,zurich ins,quotations and citations omitted.only legal expenses incurred while defending the suit against the insured are recoverable.id.the towne realty court expressly held that defense of the suit does not extend to countersuits,noting a t the risk of stating the obvious,a countersuit
