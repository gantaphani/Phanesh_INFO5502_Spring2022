when an insured sues its insurer for coverage and also brings negligence claims against its business manager and insurance broker for failing to advise about a policy exemption and failing to obtain additional coverage,are the negligence claims barred as a matter of law if the court rules in the insured favor on the coverage claim in this case,after the trial court concluded on a motion for summary adjudication that an insurer breached its duty to defend appellants,respondents filed motions for judgment on the pleadings arguing this ruling negated appellants negligence claims against them as a matter of law.the trial court agreed and granted the motions without leave to amend,and appellants dispute this ruling on appeal.we conclude the judgment must be reversed because the prior order did not negate an element of the causes of action alleged against respondents.we also conclude attorneys fees appellants incurred in pursuing coverage are a recoverable item of damages in their claims against respondents.
background 
appellants are members and associated corporate entities of the musical performance group third eye blind during the relevant time period,appellants business manager,respondent provident financial management provident,was responsible for,among other things,assessing the band insurance needs,facilitating insurance planning and obtaining appropriate insurance policies.appellants also retained an insurance broker,respondent near north entertainment insurance services,llc near north,a company they selected based on its claimed expertise in the field of entertainment insurance and risk management.
respondents obtained a commercial general liability cgl insurance policy for appellants from north american specialty insurance company nas covering the period of january,to january.provident paid premiums on the policy and was responsible for obtaining renewals.despite their responsibilities and expertise,however,neither provident nor near north advised appellants that the nas policy excluded coverage for some liability under a field of entertainment limitation endorsement fele.the fele in appellants policy excludes coverage for personal injury or advertising injury arising out of the field of entertainment business.specifically,coverage is excluded for claims of invasion,infringement or interference of the right to privacy or publicity copyright or trademark infringement defamation,except for claims arising out of a public appearance unrelated to the band professional entertainment work plagiarism,piracy or unfair competition regarding unauthorized use of others ideas or works and breach of contract regarding the band professional entertainment work.
in january,third eye blind fired one of its band members,kevin cadogan.cadogan immediately threatened to sue the band,claiming any further performances it gave under the name third eye blind would violate cadogan rights under the lanham act.a.cadogan ultimately filed suit against appellants,and others,in june.in addition to several other claims against individual band members,the complaint in cadogan third eye blind,et alleged appellants had misappropriated cadogan right of publicity by making unauthorized use of his name,likeness and goodwill and had violated the lanham act by creating public confusion regarding cadogan affiliation with the band and his role in creating or sponsoring the band music.cadogan also claimed appellants continued use of the name third eye blind constituted trademark infringement under the lanham act.
shortly after it was filed,appellants tendered the cadogan complaint to nas for defense and indemnity.nas denied the claim a month later,asserting the fele in appellants policy excluded coverage for the cadogan complaint lanham act claims and claims alleging a violation of cadogan right of publicity.although appellants sought reconsideration based on case law holding the fele language ambiguous,nas continued to refuse coverage.appellants therefore proceeded to defend the cadogan suit on their own and ultimately settled the case.appellants estimate the amount of settlement proceeds paid,combined with attorney fees and costs they incurred,exceeds million.
on march,appellants filed the instant action against nas and respondents provident and near north.the complaint alleged nas had breached its policy obligations by unreasonably refusing to defend and indemnify appellants in the cadogan case.in addition to breach of contract and declaratory relief claims against nas,the complaint alleged causes of action against respondents for negligence,breach of implied contract and declaratory relief.appellants alleged that,despite their claimed expertise in the field of entertainment industry insurance and despite the duties they owed appellants,respondents failed to advise or notify them that the nas policy contained an fele,such that an additional errors and omissions insurance policy would be necessary to guarantee full coverage.appellants further alleged they would have obtained an errors and omissions policy if they had been so advised.the complaint sought general damages from respondents,including all covered defense costs appellants had incurred.
in the summer of,appellants and nas filed for summary judgment and summary adjudication regarding nas duty to defend the cadogan suit.after two hearings,the court james robertson,ii concluded cadogan claims against appellants were potentially covered under the cgl policy and nas therefore had a duty to defend appellants in the cadogan lawsuit.in granting appellants motion for summary adjudication against nas,the court also ruled the fele was ambiguous as applied to the allegations and claims set forth in the cadogan complaint.this court summarily denied nas petition for writ of mandate on november,and the trial court denied a motion for reconsideration of the order on december.during this time,counsel for nas advised appellants attorney that nas believed the trial court rulings were erroneous and nas planned to appeal any final judgment.appellants and nas participated in two mediation sessions in january and ultimately reached a settlement.
on february,provident filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing the complaint did not state a cause of action against it in light of the court recent summary judgment and summary adjudication orders.characterizing these orders as a judicial determination that nas owed appellants a duty to defend the cadogan lawsuit,provident asserted it could not be held liable on the complaint claims for breach of implied contract,negligence and declaratory relief because these claims were alleged as alternative causes of action,and predicated on a finding that the nas policy did not cover appellants underlying claim.a week later,near north filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings reciting the same arguments.both motions requested judicial notice of the court orders granting appellants motion for summary adjudication and denying nas motion for summary judgment.after a hearing,the trial court ronald evans quidachay granted the requests for judicial notice and granted the motions for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend.the order explained appellants causes of action against provident and near north no longer stated claims for relief because they were predicated on a claim that the nas policy was insufficient to provide coverage in the cadogan lawsuit,yet the court had found in prior orders that the policy was sufficient.accordingly,the trial court also denied appellants claim for attorney fees.this appeal followed from the judgment 
discussion 
in the trial court,a defendant is entitled to judgment on the pleadings if the plaintiff complaint does not state a cause of action.in considering whether a defendant is entitled to judgment on the pleadings,we look only to the face of the pleading under attack all facts alleged in the complaint are admitted for purposes of the motion,and the court determines whether those facts constitute a cause of action.the court also may consider matters subject to judicial notice.citations.citations.howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside th,d.on appeal,review of a judgment on the pleadings requires the appellate court to determine,de novo and as a matter of law,whether the complaint states a cause of action.citation.for purposes of this review,we accept as true all material facts alleged in the complaint.citation.ott agri,supra,th at,d.
complaint alleged claims against respondents independent of coverage 
appellants argue the trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings because they alleged independent causes of action against respondents and the court prior ruling regarding nas duty to defend did not resolve or negate any element of these claims.respondents,of course,disagree.they contend appellants claims against them are precluded by the nas ruling because these claims were predicated on a finding that the cgl policy did not provide coverage for the cadogan lawsuit.we conclude there are several problems with this argument and the judgment in favor of respondents must be reversed.
first,respondents distort the nature of the claims against them when they rely on language taken out of context from the complaint to argue these claims were predicated on an absence of coverage under the cgl policy.in support of their argument,respondents quote the following paragraph from the introductory section of the complaint emphasizing the opening clause alternatively,if this court determines that nas has no obligation to provide defense or indemnity for the cadogan suit,plaintiffs seek compensatory damages against provident near north entertainment arising out of their failure to obtain adequate and reasonable insurance coverage,and in particular,an errors and omissions policy.however,read in context,the complaint alleges claims against respondents that are not premised on any conclusions as to the sufficiency of the cgl policy.indeed,although respondents summarize its allegations this way,the complaint does not simply assert that respondents were negligent because they procured an insufficient policy.rather,it alleges that,despite their superior insurance knowledge and expertise,respondents failed to notify appellants that the policy contained an which coverage for certain events might be failed to advise them that an errors and omissions policy would be necessary to cover this potential shortfall.these claims do not depend on an assumption that the cgl policy was deficient.the point is that respondents failed to alert appellants that the fele would give nas a viable basis for refusing coverage under some circumstances and,consequently,failed to recommend that appellants purchase errors and omissions insurance to ensure complete,uncontestable coverage.
based on their oversimplified articulation of the claims against them,respondents proceed to argue that the nas ruling conclusively established they fulfilled any duty of care they owed to appellants in similar fashion,they contend the prior ruling established nas was fully responsible for appellants losses.because respondents did not do something to cause nas to deny coverage,they argue their conduct can not be considered a proximate cause of any injury to appellants.but again,these arguments merely knock down straw men while ignoring the actual legal theories alleged in the complaint.appellants alleged respondents breached their duty to notify appellants of the existence of the fele and to advise them of the need to obtain errors and omissions insurance to protect them from a potential gap in coverage.whether respondents failed to give competent advice to appellants is an independent question and does not depend on whether nas was justified in denying coverage under the cgl policy 
likewise,while it is true the complaint does not allege respondents actively caused nas to deny coverage,respondents fail to recognize that this is not the only way in which their breach of duty could cause appellants losses.appellants allege that if respondents had advised them about the fele they would have obtained an errors and omissions policy to cover any potentially excluded claims,such as cadogan.because they did not have such a policy to provide clear coverage of the cadogan suit,appellants were forced to assume their own defense,incurring attorney fees,costs and indemnity.the complaint also alleges nas is responsible for these losses,but the two theories are not mutually exclusive,as respondents argue.rather,the law recognizes that there may be multiple causes of a plaintiff injury.it is not essential to a recovery of damages that a defendant wrongful act be the sole and only cause of the injury it is sufficient if it be a proximate cause which in the natural course of events produced,either by itself or in conjunction with other causes,the damage.citations.citations.mcdonald plumb d.see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.
division two of this court recently rejected a similar causation argument.in lombardo huysentruyt th,d,an attorney drafted an amendment to name the appellants beneficiaries of a trust.after a probate court found this amendment ineffective,the appellants settled with the probate estate and then sued the attorney for malpractice.id.at,d.however,the trial court concluded no reasonable judge would have found the trust amendment ineffective,and thus the probate court order was a superseding cause of the appellants alleged damages.id.at,d.on appeal from an entry of nonsuit,the appellate court rejected this reasoning based on hornbook law that a n independent intervening act is a superseding cause relieving the actor of liability for his negligence only if the intervening act is highly unusual or extraordinary and hence not reasonably foreseeable.citation.citation.id.at,d.because the appellants offered evidence to show that a reasonable attorney would have taken steps before execution of the trust amendment to avoid the rejection appellants ultimately suffered in probate court,the probate court if,for nonsuit purposes,a foreseeable result of the attorney negligence.id.at,d.likewise,here,appellants have alleged that,as a result of respondents negligent failure to advise them about the fele and the need for errors and omissions insurance,they suffered the foreseeable harm of having to defend a lawsuit without adequate insurance coverage.although nas may have been wrong to deny coverage of the cadogan suit,the complaint alleges this was a foreseeable harm that could have been avoided if respondents had competently advised appellants.
similar allegations of proximate cause have been found sufficient to withstand a challenge to the pleadings.in kurtz,richards,wilson insurance communicators marketing th,d kurtz,the plaintiff krw hired an insurance broker to obtain group insurance for its employees.when krw later made large claims on its policy due to the serious illness of an employee,the insurer denied coverage,citing an inaccurate certificate krw had submitted through its broker.id.at,d.the insurer sued krw to rescind the policy,and krw filed a against the insurer,for breach of contract and other claims,and against the insurance broker and its president for negligence and fraud.id.at,d.much like the procedural history in the case before us,the broker defendants successfully demurred to the after the trial court granted krw motion for summary judgment against the insurer.id.at,d.on appeal,the broker defendants maintained it was not reasonably foreseeable that any false information they may have given the insurer would cause the insurer to cancel the policy and bring suit against krw.id.at,d.as support,they cited krw own allegations in the that the insurer used the inaccurate information in the application to create a pretense for cancelling the policy.ibid.however,the appellate court concluded the demurrer should have been overruled because the complaint alleged it was entirely foreseeable the insurer would seek to rescind the policy on this basis,even if the attempted rescission was not ultimately successful.id.at,d.in an observation that seems equally apt in the present case,the kurtz court noted krw challenge to the legality of its insurer actions does not insulate respondents from liability.id.at,d.
