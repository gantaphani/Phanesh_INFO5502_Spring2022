at issue here is the third paragraph of section,subdivision a,which was added as part of the amendments any employer held liable for workers compensation benefits as a result of another employer failure to secure the payment of compensation as required by this division shall be entitled to reimbursement from the employers who were unlawfully uninsured during the last year of the employee employment,and shall be subrogated to the rights granted to the employee against the unlawfully uninsured employers under the provisions of article commencing with section of chapter of part of division.
