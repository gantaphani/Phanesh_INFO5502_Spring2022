appellants james hurvitz,and his wife jackie hurvitz brought suit against respondent paul fire and marine insurance company paul for bad faith breach of insurance contract based on paul decision to settle a third party claims without the hurvitzes consent and over their objections and breach of oral settlement agreement.the trial court granted paul motion for summary judgment,concluding that the hurvitzes consent was not required and that no final settlement agreement had been consummated.we hold that where an insurance policy grants to the insurer the right and duty to defend any claim or suit for covered injury or damage,including claims and suits that are groundless,false or fraudulent and the right to settle any claim or suit within the available limits of coverage,the insurer need not obtain the insureds consent prior to settling with a third party even though it leads to the loss of the insureds potential claim for malicious prosecution,injures their reputation,or impacts their future insurability.we further agree with the trial court that no final settlement agreement was breached,and,therefore,affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the following are the agreed facts as set forth in the parties briefs.
the insurance policy 
respondent paul issued a professional office insurance policy package to hurvitz effective from january,to january.the package included commercial general liability coverage for bodily injury,property damage,personal injury,and advertising injury.the policy had an advertising injury limit of.the advertising injury liability provision provided we pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered advertising injury that results from the advertising of your products,work or completed work and is caused by an advertising injury offense committed while this agreement is in effect.the term advertising was defined to mean attracting the attention of others by any means for the purpose of seeking customers or increasing sales or business.the term advertising injury was defined to mean injury,other than bodily injury or personal injury,caused by an advertising injury offense.the term advertising injury offense was defined to mean any of the following offenses libel or slander.making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that belittles the products,work or completed work of others.making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates an individual right of privacy.unauthorized taking or use of any advertising idea,material,slogan,style or title of others.
the provision governing the r ight and duty to defend provided we have the right and duty to defend any claim or suit for covered injury or damage made or brought against any protected person.we do so even if any of the allegations of any such claim or suit are groundless,false or fraudulent.but we have no duty to perform other acts or services.and our duty to defend claims or suits ends when we have used up the limits of coverage that apply with the payment of judgments,settlements or medical expenses.we have the right to investigate any claim or suit to the extent that we believe is proper.we also have the right to settle any claim or suit within the available limits of coverage.
the litigation 
appellant hurvitz was formerly in business with steven hoefflin.in,hurvitz filed suit against hoefflin,case no.while that case was pending,four former employees of hoefflin threatened to bring a sexual harassment claim against him.hoefflin was convinced to settle immediately,and,although no complaint was supposed to be filed,one accidentally was.in addition,a second,more detailed,version of the complaint hereafter the draft complaint found its way into the hands of hurvitz,who sent it to bob woodward of the washington post.the post published a story about the allegations of the draft complaint.the draft complaint contained allegations that hoefflin had exposed or ridiculed patients while they were under anesthesia.
as a result of the publication of the allegations of the draft complaint,hoefflin filed a complaint for defamation against the hurvitzes,case no.hoefflin also filed a in,the case initiated by hurvitz,containing similar allegations of defamation.hoefflin then filed a in another action pending between him and the hurvitzes,case no.the defendants in included the hurvitzes and gregory smith,one of the attorneys for the employees who had threatened to sue hoefflin.in addition to defamation,the in alleged conspiracy,promissory fraud,fraud in the inducement,and breach of contract,based on the turning over of the draft complaint to the press.
finally,hoefflin filed yet another complaint against the hurvitzes,case no,this time including one of the settling employees,kim,smith,and another attorney for the employees,richard garrigues.with regard to the hurvitzes,the complaint in alleged that they encouraged to breach the confidentiality provision of the employees settlement agreement.the complaint in included defamation claims,but they were brought against and the attorneys only.the complaint also included a cause of action for injunctive relief seeking to keep all the defendants from disseminating and discussing false allegations of misconduct by hoefflin including but not limited to the allegations in the complaint,as well as the terms of the settlement agreement with various persons,including the media.for reasons that are not entirely clear,this complaint was never served on the hurvitzes 
paul representation and settlement 
on february,paul agreed to represent the hurvitzes in the first independent action for defamation filed by hoefflin under a reservation of rights.on september,paul agreed to defend the hurvitzes against the in,and the in.this was also subject to a reservation of rights.
on july,paul declined to represent the hurvitzes in the other independent lawsuit filed by hoefflin,on the ground that t he only cause of action against the hurvitzes is for intentional interference with contractual relationships and the final cause of action against all defendants for injunctive relief t he cause of action for interference with contractual relationship does not potentially allege bodily injury,property damage or an occurrence the claim does not potentially allege any enumerated tort under the personal injury coverage or any claims for advertising injury and a ny potential claims for libel or slander that the facts might describe are being pursued by hoefflin in a separate action and are not potentially alleged here.
the hurvitzes were initially represented by independent counsel,thomas ferlauto,and his firm,king ferlauto,due to paul reservation of rights.paul withdrew its reservation of rights on november,and proceeded to appoint richard charnley as new defense counsel for the hurvitzes.the next month,paul sent a letter to ferlauto in which terms of settlement of both hoefflins claims against the hurvitzes and the hurvitzes potential claims against paul and hoefflin were discussed,and the following statement was made if you would prefer for paul not to settle the case,and would rather withdraw the tender of this claim for any defense by paul,you,of course,have that right.please advise us by the end of the day.as long as this case is being tendered to paul and defended by paul,paul may exercise its right to settle the claims against its insured.in april,hurvitz sent a letter stating that she wished to withdraw the tender of all lawsuits that paul had been defending on her behalf nevertheless,paul proceeded to settle all of hoefflin claims against it and the hurvitzes,including the claims against hurvitz and the claims in,the action which paul had consistently refused to defend.
under the settlement agreement,hoefflin agreed to release the hurvitzes from all claims of any nature whatsoever and specifically agreed to dismiss all four complaints and against the hurvitzes in exchange for.the settlement was conditioned on the dismissal of hoefflin claims being effectuated by the court.hoefflin agreed that the settlement was not intended to impair the hurvitzes prosecution of any and all claims available to them against hoefflin,and that the prosecution of any and all such claims is in no manner impacted,effected,modified,cancelled,settled,released or waived by way of the release or the dismissal entered pursuant to this settlement.at the hearing in which the settlement was put on the record,both charnley and ferluato appeared on behalf of the hurvitzes to clarify that this was a settlement between hoefflin and paul,and that the hurvitzes objected.the court dismissed hoefflin complaints and against the hurvitzes in,and.
counsel for the hurvitzes also appeared at the hearing challenging whether the settlement between paul and hoefflin was in good faith for purposes of code of civil procedure section the challenge was brought by the codefendants in and the attorneys who had represented her in the sexual harassment protect their potential right to proceed against the hurvitzes for indemnity.the challenging parties argued that since paul expressly denied coverage to the hurvitzes for claims asserted in,it had no standing to obtain a good faith determination in that case.counsel for the hurvitzes informed the court at that time that the hurvitzes would like the protection of a good faith determination.counsel argued,however,that the good faith determination could and should wait until a later time due to his concern that such a determination would impact the hurvitzes ability to pursue the underlying lawsuit against paul for wrongfully settling without their consent.
the underlying complaint and summary judgment 
after the settlement agreement was finalized,the hurvitzes filed the underlying complaint against paul.the complaint contained two causes of for breach of the insurance policy,including breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and one for breach of an alleged oral settlement agreement.with respect to the action for breach of the insurance policy,the complaint alleged that paul prematurely abandoned prospects of a global settlement which would have been beneficial to the hurvitzes in favor of pursing a partial settlement which was favorable to paul and not favorable to the hurvitzes.the complaint further alleged that paul attempted to coerce the hurvitzes into accepting the settlement by refusing to pay invoices of their independent defense counsel.paul settlement with hoefflin allegedly impaired the hurvitzes negotiating position caused injury to their reputation precluded them from filing a malicious prosecution action against hoefflin provided funds to hoefflin to use to finance his defense of the hurvitzes lawsuits against him deprived the hurvitzes of insurance financing for their continued litigation and impacted the hurvitzes future insurability.
the complaint also alleged breach of a binding settlement agreement with the hurvitzes.according to the allegations,an oral contract was entered into on or about january,under which paul was to pay the hurvitzes in return for the release of their malicious prosecution claims against hoefflin and release of their right to seek reimbursement for defense costs from paul.
paul moved for summary judgment.the moving papers established that the policy gave paul the right to settle claims against the insureds without their consent,that paul settled all of hoefflin claims against the hurvitzes,and that the settlement did not impair the hurvitzes affirmative against hoefflin 
in the opposition,the hurvitzes disputed that paul had the right to settle because of its denial of tender,or any of the claims against hurvitz.they further contended that settling with hoefflin without their consent violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because,among other things,it impaired their potential malicious prosecution claim,and that they were entitled to independent counsel during settlement negotiations.
trial court order 
the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment.the court reasoned that t he policy expressly gave paul the right to settle claims within the policy limits and to do so without the consent of the insured and that therefore the hurvitzes dissatisfaction with the terms of the settlement does not give rise to a claim.paul was under no obligation to litigate every case to a favorable termination to preserve the insured expectancy of a future claim for malicious prosecution.concerning hurvitz attempt to withdraw her tender of defense,the court said that it did not result in the requirement that paul obtain her consent to settle because t here is no evidence that hurvitz withdrew her demand that paul indemnify her and that therefore paul was contractually obligated to pay a settlement or judgment of hoefflin claim.the court also expressed the understanding that t he withdrawal of hurvitz tender of defense could not prevent hoefflin from obtaining a judgment against her and then collecting that judgment from paul.once hoefflin sued and paul agreed to provide a defense,hoefflin rights against the paul policy vested,so that paul and the hurvitzes could neither bilaterally nor unilaterally defeat hoefflin claims against the policy.neither the insurer nor the policyholder can cancel or rescind an insurance policy to defeat the rights of third party claimants.
with regard to the cause of action for breach of settlement agreement,the court stated the undisputed facts show that paul did not agree to the terms contained in the january,letter and that the hurvitzes themselves had no knowledge of and certainly did not agree to the settlement terms they are seeking to enforce.the letters presented by the hurvitzes show that there was no meetings of the minds regarding the terms of any oral contract.the hurvitzes have presented no material disputed facts that would demonstrate that there was a meeting of the minds.further,it was the clear intention of the parties that the agreement would be in writing before it could be considered completed.judgment was entered on the court order,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
the hurvitzes contend that paul wrongfully settled with hoefflin over their objection,particularly with regard to,the case it consistently refused to defend,and the claims asserted against hurvitz since she sent a letter purporting to withdraw her tender of defense.
preliminarily,we look at whether an indemnitor settlement of a lawsuit without the consent or participation of the indemnitee does,in fact,bar a later claim for malicious prosecution by the primary injury purportedly suffered by the hurvitzes.that was the issue in villa cole th,d,a case involving a suit against several alameda police officers and the city of alameda city brought by a man who had been arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.the officers were sued both in their official capacities and their individual capacities,and were represented by the city attorney.the city was bearing all the cost of defense and would have been obligated to pay any judgment.the arrestee eventually offered to settle in exchange for the city waiver of its right to seek reimbursement for its litigation costs and attorney fees.one of the officers objected to settlement on those terms,but the city went ahead,taking the position that it had a right to settle the lawsuit on behalf of the recalcitrant officer because it had borne all the expense of his indemnification and defense,and because the settlement would result in the dismissal of the lawsuit with no actual or potential liability to him.after the matter settled,the officer filed a lawsuit for malicious prosecution against the arrestee.summary judgment was granted on the ground that the settlement prevented the officer from establishing favorable termination of the underlying action in his favor.
in reviewing the trial court order,the appellate court discussed the basic principles of malicious prosecution law i n order to establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution a plaintiff must plead and prove that the prior proceeding was pursued to a legal termination favorable to the plaintiff brought without probable cause and initiated with malice.citations.in order for the termination of the lawsuit to be considered favorable to the malicious prosecution plaintiff,it must be reflective of the merits of the action and of the plaintiff innocence of the misconduct alleged therein.in most cases,a voluntary unilateral dismissal is considered a termination in favor of the defendant in the underlying action the same is true of a dismissal for failure to prosecute.citations.on the other hand,a resolution of the underlying litigation that leaves some doubt as to the defendant innocence or liability is not a favorable termination,and bars that party from bringing a malicious prosecution action against the underlying plaintiff.thus,a dismissal resulting from negotiation,settlement or agreement is generally not deemed a favorable termination of the proceedings.citations.the purpose of a settlement is to avoid a determination on the merits.villa cole,supra,th at,d.
the officer contended that because the underlying lawsuit was settled over his protests and objection and because he did not participate in the settlement in any way,it actually operated as a voluntary unilateral dismissal of himself by the arrestee,and was thus a favorable termination on the merits.villa cole,supra,th at,d.the court disagreed e ven where a defendant does not agree to a settlement made on his behalf,his or her dismissal from the lawsuit pursuant to that settlement will not be viewed as a favorable termination as long as it was a necessary condition to achievement of the overall settlement.such a dismissal is not considered unilateral because it was required by the terms of a settlement agreement,and it will act as a bar to a later malicious prosecution action by the nonsettling defendant.ibid.in the case before it,the terms of the settlement between the city and the arrestee required the dismissal of all the defendants,including the officer.the city could not realize the benefits of settling the litigation with the arrestee unless the action against the officer was simultaneously terminated.otherwise,the city would continue to be exposed to potential liability on the officer behalf,both for defense and for indemnification,and would therefore still be a participant in the litigation,contrary to its aims in settling with the arrestee and his attorney.in short,the arrestee dismissed the officer from the lawsuit because it was necessary to effect the settlement with the city.such a termination does not necessarily reflect the arrestee opinion that his action against the officer lacked merit,and thus does not qualify as a favorable termination for purposes of a malicious prosecution action.ibid.
in reaching its decision,the court relied in part on haight handweiler d.in that case,a malicious prosecution action based on an underlying malicious prosecution action,the attorney defendant in the underlying malicious prosecution refused to settle unless the plaintiff also dismissed his former client.the settlement went forward and both were dismissed,but neither the client nor his new attorney agreed to the settlement or authorized the dismissal.like the officer in villa cole,supra,th,d,the client argued that because he did not agree to the settlement the termination should be treated as a voluntary dismissal of him haight handweiler,supra,d at.the facts were undisputed,however,that the plaintiff in the underlying malicious prosecution action dismissed the client because it was necessary to effect the settlement,because the former attorney would not settle without it ibid.the plaintiff in the underlying malicious prosecution action also believed that the settlement funds represented reasonable compensation for the damage he suffered in the original litigation.on those facts,the court agreed that the dismissal of the client does not qualify as a favorable termination in the context of a malicious prosecution action.ibid.
based on villa cole and haight handweiler,it appears that the hurvitzes are correct that the settlement,despite their lack of involvement and outright opposition,deprived them of the favorable termination needed to pursue a later malicious prosecution action against hoefflin.
as we have seen,the insurance policy gave paul the right and duty to defend any claim or suit for covered injury or damage made or brought against any protected person even if any of the allegations of any such claim or suit are groundless,false or fraudulent and the right to settle any claim or suit within the available limits of coverage.the hurvitzes argue that,despite the language of the policy,paul did not have an unfettered right to settle claims without their consent.the hurvitzes maintain that by settling,paul violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because hoefflin claims were meritless,and the settlement precluded the possibility of a later claim for malicious prosecution action against hoefflin.the hurvitzes further alleged that the settlement impaired their negotiating position,caused injury to their reputation,provided funds to hoefflin to use to finance his defense of the hurvitzes lawsuits against him,deprived the hurvitzes of insurance financing for their continued litigation,and impacted their future insurability.
similar allegations were before the court in western polymer technology,reliance ins.th,d,where the plaintiffs,a company and its owner,alleged that the settlement of a third party claim by their insurer injured their reputations and damaged plaintiff company ability to recover on its against the third parties.id.at,d.the plaintiff company had been sued by a third party for allegedly delivering defective manufacturing equipment,and had for amounts due under a note and for misrepresentation.after expending over in defense costs,the insurer settled within policy limits under an agreement that left the intact.putting a reverse spin on the numerous cases which have held that an insurer acts in bad faith when it unreasonably refuses to settle a case within policy limits and thus exposes its insured to a judgment far beyond policy limits,the plaintiffs argued that an insurer engages in bad faith conduct when it accepts a settlement over the insured objection where there is no likelihood that the insured would be exposed to a judgment that exceeded the policy limits.id.at,d.
the court refused to accept plaintiffs indiscriminate transfer of rules that address one which wrongfully expose their insureds to excess liability by unreasonably refusing a context completely foreign to the rules origins.western polymer technology,reliance ins,supra,th at,d.instead,it use d fundamental principles that govern claimed breaches of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to analyze plaintiffs claim.ibid.under this analysis,it was clear that the interests plaintiffs claimed were impaired could not be protected by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,given the purpose of liability insurance and the express language of the policy plaintiff company contends that the settlement injured its business reputation.however,a liability insurance policy purpose is to provide the insured with a defense and indemnification for third party claims within the scope of the coverage purchased,and not to insure the entire range of the insured.citation.at least where the policy does not require the insured consent to a settlement,there appears to be no precedent for holding an insurer liable for injury to an insured reputation as a result of the settlement of a third party claim.citation.this is not surprising,because the policy language informs the insured that the insurer may settle as it deems expedient any claim or suit,even if the suit allegations are groundless,false or fraudulent no reasonable reading of this language would create an expectation that the insurer has to forgo settlement in favor of vindicating the insured reputation.id.at,d.as the court saw it,adopting the plaintiffs argument would mean that insurers could never settle without the insured consent even where the contract stated otherwise,and result in a judicial fiat excising insurers contractual right to control settlements id.at,d accord,new hampshire ins.ridout roofing th,d stating that where the policy gave the insurer the express right to settle claims and,if such settlements included the insured deductible,to thereafter seek reimbursement from the insured,the insured exercise of that right could not be limited by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the implied covenant can not be utilized to limit or restrict an express grant of discretion in a contract to one of the parties thereto see caplan fellheimer eichen braverman kaskey cir,where insured sought an injunction to prevent the insurer from settling with a third party because the settlement would preclude a later malicious prosecution action,court held that because they contracted with the insurer to authorize it to settle claim and thereby acted to permit the outcome which they find unacceptable,the outcome complained of was and does not qualify as irreparable injury.
although the hurvitzes alleged injuries are somewhat different than those described in western polymer,we believe the court analysis is equally applicable here the decision to settle rather than continue litigation invariably involves a conflict between the desire to vindicate oneself and the desire to minimize the costs of litigation and avoid the risk of loss.defendants who settle face an uphill battle in convincing others,including members of the interested public or the media,that they were completely innocent of the charges.moreover,when a defendant pays money or gives up something of value to settle a claim,he or she loses the ability to later pursue a malicious prosecution claim.see,ferreira gray,cary,ware freidenrich th,d a negotiated settlement is entirely inconsistent with bringing a further lawsuit for malicious prosecution.these are the ordinary consequences of settlement.a party purchasing a liability insurance policy containing the duty to defend language at issue here agrees to accept the insurer view concerning the point at which the benefits of settlement exceed the risk of continuing litigation.the alternative is to pay policy with a consent provision.liability insurance exists primarily to protect the insured finances.the covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires the insurer to minimize the possibility of an award that exceeds the policy does not require the insurer to fight a legal action until the bitter end when the costs of defense exceed the benefit to be achieved.
we find further support for our conclusion in new plumbing contractors,edwards,sooy byron th,d,where the insured sued not its insurer,but the insurer counsel,alleging professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty for settling an earlier action without notifying the insured and ignoring valid defenses that would have absolved the insured of any liability.id.at,d.the damages were said to be higher premiums,lower coverage and higher deductibles,as well as the need to deal with financially weaker carriers ibid.the trial court ruled that the insurer had the right to settle the case regardless of whether it was defensible,and without consulting its insured.id.at,d.the appellate court agreed under a policy provision giving an insurance company discretion to settle as it sees fit,the insurer is entitled to control settlement negotiations without interference from the insured,and generally,it has no liability to the insured for settling within the policy limits.citation.thus,there is no cause of action where the insured claims the settlement injured its business reputation citation,nor any where the insured claims the settlement unfairly used up its deductibles.citation.since the insurer could settle without consulting the insured and over its objection,counsel recommendation of settlement was not a cause of any harm the insured may have suffered.id.at,d.
the hurvitzes cite a case with similar facts that came to a dissimilar conclusion novak low,ball lynch th,d.there the insurer agreed to defend two of the multiple causes of action in a third party complaint under a reservation of rights.independent counsel was appointed to provide the insured a defense.in the meantime,unbeknownst to the insured or his independent counsel,counsel for the insurer entered into settlement negotiations with the third party,eventually agreeing to settle the two potentially covered causes of action,allowing the insurer to completely withdraw.as in new plumbing contractors,the insured brought an action against the attorneys for the insurer,contending that they should have advised the insured and his counsel of settlement negotiations.the claim was dismissed by the trial court,but the court of appeal believed there was merit to the allegations because the insured and his attorney might have been able to impact settlement through the exchange of information or otherwise protect the insured interest in light of the proposed dismissal of the first two causes of action.id.at,d.
the court gave various examples of ways the insured could have acted to protect himself had he been properly informed,which bore on the factual issues of causation and damages,which remain for determination at trial he could have attempted to finish discovery prior to settlement,effect a global settlement of the entire action or seek declaratory relief as to whether the insurer could withdraw its defense upon a partial settlement.the insured has also asserted various ways in which the settlement worked more harm than good,including loss of insurance protection and defense to the remaining causes of action.as well,the settlement provided the third party with financing to aggressively prosecute the remaining causes of action.further,the insured contends the first two causes of action were completely devoid of merit,and thus their dismissal precluded pursuit of a suit for malicious prosecution as to those claims.novak low,ball lynch,supra,th at,d.
in novak,the harm to the insured arose primarily from the failure to negotiate a global settlement that included dismissal of all causes of action against the insured,something that did not occur here.however,to the extent it is supportive of the view that,prior to acceptance of a reasonable settlement within policy limits,an insurer or its counsel must consider the impact of a settlement on an insured potential claim for malicious prosecution or on the third party ability to finance continuing litigation,we must respectfully disagree for the reasons we have discussed and the reasons set forth in western polymer and new plumbing contractors.
as the hurvitzes further point out,in other circumstances,courts have held that settlements which eliminate the insureds rights to obtain recovery for their affirmative claims of injury can result in liability for bad faith.in two aetna casualty surety d,and rothtrock ohio farmers ins.d.involving automobile accidents,the insurance companies settlements with third parties caused the insureds compulsory for personal injuries arising out of the same accidents to be barred.in those cases,the insurers undertook the settlements knowing that the insureds intended to file,but before the were filed.had they simply allowed the to be filed before the settlement,or carefully worded the settlement agreements to make clear that were not paul did here with respect to the hurvitzes against claims could have gone forward.the hurvitzes suggest no way that paul could have both settled with hoefflin and preserved their right to a malicious prosecution action.see villa cole,supra,th,d ferreira gray,cary,ware freidenrich,supra,th at,d w here both sides give up anything of value in order to end the litigation,a party can not later claim he received a favorable termination.
the hurvitzes also seek to rely on this court decision in notrica state comp.ins.fund th,d for the proposition that the insurer must at least consider the potential impact on the insured future premiums when it settles a third party lawsuit.in that case,a business sued its workers compensation carrier,the state compensation insurance fund,for tort recovery based on the insurer case reserve and claims handling policies and practices.the insurer had a pattern of leaving claims open for excessive periods of time and assigning high monetary rese
