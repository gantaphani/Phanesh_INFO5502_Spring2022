introduction 
a group of employees brought an action against their employer,jon davler,for various employment claims,including sexual harassment,invasion of privacy,and false imprisonment.jon davler tendered the action to its insurer,arch insurance company,which denied coverage based on an practices exclusion.after jon davler filed this insurance coverage action against arch,the trial court sustained arch demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the underlying action 
three female employees of jon davler,a cosmetics company,sued their employer,individually and on behalf of all similarly situated employees,for sexual harassment in violation of government code section,subdivision j,failure to prevent sexual harassment in violation of government code section,subdivisions j and k,invasion of privacy in violation of article i,section of the california constitution,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and false imprisonment.the employees also named as a defendant christina yang,an owner,manager,or supervisor of jon davler.
the employees alleged that yang became upset one morning because she found a used sanitary napkin around the toilet area in the women bathroom and blood around the toilet seat at the jon davler facility where they worked.the employees alleged that yang was so upset that she went to the department where they were working and started yelling that they were dirty and demanded to know who was on their menstrual period so that she could determine who had left the used sanitary napkin by the toilet and the toilet unclean.yang demanded in a loud,angry voice,are you on your period the employees denied that they were on their menstrual cycle,but yang was not satisfied with the responses she received.she instructed another female employee,against her will,to take each of the employees into the bathroom,one by one,and check their panties to see who was on their menstrual period,by requiring each to pull down their pants and underwear for an inspection.
the employees were shocked and in a state of disbelief at yang instructions.when they asked about the consequences of refusing to participate in the inspection,yang said that anyone who refused would be fired.yang then lined up the employees outside the bathroom.while a male supervisor waited with yang outside the bathroom door,the designated female employee went into the bathroom with each employee,stood a foot or two away while the employees had to pull down their pants and their panties,exposing their vaginal area,so that the employee could see if they were wearing a sanitary napkin and therefore on their period.when the employees exited the bathroom after the inspection,they found it extremely difficult and embarrassing to face yang and the male supervisor,and quickly went back to their work area while the inspections continued with the other employees.in their cause of action for false imprisonment,the employees alleged that they were wrongfully detained and confined by jon davler and yang in the bathroom for the purpose of conducting a humiliating and wrongful inspection of their vaginal area to determine if they were on their menstrual period.
b.the policy 
arch issued jon davler a commercial general liability policy that,among other coverage,provided coverage for those sums jon davler becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal and advertising injury to which this insurance applies.the policy defined personal and advertising injury as injury,including consequential bodily injury,arising out of seven categories of offenses,one of which was f alse arrest,detention or imprisonment 
the policy contained an employment related practices exclusion,which the parties refer to as an erp exclusion.this exclusion stated that the coverage for personal and advertising injury did not apply to an injury arising out of any refusal to employ a person,termination of a person employment,or e practices,policies,acts or omissions,such as coercion,demotion,evaluation,reassignment,discipline,defamation,harassment,humiliation,discrimination or malicious prosecution directed at that person 
jon davler tendered the underlying action to arch.arch declined coverage and refused to provide indemnity or a defense based on the practices exclusion.
c.this action 
jon davler filed this action against arch for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and conversion.jon davler alleged that the personal and advertising injuring coverage included indemnity and defense for false arrest,detention and imprisonment and o ral or written publication,in any manner,of material that violates a person right of privacy.jon davler alleged that arch refusal to provide indemnity or a defense breached the terms of the policy and was unreasonable and in bad faith.jon davler also alleged that arch converted its policy benefits and premium payments 
arch demurred,arguing that all of the claims in the underlying action alleged injury to persons arising out of e practices,policies,acts or omissions,and that therefore the practices exclusion applied.arch emphasized that the only relationship between the employees in the underlying action and arch insured jon davler was an employment relationship,that the employees alleged yang had told the employees they would be fired if they did not comply with the inspection demand,and that all of the claims were based on allegations of harassment and hostile work environment.arch also noted that,i n obvious recognition that their claims were based upon employment practices,the employees alleged that they had exhausted their administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the california department of fair employment and housing in opposition,jon davler argued that the practices exclusion was ambiguous and did not apply to a claim based on false imprisonment that occurred in an employment scenario and was for employment purposes.
the trial court sustained arch demurrer without leave to amend.the court noted that because all of the causes of action other than false imprisonment were clearly the types of actions covered by the practices exclusion,it was really the false imprisonment that we are concentrating on here,and jon davler is alleging ambiguity as applied in this situation.the court ruled that all of the claims in the underlying action fall within the exclusion,and,therefore,the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.the trial court entered an order of dismissal.jon davler appealed.
discussion 
standard of review and the duty of an insurer 
because a demurrer both tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint and involves the trial court discretion,an appellate court employs two separate standards of review on appeal.citation.appellate courts first review the complaint de novo to determine whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory,citation,or in other words,to determine whether the trial court erroneously sustained the demurrer as a matter of law.citation.citation.second,if a trial court sustains a demurrer without leave to amend,appellate courts determine whether the plaintiff could amend the complaint to state a cause of action.citation.citation.das bank of america,th.where an insured has asserted a claim against an insurer for breach of the duty to defend,and the policy and the underlying third party complaint has been incorporated into the insured complaint against the insurer,we may properly rely on these documents in assessing whether the insured claims are legally tenable.total call,peerless ins.th.
an insurer must defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity under the policy.scottsdale ins.mv transportation cal th.determination of the duty to defend depends,in the first instance,on a comparison between the allegations of the complaint and the terms of the policy.citation.but the duty also exists where extrinsic facts known to the insurer suggest that the claim may be covered.citation.this includes all facts,both disputed and undisputed,that the insurer knows or becomes aware of from any source citation if not at the inception of the third party lawsuit,then at the time of tender citation.moreover,that the precise causes of action pled by the third party complaint may fall outside policy coverage does not excuse the duty to defend where,under the facts alleged,reasonably inferable,or otherwise known,the complaint could fairly be amended to state a covered liability.citation.thus,i f any facts stated or fairly inferable in the complaint,or otherwise known or discovered by the insurer,suggest a claim potentially covered by the policy,the insurer duty to defend arises and is not extinguished until the insurer negates all facts suggesting potential coverage.citation.in general,doubt as to whether an insurer owes a duty to defend must be resolved in favor of the insured.citation.hartford casualty ins.swift distribution,cal th.
while the duty to defend is broad,it is not unlimited it is measured by the nature and kinds of risks covered by the policy.citation.in an action seeking declaratory relief concerning a duty to defend,the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage,while the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.in other words,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.citation.thus,an insurer may be excused from a duty to defend only when the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.hartford casualty ins.swift distribution,supra,cal th at.
finally,i n determining whether a claim creates the potential for coverage under an insurance policy,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.citation.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.citation.citation.in determining this intent,t he rules governing policy interpretation require us to look first to the language of the contract in order to ascertain its plain meaning or the meaning a layperson would ordinarily attach to it.citation.we consider the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.citation.we must also interpret the language in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy.citation.hartford casualty ins.swift distribution,supra,cal th at.
b.the employment related practices exclusion applies to the underlying claims 
jon davler argues that the trial court erred in sustaining arch demurrer without leave to amend because the practices exclusion is ambiguous.jon davler contends there is ambiguity in the exclusion use of the phrases such as and arising out of,and ambiguity created by the presence of false imprisonment in the coverage provision and its absence in the exclusion.we see no such ambiguities.
jon davler argues that the practices exclusion is ambiguous as applied to false imprisonment claims because the exclusion use of the term such as limits the scope of the general exclusionary phrase practices to sharing or having the same or similar characteristics or qualities as coercion,demotion,evaluation,reassignment,discipline,defamation,harassment,humiliation,discrimination or malicious prosecution.jon davler contends that f alse imprisonment is markedly dissimilar to the specific examples restricting the general exclusionary phrase.
the phrase such as is not intended to be exhaustive harper row,publishers,nation enterprises,d and is illustrative and not limitative campbell acuff rose music,d.the use of the phrase such as in an exclusion is nonexclusive and is not a phrase of strict limitation,but is a phrase of general similitude indicating that there are includable other matters of the same kind which are not specifically enumerated.aroa marketing,hartford ins.of midwest th,quoting shaddox bertani th,see aisenberg d,i f nothing else,the phrase such as reveals that other examples exist,rev in part on other grounds in aisenberg cir.
false imprisonment shares general similitude with several of the matters specifically enumerated in the practices exclusion,such as coercion,discipline,and harassment.false imprisonment is the unlawful violation of the personal liberty of another,where the restraint required may be effectuated by means of physical force citation,threat of force citation,confinement by physical barriers citation,or by means of any other form of unreasonable duress.fermino fedco,cal th,see lyons fire ins.exchange th,t he elements of a tortious claim of false imprisonment are the nonconsensual,intentional confinement of a person,without lawful privilege,and for an appreciable period of time,however brief.false imprisonment involves coercion,by force,threat,or otherwise.an employer can commit false imprisonment by assault and battery or by engaging in some other coercive stratagem.fermino,supra,at.similarly,workplace harassment can include false imprisonment,and employment actions often involve both claims.see,myers trendwest resorts,th,supervisor made numerous sexual advances and tried to have sex with employee in garage with the door closed murillo rite stuff foods,th,supervisor sexually harassed employee and isolated her from other employees to facilitate his predations krause turnberry country club d,supervisor sexually harassed employee and,when she announced her departure,pulled her into his office against her will,shut the door,and told her she was committing career suicide.thus,false imprisonment is similar to the examples of acts listed in the exclusion.even under jon davler theory,the exclusion applies to false imprisonment claims.
arising out of 
jon davler argues that use of the the broad term arising out of creates an ambiguity because it appears both in the coverage clause and in the practices exclusion.as jon davler recognizes,however,courts generally have interpreted the phrase arising out of very broadly,even where the phrase appears in an exclusion.
california courts have consistently given a broad interpretation to the terms arising out of or arising from in various kinds of insurance provisions.it is settled that this language does not import any particular standard of causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy.rather,it broadly links a factual situation with the event creating liability,and connotes only a minimal causal connection or incidental relationship.paul mercury ins.mountain west farm bureau mutual ins.th,see southgate recreation park dist.california for park recreation ins.th,the arising out of connective broadly links the exclusionary operative events with the exclusion and is generally equated with origination,growth or flow from the event aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee th,broad interpretation given to terms arising out of in trademark exclusion in general liability insurance policy fibreboard hartford accident indemnity th,california courts generally have given the terms arising out of or arising from their commonsense meaning,concluding that they connote more than mere causation.
the jon davler employees injuries caused by the alleged false imprisonment arose out of the employees employment.in low golden eagle ins.th,the court held that factors relevant to the determination of whether the events in the underlying action were within the scope of the practices exclusion include the nexus between the allegedly defamatory statement or other tort at issue and the third party plaintiff employment by the insured,and the existence or nonexistence of a relationship between the employer and the third party plaintiff outside the employment relationship.id.at.here,the nexus between the other tort,false imprisonment and the employees employment with jon davler was as close as a nexus can be the only reason the employees were forced into the bathroom for inspection was that that they were employed by jon davler,were following a directive from a supervisor at their place of employment,and would lose their jobs
