tig asserts that sedgwick coi should obligate lumbermens because sedgwick acted as lumbermens agent.although laying out the agency relationship will aid us in resolving other matters,tig mistakenly assumes that merely establishing an agency relationship will create liability for lumbermens.lumbermens delegated the power to issue coi to sedgwick,but those coi could not alter the underlying policy terms or create liability.because the coi expressly disclaims any power to alter the underlying policy,and the parties agree that lumbermens withheld from sedgwick the power to alter policies,sedgwick issuance of the coi did not create coverage.
texas law classifies insurance sellers into three,soliciting agents,and recording agents.a seller can have an agency relationship with both the insurer and insured.mckillip employers fire ins,no writ.regardless of the agency relationship,the agent actual or apparent authority to perform a task can create vicarious liability.duzich marine office of am,christi,writ denied.
an insurance seller acts as a broker when a potential insured approaches the insurance seller and the insurance seller only submits an application to the insurance agency.mckillip,at.if the insurance seller has contact only with the buyer,the seller is a broker.employers cas.mireles,antonio,writ ref.
an insurance seller acts as a soliciting agent when the seller contacts the insured but the seller lacks the power to modify,change,or waive the terms of the policy.ann.vernon supp maccabees mut.life ins.mcniel,writ denied.the soliciting agent has limited actual authority to make representations on behalf of the insurance company.maccabees,at.
a recording agent solicits insurance,has the power to write policies of insurance,binds the insurer on risks,and collects premiums on behalf of the insurer.ann.art vernon supp maccabees,at.the recording agent is closest to the principal,and his actions will always bind the principal.lexington ins.buckingham gate,christi,pet.denied.
if the insurance seller is not a broker,soliciting agent,or recording agent,the seller falls into the category of the insurer agent.ann.vernon supp maccabees,at.sellers in this category lack the power to modify the terms of a policy.stating that this article does not authorize an agent to alter,amend,modify,waiver,or change a term or condition of an insurance policy.
the district court correctly categorized sedgwick as a soliciting agent,relying on the agency agreement between sedgwick and lumbermens to reach this conclusion.the agency agreement authorized sedgwick to solicit insurance on behalf of lumbermens but permitted sedgwick to bind lumbermens only to the extent specific authority was granted in the schedule s attached.under policy,sedgwick had the authority to issue coi and binders but lacked the authority to modify the policy itself.
on appeal,tig argues that lumbermens granted sedgwick the power to issue coi.the certificates of insurance,however,expressly state that they do not modify the underlying insurance policy.the coi comport with the agency agreement lumbermens granted sedgwick the power to solicit and negotiate but not to bind.the district court properly categorized sedgwick as a soliciting agent.
tig contends that,regardless of the statutory category in which sedgwick falls,lumbermens granted sedgwick the actual authority to bind the principal.a soliciting agent misrepresent
