this is a coverage action by an insured against his insurer stemming from an action in which a customer sued the insured for,among other claims,assault and battery committed by the insured business manager in an altercation with the customer on the business premises.the insurer moved for summary judgment claiming the manager actions allegedly taken in were nevertheless intentional and deliberate,and thus outside the policy coverage for accidents.the trial court granted the insurer motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action.because existing case law indicates acts committed by an insured in can be deemed an accident,the underlying case raised the possibility of coverage under the policy.we thus conclude the trial court erred in finding the insurer had no duty to defend the insured on the ground the manager acts were deliberate and intentional.accordingly,we reverse.
facts and proceedings below 
plaintiff and appellant is davar jafari,doing business as glendora tire brake center.during the incident at issue in this case,he was the named insured under a garage liability policy issued by respondents,emc insurance companies and employers mutual casualty company.the policy provided liability coverage for garage operations other than for covered autos.
under liability coverage the policy provided we will pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies caused by an accident and resulting from garage operations other than the ownership,maintenance or use of covered autos.
the policy defined insured to include employees acting within the scope of their duties.
one of the exclusions in the policy was for expected or intended injury.this clause stated insurance coverage under the policy did not apply to bodily injury or property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.but for garage operations other than covered autos this exclusion does not apply to bodily injury resulting from the use of reasonable force to protect persons or property.
on august,farhad nazemzadeh came to pick up his car from glendora tire brake center.mark mitchell,the manager of glendora tire brake center,told nazemzadeh his car was not ready for pickup.apparently,nazemzadeh became verbally abusive.he started yelling at mitchell.mitchell told nazemzadeh to leave and to get out of his face.nazemzadeh apparently did not leave but continued his verbal assault,telling mitchell he would kill him.mitchell punched nazemzadeh at least twice in the face.nazemzadeh sustained a cut over his right eye which required three stitches.
nazemzadeh filed suit against mark mitchell,jafari,and jafari doing business as glendora tire brake center.nazemzadeh complaint alleged causes of action for assault,battery,negligence,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,premises liability and negligent hiring.
jafari tendered defense and indemnification of the action to respondents.respondents rejected jafari tender.in respondents denial letter coverage counsel explained nazemzadeh suit was the result of mitchell intentional acts,intentional acts are not accidents,and hence do not fall within the coverage provision of the policy.accordingly,jafari was required to retain counsel to represent his interests in the nazemzadeh litigation.
jafari then filed this coverage action against respondents for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing for respondents failure to provide a defense and indemnity in the nazemzadeh litigation.respondents filed a motion for summary judgment.their motion asserted,the triggering act,punching someone in the face,was in no way accidental or unintentional and thus did not result from an accident as that term is defined in the policy.thus,there was no coverage and,accordingly,no breach of the duty to defend or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
respondents attached a copy of the police report of the incident to their motion for summary judgment the reporting officer wrote in the synopsis portion of the report,mitchell hit nazemzadeh in the face after nazemzadeh threatened to kill mitchell for not repairing his vehicle.nazemzadeh received three stitches to his right eye.the officer took nazemzadeh statement.nazemzadeh explained he went to jafari business and asked mitchell to finish fixing his car.mitchell said he was busy and would get to it when he had a chance.nazemzadeh said mitchell became angry and hit him three times in the face,causing a black eye and a cut above his right eyelid.nazemzadeh told the officer mitchell threatened to kill him if he came back or if he told the police.
the officer then spoke to mitchell.mitchell explained nazemzadeh said he needed his car by the end of the day.nazemzadeh had only dropped it off late the night before and there were several other customers ahead of him whose cars needed to be worked on first.nazemzadeh started yelling at mitchell and got up close to him.nazemzadeh said he would kill mitchell and have the armenian mafia beat him up.mitchell said he was going to call the police if nazemzadeh did not leave.mitchell dialed a and a hoping nazemzadeh would leave.nazemzadeh started yelling at him in armenian and kept coming closer until he was yelling in mitchell face.mitchell told him to back off,and when nazemzadeh did not,mitchell punched him twice in the face because nazemzadeh refused to get out of his face and he was defending himself.
jafari filed opposition.jafari pointed out the term accident was not defined in the policy and under existing case law acts of are considered unintended and unexpected and thus accidental for purposes of coverage.jafari also pointed out the policy expressly provided an exception to the exclusion for bodily injury resulting from the use of reasonable force to protect persons and property.for this reason,jafari argued,mitchell actions assertedly taken in raised the possibility of coverage under the policy and thus respondents owed a duty of defense and indemnity.
mitchell filed a declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,stating a customer,farhad nazemzadeh,came into the store and demanded the return of his vehicle.after i told him that his vehicle was not ready he became very upset and started to yell derogatory comments about my boss and me.i requested that he leave the store.however,he did not and he became more upset and got right up into my face.to try to get him to leave,i pretended to call the police.in response,nazemzadeh threatened to kill me and was standing directly in front of me,yelling at me.i was afraid that he was going to strike me and,in an effort to defend myself and the store,i struck him.i then pushed him out of the store.at the time i struck him i was in fear for my personal safety and my life.
in their reply,respondents agreed an issue in dispute was whether mitchell in fact acted in.nevertheless,respondents argued,while the validity of the contentions may be in dispute,there is no question that mitchell intended to strike nazemzadeh,and that mitchell conduct caused the injury.because mitchell acted intentionally,respondents argued,there could be no accident within the coverage provision of the policy.
by the time of the hearing on the motion respondents agreed the term accident was not defined in the insurance policy and agreed common law construction of the term accident is read into insurance policies as a matter of law.on the issue whether mitchell acted in,respondents urged the trial court to decide as a matter of law mitchell had not been acting in,and thus not accidentally,when he intentionally and deliberately punched nazemzadeh in the face.ultimately,the trial court adopted respondents arguments.the court found the injuries alleged in the underlying action were not the result of an accident and for this reason did not present a covered claim giving rise to a duty of defense.accordingly,the court granted respondents motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action.
jafari appeals from the adverse judgment.
discussion 
standard of review of a summary judgment.
summary judgment is properly granted where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.in the trial court,a defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.
if the party demonstrates the existence of a triable dispute with specific facts,subd.p by making a prima facie showing of the merit of the complaint,the motion must be denied.there is to be no weighing of evidence.citations.kids universe th at,d.moreover,equally conflicting evidence requires denial of a summary judgment motion and a trial to resolve the dispute.citations.
we review the court ruling with these standards in mind.
ii.applicable standards in determining an insurer duty of defense and indemnification.
it has long been a fundamental rule of law that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.gray zurich insurance cal d at,see also,montrose chemical superior court cal th at,d.however,where there is no possibility of coverage,there is no duty to defend fire insurance exchange abbott d.gray and its progeny have made it clear that the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.gray,supra,cal d at,la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d,test is whether underlying action for which defense is sought potentially seeks relief within policy terms.
t he insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.facts merely tending to show that the claim is not covered,or may not be covered,but are insufficient to eliminate the possibility that resultant damages or the nature of the action will fall within the scope of coverage,therefore add no weight to the scales.any seeming disparity in the respective burdens merely reflects the substantive law.on the other hand,an insurer owes no duty of defense when the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.citation.
whether an insurer must indemnify an insured in a given third party action is an entirely different question.that duty requires a determination of actual coverage in some instances this duty may not be entirely clear until after trial of the underlying matter.for this reason an insurer has a duty to defend whenever the insurer ascertains facts which give rise to the possibility of coverage 
iii.allegations of the complaint asserting an assault and battery and facts extrinsic to the complaint indicating mitchell acted in raised the possibility of coverage under the policy.
the parties agree the issue in this appeal is whether the conduct giving rise to the injuries alleged in the third party suit constituted an accident a term not defined in the as to fall within the coverage provision of the policy.the parties further agree common law construction of the term accident is part of the policy as a matter of law where the parties disagree is whether under existing case law allegedly intentional conduct in is nevertheless deemed to be an accident within the coverage provision of the policy because provoked by the unexpected and unintended acts of the third party.we conclude it can.
any discussion of the matter must begin with the supreme court seminal decision in gray zurich insurance the issue before the supreme court in gray was whether the insurer had a duty to defend its insured in a third party action alleging the insured had committed an assault.the complaint in the underlying action alleged the insured had wilfully,maliciously,brutally and intentionally assaulted the victim.the insured notified the insurer of the suit.the insured claimed he had acted in and requested the insurer to undertake his representation in the matter.the policy at issue excluded coverage for bodily injury caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.the insurer refused to defend on the ground the complaint alleged an intentional tort which fell outside the coverage of the insured policy 
the gray court disagreed an insurer could properly determine its contractual obligations by simple reference to the allegations of a complaint.since modern procedural rules focus on the facts of a case rather than the theory of recovery in the complaint,the duty to defend should be fixed by the facts which the insurer learns from the complaint,the insured,or other sources.an insurer,therefore,bears a duty to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts which give rise to the potential of liability under the policy the court concluded the allegations of the complaint plus the information received from the insured regarding his claim of provided the insurer sufficient facts to trigger its duty to defend the underlying lawsuit.jones complaint clearly presented the possibility that he might obtain damages that were covered by the indemnity provisions of the policy.even conduct that is traditionally classified as intentional or wilful has been held to fall within indemnification coverage.moreover,despite jones pleading of intentional and wilful conduct,he could have amended his complaint to allege merely negligent conduct.further,plaintiff might have been able to show that in physically defending himself,even if he exceeded the reasonable bounds of,he did not commit wilful and intended injury,but engaged only in nonintentional tortious conduct.thus,even accepting the insurer premise that it had no obligation to defend actions seeking damages not within the indemnification coverage,we find,upon proper measurement of the third party action against the insurer liability to indemnify,it should have defended because the loss could have fallen within that liability.
lowell maryland casualty also involved a third party suit for assault and battery.the complaint in the underlying suit alleged the insured did unlawfully and maliciously assault,beat,strike and batter plaintiff,about the back,arms,head and body with great violence and without cause or provocation.the insured tendered defense of the suit to his insurer.the policy covered damages for bodily injury claims caused by accident.under the policy assault and battery were deemed to be accidents unless committed by or at the direction of the insured.the insurer refused to defend,concluding the allegations of the complaint alleged facts outside the policy coverage 
the supreme court held the facts gave rise to the potential for coverage and thus a duty to defend w e note that the gonzales action presented the potential of liability under the policy the insurer could not justify its refusal to defend upon the ground that the bare pleadings asserted an assault and battery and therefore precluded indemnification coverage.in an action for assault and battery a probable or possible issue of may always arise.as we have explained in gray,even if the insured conduct may traditionally be classified as an intentional or wilful tort,many cases have held that such conduct falls within the indemnification coverage 
following gray and its progeny,the court of appeal in mullen glens falls insurance held a third party lawsuit alleging an intentional assault and battery raised the potential for coverage under an insuring clause covering accidents nearly identical to the clause in the case at bar.in mullen the insureds son allegedly got into a fight with a gas station attendant and struck the attendant with a tire iron.the gas station attendant brought suit against the insureds and their son alleging claims for negligence and the intentional torts of assault and battery.the policy stated coverage applied to damages as a result of bodily injury caused by an occurrence.an occurrence,as in the present case,was defined as an accident neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.glens falls denied a defense based on the allegations of the complaint alleging intentional conduct and the insurer erroneous belief the underlying suit involved use of an automobile.a second insurer assumed responsibility for the insureds defense and filed an answer alleging the insureds son had acted in 
in a later coverage action against glens falls the court of appeal held the underlying suit raised the potential for coverage and thus the insurer had breached its duty to defend.w hen glens falls denied the insureds son a defense it had information in its possession which showed that the operation and use of an automobile had no causal connection with plaintiff injuries citations and that the alleged injuries were the result of a fight for all the insurance company could have known at that time,plaintiff started the fight and was struck by the insureds son in.it is now settled that injuries resulting from acts committed by an insured in are not intended or expected within the meaning of those terms as customarily used in an exclusionary clause like the one involved in the present case.citations.
the mullen court explained when a policy excludes from coverage injuries which are expected or intended courts construe this policy language merely to exclude from coverage injuries and damage resulting from acts involving an element of wrongfulness or misconduct,even though the acts otherwise are performed intentionally.
the decision in walters american insurance is another decision involving an assault and battery where the insured agreed he had struck the plaintiff intentionally in.the insurer,as in this case,contended the motive was irrelevant because the insured intentional act of striking the third party was sufficient to exclude coverage.the walters court disagreed.it found the insured motive of was in fact relevant to the question whether he acted wrongfully in the first instance.the court construed the phrase willful act in insurance code section prohibiting an insurer from indemnifying an insured for wrongful acts,as meaning something more blameworthy than ordinary negligence,and more than just an act performed intentionally.if plaintiff acted in then although he intended the act,plaintiff acted by chance and without a preconceived design to inflict injury a n element of wrongfulness or misconduct is connoted by an exclusion provision drafted as in the present case.such a construction would also be consonant with the public policy provision in section of the insurance code.acts committed in are not unlawful.
respondents attempt to distinguish these decisions by pointing out other case law definitions of the term accident in insurance policies do not encompass deliberate and intentional acts.respondents rely primarily on the definitions provided in the decisions in collin,mendez and quan.in each of these cases the insuring clause covered an occurrence defined as an accident,and each policy excluded from coverage bodily injury expected or intended by the insured.in collin american empire ins.we defined an accident as an unexpected,unforeseen,or an undesigned happening or consequence from either a known or unknown cause.alternatively,we said in collin an accident is something out of the usual course of events which happens suddenly and unexpectedly and without design.in merced mutual insurance mendez,the court considered,among others,the dictionary definition of accident,defined as something arising from extrinsic causes occurring unexpectedly or by chance or happening without intent or through carelessness.the quan truck insurance exchange court adopted and applied the definitions of accident used by the mendez court 
the decision in merced mutual insurance mendez on which respondents primarily rely,involved intentional and inherently wrongful acts,and is distinguishable on that ground alone.in mendez a third party complaint alleged acts of forcible oral copulation assault with the intent to commit forcible oral copulation.the insured admitted the sex acts but claimed they had been consensual.the court found the insured intent not to cause injury was immaterial because he intended to,and did,commit the intentional and unprovoked by any outside force.given the insured acts involved inherently harmful and illegal conduct the court further found his unilateral acts were not accidents for purposes of coverage under the policy 
the mendez court rejected the notion it was enough for the injury to have been unintended to be deemed an accident within the meaning of the insuring clause.in terms of fortuity foreseeability,both the means as well as the result must be unforeseen,involuntary,unexpected and unusual.unigard mut.ins.argonaut ins,we agree coverage is not always precluded merely because the insured acted intentionally and the victim was injured.an accident,however,is never present when the insured performs a deliberate act unless some additional,unexpected,independent,and unforeseen happening occurs that produces the damage.ibid.clearly,where the insured acted deliberately with the intent to cause injury,the conduct would not be deemed an accident.moreover,where the insured intended all of the acts that resulted in the victim injury,the event may not be deemed an accident merely because the insured did not intend to cause injury.conversely,an accident exists when any aspect in the causal series of events leading to the injury or damage was unintended by the insured and a matter of fortuity.
quan truck insurance is distinguishable on the same ground as it too involved a third party suit based on the insured inherently wrongful acts of sexual assault and rape.because the sexual assault was deliberate,the quan court concluded there was no accident within the meaning of the policy and thus no coverage.the court rejected the insured argument he had made a mistake and had acted negligently,rather than intentionally.negligent or not,in this case the insured conduct alleged to have given rise to claimant injuries is necessarily nonaccidental,not because any harm was intended,but simply because the conduct could not be engaged in by accident.the court also noted there were no facts to suggest a possible intervening force or other theory which could create coverage under the policy.in this case,there is no theory available on the facts expressed in the complaint or made known to the insurer from other sources under which the insured can be liable for physical injuries caused by accidentally touching,kissing,embracing or having sex with the claimant,nor is there any additional happening to combine with these necessarily deliberate acts so as to produce an accident giving rise to bodily injury.there is thus no potential liability for bodily injury caused by an occurrence and no duty to defend.
we find the definitions provided in these decisions do not foreclose the possibility acts in can be an accident and thus fall within the coverage provision of the policy.in construing the word accident in insurance policies these courts definitions support the finding acts in can be an accident where the third party actions provoking the response were the unforeseen and unexpected element in the causal chain of events making the insured acts in unplanned and involuntary.under these courts definitions,it is the unexpectedness of the third party actions which creates the accident within the meaning of the coverage clause.
in other words,in assault and battery cases the third party actions prompting an insured to act in are part of the causal chain of events leading to potential injury in the usual case the th
