the case before us presents another variation on the question when,under the abstention doctrines,a federal court should defer to state proceedings.the appellant is employers insurance of wausau wausau the appellee is roger sevigny,insurance commissioner of new hampshire commissioner,acting as liquidator of the home insurance company home,now insolvent.we begin with the background events and then describe the state court proceedings and the federal action now before us.
prior to its insolvency,home was an insurance company,incorporated and based in new hampshire,engaged both in providing insurance to customers and in reinsurance a reinsurer provides indemnity to another insurer for a share of payments made under one or more of the other insurer policies.home provided reinsurance,as did a related entity called international reinsurance usi re.
wausau is a wisconsin insurer,also engaged in both insurance and reinsurance.wausau is home reinsurer under several reinsurance agreements entered into in the the outwards agreements.under separate agreements,home and usi re became wausau reinsurers the inwards agreements.in the,quite possibly because home and usi re were encountering financial difficulties,wausau began to set is,reduce or cancel out amounts it owed to home under the outwards agreements against amounts it was owed by usi re under the inwards agreements.home is allegedly a percent reinsurer of usi re insurance obligations and the two companies apparently shared management at least in part.
home and usi re objected to the setoffs and,in,they arbitrated the matter with wausau.one issue raised was whether the debts owed to wausau by usi re and the credits owed to home by wausau being set off by wausau were mutual.home argued,inter alia,that there was no mutuality because wausau was offsetting the obligations of different entities wausau argued that there was mutuality because home completely reinsured all of usi re obligations.the arbitration panels,with minimal explanation,concluded that wausau setoffs were proper and valid.
on march,the new hampshire superior court of merrimack county on the petition of the issued a rehabilitation order with respect to home.on june,after the commissioner had determined that rehabilitation was futile,the superior court issued an order of liquidation and appointed the commissioner as home liquidator under.ann,i.
among many other things the order enjoined the setoff of any debt owing to the home provided,however,that notwithstanding anything in this order to the contrary,nothing herein is intended nor shall it be deemed to stay any right of setoff of mutual debts or mutual credits by reinsurers as provided in and in accordance with rsa.the statutory provision referred to states,with certain exceptions not applicable here,as follows 
mutual debts or mutual credits between the insurer and another person in connection with any action or proceeding under this chapter shall be set off and the balance only shall be allowed or paid 
the commissioner,on october,filed suit in the superior court seeking a judgment that,under the liquidation order and section quoted immediately above,setoffs only of mutual debts and credits were permissible a judgment that no mutuality exist ed for the setoffs in this case and any further relief deemed proper by the court.on november,wausau removed the case to federal district court,invoking jurisdiction based inter alia on diversity of citizenship as between wausau and commissioner.
the commissioner moved to remand under the burford and colorado river abstention doctrines.the former,derived from burford sun oil,requires in certain circumstances a federal court to abstain in favor of state processes where federal litigation would interfere with a state administrative scheme and where adequate state judicial review exists.colorado river water conservation district united states,d,represents a more amorphous abstention doctrine whose contours can be variously described.these are among various doctrines and statutory directions that permit,or sometimes require,federal court abstention 
seeking abstention and remand,the commissioner urged that new hampshire has a comprehensive and uniform liquidation scheme that would be disrupted by the intrusion of the federal court.wausau opposed,arguing first that the primary issue was its defense that the setoffs were proper because the arbitrators had determined them to be mutual,and more generally that a federal court decision in this case would not have the repercussions on home liquidation that the commissioner claimed it would.
on september,in an order by the magistrate judge to whom the case had been submitted,see c rule b b,the district court remanded the case to the state court,finding that abstention was proper under both the burford and colorado river doctrines.sevigny employers ins.of wausau,no.civ,wl,at,unpublished opinion.wausau has now appealed from the remand order,this being permissible under quackenbush allstate insurance,d.
the standard of review as to abstention decisions is sometimes said to be abuse of discretion.see dunn cometa,cir.but as we explained in cotter.ass of law enforcement officers,cir,abuse of discretion is sometimes a misleading phrase because d ecisions on abstract issues of law are always reviewed de novo and the extent of deference on law application issues tends to vary with the circumstances.in this case nothing appears to turn on the precise standard of review.
the burford doctrine is a set of variegated responses built around a central theme.the fundamental concern in burford is to prevent federal courts from bypassing a state administrative scheme and resolving issues of state law and policy that are committed in the first instance to expert administrative resolution.pub.serv.of patch,cir.burford itself involved a due process clause challenge in a federal court to a drilling permit issued by the texas agency charged with responsibility for such regulation.the supreme court endorsed abstention.
although the due process challenge raised a federal issue,the supreme court concluded even so that this issue was closely intertwined with complex issues of state law and policy,administered through an agency subject to state court review,so that interference was likely to cause more disruption than good.see burford,at.the federal due process issue could,of course,have been resolved in state court with possible further direct review in the supreme court itself.id.at.
a contrast is provided by new orleans public service,council of the city of new orleans nopsi,d.there,a city council order was challenged in federal court as inconsistent with a federal agency order issued by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc.id.at.the supreme court rejected burford abstention,see id.at,quite possibly concerned with a threat to the supremacy of the federal regulatory scheme if the meaning of the ferc order were left to state court interpretation on review of the city council order.
nopsi is sometimes viewed as cutting back on burford abstention,see,fragoso lopez,cir nopsi cabins the operation of the burford doctrine.yet nopsi also contains a general reformulation of burford,often quoted,that can be read expansively or narrowly and is ultimately ambiguous in any case,there is no supreme court precedent directly in point here in quackenbush the court faced a burford issue in an insurance liquidation case but disposed of it on grounds not relevant here.quackenbush,at.
circuit precedent is also of only limited help.one of our own cases,gonzalez media elements,cir,minimal abstention to be proper in matters involving insurance company liquidation,as have cases in other circuits more recently,we have issued a points the other way and purports to limit our earlier case in light of nopsi.in fragoso,the legal issue embedded in a federal court case involving a liquidating statute of limitations highly conventional and easily separable from the state reorganization scheme,at still,for various reasons,fragoso was a somewhat weaker case for abstention than our own.
so,without the help of clear governing precedent or a burford rule,we tur
