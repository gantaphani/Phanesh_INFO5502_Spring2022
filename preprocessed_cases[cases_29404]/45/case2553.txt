stuart brehm iv,appeals from the order of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend century insurance company demurrer to his second amended complaint for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.brehm contends the trial court misapplied the genuine dispute rule,which protects an insurer from a bad faith claim when its denial of benefits was asserted in good faith and on reasonable grounds,and neither the express policy provision that authorizes the insurer to arbitrate uninsured motorist um and underinsured motorist uim claims nor insurance code section,subdivision b which bars a cause of action for exercising the right to request arbitration of a claim under an insured coverage,precludes this action based on allegations century unreasonably failed to make a good faith effort to obtain a prompt,fair and equitable settlement of brehm claim for uim benefits.we agree with brehm on each of these points and,accordingly,reverse.
factual and procedural background 
brehm accident and demand for uim benefits 
according to the facts alleged in brehm second amended complaint brehm,his father and his mother were all seriously injured in an august traffic accident caused by natalie aguirre,who struck the rear of the brehm family chrysler concorde while it was stopped at a red light,waiting to make a left turn.in march brehm and his parents settled with aguirre insurance carrier for,her full policy limits brehm received each of his parents also received.
in april brehm made a written claim to century under the uim provision of the automobile insurance policy issued by century to his parents,which covered the family chrysler concorde and included brehm as an additional insured person.the policy,in effect at the time of the august accident,provided uim benefits of for one person and an additional in medical benefits.brehm submitted medical reports and assessments,bills and diagnostic test results to century that showed,as a result of the accident with aguirre,he had suffered among other injuries,a severe shoulder injury that would require costly surgery and related costs and expenses.
after the parties failed to reach an agreement on brehm issue apparently only being the extent of his injuries and thus the amount to which he was arbitration was scheduled for november.on september,brehm made a statutory demand for plus medical payments pursuant to code of civil procedure section.century rejected the demand on october,and made a counteroffer of plus previously paid medical benefits.in rejecting brehm demand,century stated its position,based on an evaluation conducted by its medical expert,joseph swickard,was that brehm injuries were limited to soft tissue and the surgeries recommended by brehm medical provider hafezi are not necessary.in his report swickard asserted brehm had only subjective complaints with no objective evidence of injury or problem.
to persuade century to pay a reasonable settlement,in brehm submitted to a truly independent medical examination by a highly credentialed orthopedic surgeon,ronald glousman.glousman report,provided to century on november,stated brehm had suffered a cervical strain,lumbar strain and right shoulder rotator cuff strain.glousman opined brehm needed further treatment and concluded it was more likely than not that surgery would be required on his right shoulder.glousman estimated the surgery would cost and physiotherapy approximately.
following a continuance of the november arbitration date to allow century to subpoena and review glousman records,brehm made a policy limit demand less the brehm had recovered from aguirre,plus in medical payments.in response century offered plus the balance of the full policy maximum of in medical payments.brehm rejected the counteroffer.on march,brehm received an arbitration award of the award was reduced by stipulation to the policy limit.century paid brehm the shortly after the award was made.
brehm lawsuit for breach of the implied covenant of good faith 
brehm filed a complaint against century on january,and,after the court sustained a demurrer,a first amended complaint on july,asserting causes of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract,alleging century had unreasonably failed to make a good faith effort to resolve brehm uim claim after its liability for payment of benefits was clear.on november,the trial court sustained century demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend,suggesting at the hearing that brehm needed to plead a sufficient factual basis for asserting the failure to settle his uim claim was the result of something more than a genuine dispute between the parties as to the amount of damages to which he was entitled.
on november,brehm filed his second amended complaint for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of contract and fraud.in addition to the factual allegations described above,brehm alleged the medical evidence in century possession at the time it rejected brehm policy limit demand and made a counteroffer showed its offer was extremely unrealistic century knew from the information it had received brehm was entitled to the full policy limits based on the injuries sustained in the accident with aguirre and also knew any fair arbitration would likely award that sum to brehm.nonetheless,century made an unreasonably low offer to delay paying his legitimate claim and in the hope of compelling him to accept less than the full amount he was due.brehm further alleged swickard,a nonpracticing professional expert witness,was known to the insurance industry to be biased in favor of the defense and was retained,not to objectively and fairly evaluate brehm shoulder injury,but with the intent that he minimize its seriousness to make it was a genuine dispute about the extent of that injury.indeed,contrary to swickard conclusion regarding subjective complaints with no objective evidence of injury or problem,his report actually noted brehm had demonstrated restricted motion and occasional crepitus a grating or crackling feeling or sound in the right shoulder that was not present on the left.yet swickard and century deliberately ignored these facts in order to deprive brehm of his contractual rights.
the trial court ruling sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend 
century demurred to the second amended complaint,insisting brehm had simply alleged a classic genuine dispute as to the value of a uim claim and arguing under chateau chamberay homeowners associated internat.ins.th,d chateau chamberay an insurer denying or delaying the payment of policy benefits due to the existence of a genuine dispute with its insured as to the amount of the claim can not be liable in bad faith.because century had relied upon the of its expert to evaluate brehm uim claim,its offer of an additional was reasonable as a matter of the fact the arbitrator ultimately agreed with brehm expert,not century.century also argued it had a right under the policy express terms to submit to arbitration its dispute with brehm concerning the damages due on his uim claim in opposition brehm argued the genuine dispute rule should not apply at the pleading stage of a case and,in any event,was inapplicable when an insurer selects its expert dishonestly or the expert performs unreasonably,as alleged in the second amended complaint.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend in an order that incorporated its written tentative ruling.the court found century had a contractual right to challenge the amount of loss claimed under its uim coverage and to submit any dispute with its insured over uim damages to arbitration.accordingly,brehm could not argue century had breached the contract as a result of properly exercising its rights under the contract.the court further ruled a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing necessarily requires that there be a breach of the underlying insurance contract.accordingly,because the court had concluded the breach of contract cause of action was without merit,the claim for breach of the implied covenant necessarily failed as well.quoting from chateau chamberay,supra,th at page,d,that there can be no bad faith liability imposed on the insurer for advancing its side of a genuine dispute,the trial court also ruled the second amended complaint contained insufficient factual allegations that century actions were done for any malicious reason other than advancing its side of that dispute.
the court february,minute order sustaining century demurrer without leave to amend also states,o n oral motion of defendant p ursuant to section f of the california code of civil procedure the case is hereby ordered dismissed.the minute order is signed by the court or at least stamped with a replica of the trial judge signature,making it an appealable order under code of civil procedure section brehm filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions 
insisting his second amended complaint properly pleaded a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing brehm contends the trial court erred in concluding a claim for insurance bad faith requires the insured to separately allege a breach of an express term of the policy and misapplied the genuine dispute rule of chateau chamberay,supra,th,d to his claim,which alleges the insurer dishonestly selected its expert,who then deliberately failed to conduct a fair evaluation of brehm medical condition.brehm also contends neither century contractual right to compel arbitration of an unresolved claim nor section,subdivision b,which bars a cause of action for exercising the right to request arbitration of such a claim,precludes a bad faith action based on the insurer improper,handling of the claim.

breach of an express contract term is not a prerequisite to maintaining an action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
california law recognizes in every contract,including insurance policies,an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.wilson century ins.cal th,d,wilson gruenberg aetna ins.cal d.in the insurance context the implied covenant requires the insurer to refrain from injuring its insured right to receive the benefits of the insurance agreement.egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d.t he covenant is implied as a supplement to the express contractual covenants,to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct that frustrates the other party rights to the benefits of the agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.
as a general rule,as the trial court recognized,there can be no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if no benefits are due under the policy t he covenant is based on the contractual relationship between the insured and the insurer absent that contractual right to policy benefits,the implied covenant has nothing upon which to act as a supplement,and should not be endowed with an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,see love fire ins.exchange d.however,as this court held in schwartz state farm fire casualty th,d,the principle that no breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can occur if there is no coverage or potential for coverage under the policy is quite different from the argument that no breach of the implied covenant can occur if there is no breach of an express contractual provision b reach of a specific provision of the contract is not a necessary prerequisite to a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing e ven an insurer that pays the full limits of its policy may be liable for breach of the implied covenant if improper claims handling causes detriment to the insured.schwartz,at,d accord,carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,d,breach of a specific provision of the contract is not a necessary prerequisite to an action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith w ere it otherwise,the covenant would have no practical meaning,for any breach thereof would necessarily involve breach of some other term of the contract see also careau security pacific business credit,d.allegations of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing must show that the conduct of the defendant,whether or not it also constitutes a breach of a consensual contract term,demonstrates a failure or refusal to discharge contractual responsibilities.
thus,in waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th,d,in language particularly apt to the case at bar in light of brehm allegations of improper conduct by century,the supreme court explained an insurer obligations extend beyond simply paying the benefits to which its insured is entitled w hen benefits are due an insured,delayed payment based on inadequate or tardy investigations,oppressive conduct by claims adjusters seeking to reduce the amounts legitimately payable and numerous other tactics may breach the implied covenant because they frustrate the insured right to receive the benefits of the contract in prompt compensation for losses.waller,at,d,see wilson,supra,cal th at,d,w hen the insurer unreasonably and in bad faith withholds payment of the claim of its insured,it is subject to liability in tort gruenberg aetna ins,supra,cal d at,under implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing insurer owes its insured a duty not to withhold unreasonably payments due under a policy.similarly,the supreme court in comunale traders general ins.cal d,held the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires the insurer to settle in an appropriate case although the express terms of the policy do not impose such a duty.breach of the implied obligation to accept a reasonable offer to settle a claim against its insured exposes the insurer to liability in both contract and tort,regardless of its fulfillment of the express terms of the insurance policy.see johansen california state auto.bureau cal d,archdale american internat.specialty lines ins.th,d although record reflects insurer fully performed express contractual promises made in its defend its insured and to pay the full policy limit on account of the judgment entered in the underlying judgment improperly entered on claim insurer breached its implied obligation to accept a reasonable settlement offer.
century essentially concedes the trial court erred in sustaining its demurrer on this ground,acknowledging a cause of action may lie for breach of an implied covenant in the absence of an express breach of contract.instead,it urges alternative grounds for affirming the trial court order bd.of medical examiners cal d,ruling or decision,itself correct in law,will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason,including the argument,discussed in section,below,that no cause of action will lie for breach of an implied covenant that is expressly contradicted by the terms of the contract.
the genuine dispute rule does not protect an insurer whose position is not maintained in good faith and on reasonable grounds 
a delay in payment of benefits due under an insurance policy gives rise to tort liability only if the insured can establish the delay was unreasonable.wilson,supra,cal th at,d,frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange cal d.as a close corollary of that principle,it has been said that an insurer denying or delaying the payment of policy benefits due to the existence of a genuine dispute with its insured as to the existence of coverage liability or the amount of the insured coverage claim is not liable in bad faith even though it might be liable for breach of contract.wilson,at,d,quoting chateau chamberay,supra,th at,d.relying on chateau chamberay,the trial court accepted century argument that the second amended complaint merely alleged a genuine dispute between brehm and his medical experts,on the one hand,and century and its medical expert,on the other hand,and thus was insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant.
century attempts to support the trial court ruling sustaining its demurrer on this ground,first,by reviewing case law holding bad faith liability can not be predicated on the insurer mistake or even negligence see,state farm fire casualty superior court th,d criticized on another ground in communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,plaintiff must establish insurer denial or delay in paying benefits was prompted not by an honest mistake,bad judgment or negligence but rather by a conscious and deliberate act fraley allstate ins.th,d w here the parties rely on expert opinions,even a substantial disparity in estimates of the value of the insured claim does not,by itself,suggest the insurer acted in bad faith and,then,by emphasizing its settlement offer of plus the remaining sum available under the medical payment limits,together with the brehm received from aguirre carrier,would have given brehm essentially the sum his expert had opined was needed for shoulder surgery and physiotherapy.thus,whether viewed from the perspective of its own medical expert,swickard,who had opined there was no need for surgery and no objective evidence of any injury or problem at all,or brehm expert,glousman,century position was,as a matter of law,objectively reasonable or,at the very least,the product of a good faith dispute as to the value of brehm claim.finally,century insists,because its settlement offer was objectively reasonable,brehm allegations about its subjective intent in hiring swickard to evaluate brehm medical condition are irrelevant.see calfarm ins.krusiewicz th,d i f the conduct of the insurer in denying coverage was objectively reasonable,its subjective intent is irrelevant but see wilson,supra,cal th at,d,an insurer is entitled to summary judgment based on a genuine dispute over coverage or the value of the insured claim only where the summary judgment record demonstrates the absence of triable issues citation as to whether the disputed position upon which the insurer denied the claim was reached reasonably and in good faith.
century summary of the governing case law fails to acknowledge an important limitation on the genuine dispute rule or to recognize the significance of the trial court dismissal of brehm bad faith claim while it was still at the pleading stage.in wilson,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court emphasized the genuine dispute rule can not be invoked to protect an insurer denial or delay in payment of benefits unless the insurer position was both reasonable and reached in good faith the genuine dispute rule does not relieve an insurer from its obligation to thoroughly and fairly investigate,process and evaluate the insured claim.a genuine dispute exists only where the insurer position is maintained in good faith and on reasonable grounds.id.at,d,see id.at,fn,d,i n the insurance bad faith context,a dispute is not legitimate unless it is founded on a basis that is reasonable under all the circumstances.the wilson decision,moreover,simply confirms the caution voiced by division three of this court in chateau chamberay,supra,th at page,d,that an expert testimony will not automatically insulate an insurer from a bad faith claim based on a biased investigation.
in wilson,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court affirmed this court judgment reversing the trial court grant of summary judgment to century,holding plaintiff reagan wilson had demonstrated a triable issue of fact as to whether century decision to deny her uim claim was made unreasonably and in bad faith.id.at,d.although century ultimately paid its full policy limits on wilson uim arbitration proceedings were sued for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing alleging century initial denial of benefits had not been made in good faith and the resulting delay until the claim was paid caused her damage lost interest,attorney fees and costs and emotional distress.wilson had submitted medical evidence to century indicating she had suffered a neck injury due to her recent automobile accident with an underinsured motorist.without contacting wilson orthopedist,having its own physician review the submitted medical records or arranging for wilson to be examined by another physician,century claims examiner denied the claim on the ground,wilson pain was due only to soft tissue injury superimposed by a preexisting degenerative disc disease.ibid.although the supreme court acknowledged that in some cases review of the insured submitted medical records might reveal an indisputably reasonable basis to deny the claim without further investigation id.at,d,reviewing the summary judgment record before it,the court concluded a jury could reasonably find that nothing in the material the claims examiner had received justified his conclusions u nder the facts of this case a triable issue of fact exists as to whether it was reasonable to deny wilson claim on the grounds stated without further medical investigation.see id.at,d,t he summary judgment record demonstrates the existence of triable issues of fact as to whether,before rejecting wilson uim claim in july,century thoroughly investigated and fairly evaluated the claim.
wilson is distinguishable from the case at bar,of course,because century did have brehm examined by swickard following brehm submission of his medical information and it was swickard,not a claims examiner,who asserted brehm did not need surgery and had only subjective complaints with no objective evidence of injury or problem.but brehm has alleged that swickard examination was a sham that he was retained by century with the intention he prepare a report that falsely minimized the seriousness of brehm injury precisely so that century could argue there was a genuine dispute as to the value of the claim and that swickard did exactly as he was expected to do.although his examination revealed restricted motion and occasional crepitus in the right shoulder,swickard allegedly ignored those objective well as the medical evidence submitted by concluded without any factual basis brehm had not suffered any significant shoulder injury in the automobile accident and would not require future surgery.although we may entertain some skepticism as to the nature of the competent and credible proof brehm will be able to offer in support of these allegations,the issue before us is not whether his evidence will be sufficient but whether his allegations of intentional misconduct and bad faith are.under wilson,supra,cal th,d,and chateau chamberay,supra,th,d,the answer to that limited question,inescapably,is yes.see wilson,at,d,genuine dispute rule does not protect insurer who fails to fairly investigate and evaluate its insured claim chateau chamberay,at,d insured biased investigation claim should go to jury when insurer experts were unreasonable.
brehm bad faith claim also differs from wilson because century did not deny his uim claim.indeed,century asserts its relatively modest offer of plus remaining medical benefits totaling something less than,although much lower than the ultimate arbitration award,was sufficient to cover the projected medical expenses identified by glousman and,therefore,could not have been made in bad faith as a matter of law.brehm second amended complaint,however,alleges the amount offered by century was unreasonably low in light of the medical evidence in its possession at that time.moreover,brehm notes that,even if century offer,together with the aguirre settlement,would cover future medical expenses as estimated by glousman,it provided nothing at all for past expenses,lost earnings or pain and suffering,all items recoverable in an action against aguirre and,therefore,covered by the uim provisions of his parents policy.the reasonableness of century settlement counteroffer at the time it was made is simply not a question that can be resolved at the pleading stage see shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,d o rdinarily,the question whether the insurer has acted unreasonably in responding to a settlement offer is a question of fact to be determined by the jury walbrook ins.liberty mutual ins.th,d same.
century contractual right to arbitrate uim claims does not relieve it from its obligation to deal with its insured in good faith 
the century policy expressly grants the parties the right to arbitrate any dispute regarding a um or uim claim if we and a person insured do not agree as to whether he or she is legally entitled to recover damages from an uninsured motorist or the amount of such damages,then upon written demand of either,the disagreement shall be submitted to a single neutral arbitrator for decision in accordance with the law of california.in sustaining the demurrer to brehm breach of contract claim,the trial court,after quoting this provision,ruled,p er the foregoing,defendant properly exercised its rights under the contract since the contract specifically notes that in the event of a dispute between the parties re damages,such damages shall be determined by an arbitrator.that is exactly what happened per the contract.
echoing this conclusion,century posits a simple syllogism it had a contractual right to arbitrate brehm uim claim.the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can not prohibit a contracting party from doing that which is expressly permitted by the agreement itself here,the insurance policy.carma developers cal,marathon development california,supra,cal th at,d,as to acts and conduct authorized by the express provisions of the contract,no covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be implied which forbids such acts and conduct.and if defendants were given the right to do what they did by the express provisions of the contract there can be no breach.see tanner title insurance trust cal d,see also wolf walt disney pictures television th,d.accordingly,its decision to seek arbitration can not possibly constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
century deceptively simple analysis fundamentally misconceives the relevant inquiry.the issue is not whether,having failed to reach an agreement with brehm as to the extent of his injuries and,therefore,the value of his uim claim,century had an absolute right to demand whether century had an implied obligation to honestly assess brehm claim and to make a reasonable effort to resolve any dispute with him as to the amount of his damages before invoking that right.an insurer duty to thoroughly investigate and fairly evaluate its insured uim claim,so forcefully recognized in wilson,supra,cal th at pages to,d,has no meaning unless the answer to that question is yes.see interinsurance exchange of the automobile club th,d although insurer is not necessarily obligated to accept its insured reasonable settlement offer,it has duty to act reasonably regarding the payment of benefits due under the uim provision of its policy.
indeed,by making lack of agreement as to the value of the claim an express precondition to demanding arbitration,the policy itself contemplates the parties will first make an affirmative effort to resolve their dispute,in effect creating a contractual duty to discuss the claim to which the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing properly attaches.the implied covenant imposes on a contracting party not only a duty to refrain from acting in a manner that frustrates performance of the contract but also the duty to do everything that the contract presupposes that he will do to accomplish its purpose.pasadena live llc city of pasadena th,d theatre company agreement to pay for renovation of facility,with payments to be credited against license fees for use of facility in future,contemplated theatre company would submit applications for approval of events city refusal to consider such events supports claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing see coleman engineering north american aviation,cal d,contract provision permitting change orders subject to an equitable adjustment in price and time of performance mutually satisfactory to buyer and seller necessarily implied an obligation to discuss the matters and negotiate in good faith based on implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing copeland baskin robbins th,d parties may enter into a binding contract to negotiate an agreement when the parties are under a contractual compulsion to negotiate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing attach es,as it does in every contract.century express contractual right to resolve any remaining disputes by arbitration is not inconsistent with its implied obligation to attempt in good faith to reach agreement with its insured prior to arbitration.
insurance code section,subdivision b,does not immunize an insurer from tort liability for bad faith handling of a uim claim 
the contractual provision for arbitration of um and uim claims disputes in century policy is mandated by the statutory scheme requiring um and uim coverage.section,subdivision a,originally enacted in stats,ch,requires all automobile insurance liability policies include coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death caused by a collision with an uninsured or underinsured motorist.see mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d.section,subdivision f,provides,the policy or an endorsement added thereto shall provide that the determination as to whether the insured shall be legally entitled to recover damages,and if so entitled,the amount thereof,shall be made by agreement between the insured and the insurer or,in the event of disagreement,by arbitration.
in the legislature expanded the scope of mandatory um and uim coverage by adding section to the insurance code,requiring insurers to offer coverage for property damage caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists to policyholders without collision coverage,subd.a and to offer additional first dollar coverage that would waive the deductible on collision insurance when the insured has been struck by an uninsured or underinsured motorist,subd.a.see stats,ch.as originally enacted,section,subdivision b,provided for payment of um and uim claims under the new property damages provisions in subdivision a and when the insured satisfied certain reporting requirements and it is determined by the insured and insurer or,in the event of disagreement,by arbitration that the insured is legally entitled to recover the amount of such payments for property damage from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle.the following sentence provided,no cause of action shall exist against either an insured or insurer from exercising the right to request arbitration of a claim under this section or section.
describing this second sentence of section,subdivision b which has not been modified since its adoption in a grant of complete immunity for its decision to arbitrate brehm uim claim,century argues brehm cause of action for breach of the implied covenant and good faith necessarily fails.a similar argument was considered and rejected by division three of this court in hightower farmers ins.exchange th,d under farmers interpretation of the statute,an insurer could stonewall uninsured motorist claimants in every case but avoid bad faith liability through the simple act of requesting arbitration and refusing to pay until ordered to do so by an arbitrator.we can not ascribe such an intent to the legislature.giving insurance code section,subdivision b a reasonable interpretation,one which does not fly in the face of statutory and decisional law concerning an insurer duties citations,the enactment simply declares that the bare act of requesting arbitration of an uninsured motorist claim,without more,is not actionable.where there is no issue reasonably to be resolved by arbitration the failure to attempt to effectuate a prompt and fair settlement violates the insurer statutory duties citation and gives rise to tort liability.similarly,an insurer can not shield other dilatory conduct,such as failing to investigate a claim,by the mere act of requesting uninsured motorist arbitration.
despite the fact hightower farmers ins.exchange,supra,th,d has not been questioned by any appellate court in the years since it was decided,century insists it is wrong and urges us to read section,subdivision b,as creating a broad rule of immunity that permits an insurer to avoid bad faith liability arising from its handling of a um or uim claim simply by requesting arbitration.section,according to century,bars any cause of action based on a party or exercise its statutory right to arbitration.the legislature provided this blanket immunity as a way to ensure the continuing viability of the unique mandatory arbitration scheme contained in the statute.by limiting section,subdivision b,to reasonable requests for arbitration by an insurer,century argues,hightower ignores both the plain language of the statute and the obvious intent of the legislature,impermissibly reads into the section an exception where none exists and renders its protection meaningless because,even without it,a reasonable request for arbitration,is not actionable.
we,of course,agree with century that the fundamental task of statutory interpretation is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.olson automobile club of southern california cal th,d,miklosy regents of the university of california cal th,d.we begin with the statutory language because it is generally the most reliable indication of legislative intent.miklosy,at,d.but i t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.people pieters cal d,see wedemeyer safeco ins.of america th,d w e must give the statute a reasonable interpretation,avoiding,if possible,a literal interpretation which will lead to an absurd result.moreover,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.pieters,at,see stone street capital,llc california state lottery comm.th,d w e presume that the legislature,when enacting a statute,was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.
the primary flaw in century narrow and literal reading of the second sentence of section,subdivision b,is that it disregards the preceding sentence of the subdivision concerning arbitration of collision damage claims in cases,as well as the comparable mandatory arbitration language in section,subdivision f.neither provision grants the insurer the unfettered right to demand arbitration as soon as a claim is filed both obligate the insurer to attempt to reach an agreement with its insured before it may invoke arbitration as a means of resolving any disagreement.section,subdivision f,requires any questions concerning liability or the amount of damages to be decided by agreement between the insured and the insurer only in the event of disagreement may the dispute be resolved by arbitration.similarly,under section,subdivision b,arbitration is available in the event of disagreement between the insurer and the insured as to whether the insured is legally entitled to recover the property damages sought.this duty to attempt to agree before arbitrating,clearly imposed by the legislature,invokes a corresponding duty to do so in good faith.wilson,supra,cal th at,d,frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange,supra,cal d at,see,subd.h unfair business practice for insurer not to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt,fair,and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.
but,century protests,if it faces potential tort liability for acting unreasonably regarding the payment of um and uim benefits due under its is,for failing to conduct a thorough investigation or fair evaluation of its insured claim before denying it and proceeding to section,subdivision b language that no cause of action shall exist from exercising the right to request arbitration provides no protection at all,impermissibly rendering the statute nugatory,inoperative and meaningless.century concern that our agreement with the analysis and conclusion in hightower farmers ins.exchange,supra,th,d will frustrate the legislature scheme for resolving um and uim disputes is misplaced.
as century suggests,although the legislative history is silent on this point,it is plausible the second sentence in section,subdivision b,was enacted in response to the supreme court landmark decision five years earlier in neal farmers ins.exchange cal d,neal in a decision the court in neal affirmed an award of compensatory damages approximately and punitive damages approximately against an insurer for its bad faith refusal to pay its insured,by way of settlement,the full um benefits to which she was entitled under her policy,finding abundant evidence,a good deal of it conflicting,on the subject of defendant conduct and motives in delaying payment,through completion of arbitration,as part of a conscious course of conduct,firmly grounded in established company policy,designed to utilize the lamentable circumstances in which neal and her family found themselves,and the exigent financial situation resulting from it,as a lever to force a settlement more favorable to the company that the facts would otherwise have warranted.id.at.writing for the court,justice manuel reiterated that the duty of an insurer to accept reasonable settlements of third party claims against its insured is but one aspect of its obligation to act fairly and in good faith in discharging its contractual responsibilities to its insured.another aspect of that obligation is the duty of the insurer to act fairly and in good faith in handling claims submitted by its insured,which we have characterized as a duty not to withhold unreasonably payments due under a policy.citation.w hen an insurer fails to deal fairly and in good faith with its insured by refusing,without proper cause,to compensate its insured for a loss covered by the policy,such conduct may give rise to a cause of action in tort for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at.
justice richardson in his dissenting opinion explained the insurer had offered its insured,neal,a percent settlement,in contrast to her demand for full um benefits,and stated,in his view,the question of bad faith was very close based on the serious question whether there was any negligence on the part of the uninsured motorist and,therefore,whether neal,who had been severely injured,was entitled to any payment at all under the general um coverage.neal,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of richardson.justice richardson also objected to the analysis by which the punitive damage award was justified by the majority,but did not question the basic legal principles described by the majority concerning the insurer duties to act in good faith in handling a um claim if the uninsured motorist carrier has acted unreasonably,damages,including punitive damages,are entirely proper id.at,dis.opn.of richardson.justice clark concurred in justice richardson dissenting opinion but wrote separately to comment that t he majority holding,that a first party insurer may not guess wrong,effectively abolishes the present statutory scheme for handling uninsured motorist claims.we may anticipate arbitration,pursuant to insurance code section,will no longer be used to resolve these disputes because the penalty for losing in arbitration will be an automatic second proceeding in superior court for bad faith breach of the insurance policy.thus,all claims must necessarily be paid regardless of how frivolous.id.at,dis.opn.of clark.
in adopting the no cause of action shall exist language in section,subdivision b,the legislature may well have been mindful of the concern voiced by justice clark in his dissenting opinion in neal that an insurer should not be penalized for guess ing wrong and losing an,if so,it is surely odd that the neal decision is n
