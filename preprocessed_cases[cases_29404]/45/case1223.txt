vanessa absher and lynda mitchell sued momence meadows nursing center,and its owner and operator,jacob graff collectively momence.they sought damages for themselves and on behalf of the united states and the state of illinois for alleged violations of the federal false claims act fca,et,and the illinois reward and protection act iwrpa,ilcs et.the health care industry liability insurance program healthcap filed this action seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend momence in that lawsuit under a commercial general liability policy it had issued to momence.the district court found that healthcap had no duty to defend momence,and momence appeals.we affirm.
vanessa absher and lynda mitchell are former employees at momence nursing center.in their third amended complaint which we will refer to hereafter as the underlying complaint,absher and mitchell sought treble damages for exposing thousands of false charges momence submitted to medicare and medicaid.their theory of recovery was predicated on the statutory requirement that medicare and medicaid providers may not submit claims for services that failed to meet professionally recognized standards of health care.a.according to absher and miller,momence violated that requirement by certifying on its annual cost reports that it was meeting the required standard of care when,in fact,momence management knew that it was not.
the underlying complaint provides detailed allegations of how momence was not meeting the standard of care for medicare and medicaid.it alleges,for instance,that momence failed to maintain the minimum staffing levels for nurse and nurse assistants,failed to ensure its residents received their medications as prescribed by their physicians,failed to ensure residents received adequate nutrition and assistance with meals,and failed to provide the residents with clean and dry beds,clothes,and regular baths.the underlying complaint devotes several pages to further elaborating these alleged failures.included in those pages is a detailed description of the resulting injuries patients suffered from momence substandard care,such as scabies,sepsis,seizures,and death.
the underlying complaint sets forth four counts.in count one,the plaintiffs seek statutory and treble damages under the fca for momence submission of false claims to the united states.in count two,they seek statutory and treble damages under the iwrpa for momence submission of false claims to the state of illinois.in counts three and four,absher and mitchell seek damages under the provisions of the fca and iwrpa,respectively.mitchell claims that momence terminated her in retaliation for complaining to momence management about the failures to provide adequate care.absher alleges constructive discharge for the same reason.
as absher and mitchell suit proceeded,healthcap brought this action seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify momence in the underlying suit based on a commercial general liability policy healthcap issued to momence in.that policy provides momence with multiple lines of coverage.relevant to this appeal are the commercial general liability coverage cgl coverage and the professional liability coverage pl coverage the cgl coverage has two separate coverage sections,cgl coverage a which provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage,and cgl coverage b which addresses personal and advertising injury liability.in addition,the cgl coverage contains an practices exclusion applicable to both cgl coverage a and cgl coverage 
approximately a year after filing suit,healthcap moved for summary judgment,arguing that it had no duty to defend or indemnify momence.in a comprehensive opinion,the magistrate judge held that healthcap had no duty to defend momence.the court further held that the issue of indemnification was not ripe for consideration because momence had yet to incur any liability in the underlying action.it therefore dismissed the action without prejudice with leave for momence to reinstate the suit after the underlying proceedings became final and liability had been determined.momence appeals.
on appeal,momence asserts that the magistrate judge erred in concluding that healthcap had no duty to defend it in the underlying litigation.we review the lower court grant of summary judgment,as well as its construction of the commercial general liability policy,de novo.lyerla amco ins,cir.since this is a diversity action,state law applies.rli ins.conseco,cir.the parties proceed under the assumption that illinois law applies so will we.
momence first argues that the magistrate judge opinion contain s an inherent inconsistency requiring reversal.according to momence,the inconsistency is the lower court granting of summary judgment on the duty to defend while postponing judgment on the duty to indemnify.if there really were no duty to defend,momence points out,then the magistrate judge would have held that there was no duty to indemnify either,since the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.basf ag great am.assur,cir applying illinois law.but because the lower court left open the question of indemnification,momence reads the magistrate judge action as admitting that a possibility still exists that the policy covers the underlying suit.and because the possibility of coverage triggers the duty to defend,see,gibraltar cas.sargent lundy,d,momence therefore argues that the lower court wrongly held that healthcap had no duty to defend.
the inherent inconsistency momence believes is present in the magistrate decision is of no moment to us.where,as here,the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,a finding of no duty to defend necessarily precludes a finding of a duty to indemnify.as the illinois supreme court stated in crum forster resolution trust 
in cases such as the instant case where no duty to defend exists and the facts alleged do not even fall potentially within the insurance coverage,such facts alleged could obviously never actually fall within the scope of coverage.under no scenario could a duty to indemnify arise.clearly,where there is no duty to defend,there will be no duty to indemnify 
internal citations omitted see also sokol atl.mut.ins,cir since the claim at issue in crum forster did not even potentially fall within the scope of coverage for purposes of the duty to defend,it logically followed that the claim would not actually fall within the scope of coverage for purposes of the duty to indemnify.
in this case,just as in crum forster,the duty to defend subsumes the duty to indemnify holding that an insurer has no duty to indemnify therefore follows inexorably from holding that an insurer has no duty to defend.accordingly,if the magistrate judge properly ruled that healthcap did not have a duty to defend,healthcap was likewise entitled to summary judgment on the issue of indemnification.we need not consider the issue any further,however,because healthcap has not.see greenlaw united states,d i t takes a to justify a remedy in favor of an appellee.
that brings us back to the duty to defend,the sole issue on appeal.illinois courts determine an insurer duty to defend by comparing the allegations in the underlying complaint to the relevant provisions of the insurance policy.outboard marine,at.an insurer is obligated to defend its insured if the underlying complaint contains allegations that potentially fall within the scope of coverage.lyerla,at citing agents ins.of,midwest sporting goods.in other words,if any portion of the suit potentially falls within the scope of the coverage,the insurer is obligated to defend.valley forge ins.swiderski,noting that insurer has duty to defend even if only one of several theories of recovery alleged in the complaint falls within the potential coverage of the policy.an insurer may refuse to defend only if it is clear from the face of the underlying complaint that the allegations set forth in the complaint fail to state facts that bring the case within,or potentially within,the coverage of the policy.id.
momence argues that the allegations contained in counts one and two of the underlying fca claims and their iwrpa fall within the scope of the pl coverage and the cgl coverage.as quoted above,the pl coverage obligates healthcap to defend any suit seeking damages because of an injury that is caused by a medical incident arising out of the providing or withholding of various professional services,including medical or nursing treatment.momence points to the allegations of physical harm to the residents incorporated in counts one and two as the injury.that physical harm to the residents arose out of a medical incident,momence asserts,because according to the underlying complaint it resulted from the provision of shoddy medical and nursing treatment.momence therefore concludes that the underlying complaint seeks damages because of the physical harm to the residents.as momence puts it,b ut for the inadequate care and resulting bodily injury,there would have been no lost services and no false claim s.
momence uses a similar chain of logic to place counts one and two potentially under the umbrella of cgl coverage a,which covers bodily injury and property damage.cgl coverage a obligates healthcap to pay those sums momence becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury and to defend momence against any suit seeking those damages.emphasis added.as with its pl coverage argument,momence claims that the injury to the residents is the essential foundation of counts one and two of the underlying complaint.without such injury,momence contends,the fca claims and the companion iwrpa claims would not have been brought.momence asserts that any damages that may result from counts one and two are therefore because of the bodily injury suffered by momence residents,thus triggering healthcap duty to defend.
rather than triggering the duty,that line of argument effectively bypasses it.the injuries to the residents as alleged by the plaintiffs relate back to momence cost reports to the government where it certified that it provided quality services and care.plaintiffs claim momence knew that was false.the statutory damages they seek result from those allegedly false filings,and not from any alleged bodily injury to the residents.although the allegations in the underlying complaint detailing the injuries suffered by momence residents put a human touch on the otherwise administrative act of false billing,they need not be proven by the plaintiffs to prevail.under the fca and the iwrpa,the plaintiffs do not have to show that any damages resulted from the shoddy care.see horizon paul fire marine ins,d,citing a liability under the fca is based solely upon the creation or presentation of false claims to the government,not upon the underlying conduct used to establish the falsity of such a claim,aff.cir.instead,all the plaintiffs need to show is that momence billed the government for services and a level of care that it knew it was not providing see united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,cir providing elements of fca claim see also scachitti ubs fin,noting the similarity between the fca and the iwrpa and finding case law on the fca instructive regarding the interpretation of the iwrpa.
other courts have recognized this distinction between the proof required for the fca claim and the conduct underlying the false claims.they uniformly hold that an insurer is not obligated to defend a qui tam suit merely because the insurer would have to defend the insured against a suit for damages resulting from the insured conduct underlying the qui tam action the case upon which momence principally relies,watts industries,zurich american insurance,th,d,does not hold to the contrary.although the underlying suit in watts began as a qui tam action on behalf of southern california municipalities,the municipalities themselves soon intervened.id.at.they asserted claims for damages on their own behalf against water systems manufacturers who allegedly sold the municipalities parts.in deciding that the manufacturers insurer had a duty to defend the suit under the property damage portion of the cgl policy,the court focused exclusively on the damages the municipalities sought the cost of replacing the substandard parts and the costs of future water quality monitoring.id.at.no mention was made of the qui tam claims they did not enter into the court analysis.
despite the lack of supporting precedent and a long line of cases holding to the contrary,momence nevertheless persists in pressing its position that the fca and iwrpa claims are at least potentially covered.momence points out that the factual allegations of the underlying complaint control,not the legal theory alleged.the underlying complaint contains a plethora of factual allegations detailing the residents personal injuries.based on those allegations,momence asserts that the suit must be covered by healthcap policy.
momence is correct that the factual allegations in the complaint,and not the legal labels a plaintiff uses,control.see,lexmark int l,transp.ins,d.but factual allegations are only important insofar as they point to a theory of recovery.see,usf g wilkin insulation,a n insurer has a duty to defend its insured if any theory of recovery alleges potential coverage.second emphasis added.emcasco ins.nw,d,noting that duty to defend arises if the insurance covers the liability on any set of facts consistent with the allegations needed to support recovery on any theory raised in the complaint emphases added.and it is impossible to construe the underlying complaint as raising any theory of recovery based on bodily injury.neither of the plaintiffs in the underlying suit seeks damages for personal injury caused by substandard medical care.nor could and mitchell were employees of momence,not residents,and they lack standing to sue on the residents behalf see basf ag,at kittay allstate ins,d.
momence makes two other arguments in favor of coverage,both of which lack merit.momence maintains that absher and mitchell claims of emotional distress in counts three and four the retaliation claims are properly classified as claims for bodily injury under cgl coverage a,which defines bodily injury as bodily injury,sickness or disease sustained by a person.momence attempts to sidestep illinois case law clearly holding to the contrary by contending that the policy itself classifies such claims as bodily injury.we need not describe in detail the tortured interpretation of the policy momence presents to support that assertion.for even if momence is correct that the policy counts emotional distress as bodily injury and it does practices exclusion forecloses coverage of any claims for damages arising from counts three and four of the underlying complaint.
specifically,that exclusion provides that the cgl coverage does not extend to any claim by a person arising out of any t ermination of that person employment or e practices,policies,acts or omissions,such as coercion,defamation,harassment,humiliation or discrimination directed at that person.emphases added.in counts three and four,mitchell and absher allege that momence retaliated against them because they had attempted to call to the attention of momence management the failure to provide the requisite level of care.they also allege that the retaliation culminated in momence terminating mitchell employment and constructively discharging absher.those allegations fall squarely within the practices exclusion.
momence arguments against the application of the exclusion are unconvincing.momence contends that absher allegations of constructive discharge do not amount to an employment practice because she left momence on her own.but a constructive discharge is the legal equivalent of a formal termination.state police suders,d,and a termination is unambiguously within the employment exclusion.moreover,constructive discharge is an allegation concerning an employer e practices,policies,acts or omissions and thus falls within the ambit of the practices exclusion.
momence also argues that the following allegation in count three falls outside of the practices exclusion momence meadows management faxed plaintiff absher letter of resignation to potential employers in an effort to prevent her from finding other emplo
