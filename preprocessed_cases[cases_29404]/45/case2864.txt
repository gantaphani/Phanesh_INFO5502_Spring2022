plaintiff martin morris appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of the paul revere life insurance company.morris alleged that revere acted in bad faith in denying his claim for benefits under his disability policy.the court granted summary judgment in favor of revere,concluding that its interpretation of the policy language and the california statute governing incontestability clauses in disability insurance policies was reasonable in light of the evolving state of the law.we agree and affirm the judgment.
revere issued disability policies to morris in and.among the policies coverage limitations was one for disabilities caused by a sickness or disease which first manifests itself after the date of issue and while your policy is in force.
the policies also included an incontestability clause,as required by california insurance code section,which provided a.after your policy has been in force for years,excluding any time you are disabled,we can not contest the statements in the application.no claim for loss incurred or disability that starts after years from the date of issue will be reduced or denied because a sickness or physical condition not excluded by name or specific description before the date of loss had existed before the date of issue.
the policies also included a provision ensuring conformity with state laws any provision of this policy which,on its date of issue,conflicts with the laws of the state in which you reside on that date is amended to meet the minimum requirements of such laws.
after the policies had been in effect for over two years,morris filed a claim for benefits,because of a disability resulting from multiple sclerosis ms.although revere initially paid benefits to morris for about six months under the policies,it subsequently notified him that it was denying further benefits on the ground that his ms was not a covered disease because it had manifested itself before the effective dates of the policies.
morris sued to obtain the benefits he claimed were owed to him.he also alleged that in light of the incontestability clause,revere had acted in bad faith in denying the claim.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of revere on the coverage issue,concluding that the undisputed evidence demonstrated morris ms had manifested itself prior to the date the policies had issued and was thus not a covered sickness.having agreed with revere on the coverage issue,the trial court had no occasion to address the allegation of bad faith.
morris appealed aprahamian paul revere life ins,and while that appeal was pending,our supreme court considered and decided the identical coverage issue in galanty paul revere life ins.cal th,d.in galanty,the court noted courts around the country had split on the issue.decisions interpreting substantially identical policy and statutory to whether a coverage provision excluding sicknesses which had manifested prior to the date of policy issuance was inconsistent with an incontestability clause that precluded an insurer from denying coverage on the ground the disease had gone both ways.
according to the supreme court,seven jurisdictions,led by the fifth circuit court of appeals in massachusetts casualty insurance forman cir,had found in favor of the insurer and concluded there was no conflict.galanty paul revere life ins,supra,cal th at,d.those courts reasoned that the manifestation of a disease referred to the point when the insured has reason to know of or discover the condition,whereas the existence of the disease referred to the point when it first took hold,without regard to whether the insured had any reason to suspect,or even could have discovered,its existence.as exemplified in forman,those courts held that distinguishing between those points gave the parties the benefit of their bargain and was consistent with the purposes of an incontestability clause the statutory incontestability clause protects both parties from uncertainty where coverage turns on when a disease first existed,occurred or arose.under such polices coverage may be uncertain even long after the policy was procured because a disease may exist but not be discoverable by reasonable medical investigation.this clause resolves the uncertainty in favor of coverage beginning two years after the policy date.where coverage turns upon manifestation rather than existence,the insurance policy itself eliminates this uncertainty because manifestation is normally discoverable by reasonable medical investigation.massachusetts casualty insurance forman,supra,at.
on the other hand,the supreme court noted nine other jurisdictions had ruled in favor of the insured,concluding the incontestability clause precluded the insurer from arguing a disease had once the incontestability period had commenced.galanty paul revere life ins,supra,cal th at,d.
finally,the supreme court stated there was only one published opinion on point in this state,mcmackin great american reserve ins.d.the mcmackin court had decided the issue in the insured favor,albeit without useful discussion.on the other hand,two other california appellate courts had decided the issue in the insurer favor,including the lower court in galanty,and the court in callahan mutual life ins.d,in which review was granted and the case held pending the galanty opinion.galanty paul revere life ins,supra,cal th at,d.
as part of a comprehensive review of the history and development of incontestability laws,the supreme court explained that the concept was first developed in the context of life insurance.as the incontestability law developed in that area,it was interpreted by some courts as wiping out the ability of insurers to place limits on the risks they undertook.in at least one case,the insurer had excluded death caused by air travel from coverage under the policy.when the insured later died in a plane crash,the court held that the exemption had been nullified when the policy became incontestable,and ordered the insurer to pay the benefits.jordon western states life ins.
other courts,recognizing the incongruity of such results,were careful to differentiate the concepts of coverage and incontestability.as explained by chief judge cardozo in metropolitan life ins.conway,the provision that a policy shall be incontestable after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of two years is not a mandate as to coverage,a definition of the hazards to be borne by the insurer.it means only this,that within the limits of the coverage,the policy shall stand,unaffected by any defense that it was invalid in its inception,or thereafter became invalid by reason of a condition broken.id.at.that opinion,described as very influential by our supreme court galanty paul revere life ins,supra,cal th at,d,inspired insurance law reforms designed to ensure that concepts of coverage and incontestability remained separate in the interpretation of life insurance policies.
it was in that context that insurers began to state laws began to clauses in disability policies as well.although the language of such clauses was substantially different from that found in life insurance policies galanty paul revere life ins,supra,cal th at,d,some courts nonetheless interpreted them in accordance with the principles developed in the life insurance cases.our supreme court unanimously concluded such an analysis was incorrect.
the court reasoned,the argument has serious flaws,beginning with the assumption on which it depends.in the present context,the assumption that an incontestability clause can not affect coverage is erroneous.the assumption,as noted,finds its origin in chief judge cardozo explanation that an incontestability clause is not a mandate as to coverage,a definition of the hazards to be borne by the insurer metropolitan life ins.conway,supra,at.this explanation makes perfect sense in its original context a conflict between an incontestability clause in a life insurance policy,providing simply that the policy shall be incontestable after two years,and a provision excluding coverage for a specific hazard,namely,travel by aircraft.ibid.but the proposition that no incontestability clause,r
