plaintiffs national casualty company and scottsdale indemnity company provided commercial general liability cgl and law enforcement insurance to edgar county,illinois,via a series of policies.in,gordon randy steidl sued edgar county and its former state attorney,michael mcfatridge for damages stemming from steidl conviction for murder,which a federal court overturned in.the district court held that national casualty company and scottsdale indemnity company have no obligation to defend or indemnify mcfatridge or the county under four insurance policies issued in,and.the county and mcfatridge appeal and we affirm.
background 
in,steidl was convicted in edgar county of murder.eventually,steidl appeals entered the federal system under.in june,the district court granted a writ of habeas corpus based on ineffectual counsel at the trial and sentencing in the state court.
steidl sued,under and illinois law,a number of officials involved in the prosecution,including illinois state police and paris police officers who had investigated the murders,and former edgar county state attorney michael mcfatridge,who was involved in the investigation and prosecution.steidl also named the county of edgar as a defendant and necessary party.
according to the complaint,mcfatridge,in cooperation with paris police,framed and falsely prosecuted steidl.the complaint says that mcfatridge coerced and threatened two key witnesses,induced them to testify falsely,and concealed numerous pieces of exculpatory evidence during the trial.steidl also claims that throughout the proceedings,even after mcfatridge left office in,he continued to coerce witnesses,lied about the evidence,and engaged in a publicity campaign defending the trial and steidl conviction.
steidl suit seeks damages for false arrest,false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the county tendered the suit to national and scottsdale,believing itself entitled to a legal defense and indemnification under each of four insurance policies the companies issued.the insurers responded by filing a declaratory judgment action,asking the court to determine that they had no duty to defend or indemnify the county under any of the policies.
there are four separate insurance policies at issue,each in effect at a different time a law enforcement liability policy issued by scottsdale insurance company was in effect from may,until may.it named county of edgar as the insured.in addition,three cgl issued by scottsdale indemnity company,and one issued by national casualty edgar county from july,until july.each of the three policies covered a period.
edgar county argued that the policies are at least ambiguous about whether they provide it or mcfatridge coverage for liability to steidl,and should be read against the drafters,in favor of a duty to defend.the district court granted summary judgment for the insurers.
first,the court found no coverage for mcfatridge under the law enforcement policy in effect from may through may because the state attorney was not a class c employee under that policy.in addition,while indicating that mcfatridge conduct during the proceedings suggests the possibility of coverage under the two cgl policies in effect in and early,the court pointed out that mcfatridge left office in.it held that the cgl policies did not cover acts by former officials or employees committed during the policy periods therefore,mcfatridge was not an insured under any of the three cgl policies.
edgar county appealed the district court decision and filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
in determining whether the insurance companies must provide former edgar county state attorney michael mcfatridge with legal defense liability arising from steidl prosecution and conviction,we look to illinois law,which the parties agree governs this dispute.indem.der travel,cir.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.del monte fresh produce,transp.ins,cir.
duty to defend 
an insurer duty to defend its insured is broader than its duty to indemnify.if an insurer has no duty to defend,it has no duty to indemnify.we determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend by examining the underlying complaint and the language of the insurance policy.agents ins.of,midwest sporting goods.any doubts as to whether particular claims fall within the policy are resolved in favor of coverage.del monte fresh produce,at.so if the complaint asserts facts within or potentially within policy coverage,an insurer is obligated to defend its insured.agents,at.on the other hand,an insurer may refuse to defend an action in which,from the face of the complaint,the allegations are clearly outside the bounds of the policy coverage.fid.guar.wilkin insulation.
each of the four policies in question provided occurrence coverage and name county of edgar or county of edgar as named insureds.coverage depends on whether the particular policy contemplated coverage for mcfatridge or the state attorney office,if it does,we ask whether any of the allegations in steidl complaint occurred during the coverage periods.
the county argues that as state attorney,mcfatridge was an insured under the law enforcement policy in effect from may until may.during that policy period,the complaint says that mcfatridge made false public statements about steidl guilt,coerced witnesses to prevent them from recanting false testimony and provided fabricated evidence to the court.according to the county,scottsdale has a duty to defend because mcfatridge was an insured under the law enforcement policy and is potentially liable for conduct within the policy period.and,in addition,even though he left office in,the county contends that cgl policies in effect from until require scottsdale and national to defend it and mcfatridge.it claims that mcfatridge is an insured under the third cgl policy because it contains an endorsement that lists persons who were your lawfully elected officials as covered under that policy alternatively,the county argues that mcfatridge participated in a conspiracy to deprive steidl of a fair trial,that began when he was a public official with edgar county and continued into the cgl policy periods.any conduct that occurred after mcfatridge left office was therefore part of a single continuing offense committed under mcfatridge authority as state attorney.this at least raises an ambiguity,according to the county,about whether a former official is an insured under the cgl policies for wrongful acts that continued into the policy period,because the course of conduct began when he was state attorney.
finally,the county suggests that,regardless of the state attorney status as an insured,the illinois local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act.comp.stat,requires it to reimburse the state attorney for its liability.if it is liable for acts mcfatridge took during the policy periods,the county argues that the insurers must provide a defense and indemnity.we address coverage under each argument in turn.
the law enforcement to defend 
because the law enforcement policy was in effect during mcfatridge tenure as state attorney and provides slightly different coverage,we discuss it separately from the three cgl policies.
scottsdale issued the law enforcement policy,which was in effect from may,until may.the law enforcement policy required scottsdale to pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay because of wrongful acts caused by an occurrence and arising out of the performance of the insured duties to provide law enforcement.app.at emphasis added.under that policy,the named insured and all full or and all auxiliary or volunteer law enforcement officers of the named insured.app.at.it defines occurrence as an event,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in personal injury sustained during the policy period.
we first address whether the law enforcement policy contemplated coverage for liability for the acts of mcfatridge in his role as state attorney.county of edgar is the named insured in the policy.the county defendants argue that whether or not county of edgar refers to the sheriff department is ambiguous and so should be read in favor of coverage for the county of edgar as a whole.however,an endorsement to the policy names county of edgar,il as an additional insured.the endorsement specifies that county of edgar is only an insured with respect to liability arising out of the activities of the named insured,or county of edgar looking at the type of insurance purchased,the nature of the risk involved,and the overall purpose of the contract,nicor,and gas ins.serv,in this case the provision of law enforcement coverage,we think the policy clearly contemplated county of edgar sheriff department as the named insured.the sheriff is the county main law enforcement official.the county contention that county of edgar is ambiguous because it could mean something else does not make it so.see valley forge ins.swiderski,internal citations omitted terms are not ambiguous simply if the parties can suggest creative possibilities for their meaning.we will not strain to interpret a particular provision in a way that would render another provision meaningless.shelton andres.reading county of edgar as ambiguous and potentially naming the county as a whole would render the endorsement naming county of edgar itself meaningless.but if,as we conclude,the sheriff department is the named insured,the endorsement negotiated by the parties and separately added to the policy has meaning.
moreover,the other policies at issue,which no one disputes insure the county government itself,list county of edgar as the named insured indicating a distinction between cgl insurance provided to the county government,and law enforcement coverage purchased for the sheriff department.
further undercutting the county argument on this point is that the address on the policy for county of edgar is different from that of the county government.the named insured on the law enforcement policy is located at north central avenue,the same address listed publicly by the county for its sheriff department.last visited.the address for the county of edgar itself,both according to the cgl policies and the county website,is edgar county courthouse,which is actually located at west court street in paris.aspx last visited.
the endorsement does provide coverage for edgar county as an additional insured.but it does not cover mcfatridge or the state attorney office for the claims in steidl suit.edgar county is an additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of the activities of the named insured,the sheriff department.however,the law enforcement policy does not contemplate coverage for all law enforcement activity simply by virtue of its taking place within edgar county.mcfatridge and the state attorney office became involved as the state chief prosecuting official in edgar county.the state attorney duty in this case arises from illinois law,and not out of the activities of the sheriff department.under state law the state attorney must prosecute all indictments and prosecutions in the circuit court for his county.comp.stat.a.when mcfatridge investigated,charged and prosecuted steidl,he engaged in activity arising out of his duties as state attorney as defined by illinois law,not as part of the activities of the county of edgar sheriff department.a reading of steidl complaint reveals that the sheriff department was not involved in the investigation and its activities are not the subject of the lawsuit.mcfatridge worked solely with the paris police and illinois state police.in short,the county is not insured in this case because any liability it might have to steidl for his wrongful prosecution arises only through the activity of the state attorney and not through any activities of the sheriff department.
if coverage for the county in steidl case were not already foreclosed by the fact that the law enforcement policy and its endorsement cover sheriff department activities only,the rest of the policy terms unambiguously do the job.the terms of the insuring agreement explicitly provide that the policy provides coverage in the event of an injury or damage caused by an occurrence.the policy defines occurrence as an event,which results in injury and arising out of the performance of the insured law enforcement duties.app.at emphasis added.as mentioned above,the insureds in this case are the sheriff department and the county,but only for liability arising out of the activities of the sheriff department.there is no such liability here.mcfatridge involvement arose out of his duty as state attorney and the activities of the paris police and illinois state police.with no law enforcement activity by the sheriff department,there was no covered occurrence and no duty for scottsdale to defend the county in this case.
despite this seemingly clear language limiting coverage to situations where liability arose from sheriff department activities,edgar county further maintains that ambiguity in the conditions section of the policy creates the possibility of coverage for mcfatridge.the section provides as follows 
premium for the purpose of determining the actual premium,the following definitions will apply 
class c employees those employees who do not exercise power of arrest and whose duties are only administrative in nature.
app.at.the policy then lists specific positions that are part of the class c commissioner,mayor,auxiliary police officer and coroner.the district court held that mcfatridge and the edgar county state attorney are not class c employees because under illinois law the state attorney duties are not just administrative in nature,a construction which the plaintiffs national and scottsdale urge us to affirm.edgar county maintains that the state attorney fits within this definition because he is not specifically excluded,does not have the power of arrest,and provides administrative assistance to law enforcement.but the plain language of this section indicates that in order to be a class c employee,one must be an employee of the insured.mcfatridge is not an employee of the sheriff department or the county,and can not be a class c employee under the law enforcement policy.the best characterization of the state attorney is that he is a state constitutional official with jurisdiction in the county in which he is elected.he can serve as an agent of the county when representing county officers in suits brought against them or on their behalf.comp.stat.a.but his primary duty is prosecuting criminal function he fulfills as a state employee.comp.stat.a.the government of the county in which the state attorney is elected has neither the power to direct,oversee nor control these prosecutions the state attorney is not its employee.further,illinois law explicitly holds that the state attorney is a state,and not a county employee.mcgrath gillis,cir ingemunson hedges,d rafters of our present constitution agreed that state attorneys should be classified as state,rather than county officers.
that the illinois constitution treats state attorneys differently from other county officials adds further support to this holding.the position of state attorney is created in the judicial article.const.art.vi.counties have no power to eliminate the state attorney position and multiple counties may share a single state attorney only if the voters in each county agree.id.by contrast,all other county offices are created within the constitution local government article.id.at art.vii,sheriff,clerk,treasurer,coroner,assessor,recorder,auditor.unlike its limited power over the state attorney,the county can completely eliminate any of these positions via referendum and can even eliminate some simply by passing an ordinance.id.
acknowledging this authority,the county attempts to distinguish the illinois cases and constitutional framework by pointing out that the state attorney serves as the county civil actions brought by,and against the county.the budget for the state attorney office and a portion of his salary come from county coffers,suggesting that the state attorney may be a county employee in some situations.the problem with this argument is that it also proves the opposite poi
