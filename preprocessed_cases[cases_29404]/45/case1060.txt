nationwide property and casualty insurance company defendant appeals the decision of the district court,granting royce smith plaintiff or smith motion to remand the matter to state court.defendant argues that,under the class action fairness act cafa,it had established the requisite amount in controversy and that remand was not warranted.in response,plaintiff argues that the district court appropriately determined that defendant had failed to establish the requisite amount in controversy or,in the alternative,that the district court improperly determined that cafa even applied to the action and that,in either event,remand was or should have been appropriately granted upon his motion.
we are of the opinion that the provisions of cafa are applicable to the matter at hand and that defendant has failed to demonstrate,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the district court had original jurisdiction over this putative class action by virtue of an adequate amount in controversy.as explained more fully below,we hereby affirm the decision of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff alleges that on january,his subaru forrester was involved in an accident in newport,tennessee,with a chevrolet pickup truck owned and driven by defendant insured.the insured was determined to be at fault and,after inspecting plaintiff automobile,defendant adjuster determined that repairs would cost approximately.
plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement with defendant in which defendant agreed to repair plaintiff vehicle in return for a release of plaintiff property damage claims against its insured.plaintiff alleges that when repairs are undertaken by defendant pursuant to such a settlement agreement,defendant is obligated to restore vehicles to their prior appearance,function and value.plaintiff claims that defendant breached this agreement by not assessing the vehicle after it was repaired,not informing plaintiff of any lost value following such an assessment,and failing to pay the loss of value unless plaintiff demands and proves loss of value.
plaintiff initial complaint,filed in the circuit court for cocke county,tennessee,in,sought relief only for smith.in the amended complaint,filed in the state court on september,however,plaintiff purports to represent a class of plaintiffs and states as follows 
the total amount in controversy as to the plaintiff and each member of the proposed class does not exceed thousand and dollars each,exclusive of interest and costs.plaintiff disclaims any compensatory damages,punitive damages,declaratory,injunctive,or equitable relief greater than per individual class member.plaintiff and the proposed class limit their total class wide claims to less than four hundred and thousand nine hundred and dollars 
in both his original and amended complaint,plaintiff avers fraudulent concealment,but the allegation is isolated to the tolling of applicable statutes of limitations by virtue of the discovery rule.plaintiff prayer for relief in his amended complaint seeks only to recover compensatory damages for injuries and damages he has suffered,a permanent injunction prohibiting nationwide from failing to assess for loss and requiring nationwide to pay that loss of value if it exists in future instances,a permanent injunction requiring that nationwide establish a procedure to handle such claims,and such other and further relief as it deems just and proper under the premises.
plaintiff further alleges that defendant routinely enters into agreements with to make repairs and restore vehicles in return for a release of property damage claims and breaches these agreements as outlined above.in both his original and amended complaint,plaintiff demanded damages for breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing,as well as for declaratory and injunctive relief requiring defendant to assess vehicles for loss of value,inform parties of that assessment,and pay for loss of value for vehicles within the six year period prior to the commencement of the action.
on october,defendant removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee,asserting federal subject matter jurisdiction under the class action fairness act cafa.in response to plaintiff motion to remand,defendant asserted that cafa applied and that the district court should exercise jurisdiction over the matter as the amount in controversy exceeded the jurisdictional minimum,arguing that plaintiff sought at least in compensatory damages for the putative class and that even modest punitive damages would place a jury award in excess of.upon a motion to remand,the united states district court applied the provisions of cafa,without explicitly addressing when the action commenced for the purposes of the applicability of the statute,and determined that defendant had not carried its burden of establishing the minimum amount in controversy of.finding that it did not have jurisdiction over the matter,the district court remanded the matter to the circuit court for cocke county,tennessee on may.defendant then successfully petitioned this court for leave to take an appeal of the remand order under c.its petition for permission to appeal pursuant to was received by the court on may.
ii.jurisdiction 
generally,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise d.congress has seen fit,however,to make an exception from d,providing that a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of appeals not less than days after entry of the order.c.the district court entered its order granting plaintiff motion to remand this matter to state court on may.plaintiff petition for permission to appeal pursuant to was received by the court on may,seven days excluding the intervening saturday and sunday after the entry of the order by the district court.see fed.a and.accordingly,this court has jurisdiction over this appeal.
