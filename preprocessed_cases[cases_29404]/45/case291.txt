the material facts are not in dispute.coops applied by telephone for a term life insurance policy from pruco in july of a pruco employee recorded the information coops provided.on or before september,coops was diagnosed with stage iv colon cancer.subsequently,on september,pruco delivered the life insurance policy to him.the policy contained the following statement this policy and any attached copy of an application,including an application requesting a change,form the entire contract.app x.physically attached to the policy was a document entitled application for life insurance,which contained the information provided by coops to pruco prior to his cancer diagnosis.accordingly,the application indicated that coops had never been diagnosed with or treated for cancer.the application also included a section titled terms and conditions,which specified

the policy is issued,delivered and i accept it,

the first premium is paid in full and the check or other form of payment is good and can be collected.
coops was presented with two copies of the application when the policy was delivered to him on september.the first was physically attached to the policy the second was not.coops made two changes to the latter copy,first correcting an error in his billing address,and second,signing and dating the application,thereby attesting that t o the best of his knowledge and belief,the statements in the application were complete,true and correctly recorded,and he would inform the company of any changes in his health,mental or physical condition,or of any changes to any answers on the application,prior to or upon delivery of the policy app x.a representative of pruco also signed that copy of the application.pruco retained the signed and amended version of the application,while coops retained the version that was attached to his policy.
coops never informed pruco of his cancer diagnosis or treatment or attempted to amend or supplement the information in the application,which indicated that he had not been diagnosed with cancer.the parties agree that pruco issued the policy only because it did not know of the diagnosis prior to,or at the time of,delivery on september.coops paid premiums until he died on april.following his death,pruco learned for the first time that coops had been diagnosed with colon cancer before the policy was delivered.pruco rescinded the policy,relying on new york law that permits an insurer to rescind an insurance policy ab initio if the insured made a material misrepresentation when he or she secured the policy,novick middlesex mut.assurance,dep t.it denied smith claim for a death benefit and returned coops premium payments.this suit followed.
the district court held a bench trial at which the primary disputed issue was whether the court could consider the application attached to the policy in determining whether coops had made a misrepresentation to pruco.relying on new york insurance law a,smith argued to the district court,as he does on appeal,that the policy was not admissible as evidence to establish coops alleged misrepresentation.the district court admitted and considered the application and found in pruco favor.
new york insurance law a provides,in relevant part 
every policy of life insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this state,shall contain the entire contract between the parties,and nothing shall be incorporated therein by reference to any writing,unless a copy thereof is endorsed upon or attached to the policy or contract when issued.
no application for the issuance of any such policy or contract shall be admissible in evidence unless a true copy was attached to such policy or contract when issued.
smith focuses on the term true copy used in subdivision.he presumes that the application for insurance sought to be introduced in evidence is the one that bears coops signature,and argues that a true copy of that application was not attached to the policy,as the version that was attached was unsigned and did not reflect coops correction of his billing address.the district court rejected smith argument,concluding that the unsigned application attached to the delivered policy served the purposes of a and constituted a true copy,properly considered as evidence.smith pruco life ins.of,d.we agree.
