the illinois school district agency agency appeals the district court partial grant of summary judgment on behalf of pacific insurance company,pacific.the district court held that agency was not entitled to recover costs attributable to certain claims because those claims were not covered by an insurance policy pacific issued to agency.in our view,agency came forward with sufficient evidence that pacific policy should have covered an estoppel claim made against agency in the underlying litigation.because this evidence presents a genuine issue of material fact,we reverse the grant of summary judgment to pacific and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
agency is an intergovernmental cooperative.it consists of member illinois school districts and is organized to provide joint for the member school districts.essentially,agency functions as an insurance provider for the member school districts.
there are two insurance policies at issue in this case.the first is a general liability insurance policy general liability policy that agency issued to one of its member districts,the east moline school district east moline.the other policy is an errors and omissions policy e o policy which agency purchased from pacific.the e o policy was not a reinsurance policy rather,it covered agency own liability for its actions.first state management group,first state acted as pacific agent in administrating claims agency made on the pacific policy,but is not a party to this appeal.
the current dispute is best understood in light of a series of lawsuits among east moline,pacific,agency and other parties concerning the interpretation of these insurance contracts.we therefore shall discuss briefly each of these actions.
the mancilla action 
in april of,the mancilla family sued east moline for injuries that resulted when an east moline student brought mercury home from school mancilla action.the suit was filed in the circuit court of rock island county,illinois.agency,through its administrator,martin boyer company martin boyer,initially agreed to defend east moline.martin boyer determined that east moline defense was covered by the general liability policy.
later,however,agency hired a new administrator,hinz claim management hinz.hinz reviewed the mancilla action and concluded that the suit was not within east moline coverage under the general liability policy because claims for mercury poisoning were excluded by an absolute pollution exclusion.in april of,two years after the suit was initiated,hinz notified east moline that agency would no longer provide a defense to the mancilla action.in november of,the mancilla action was settled for plus costs and fees.
the east moline action 
in june of,east moline filed a suit in illinois state court east moline action.it sought a declaratory judgment against agency that the general liability policy obligated agency to reimburse east moline for costs incurred in the defense of the mancilla action.east moline alleged that agency had acted in bad faith under ilcs,that agency had waived its right to assert a defense under the general liability policy and that agency was estopped from denying east moline defense of the suit.
in march of,the district court granted summary judgment on the contract claim in favor of agency.it held that the mercury claim fell within the pollution exclusion and thus was outside the scope of coverage.in,the court granted agency summary judgment on the bad faith and waiver claims.in july of,the estoppel claim went to trial,and agency prevailed.
the martin boyer action 
agency sued martin boyer in state court to recover defense fees and costs that it had incurred defending itself in the east moline action martin boyer action.agency obtained a judgment in the amount of from martin boyer in july of.there is no evidence in the record that agency has received this award.
the current action 
agency next made a demand on pacific under the e o policy.in this action,agency likewise sought reimbursement of all costs in defending the east moline action.pacific refused to reimburse agency for the full costs,and agency then filed the present action.the complaint alleged four counts.count i sought a declaratory judgment that pacific was obligated to pay all of agency costs for the east moline action.count ii alleged that pacific breached the policy by failing to pay the full costs and sought recovery of those costs.count iii alleged that pacific vexatiously refused to pay these costs in violation of ilcs see.in short,agency sought declaratory and monetary relief for the cost of defending itself against each of the claims that east moline brought against it in the east moline action the claim that agency breached the contract with east moline the claim that agency had acted in bad faith in violation of ilcs the claim that agency was estopped from denying coverage and the claim that agency had waived the right to deny coverage.
pacific raised a number of affirmative defenses.one of those defenses was that a policy exclusion in the e o policy exclusion d prevented agency from obtaining declaratory and monetary relief on its claims against pacific.the text of exclusion d,listed in the e o policy,reads as follows 
this insurance shall not indemnify the insured for loss incurred from any claim 
d for obligations or responsibilities assumed by the insured under any contract unless liability therefore would have attached to the insured by reason of the insured negligent acts,errors or omissions or by reason of the insured actual or alleged breach of duty,neglect,error,misstatement,misleading statement or other act or omission in the absence of such a contract committed in the insured capacity as stated in the insuring agreements.
at.pacific answer also included various other affirmative defenses,including that agency failed to allocate between covered and uncovered claims and that agency did not provide timely notice to pacific of the east moline action as required by the e o policy.
pacific then moved for summary judgment.agency for summary judgment on a number of pacific affirmative defenses,including the defense that agency failed to allocate between covered and claims and that agency failed to give timely notice to pacific of the east moline action.
district court proceedings 
on july,the district court entered partial summary judgment in favor of pacific and partial summary judgment in favor of agency.the court noted that the parties do not dispute that east moline claim that the general liability policy required agency to defend the mancilla action is a contract claim excluded from coverage under exclusion d of the e o policy.however,the parties also agree agency costs of defending against east moline bad faith failure to defend claim are covered by the e o policy because this claim is.at.the parties further agreed that illinois law controls the interpretation of the insurance policies.the parties disagreed as to whether agency costs of defending itself against east moline waiver and estoppel claims are excluded from the e o policy that agency obtained from pacific.id.
the district court granted partial summary judgment to pacific on agency claim that pacific was to reimburse it for the costs it incurred while defending the estoppel and waiver claims brought by east moline.the court also granted partial summary judgment to agency on pacific affirmative defense that agency failed to give pacific timely notice of the east moline action as required by the e o policy.
the district court reached its decision by concluding that east moline waiver claim was not covered by the e o policy.the court noted that exclusion d excludes from coverage any losses that arise by contract unless the basis for liability would have attached even in the absence of a contract.in east moline suit against agency,east moline alleged that agency had waived its right to assert the absolute pollution exclusion in the general liability policy.agency thus remained obligated to treat the claims against east moline in the mancilla action as covered by the policy.the court held that the alleged liability was based on the general liability policy and,due to agency waiver of its rights under the pollution exclusion,would not have attached absent that agreement.therefore,the court held that east moline waiver claim was a contract claim and excluded from coverage pursuant to exclusion d of agency e o policy.
the district court then held that the estoppel claim involving the pollution exclusion is excluded from e o policy coverage by exclusion d.the district court stated that,in an insurance context,estoppel arises when an insured tenders the defense of a claim to an insurer,and the insurer does not either defend under a full reservation of rights or file a declaratory judgment action to determine whether the claim is covered and whether the insurer has a duty to defend.id.at citing employers ins.of wausau ehlco liquidating trust.had east moline prevailed on its estoppel theory,agency would have been obligated to treat the claim from the mancilla action as a claim covered by the general liability policy.id.at.because liability would have been defined by the general liability policy and would not have arisen in absence of that agreement,the estoppel claim was also within the e o policy exclusion d.
next,pacific asserted that it was not obligated to reimburse agency for the costs of defending east moline bad faith claim because agency did not allocate defense costs between this covered claim and other uncovered claims.id.pacific argued that the e o policy dictated that costs should be allocated on a pro rata basis between uncovered and covered claims.however,the district court held that the policy did not contain such a provision.id.at.
the court then held a bench trial on the remaining issues,namely the amount and reasonableness of the fees agency sustained in defending against east moline claim.the district court rejected pacific contention that the previous martin boyer action in state court barred recovery.at.the court also rejected pacific argument that the district court should abstain under colorado river water conservation district united states,d,because the proceedings were not parallel and because they were between different parties involving different contracts.id.at.
the court then analyzed the legal defense costs submitted by agency.it determined that some should be reimbursed under the policy because they furthered either the case in general or the bad faith claim.other costs,relating exclusively to the estoppel and waiver claims,were held by the district court to be under the e o policy.the district court entered a judgment against pacific for the district court determined this amount to be the cost of defending east moline claim against agency.id.at.agency now appeals the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of pacific.
discussiona.estoppel.
agency submits that,in the east moline litigation,it had to defend against a claim of equitable estoppel and that such a claim is covered by pacific e o policy.in addressing this contention,we must examine the text of exclusion d of the e o policy to ascertain whether it excludes coverage of agency in the event of an equitable estoppel claim.under illinois law,if the words of an insurance policy are unambiguous,we must give them their plain,ordinary and popular meaning if the words are susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,they are ambiguous and will be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer that drafted the policy.maremont cont l cas,d.in illinois,the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.see,zurich ins.walsh constr.of,d.
in our view,the most reasonable reading of exclusion d is that pacific is not liable for obligations or responsibilities assumed by the insured under any contract unless liability would have attached,independently of the contract language,to agency by reason of agency negligent acts,errors,or omissions.in the case of equitable estoppel,agency liability would arise not because it was contractually obligated to defend east moline,but because it had taken control of east moline defense to east moline disadvantage.such an act could be a negligent act that is not excluded from coverage by exclusion d.the remedy would be one in equity,not one determined by the terms of the contract.in fact,contractual obligations may be irrelevant in such a situation,any alleged estoppel applies not due to the terms of a contract between the insurer and the insured,but rather because of the insurer actions themselves.accordingly,an equitable estoppel claim is outside the terms of the policy exception because the claim is not based on the contract.rather,it seeks a remedy for agency negligent action in taking up east moline defense,controlling it even though it was not contractually obligated to do so,and then ceasing this defense to the detriment of east moline.following illinois law,we therefore shall construe the policy in favor of the insured,and,for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that a claim of equitable estoppel is not one that is excluded from policy coverage by exclusion d of the e o policy.
in agency view,the e o policy covered the cost of its defending against east moline estoppel claim because the claim was one for equitable estoppel,not contractual estoppel.it regards exclusion d as excluding only liability that is assumed under contract,and would not have arisen in absence of the contract.appellant br.at emphasis in original.agency urges that the estoppel claim brought against it by east moline meets neither of these two prongs.
agency submits that illinois recognizes two distinct theories of estoppel.it labels them contractual estoppel and equitable estoppel.c ontractual estoppel,it continues,is the type of estoppel relied upon by the district court.under this theory,an insurer that believes it has no duty to defend a tendered claim can avoid liability if it either defends under a reservation of rights or seeks a declaratory judgment that it has no obligation to defend.if an insurer simply declines to defend and is later found to have denied wrongfully coverage,the insurer is estopped from raising policy defense to coverage.id.at citing employers,at.thus,according to agency,contractual estoppel is premised on the notion that,by wrongfully refusing to provide a defense,the insurer has breached the terms of its own policy of insurance.id.at.
agency submits that the district court misapprehended the claim asserted in the east moline action.it submits that east moline alleged equitable estoppel not contractual estoppel.equitable estoppel,according to agency,arises when there has been a showing that the insurer induced the insured to surrender control of the defense,to the insured detriment.id.citing maryland cas.peppers.it arises out of conduct,not contract,and as such it may arise even in the absence of a contract.id.at emphasis in original.because exclusion d only excludes liabilities assumed by contract that would not have arisen in the absence of contract,agency submits that exclusion d would not exclude a claim of equitable estoppel.
pacific does not disagree with agency description of the two different theories of estoppel recognized in illinois law.it correctly accepts that illinois case law supports the distinction.see consol.rail liberty mut.ins,d,distinguishing between a theory of estoppel where there is a contractual potential for coverage,but the insurer refuses coverage from the outset and a theory of estoppel where an insurer assumes the defense of an insured and then withdraws that defense.the supreme court of illinois has also stated that this contractual estoppel doctrine has roots in the principle of equitable estoppel and has since developed into a distinct doctrine that stands on its own.employers,at.furthermore,the supreme court of illinois has applied the equitable theory when an insurer undertakes the defense of an insured and later attempts to withdraw that defense,to the detriment of the insured.see maryland cas,at stating that an insurer may be estopped from asserting a noncoverage defense where the insurer undertook defense of an action,but requiring prejudice to the insured as a res
