this case requires us to consider the interrelationship of joinder and supplemental jurisdiction in a diversity case.the picciotto family and their company,foreign car center,the picciottos,appeal the dismissal of their complaint for failure to join an indispensable party.the district court found that dana casher,a citizen of massachusetts,is a necessary and indispensable party in the picciottos suit against casher malpractice insurers and others for civil conspiracy.because the picciottos are also massachusetts citizens,the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that joinder of casher would destroy its diversity jurisdiction.
on appeal,the picciottos challenge the district court determination that casher is both necessary and indispensable.alternatively,they argue that grants supplemental jurisdiction to the district court,allowing casher to be joined as a defendant under federal rule of civil procedure without destroying diversity,provided that the plaintiffs do not assert any claims against her.finding no abuse of discretion in the district court determination that casher is a necessary and indispensable party,and rejecting the picciottos assertion that the supplemental jurisdiction statute permits joinder of nondiverse indispensable parties,we affirm the dismissal.
this appeal is the latest episode in a long series of cases involving the picciotto family,stemming from a toxic tort action brought by the picciottos against salem suede,in although the picciottos prevailed in a jury trial against salem suede in,winning a million judgment,salem suede subsequently filed for bankruptcy.in the bankruptcy proceedings and settlement negotiations with salem suede insurer,travelers,the picciottos hired dana casher to represent them.
the picciottos allege that,without their consent,casher also agreed to represent juan nunez,a former foreign car center employee with claims against salem suede,in the negotiations with travelers.the picciottos also criticize casher representation in the settlement talks with travelers.they allege that,after allowing the negotiations to run late into the night,casher refused to allow them to leave the conference to consider the settlement agreement overnight before signing.they further contend that she violated the massachusetts rules of professional conduct by failing to specify in the settlement agreement itself the allocation among the picciottos,nunez,and casher of the million settlement travelers had offered.they claim that casher had agreed to be paid million from the settlement money,with the understanding that she would use part of this money to pay the other attorneys who had previously represented the picciottos in their toxic tort case against salem suede however,when the picciottos former attorneys refused to sign releases discharging travelers from additional liability for attorneys fees,travelers refused to turn over the settlement funds.
the picciottos claim that when casher realized her error in failing to obtain releases from the other attorneys,she and her firm notified continental and great northern,her firm malpractice insurers of potential malpractice claims.the picciottos allege that continental and great northern took charge of the claim and,from that point on,directed the conduct of casher.they allege that continental and great northern had also reinsured the travelers policy issued to salem suede.they contend that these insurance companies joined forces with twin city and hartford two other reinsurers of the travelers policy,and the picciottos former attorneys to form the picciotto defense group.they further allege that continental and great northern,working in concert with twin city and hartford,directed casher to coerce the picciottos into agreeing to amend the settlement agreement with travelers.they assert that this amendment allowed travelers to escape its contractual obligation to pay out the settlement funds and instead to file an interpleader action,depositing the funds in a escrow account.the picciottos further claim that casher,acting under the direction of continental and great northern,prevented the picciottos from sending a timely demand letter to travelers,as required by massachusetts general laws chapter and failed to file the appropriate crossclaims and counterclaims for the benefit of the picciottos in the interpleader action.
in the interpleader action,the picciottos former attorneys filed claims for unpaid fees and the picciottos counterclaimed for malpractice.the picciottos lost.the litigation continued as the picciottos next sued casher for malpractice in state court.in another suit,they also asserted a variety of claims against nunez,casher,and another of their former attorneys,including breach of obligation under an fee agreement,negligence,civil conspiracy,interference with contract,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty.casher,in turn,has sued the picciottos for unpaid fees.all of the state court cases involving the picciottos have been consolidated into a single case with a state court judge specially assigned to preside over them.
in the case at bar,the picciottos brought suit against continental,great northern,hartford,and twin city,predicated on diversity jurisdiction under.they claim that the defendant insurance companies engaged in a civil conspiracy to interfere tortiously with the contractual relations between the picciottos,casher,and casher law firm.they also assert claims for negligence,fraud,and violation of chapter against each of the defendants.
the defendants contend that the picciottos have brought this suit largely to obtain discovery that they had been denied in the state court actions and to pressure their state court opponents and their opponents insurers the defendants note that the claims asserted against the defendant insurers in this federal case are nearly identical to the claims asserted against casher in the state case,and that casher conduct is central to this action.the defendants moved for dismissal on the ground that casher is both a necessary and an indispensable party under federal rule of civil procedure rule and that her joinder is not feasible because it would destroy the district court diversity jurisdiction.the court granted the motion to dismiss and this appeal ensued.
standard of review 
in this circuit,we review a district court determination that a party is indispensable under rule b for abuse of discretion.fernandez,kellogg usa,cir travelers indem.dingwell,cir.this deference is warranted because rule b determinations are anything but pure legal conclusions.travelers,at.instead,they involve the balancing of competing interests and must be steeped in pragmatic considerations.id.
we have not previously determined the correct standard to apply in reviewing a district court determination that a party is necessary under rule a.united states san juan bay marina,cir citing tell trustees of dartmouth,cir noting some difference among the circuits regarding the appropriate standard of review.like rule b,rule a requires the trial court to make pragmatic judgments and to decide whether considerations of efficiency and fairness,growing out of the particular circumstances of the case,require that a particular person be joined as a party.pujol express,cir.such pragmatic judgments generally warrant deference to the trial court because they turn on specific facts,will not recur in identical form and the district judge is closer to the facts and has a comparative advantage over a reviewing court.tell,at.the tell panel indicated that i f it mattered in that case,it would be inclined to apply an abuse of discretion standard to such decisions under rule a.id.at.we share that inclination and now explicitly hold that the abuse of discretion standard applies in both the rule a and rule b contexts.

rule analysis 
rule addresses circumstances in which a lawsuit is proceeding without particular parties whose interests are central to the suit.it provides for the joinder of such necessary parties when feasible.a.it then provides for the dismissal of suits when the court determines that the joinder of the necessary parties is not feasible,but that they are,nonetheless,so indispensable that the suit must not be litigated without them.b.
in proceeding with its inquiry into both necessity and indispensability,a district court should keep in mind the policies that underlie rule,including the public interest in preventing multiple and repetitive litigation,the interest of the present parties in obtaining complete and effective relief in a single action,and the interest of absentees in avoiding the possible prejudicial effect of deciding the case without them.acton bachman foods,cir.the supreme court has instructed that the decision whether to dismiss for nonjoinder is a practical determination that must be based on factors varying with the different cases,some such factors being substantive,some procedural,some compelling by themselves,and some subject to balancing against opposing interests.provident tradesmens bank trust patterson,d.
necessary party 
against this policy backdrop,the district court must first determine whether the absent person is a necessary party.pujol,at.in other words,the court must decide whether the person fits the definition of those who should be joined if feasible under rule a.id.thus,as the district court explained,casher would be a necessary party if the district court found either that the litigation would impair or impede her ability to protect her interests.a i or if the case would leave defendants subject to multiple obligations as explained in.a ii.the court then went on to find casher presence necessary under both aspects of the rule a test 
in analyzing rule a i,the district court noted two ways in which the federal litigation could,as a practical matter,impair casher ability to protect her interests in the state court proceeding.first,the court stated that w hile the outcome of the federal litigation would not be binding on casher as res judicata if she were not a party to the case,an adverse ruling would nonetheless impair casher ability to settle the state law claims against her.settlement position is a valid consideration in the practical inquiry required by rule a i because,even without a direct preclusive effect,an adverse judgment could be persuasive precedent in a subsequent proceeding,and would weaken the absent party bargaining position for settlement purposes.acton,at see also gonzalez cruz,cir holding that although a ruling against the absent party would not be binding in the state court,it could,as a practical matter,impair the absent party probability of success in a future proceeding and reduce its ability to reach a favorable settlement.
the picciottos criticize this analysis by the district court because casher affidavit opposing the litigation of the federal case in her absence did not assert that her ability to settle the state case could be impaired.however,in making the highly practical determination required by rule a i,a court may draw reasonable,pragmatic inferences from the particular circumstances in the case to protect the absent party.the determination that casher state settlement position would likely be impaired by her absence in the federal litigation is just such an inference.
the district court also concluded that casher interests could be impaired because an adverse ruling in the federal litigation could cause her to lose her insurance coverage in the state case.in pursuing their conspiracy claim,the picciottos allege that casher gave continental and great northern prompt notice of the picciottos potential claims against her,allowing the insurance companies to take charge and direct casher subsequent representation of the picciottos.the picciottos allege that the notice was provided to continental and great northern before casher and her firm acquired their current coverage from tig.such an allegation,if proven,would likely cause casher and her firm to lose their tig coverage and defense in the state court action.the picciottos counter this argument by asserting that continental would step in and provide coverage if tig disclaims its coverage because casher has full prior acts coverage with continental.even if that is so,we agree with the district court that casher has a cognizable interest in maximizing her available coverage by protecting her current insurance coverage and defense.thus,the court did not abuse its discretion with its necessary party determination.
feasibility in the diversity context 
as we explained above,necessary parties should be joined if f easible.a.in the traditional analysis,when the court subject matter jurisdiction is grounded in diversity,the joinder of a nondiverse party is not feasible because such joinder destroys the court subject matter jurisdiction.in re olympic mills,cir acton,at.it is axiomatic that f ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.the statutory grant of federal jurisdiction in diversity cases gives district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy is between citizens of different states.a.this statutory grant requires complete diversity between the plaintiffs and defendants in an action.strawbridge curtiss,cranch.halleran hoffman,cir.thus,under the traditional analysis,if the matter in controversy involves a necessary,nondiverse absentee,the court must determine whether the litigation may continue in the absence of this person or whether she is so indispensable that the court should dismiss the case for want of subject matter jurisdiction.acton,at.
as we discuss in part iii below,the picciottos contend that this traditional analysis has been dramatically altered by the adoption of the supplemental jurisdiction statute,in.they argue,in effect,that the supplemental jurisdiction statute means that,even in diversity cases,the joinder of nondiverse parties,when no claims are asserted against them,is now feasible.this novel contention would obviate the need to conduct an indispensability analysis because casher joinder would be feasible.however,before we address that alternative approach,we first proceed with the indispensability analysis,premised on the traditional notion that casher joinder as a defendant would not be feasible because the picciottos and casher are both massachusetts citizens.
indispensable party 
under rule b,the court must determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed.b.the rule specifies the four factors the court should consider 
in this case,the district court carefully analyzed each factor before determining that casher is an indispenable party and dismissing the suit.on the first factor to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties,the court reiterated its rule a i finding that casher interest in settling the state law claims against her and retaining her insurance would be prejudiced by an adverse judgment in this case 
on the second factor the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided,the court found that it would be difficult if not impossible to shape relief that would not implicate casher interests.given the prejudice that the court identified the impact on a potential settlement of the state law claims and the potential loss of insurance coverage,we agree that there is no such protective approach possible because the prejudice to casher would result from the potential outcome of the litigation itself,not the specific terms of any judgment.
on the third factor whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate,the court explained that this factor extends beyond the issue of whether relief could be shaped that would satisfy the parties.it also encompasses the interest of the courts and the public in complete,consistent,and efficient settlement of controversies.see provident tradesmens bank,at.we read rule third criterion,whether the judgment issued in the absence of the nonjoined person will be adequate,to refer to this public stake in settling disputes by wholes,whenever possible,for clearly the plaintiff,who himself chose both the forum and the parties defendant,will not be heard to complain about the sufficiency of the relief obtainable against them.applying this broader view of the third factor,the district court concluded that the striking similarity between the claims in this case against the insurance companies and the claims against casher and others in the state court litigation demonstrates the availability of an alternative forum and the efficiency of litigating the entire case in state court.
in discussing the fourth factor,the availability of an adequate remedy in the event of dismissal,the court reiterated this conclusion.the district court found that the remedy would be to join the insurance companies as defendants in the state court litigation and that nothing would prevent the picciottos from doing so.the picciottos protest that they will be barred from joining the insurance companies in the state suit by the statute of limitations or a state court injunction however,they undoubtedly could have named the insurance companies as defendants in their initial state court pleadings.we doubt that the statute of limitations poses a bar to refiling in state court.see.laws ch,providing one year to file a new action following a dismissal for any matter of form.corliss city of fall river,d,holding that a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction is dismissal for a matter of form.even if the picciottos were,for some reason,unable to sue the insurance companies in state court,it is a result of their own litigation strategy and not a sufficient reason for them to remain in federal court on these claims.
in sum,the district court conclusion that casher is an indispensable party was sufficiently supported by findings that satisfy each of the four factors in the rule b analysis.thus,we find no abuse of discretion in the determination that casher is a necessary and indispensable party in this action.
alternatively,the picciottos argue that,even if casher is a necessary and indispensable party,her joinder is feasible under the supplemental jurisdiction statute,and thus the case should not have been dismissed.section a,adopted in,provides a grant of subject matter jurisdiction over supplemental claims 
except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
emphasis added.section b then limits the applicability of this supplemental authority in cases brought under the diversity jurisdiction statute,
in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section of this title,the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection a over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,or of the federal rules of civil procedure,or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule of such rules,when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.
citing a law review article the picciottos assert that b altered the traditional analysis and now allows a nondiverse party to be joined as a defendant under rule without destroying the diversity jurisdiction of the court,so long as the plaintiffs do not assert any claims against the joined defendant.however,this argument is fatally flawed.without casher,as we explain below,there is no viable civil action over which the district court may assert original jurisdiction.thus,there is no original suit to which casher may be added as a supplemental party.
prior to the adoption of,we explicitly rejected an invitation to apply ancillary jurisdiction,the historical precursor to grant of supplemental jurisdiction,to avoid dismissal in a case requiring the joinder of an indispensable,nondiverse party.acton,at.taking the same approach as the picciottos,the appellant in acton argued that,although the joinder of a nondiverse,indispensable party would appear to destroy diversity jurisdiction,that party could be joined under the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.id.at.we rejected that argument,concluding that ancillary jurisdiction presupposes the existence of an action that a federal court can adjudicate and should not be used to breathe life into a lawsuit that is not otherwise viable.id.at quoting charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure civil,at see also zb holdings,white,concluding that the term original jurisdiction presupposes a viable lawsuit,and thus rejecting the argument that allows for supplemental jurisdiction over nondiverse indispensable parties 
by definition,the rule b indispensability determination means that there is no viable lawsuit without the missing party.where jurisdiction depends solely on diversity of citizenship,the absence of a nondiverse,indispensable party is not a mere procedural defect.rather,it destroys the district court original subject matter jurisdiction.calcote texas pac.coal oil,cir w here jurisdiction depends solely upon diversity of citizenship the absence of indispensable parties absolutely defeats federal jurisdiction.thus,ancillary jurisdiction was not available to cure the jurisdictional defect in a diversity case when the absence of an indispensable party meant that there was no case over which the district court could exercise original jurisdiction.
the plain language of the supplemental jurisdiction statute incorporates this well established requirement that there be a viable action over which the district court has original jurisdiction before supplemental jurisdiction may be considered.section a grants supplemental jurisdiction over related claims in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,and defines the requirements for original jurisdiction in diversity cases.in exxon mobil allapattah services,d,the court explained how these two jurisdictional provisions interact incomplete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all claims,so there is nothing to which supplemental jurisdiction can adhere.id.at.the complete diversity requirement is consistently imposed on a,rather than a,basis in a case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants,the presence in the action of a single plaintiff from the same state as a single defendant deprives the district court of original diversity jurisdiction over the entire action.id.at.citing strawbridge,cranch.owen equip.erection kroger,d.
the court in allapattah dubbed this view of complete diversity the contamination theory because the inclusion of a nondiverse party contaminates every other claim in the complaint,depriving the court of original jurisdiction over any of these claims.id.at.the contamination theory makes sense in the context of the complete diversity requirement,the court said,because the presence of nondiverse parties on both sides of a lawsuit eliminates the justification for providin
