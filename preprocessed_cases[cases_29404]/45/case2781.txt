allstate insurance company appeals from a judgment requiring it to contribute to the costs of defense incurred by mercury insurance company on behalf of an insured covered by allstate and mercury policies.we affirm.
mercury insurance company issued a policy of automobile liability insurance to alex tsiboukas for four vehicles with limits of per person and per accident.allstate insurance company issued a personal umbrella policy to alex tsiboukas with a limit of million per occurrence.tsiboukas daughter was involved in an accident during the coverage period of both policies wherein four people were seriously injured.litigation ensued and the matter was eventually settled by both carriers paying policy limits for a total settlement of million.
the policy provided by mercury required mercury to defend the action until the company has paid the applicable limit of liability for the accident which is the basis of a lawsuit,but not beyond that time.boldface omitted.allstate policy provides that allstate may assume control of the settlement and we may assume the defense of any claim or suit against an insured person if.the limits of any required underlying insurance or any other insurance have been exhausted by payment boldface omitted,or the issuer of the underlying insurance becomes bankrupt or insolvent.the allstate policy requires the insured to maintain underlying insurance.
mercury incurred in defense costs.mercury brought the instant action against allstate for contribution for part of the costs of defense.mercury relied on insurance code section,subdivision g which provides in relevant part 
g where two or more personal policies affording valid and collectible liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle in an occurrence out of which a loss shall arise,and one policy,as defined in subdivision a of section,is primary,either by its terms or by operation of law,and one or more of the personal policies providing liability insurance,as defined in section,are excess,either by their terms or by operation of law,then the following shall apply 
each insurer shall pay its share of the defense costs.each insurer share of the defense costs shall be the percentage of the total defense costs equal to the amount of damage paid by that insurer as a percentage of total damages paid by all insurers whose policies apply to that motor vehicle.
the trial court agreed with mercury and awarded mercury,which is allstate share of the defense costs,if the formula set forth in section,subdivision g is applied.
allstate appeals,contending that insurance code section applies only to automobile liability policies,that the policy issued by allstate is not an automobile liability policy,and that it was therefore error to require allstate to contribute to the costs of defending the claim against the insured tsiboukas.
subdivision g of section has not as yet been the subject of a reported appellate court opinion.
discussion 
the statute defines the primary policy as an automobile liability policy and the excess policy as a general liability policy 
the legislature has made clear that section is intended to resolve the order in which two or more liability insurance policies are to apply to losses caused by the operation or use of motor vehicles sections and were enacted in for the purpose of resolving,so far as possible,conflicts and litigation over which,of two or more applicable policies,were to be deemed primary or excess.hartford accident indemnity sequoia ins.d.section,subdivisions a,b,c and d,set forth the four basic rules for determining the order of priority of several automobile liability insurance policies which are applicable to a given loss.the statute,where applicable,makes a definitive imposition of primary excess liability on insurers in given situations.id.at.
in referring to insurance policies,subdivisions a through d of section refer either to two or more policies affording automobile liability insurance subd.a,or to two or more policies applicable to the same loss subds.b c,or to two or more policies affording valid and collectible liability insurance subd.d.
subdivision g of section is more precise than subdivisions a though d in identifying the types of policies to which it refers.subdivision g provides that one policy,stated to be the primary policy,is as defined in subdivision a of section.the other,or excess policy,is as defined in section.
subdivision a of section states 
policy means an automobile liability,automobile physical damage,or automobile collision policy,or any combination thereof,delivered or issued for delivery in this state,insuring a single individual or individuals residing in the same household,as named insured,and under which the insured vehicles therein designated are of the following types only a motor vehicle of the private passenger or station wagon type that is not used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers,nor rented to others or any other motor vehicle with a load capacity of pounds or less provided,however,that this chapter shall not apply i to any policy issued under an automobile assigned risk plan,or ii to any policy insuring more than four automobiles,or iii to any policy covering garage,automobile sales agency,repair shop,service station,or public parking place operation hazards or a motorcycle.
subdivision a of section states 
liability insurance includes a insurance against loss resulting from liability for injury,fatal or nonfatal,suffered by any natural person,or resulting from liability for damage to property,or property interests of others but does not include worker compensation,common carrier liability,boiler and machinery,or team and vehicle insurance.
thus,section,subdivision g provides that the primary policy referred to in subdivision g of section is an automobile liability policy,and further provides that the excess policy is a policy of general liability insurance,as such insurance is defined in section.section,subdivision a excludes vehicle insurance from its definition of liability insurance.it appears to be clear therefore that the excess insurance referred to in section,subdivision g is not an automobile liability policy,but is rather a general liability insurance policy.
the reference to section in subdivision g of section makes it clear that an excess policy is a general liability policy 
allstate attempts to lend the reference to section in subdivision g of section an interpretation that is at variance with the plain text of the statute.
first,allstate attempts to explain the presence,and meaning,of section in subdivision g of section by speculating that the legislature did not want to preclude primary automobile carriers from a broader universe of personal primary automobile insurers than section narrow range of policies.according to allstate,this explains why section,subdivision g the broader definition of liability insurance in section.allstate goes on to contend in adopting that reference,the legislature broadened the range of primary automobile policies obligated to contribute to defense expenses even when they are in an excess position.allstate concludes that this does not justify the application of subdivision g to any and all liability policies.
the flaw in allstate suggestion is that if the legislature intended to limit excess policies to automobile liability insurance policies,the legislature could have done so by referring,not to section,but,to section or,as an example,to section,which defines automobile liability policies and sets forth their required contents.as it is,we can not ignore the deliberate choice of section to define excess policies,nor can we ignore that the legislature defined a primary policy in terms of section.if the legislature had intended an excess policy to be an automobile liability policy,it could have easily done so by defining both the primary and the excess policy in terms of section.
next,allstate claims that under the principle of ejusdem generis section is limited by the phrase that precedes it.that phrase,according to allstate,is two or more personal policies affording viable and collectible liability insurance that apply to the same mot
