this multimillion dollar dispute concerns the validity of a reinsurance contract between all american and sphere drake sphere drake argues that its broker,euro international underwriting eiu,lacked either actual or apparent authority to bind sphere drake to the reinsurance policy.the company contends that eiu had the authority to represent sphere drake only up to a certain dollar amount,a limit eiu exceeded when it entered the reinsurance contract with all american.thus,sphere drake argues,the policy is void.all american,in contrast,contends that the contract is valid and enforceable.
the larger underlying controversy between these parties regards sphere drake refusal to pay tens of millions of dollars in coverage all american contends it is owed under seven reinsurance contracts,including the one at issue here,referred to as the unicare retrocession.sphere drake agreed to arbitrate the six contracts,and the arbitrators concluded that sphere drake was not bound because eiu lacked actual or apparent authority to enter into the contracts.all american,not liking the arbitration results,then filed suit in federal court.the district court set aside the arbitration decision on the grounds that one of the arbitrators displayed evident partiality,a decision we reversed in what,chronologically,was the second time this conflict reached our door.sphere drake ins.all am.life ins,cir sphere drake ii.
while agreeing to arbitrate the six cases,sphere drake filed suit in the northern district of illinois seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not required to arbitrate the unicare dispute,insisting that the retrocession did not contain an enforceable arbitration provision.the district court ruled in sphere drake favor.on appeal the first time this dispute reached us,we ruled that the retrocession did contain an arbitration clause.sphere drake ins.all am.ins,cir sphere drake i.significant for our purposes here,however,we noted that whether there is a contract in the first place is a matter for the courts,not an arbitrator,to decide.id.at.thus,we held,sphere drake may be required to arbitrate if and only if eiu had authority to bind it to these reinsurance contracts.id.at.accordingly,we remanded with instructions for the district court to resolve the parties only real dispute the extent of eiu authority.id.
on remand,sphere drake filed a consolidated amended complaint for declaratory judgment.it sought a declaration that the unicare retrocession was void ad initio on two grounds eiu had written the contract in breach of an express limit on the amount of premium eiu was authorized to accept and the unicare retrocession was written in furtherance of a conspiracy between eiu and stirling cooke the broker that placed the contract on all american behalf and was therefore an act in breach of the fiduciary duties eiu owed to sphere drake.the district court bifurcated these issues.d.the effect is that only sphere drake excess authority claim is involved in this litigation.the fiduciary duty claim will be resolved in a separate arbitration if sphere drake loses on its excess authority claim.id.at.
both parties filed for summary judgment with respect to whether eiu exceeded its authority.the district court granted summary judgment in sphere drake favor and denied all american,holding that eiu overstepped its authority in writing the unicare retrocession and that stirling cooke knew eiu lacked authority to write the risk.accordingly,the court held,eiu lacked actual and apparent authority to bind sphere drake to the unicare retrocession.d.the court also rejected all american affirmative defenses of ratification,waiver,and estoppel,id.at.thus,it held the unicare retrocession void ab initio.all american appeals.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment to sphere drake.
sphere drake is an insurance company that underwrites reinsurance protection for other insurance companies,known as retrocessional coverage in january,sphere drake negotiated with john whitcombe,who was in the process of establishing eiu,regarding eiu underwriting business for sphere drake.the business plan the parties agreed to stated that eiu will undertake to achieve the following gross premium forecasts million for year,million for year,million for year.
the agreement was formalized under a binding authority which authorized eiu to enter into certain types of insurance and reinsurance contracts on sphere drake behalf.the binding authority,however,limited the amount of gross estimated premium income that eiu was authorized to write.it provided that the initial estimated gross premium was not to exceed million the equivalent of million pursuant to a to conversion rate set forth in the binding authority for convenience purposes,we will refer to the dollar,not pound,value throughout the balance of this opinion.the binding authority also specifically stated that the premium estimate would be increased by mutual agreement.
eiu,on march,requested an increase in the annual premium limit to million.sphere drake authorized the increase,including business already written.on december,in response to another request from eiu,sphere drake increased the premium limit to million.
on february,eiu submitted a proposal to increase the premium limit for to million.sphere drake rejected this figure.on february,eiu again sought an increase and proposed a limit of million.sphere drake again refused the proposed increase.
not to be deterred,in april and may,eiu again tried to increase the premium limit.vic broad,sphere drake underwriter in charge of the binding authority,denied the request and advised whitcombe that he could not increase the limit without the approval of michael watson,sphere drake ceo.on june,whitcombe met with watson and expressed a desire that eiu be permitted to write more premium,stating that he was dissatisfied with the fact that increases had to occur on a piecemeal basis.
watson informed whitcombe that broad would handle the decision with respect to any request for an increase.at a trial in the united kingdom watson testified about the meeting,i was certainly aware that whitcombe wanted to wanted more capacity but no formal request or even informal request was made as far as i was concerned.after the june meeting,according to watson,the matter of whitcombe desired increase remained outstanding.at the same trial,whitcombe stated that he believed watson had agreed in principle to give him the authority to write up to million in premium incomes.whitcombe admitted,however,that he understood that any premium increase had to be first addressed with broad.
six days after the meeting,whitcombe wrote to watson 
it is my understanding that controlled expansion to a level of premium income in the region of for would not alarm you and would certainly afford me a sound basis on which to plan events.
i am aware that you will be discussing our conversation with vic broad with a view to settling your own plans and wishes for the future.i will await his instructions.
watson responded on june,writing that he had asked broad to address the relevant underwriting issues but that whitcombe should continue on a business as usual basis.watson was absolutely unaware of anything approving an increase.
during this time,eiu continued to underwrite contracts for sphere drake.in,prior to writing the unicare retrocession,eiu accepted contracts totaling in gross estimated premiums.with the exception of a single contract for which the estimated premium was,the purchase of all of the risks eiu accepted under the binding authority was brokered through two affiliated reinsurance intermediaries,stirling cooke brown insurance brokers limited and stirling cooke brown reinsurance brokers limited collectively,stirling cooke,the same company that brokered the unicare retrocession.
in dealing with eiu,jeffery butler,the stirling cooke broker who placed the unicare retrocession,butler assistant adrian mortley,and richard wells,stirling cooke compliance officer,admitted that in they received a copy of the binding authority.butler stated that in doing so,he would have noted that the binding authority limited the amount of premium eiu was authorized to accept on sphere drake behalf.on february,butler was again sent copies of the binding authority which contained the premium limit increase to million.by that time,sphere drake had increased the premium limit to million.stirling cooke did not,however,obtain a copy of that increase prior to placing the unicare retrocession.
in,web management llc web,acting on behalf of all american,approached eiu through stirling cooke to procure reinsurance protection for all american participation in a reinsurance contract issued to unicare insurance company.on june,eiu agreed to provide such coverage on behalf of sphere drake,and the coverage was bound pursuant to the unicare slip according to sphere drake,the slip involved premium in the amount of that was to be counted against eiu alleged premium limit 
that same month,sphere drake became concerned with eiu administration of the binding authority,and it began an audit of the eiu binder.michael mather and john coppinger,two employees from the arm of sphere drake,conducted the audit at eiu offices on july and.in their report,which they presented to sphere drake senior management on august,the auditors stated that eiu had exceeded its premium cap of million.two days later,on august,watson told whitcombe that eiu had exceeded the premium cap and that eiu needed to stop underwriting.
the premium due under the unicare slip was to be paid in quarterly installments throughout the year.by the end of,all american had paid in premium less eiu commission to sphere drake.in december,all american,via stirling cooke,requested that sphere drake post a letter of credit covering incurred losses on the unicare retrocession.sphere drake refused to do so and asserted in a letter dated december,which was copied to stirling cooke,that it was reserving its position with respect to all american request pending a review of the binding authority.that same week,on january,sphere drake reiterated its position to stirling cooke.later that month,a representative of fairfax sphere drake parent company spoke to a senior of all american and offered to return the premiums accepted under the unicare retrocession.all american refused.on february,all american acknowledged in a letter from the company general counsel that as of january,sphere drake had taken issue with eiu authority to place business.in march,sphere drake sought to rescind the unicare policy and return the premium.when all american rejected sphere drake offer,sphere drake refused to pay any claims arising under the reinsurance contract.in response,all american commenced arbitration which,after the lengthy litigation discussed above,led to this matter.
before proceeding to the merits,we briefly address the issue in this case,a matter which neither party disputes on appeal.the unicare retrocession provides that t his contract of reinsurance shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the state of illinois,before the district court,sphere drake argued that this provision is inapplicable to whether there is a binding contract.instead,it stated that the district court should apply english law because the united kingdom has the most significant relationship to the transaction.the court held,however,that since illinois and english law with regard to the disputed issues are the same,t his issue need not be decided.based on the same sound reasoning,as well as the fact that both parties rely on illinois law in their briefs to this court,we,too,will apply illinois law.see gould artisoft,cir where the parties have not identified a conflict between the two bodies of state law that might apply to their dispute,we will apply the law of the forum state.
turning to the merits,we must determine if the district court was correct that there is no issue of material fact that eiu was not,at the time the unicare retrocession was signed,sphere drake agent.agency is a fiduciary relationship in which the agent has the power to act on the principal behalf.amcore bank,d.an agent authority may be either actual or apparent id.however,o nly the alleged principal words and conduct,not those of the alleged agent,establish the agent authority.id.finally,the party alleging an agency relationship,here all american,bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.id.
with those background principles in mind,we turn to whether eiu had the actual authority to bind sphere drake to the retrocession.an agent has express authority when the principal explicitly grants the agent the authority to perform a particular act.id.here,the evidence is clear that at the time eiu signed the retrocession it did not have the authority to do so.the binding authority capped the amount of estimated gross premium eiu was permitted to write with respect to each given year.increases to the premium limit,moreover,were accomplished over time only by endorsement.all american can not point to any evidence that the premium limit was ever increased above million,an amount that eiu exceeded before it entered into the unicare retrocession it is undisputed that for eiu wrote contracts prior to the unicare retrocession in the amount of.
in the face of this evidence,all american relies on eiu business plan which was provided to sphere drake at the beginning of negotiations over the binding authority and was initialed and agreed to by sphere drake to argue that the contractual premium limit was increased to million.the plan,however,merely forecasted that gross premiums would increase to million for and million for in fact,all american argument is a bit odd based on the business plan,the premium increase in should have been million,not the million amount all american focuses on.the business plan,moreover,was executed prior to the binding authority,which is the actual agency contract.
equally unconvincing is all american argument that the meetings and correspondence between sphere drake and eiu during evidence sphere drake agreement to increase the premium limit to million.the evidence establishes that whitcombe did meet with watson,who looked favorably upon increasing the premium level.watson,however,clearly told whitcombe that whitcombe had to further discuss the matter with broad.in the meantime,watson wrote that whitcombe should continue with business as usual the only reasonable interpretation of which is that the premium level remained at the million level.
therefore,at the time the unicare retrocession was written,the premium limit in the binding authority was million,and because that limit was already exceeded,eiu lacked the actual authority to accept the unicare retrocession.the district court finding that there was no issue of material fact that eiu lacked the actual authority to accept the unicare retrocession was clearly correct.
we next turn to whether eiu had the apparent authority to accept the retrocession.illinois law has long recognized the doctrine of apparent authority.see,gilbert sycamore mun.as the illinois supreme court has noted,
a principal will be bound by not only that authority which he actually gives to another,but also by the authority which he appears to give.apparent authority in an agent is the authority which the principal knowingly permits the agent to assume,or the authority which the principal holds the agent out as possessing.it is the authority which a reasonably prudent person,exercising diligence and discretion,in view of the principal conduct,would naturally suppose the agent to possess.where the principal creates the appearance of authority,the principal will not be heard to deny the agency to the prejudice of an innocent party,who has been led to rely upon the appearance of authority in the agent.
id.citations omitted.
under illinois law,the party asserting the existence of apparent authority,here all american,must meet a test 
the principal consented to or knowingly acquiesced in the agent exercise of authority based on the actions of the principal and agent,the third person reasonably concluded that the party was an agent of the principal and the third person justifiably and detrimentally relied on the agent apparent authority.
amcore bank,at.we will address each part of the test in turn.
to begin,the evidence establishes that sphere drake did not knowingly acquiesce in eiu exercise of authority.as noted above,the binding authority explicitly limited eiu authority to agree to premiums above a certain the time million.it was not until august the retrocession was signed on june,that sphere drake had knowledge regarding the cost of the unicare retrocession or the fact that the premium limit had been exceeded.in fact,the evidence shows that the most recent bordereau eiu provided to sphere drake prior to accepting the unicare retrocession was in may.that bordereau specifically indicated that eiu was still within the premium limits.because of this misrepresentation,it was not possible for sphere drake to knowingly acquiesce in eiu actions.
second,and in many ways more significant,it was not reasonable for all american to conclude that eiu was,at the time,authorized to bind sphere drake to the retrocession.as the restatement second of agency makes clear,
if a person has means of knowledge reasonably open to him as to the limits of the agent authority,he can not hold the principal unless he uses ordinary diligence to ascertain them,even in those situations in which a principal is otherwise held although the agent goes beyond his authority.he has means of knowledge if he knows or has reason to know that the authority is evidenced by a document open to and intended for his inspection.
restatement second of agency cmt.see also general ref.plumb.goodwill indus.of louis,missouri,d,the principal may act on a presumption that third persons dealing with the agent will not be negligent in failing to ascertain the extent of his authority as well as the existence of his agency quoting d,agency.lawcock trotting ass n,d,third person asserting apparent authority may not act negligently with regard to extent of agent authority or blindly trust agent statement application of lester,misc d,stating that t he ordinary rule is that diligence to ascertain if an agent is exceeding his authority devolves on those who deal with him,not on his principal quoting richmond guano dupont de nemours,cir.
here,all american had the means to determine the extent of eiu authority.stirling cooke,at the time all american agent more on this later,knew that eiu authority to accept business for sphere drake was limited by a premium cap contained in the binding authority.in fact,by february,stirling cooke had obtained a copy of the binding authority showing a premium limit of million there is no evidence that stirling cooke knew that sphere drake increased the premium limit to million.equally significant,it had knowledge that eiu had already written premium in excess of million and,in fact,million.indeed,prior to placing the unicare retrocession,stirling cooke had placed contracts with eiu with premiums to sphere drake totaling over million.whether it knew the exact limit or not,a reasonable broker in stirling cooke situation who knew about the limit in the binding authority would have investigated what the dollar limit was.we can not therefore say that it exercised due diligence or that it was reasonable to believe that eiu had the authority to bind sphere drake at the time it signed the retrocession.
nevertheless,all american argues that it acted reasonably and that it had no obligation to determine the limits of eiu authority prior to placing the retrocession.specifically,it contends,quoting a decision from the court of appeals of indiana,that the law is clear that a third person dealing with an agent is not bound to inquire into his specific authority,nor is the principal protected by secret limitations upon the authority of such an agent.yellow acceptance voss.all american also points to american insurance meyer steel drum,wl,at.june,for the proposition that w here an agent has apparent authority to act,the principal will be liable in spite of undisclosed limitations the principal has placed on that authority.reliance on these cases is misplaced,however.eiu authority was not constrained by undisclosed or secret limitations.to the contrary,stirling cooke knew that eiu was bound by a premium cap,it just did not know what the exact limit was.
a contrast with meyer steel drum,which all american argues is similar to the present case,is illustrative.there,in support of the conclusion that the purported agent had apparent authority,the court found t here is no evidence demonstrating that meyer steel drum disclosed to american that the agent was authorized only to secure insurance with annual premiums not exceeding.in other words,there was no evidence that american knew about any premium limit.in such a circumstance,it may be reasonable for the insurer not to inquire into whether a limit existed and,if so,what the value of the limit was.that is a critically different situation than the one all american faces,where it knew eiu authority was confined,had knowledge that the limit it was aware of had been exceeded,and knew the limit was subject to change.
all american also relies on industry custom.custom and practice in the industry is relevant towards determining whether a third party acted reasonably and diligently.see,property advisory group,bevona,examining practice and custom in determining apparent authority issue lincoln cardinal partners barrick,d,same.here,several witnesses testified that the normal practice is that a broker such as stirling cooke does not have a duty to determine if there is a premium cap or to monitor the amount of gross premium written by an underwriter like eiu.in a traditional situation,such a custom makes sense.a third party may not know the existence of a premium cap and would usually lack the necessary information as to an agent other business.in this particular circumstance,however,such a custom carries little weight.first,stirling cooke knew that a premium cap existed and knew it was subject to change.even more significant,the vast majority of the business eiu conducted on behalf of sphere drake was with stirling cooke.in fact,of the contracts eiu accepted for sphere drake prior to the unicare retrocession totaling over million,stirling cooke brokered all but one of them for which the estimated premium to sphere drake was.stirling cooke did not have to monitor all of eiu business to determine if eiu had exceeded the premium cap.it only had to keep track of the business it had done.
finally,all american contends that requiring it to monitor eiu actions would constitute unsound public policy.it has long been established,however,that one who deals with an agent takes the risk not only of ascertaining whether the person with whom he is dealing is the agent,but also of ascertaining the scope of his powers.ernst searle,cal.see also henry modell city of new york,those who deal with agents must ascertain the extent of the agents authority,or else proceed at their own risk.in sum,stirling cooke had knowledge that eiu was constrained by a premium limit and knew that by itself stirling cooke,before the unicare retrocession,entered into business with eiu totaling over million.contrary to all american suggestion that knowledge that there is a premium limit that will be increased over time is far different from knowing what the limit is,considering the facts of this case,we believe it would have constituted a minimal burden to ascertain the limits of eiu authority.in fact,a simple phone call inquiring into the premium limit would have done the trick.any reliance on eiu authority was thus unreasonable and can not be used to create the existence of apparent authority.
in the alternative,all american contends that stirling cooke knowledge of eiu lack of authority can not be imputed to all american because stirling cooke acted as a neutral reinsurance intermediary between the parties,rather than as any party agent.a reinsurance intermediary,however,is considered an agent.whether a broker is an agent for the insured,the insurer or both,however,is a question of fact.capitol indem.stewart smith intermediaries,d.see also philan ins.frank hall,specific factual situation demonstrating the parties
