plaintiff appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court granted defendant motion for directed verdict in this action alleging breach of an insurance contract and bad faith denial of coverage.the trial court expressed its intention to instruct the jury that plaintiff property damage loss was covered by his policy only if it was caused by perils specifically listed in the collapse coverage provision and no others.because it was undisputed that other perils contributed to some extent to the loss,plaintiff conceded he could not prevail if the jury was so instructed.the trial court also granted defendant motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff claim for punitive damages.plaintiff appeals,contending the trial court intended jury instruction violated the efficient proximate cause doctrine and there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to determine whether plaintiff met his burden of proving his claim for punitive damages.we find no error in the ruling on the punitive damages claim.we find merit in plaintiff challenge to the proposed jury instruction.accordingly,we reverse and remand for retrial of plaintiff causes of action alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,but not the claim for punitive damages.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff owned a rental house covered by an insurance policy issued by defendant.on december,he submitted a claim that stated plaintiff believed there was water damage to the flooring that might have come from the walls,and there was mold as well.defendant sent an independent insurance adjustor,douglas hoppe,to investigate the claim the next day.hoppe viewed the condition of the house and took photographs.his initial report stated the house seemed to be settling,possibly due to a water leak.the floors in some of the rooms were sinking,the bathtub was sinking,water was drizzling out of both the shower head and the bathtub faucet,the front door would not open,and there was mold in every room.plaintiff told the adjustor the tenants had reported the problem to him two or three months before,and he had asked them to move out so repairs could be made.plaintiff reported his claim to defendant after the tenants moved out.
the independent adjustor recommended defendant have an engineer inspect the house.in january,michael jundt,a structural engineer,inspected the site and took photographs he returned later,with plaintiff permission,to cut a hole in the floor to gain access to the subfloor area and investigate conditions below the house.
jundt report reflected multiple potential leaks in the roof,gutters in disrepair,downspouts that originally deposited water at the base of the walls of the house,but had become disconnected from the gutters,and evidence that a faucet or hose had been spraying the wall in one area for a significant length of time.he found water damage corresponding to these areas.jundt reported the toilet and bathtub both leaked,and the floor beneath the bathtub had sunk two and a half inches.the northwest bedroom had a depression in the floor,eight inches deep and five to six feet across there was damage due to leakage from the toilet in the closet of that bedroom.the closet in the southwest bedroom showed evidence of past damage and multiple repairs.the kitchen was water damaged and showed evidence of past termite infestation.the wood at the base of the back door to the kitchen and the utility room floor near the exterior door were also rotted and damaged by past termite infestation.the living room floor was not level and was separating from the wall.
the subfloor area lacked adequate ventilation,preventing the moisture below the house from drying.jundt opined the original construction of the subfloor area without proper ventilation was not up to code at the time of construction.the various sources of moisture roof leaks,gutters and downspouts that did not channel the water away from the house,a faucet spraying water on the exterior of the house,leaking toilet and bathtub,and humidity contributed to the damage to the house,along with poor construction,termite damage and decay.
defendant denied coverage of plaintiff loss,citing multiple policy exclusions,including exclusions for damage caused by seepage or leakage of water from a plumbing system,deterioration,mold,wet or dry rot,settling of foundations,walls or floors,earth movement,water damage,neglect,weather conditions,acts or decisions of any person,and faulty or defective design,workmanship,repair,construction,or maintenance.plaintiff then retained a public adjustor,michael decesare,to assist him in his claim.decesare wrote to defendant and expressed his disagreement with defendant conclusion that the loss was not covered by the policy.
dissatisfied with defendant response to decesare communications,plaintiff filed suit against defendant,alleging breach of the insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.plaintiff alleged the house collapsed and the policy provided coverage for collapse.the policy,excluded coverage for collapse,other than as provided in other coverages.other coverage provided coverage for losses involving collapse of a building or part of a building caused only by one or more of a list of perils,including hidden decay,hidden insect damage,and weight of contents,equipment,or people.
at trial,hoppe testified to the damage he observed in his investigation of the loss.jundt testified to his investigation of the loss and gave his opinions regarding the causes of the damage to plaintiff house.testimony from plaintiff and the former tenants addressed the condition of the house prior to the time plaintiff reported the damage to defendant.
plaintiff expert,robert bresee,a general contractor,testified to perceived errors in jundt report,and to his opinions of the condition of the house and the cause of the damage.he had to open up the floor to investigate the cause of the damage.he noted the floors in the northwest bedroom and the living room were resting on the ground,and opined the cause was dry rot,decay,and termite damage.he opined the water in the subfloor area came from within the walls,where it was not readily visible to occupants of the house.
the evidence presented by both sides indicated there were multiple causes of the damage to plaintiff house.plaintiff theory was that the coverage for collapse due to hidden decay or hidden insect damage applied,if either of those perils was the predominant cause of the collapse of the structure.plaintiff requested that the trial court give a standard jury instruction explaining that,when a loss is caused by a combination of covered and excluded risks,the loss is covered if the most important or predominant cause is a covered risk.caci.defendant instead proposed a special jury instruction placing on plaintiff the burden of proving the collapse of the house was caused only by one or more of the perils listed in other coverage.defendant special instruction specified that there was no coverage if the cause of the collapse involved any peril other than those listed.plaintiff opposed giving the special instruction proposed by defendant.
when the trial court indicated its intention to give part of defendant proposed special instruction,plaintiff indicated that giving such an instruction was tantamount to directing a verdict in favor of defendant,because there was no dispute the damage to the house was caused by perils in addition to those listed in other coverage.defendant then moved for a directed verdict on both causes of action.the trial court granted the motion,concluding defendant proposed special instruction was legally correct,based on the unambiguous language of the other coverage provision of the policy.the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant,and plaintiff appeals.

ii.contract provisions 
plaintiff insurance policy indicated coverage a covered his dwelling.the basic insuring provision of the policy,defining perils insured against,stated 
we insure for risk of direct physical loss to the property described in coverages a and b except 
collapse other than as provided in other coverage 
the other coverage section contained a list of six items 
collapse we insure for risk of direct physical loss to covered property involving collapse of a building or any part of a building caused only by one or more of the following 
a perils insured against in coverage c personal property these perils apply to covered building and personal property for loss insured by this other coverage 
b hidden decay 
c hidden insect or vermin damage 
d weight of contents equipment animals or people 
e weight of rain which collects on a roof 
f use of defective material or methods in construction remodeling or renovation if the collapse occurs during the course of the construction remodeling or renovation.
the general exclusions section of the policy contained exclusions for earth movement,water damage,neglect by the insured,inadequate or defective design,workmanship,construction,remodeling,or materials,and inadequate or defective maintenance.
plaintiff contends other coverage provides coverage for the damage to his house,because the building,or part of the building,collapsed and the predominant cause of the loss was hidden decay and hidden insect damage.plaintiff contends that,pursuant to the efficient proximate cause doctrine,because the predominant cause of the loss was a covered peril,the policy provides coverage for the loss despite any other peril that contributed to the loss,and the trial court should have determined that a jury instruction to that effect should have been given.
iii.efficient proximate cause doctrine 
in california,the efficient proximate cause doctrine is the preferred method for resolving first party insurance disputes involving losses caused by multiple risks or perils,at least one of which is covered by insurance and one of which is not.julian hartford underwriters ins.cal th,julian.it is codified in insurance code section,which provides an insurer is liable for a loss of which a peril insured against was the proximate cause,although a peril not contemplated by the contract may have been a remote cause of the loss but he is not liable for a loss of which the peril insured against was only a remote cause.
insurance code section appears to conflict with insurance code section if a peril is specially excepted in a contract of insurance and there is a loss which would not have occurred but for such peril,such loss is thereby excepted even though the immediate cause of the loss was a peril which was not excepted.the supreme court resolved the apparent conflict between these sections in sabella wisler cal d.in sabella,the insurer relied on insurance code section in arguing that,if the loss would not have occurred but for the excluded peril,then the exclusion precluded coverage for the loss.sabella,at.the court rejected that argument i f section were construed in the manner contended for by defendant insurer,where an excepted peril operated to any extent in the chain of causation so that the resulting harm would not have occurred but for the excepted peril operation,the insurer would be exempt even though an insured peril was the proximate cause of the loss.ibid.that result would be contrary to section,which provided for coverage when the peril insured against proximately caused the loss.sabella,at.the court interpreted the but for cause referred to in section to mean the peril that proximately caused the loss,and the immediate cause of the loss to mean the peril immediate in time to the occurrence of the damage.sabella,at pp.the court established this general rule i n determining whether a loss is within an exception in a policy,where there is a concurrence of different causes,the efficient cause the one that sets others in motion is the cause to which the loss should be attributed,though the other causes may follow it,and operate more immediately in producing the disaster.id.at pp.garvey state farm fire casualty cal d,garvey.
the efficient proximate cause referred to in sabella has also been called the predominant cause or the most important cause of the loss.garvey,supra,cal d at julian,supra,cal th at.by focusing the causal inquiry on the most important cause of a loss,the efficient proximate cause doctrine creates a workable rule of coverage that provides a fair result within the reasonable expectations of both the insured and the insurer.julian,at.
policy exclusions are unenforceable to the extent that they conflict with insurance code section and the efficient proximate cause doctrine.julian,supra,cal th at.thus,an insurer can not contract around the efficient proximate cause doctrine to give broader effect to its policy exclusions.
in garvey,the plaintiffs house was insured with an homeowner policy issued by the defendant.garvey,supra,cal d at.the policy insured against all risks of physical loss to the property covered,unless coverage was excluded.ibid.it excluded losses caused by,resulting from,contributed to or aggravated by any earth movement and losses caused by settling of foundations,walls,floors,roofs or ceilings.id.at pp.
an addition to the plaintiffs house began to pull away from the main structure,and they filed a claim with the insurer.the defendant denied the claim,based on the exclusions for earth movement and settling.garvey,supra,cal d at.the plaintiffs sued,contending the loss was caused by contractor negligence,and such negligence was not an excluded peril under the policy.ibid.the court held the efficient proximate cause rule applied to the plaintiffs first party property damage claim,rejecting application of a concurrent proximate cause rule applicable in third party liability insurance cases.id.at pp.the court reversed the trial court directed verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and remanded so a properly instructed jury could decide which peril was the efficient proximate cause of the plaintiffs loss.id.at pp.
thus,although the policy purported to exclude coverage if earth movement or settling merely contributed to the loss,the court held the efficient proximate cause doctrine applied,so that the exclusion precluded coverage only if an excluded peril earth movement or settling was the efficient proximate cause of the plaintiffs loss.garvey,supra,cal d at pp.
in howell state farm fire casualty d howell the plaintiff property was located on a hillside subject to landslides.howell,at.one summer,a fire destroyed the vegetation on the slope the following winter,unusually heavy rains combined with the bare slope to cause a landslide,which damaged structures on the plaintiff property.the plaintiff expert concluded the landslide probably would not have occurred if the groundcover had not been destroyed.ibid.
the plaintiff homeowners policy insured against accidental direct physical loss to the dwelling and other structures.howell,supra,d at.it excluded coverage of loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events.we do not insure for such loss regardless of a the cause of the excluded event or b other causes of the loss or c whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss ibid.earth movement and water damage were on the list of excluded events.id.at pp.
after the plaintiff insurer denied her claim,she sued the defendant moved for summary judgment,relying on the exclusions for earth movement and water damage.howell,supra,d at.the plaintiff argued the fire was the efficient proximate cause of the loss,because it permitted the landslide to occur.the trial court granted the defendant motion.ibid.
on appeal,the defendant contended the exclusion precluded coverage because the loss would not have occurred but for the excluded peril of earth movement.the court responded stated simply,the important question presented by this case is whether a property insurer may contractually exclude coverage when a covered peril is the efficient proximate cause of the loss,but an excluded peril has contributed or was necessary to the loss.we conclude that a property insurer may not limit its liability in this manner,since the statutory and judicial law of this state make the insurer liable whenever a covered peril is the efficient proximate cause of the loss,regardless of other contributing causes.consequently,the policy exclusions at issue in this case are not enforceable to the extent they conflict with california law.howell,supra,d at,fn.omitted.because there was a triable issue of fact regarding whether the fire or earth movement was the efficient proximate cause of the loss,the court reversed the summary judgment.id.at pp.
plaintiff contentions 
plaintiff contends the language caused only by one or more of the following in other coverage means that this is a complete list of the perils causing collapse that are covered under the policy.if any one or any combination of the listed perils causes the collapse,the loss is covered.if some unlisted peril contributes to the collapse,the efficient proximate cause doctrine requires that the jury determine which cause is the predominant or most important.if the predominant cause is a peril listed in other coverage,then the loss by collapse would be covered.if the predominant cause is not a listed peril,then the loss would not be covered.
consistent with this interpretation,plaintiff requested that the jury be instructed with caci,which provides 
you have heard evidence that the claimed loss was caused by a combination of covered and excluded risks under the insurance policy.when a loss is caused by a combination of covered and excluded risks under the policy,the loss is covered only if the most important or predominant cause is a covered risk.
defendant contentions 
defendant contends caused only by one or more of the following in other coverage has a more restrictive effect than plaintiff interpretation gives it.defendant contends the use of the word only means that a collapse is a covered loss only if no peril other than those listed contributes to the collapse.in its view,the decision in julian,supra,cal th,authorizes the use of interactive perils to define an exclusion,so it is permissible to cover collapse caused only by one or a combination of specified perils.defendant contends the efficient proximate cause doctrine does not apply to such a provision.under defendant interpretation,if any peril other than those listed in other coverage contributes to the collapse in any way or to any degree,then coverage is excluded.
the trial court agreed with defendant and indicated it would instruct the jury with defendant proposed special instruction,and would not give caci.defendant proposed special instruction,as the trial court intended to give it,states 
vardanyan contends that the damage to his property is covered under the insurance policy provision for collapse to a building or any part of a building caused by hidden decay or hidden insect or vermin damage.
if you find that the property or a part of the property collapsed,vardanyan bears the burden of proving that the collapse was caused only by one or more of the following 
fire or lightning windstorm or hail explosion riot or civil commotion aircraft vehicles smoke vandalism or malicious mischief damage by burglars falling objects weight of ice,snow,or sleet accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing,heating,or air conditioning system,or from within a household appliance sudden and accidental tearing apart,cracking,burning or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system,an air conditioning system,or an appliance for heating water freezing of a plumbing,heating or air conditioning system or of a household appliance sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current 
hidden decay 
hidden insect or vermin damage 
weight of contents,equipment,animals or people 
weight of rain which collects on a roof 
use of defective material or methods in construction,remodeling or renovation if the collapse occurs during the course of the construction,remodeling or renovation.
the insurance policy coverage for collapse does not apply if the cause of the collapse involved any cause other than those listed above.
iv.julian hartford underwriters ins.
in julian,heavy rains caused the slope above the plaintiffs home to fail this led to a landslide which caused a tree to crash into the plaintiffs house.julian,supra,cal th at.their homeowners policy insured against risks of direct physical loss to property,unless the loss was excluded.the exclusions section provided we do not insure against loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss ibid.the list that followed included earth movement defined to include landslide and water damage.a second exclusion provided a loss was not covered if it was caused by weather conditions.however,this exclusion only applies if weather conditions contribute in any way with a cause or event excluded in the prior list to produce the loss id.at pp.it was undisputed that losses proximately caused by weather conditions that did not contribute with an excluded cause were covered by the policy.id.at.
the insurer moved for summary judgment,contending the policy excluded each of the perils that might be the efficient proximate cause of the loss earth movement,third party negligence,and weather conditions that contributed with landslide,an excluded cause.julian,supra,cal th at.the trial court granted the motion.the court summarized the plaintiffs argument on appeal 
the policy purports to exclude losses caused by weather conditions,but only where weather conditions contribute in any way with earth movement,landslide,water damage,flood,or another,excluded peril.under the plain terms of the policy,losses caused by weather conditions that do not contribute in any way with earth movement,water damage,are covered.thus the coverage inquiry turns on whether earth movement,water damage,or the like contribute d in any way with weather conditions to create a loss.this contribute s in any way language,they posit,has the same sweeping and pernicious effect as the policy terms involved in howell and garvey had,in that it allows the insurer to defeat coverage for a loss proximately caused by weather conditions merely by finding a remote peril somewhere no matter how distant,minor,or independent from the weather conditions in the causal background.hartford,meanwhile,argues that the weather conditions clause properly excludes a specific peril,and that neither insurance code section nor the efficient proximate cause doctrine prohibits it from defining excluded perils as it chooses.julian,supra,cal th at pp.
the court framed the threshold question as whether insurance code section and the efficient proximate cause doctrine inflexibly prohibit an insurer from insuring against some manifestations of weather conditions,but not others.julian,supra,cal th at.the court concluded they did not.ibid.it expressed concern that,in some situations,the contribute in any way with language linking weather conditions to other excluded perils could be used to circumvent the efficient proximate cause doctrine.id.at.in julian,however,the court addressed only the application of the weather conditions clause to a loss occasioned by a landslide.ibid.it considered the peril of landslide to be a genuine one,not a mere drafting fiction,and a commonly understood risk of loss.ibid.the landslide was not an independent cause of the plaintiffs loss,but was dependent on the weather condition of heavy rains.the court concluded t o the extent the weather conditions clause excludes the specific peril of rain inducing a landslide,there is no violation of section or the efficient proximate cause doctrine.ibid.
application to this case 
contract interpretation 
as a question of law,the interpretation of an insurance policy is reviewed de novo under rules of contract interpretation.zurich american ins.cal th.the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage citation,controls judicial interpretation.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th.any ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds favor,consistent with the insureds reasonable expectations.safeco ins.robert cal th.policy exclusions are strictly construed exceptions to exclusions are broadly construed in favor of the insured,at.
the policy coverage for plaintiff house is or open peril coverage the policy provides that plaintiff is insured for risk of direct physical loss to the property,with specified exceptions or exclusions one of the exceptions to coverage is collapse other than as provided in other coverage.as provided in other coverage,the policy covers collapse caused only by one or more of specified perils.as defendant construes this provision,it runs afoul of the efficient proximate cause doctrine.defendant construction would exclude coverage any time a peril not listed in other coverage contributed to the loss,even minimally.under defendant construction,even if the collapse was predominantly caused by a listed peril,such as hidden decay or hidden insect damage,if an unlisted peril contributed to it in some minor way,coverage would be excluded.
julian does not change the result.the policy provision in issue in julian defined an exclusion from coverage.it took one specified peril and provided that coverage for it was excluded,but only when it combined with specified excluded perils.the court did not hold that the provision was valid in all cases.in fact,it expressed its concern that,under other circumstances,the provision could be used to circumvent the efficient proximate cause doctrine.julian,supra,cal th at.julian held only that the combination of perils in issue in that case effectively created a single peril landslide that was a genuine peril,understandable to a reasonable insured.therefore,the court concluded the provision did not violate the efficient proximate cause doctrine.
here,the policy provision in issue defines coverage,not an exclusion.it provides that collapse is covered if caused by specific listed perils.under defendant interpretation,if any of the specified perils combined with any other unspecified peril to cause the collapse,coverage would be excluded.defendant has not shown that any of the listed perils plaintiff relies on for coverage,when combined with any unlisted peril defendant contends caused or contributed to the loss,created a single peril,that is a genuine peril,and that a reasonable insured would readily understand to be a separate,excludable peril.
the combination of a listed,covered peril or perils,with a host of potential unspecified,unlisted perils is in itself problematic.a reasonable insured would not anticipate that a listed,covered peril,if combined with some completely unrelated,unspecified peril,would result in an exclusion of coverage.this is particularly true when the provision is a coverage provision,not an exclusion a reasonable insured would understand that,if one of the specified perils was the predominant or most important cause of the collapse,the loss would be covered.
further,the combined peril in julian landslide was one to which each individual peril contributed substantially.it did not present a situation in which exclusion would result even though the otherwise excluded peril contributed only minimally to the loss,while the otherwise covered peril contributed the lion share.here,no such link has been shown between any listed and unlisted perils alleged to have contributed to the loss.
defendant also cites freedman state farm ins.th freedman as another case approving the policy exclusion of interactive perils.the freedman court concluded julian applie d straightforwardly to its case.id.at.we disagree.
in freedman,a contractor drove a nail through a pipe while remodeling the plaintiffs bathroom.freedman,supra,th at.the plaintiffs discovered it years later,after corrosion around the nail caused a leak and extensive water damage.the plaintiffs policy contained exclusions for corrosion and water damage,including leakage from a plumbing system.id.at.it provided that those exclusions would apply regardless of whether one or more of the following a directly or indirectly cause,contribute to or aggravate the loss or b occur before,at the same time,or after the loss or any other cause of the loss.the list that followed included defect,inadequacy,or fault in design,workmanship,or construction of any property,which the court referred to as a third party negligence provision.ibid.
when the defendant denied coverage,the plaintiffs sued,contending the contractor negligence,a covered peril,was the predominant or efficient proximate cause of the loss.freedman,supra,th at.the defendant moved for summary judgment,contending it did not matter which peril was the efficient proximate cause of the loss because each possible efficient proximate cause was excluded corrosion,leakage of water,and third party negligence when it interacted with an excluded peril,such as corrosion or leakage.id.at.the court affirmed the trial court grant of the defendant summary judgment motion.
the court analyzed the application of julian to its facts as follows 
the third party negligence provisions of the freedmans policy exclude third parties negligent conduct and defective workmanship whenever they interact with an excluded peril,just as the julians policy excluded weather conditions whenever they interacted with an excluded peril.corrosion and continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water are excluded perils under the freedmans policy,just as earth movement was excluded under the julians policy.thus,the freedmans policy excludes corrosion and continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water,just as the julians policy excluded a landslide.the freedmans have introduced no evidence that contractor negligence caused their loss in any way apart from the nail role in triggering corrosion and a water leak,just as the julians introduced no evidence that weather conditions caused their loss in any way apart from rain role in triggering a landslide.accordingly,the freedmans loss is not covered,just as the julians loss was not covered.freedman,supra,th at pp.
the julians policy excluded weather conditions when they combined with specified excluded perils to cause the loss.the freedman policy,however,did not exclude coverage for third party negligence.rather,it provided that the exclusions,including the exclusions for corrosion and leakage of water,would be effective regardless of whether other perils,including covered perils such as third party negligence,combined with the excluded perils to cause the loss.that provision violated the efficient proximate cause doctrine,because it would exclude coverage even if the covered peril was the predominant cause of the loss and the excluded peril was a minimal contributing factor.
the freedman court equated corrosion and leakage with the julians landslide without analysis.the julian court did not conclude that every exclusion of interacting perils in a policy is acceptable and does not violate the efficient proximate cause rule.it stated that,if the exclusion of weather conditions when combined with other excluded perils would permit the insurer to deny coverage when the loss was caused percent by weather conditions and percent by earth movement or water damage,it would raise troubling questions regarding the clause consistency with the efficient proximate cause doctrine.denial of coverage for such a loss would suggest the provision of illusory insura
