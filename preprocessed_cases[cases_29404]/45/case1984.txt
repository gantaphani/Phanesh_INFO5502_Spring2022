cahill appeals.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.although cahill brief appears to raise six challenges on appeal,we consider only one.we need not consider the others,because they were either inadequately preserved or presented,or the result would not be altered even if they were successful.the one challenge we address on the merits is cahill claim that he is entitled to equitable tolling but we reject the argument that the limitations periods should have been tolled until american family informed him that it had not paid benefits required by law.
background 
the relevant facts are largely undisputed.to the extent that they are,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to cahill because we are reviewing a summary judgment against him.see milne usa cycling,cir.
on january,cahill was driving a car that was struck by a vehicle driven by a drunk,uninsured motorist.cahill,who was years old,suffered severe injuries,including a brain injury that left him in a coma.he was hospitalized for about five months.
after cahill release from the hospital,he moved back in with his parents,where he remained until.while living at home,cahill continued to receive speech,physical,occupational,recreational,and language therapy as an outpatient.
at the time of his accident,cahill was insured under his father automobile policy issued by american family.the policy provided pip coverage.because of the extent of cahill injuries,his pip coverage was quickly depleted,and on march,american family informed his father that cahill pip benefits had been exhausted.
cahill pip coverage was the minimum required under colorado law.under the colorado auto accident reparations act caara.et,which governed automobile insurance at the time of cahill accident,insurers were required to offer,for an increased premium,enhanced pip coverage in addition to the minimum coverage.see.see generally clark state farm mut.auto.ins,cir describing the pip requirements of caara.but many american family policyholders,including cahill father,had not been offered such enhanced pip benefits.
several american family policyholders filed separate putative and lawsuits against american family based on its caara violations.each sought,among other things,reformation of the policy so that the policyholders would be entitled to the enhanced pip benefits.three putative suits are noted by the parties.the first was french american family,filed in colorado state court in november.the french plaintiffs alleged and claims on behalf of a putative class consisting of all holders of defective american family policies.class certification in french was denied on december.the next putative class action was marshall american family,which was filed in colorado state court in april.its claims were similar to those in french.class certification was denied on november.the third,hicks american family,was filed in june in colorado state court.hicks sought reformation of insurance policies on behalf of a class of insureds that included cahill.the hicks class was certified and reformation was granted on november.
meanwhile,american family began reviewing its policies in late and ultimately concluded that it had not complied with colorado law.in may american family voluntarily notified some policyholders that they might be eligible for policy reformation.although american family contends that it notified cahill,he has denied receiving the notification.
in the spring of,american family,acting under a court order in hicks,notified cahill that he was entitled to enhanced pip benefits.cahill acknowledges receiving this notification.on august,american family determined that it owed cahill in additional pip benefits for his injury,and it paid him that amount.on august cahill commenced this action in colorado state court.
after american family removed the case to federal district court,cahill filed an amended complaint alleging five causes of action fraudulent misrepresentation,because in american family falsely represented to him that his pip benefits had been exhausted concealment,because american family had failed to disclose that its policy did not comply with colorado law,even though it had known of the noncompliance since breach of insurance contract,because american family had knowingly failed to provide him with the enhanced pip benefits to which he was entitled outrageous conduct,because american family had failed to provide enhanced pip benefits and had not investigated whether this failure would cause him harm,thereby intentionally inflicting emotional distress on him and violation of the colorado consumer protection act ccpa.et,because american family had misrepresented the qualities and benefits of its insurance coverage.
american family moved for summary judgment,arguing that all of cahill claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.the district court granted the motion and dismissed cahill claims.according to the district court,a limitations period applied to the claim,and a period applied to the other claims.it ruled that the,and ccpa claims had accrued by march,when american family sent notification that cahill pip benefits had expired,and that his concealment and claims had accrued no later than november,when american family knew that it had violated caara.it rejected cahill contention that the limitations periods were tolled by american family failure to inform him that he was entitled to additional pip benefits,reasoning that cahill could have ascertained that his policy failed to comply with colorado law even without such notification.the court assumed that the limitations periods for the and ccpa claims had been tolled during the pendency of the french litigation,which raised both claims but it calculated that the limitations periods for both claims would still have expired well before this litigation commenced.and even though cahill had recite d some facts that arguably could support a toll based on his incapacity,the court declined to consider such tolling because he had failed to put forth any meaningful argument regarding such a toll.cahill am.family mut.ins,wl,at.april,

standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see evers regents of of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.because the basis for the district court jurisdiction was diversity of citizenship,the accrual,limitations periods,and tolling determinations are governed by colorado substantive law.see state farm mut.auto.ins.boellstorff,cir.cahill bears the burden of establishing the factual foundation for tolling.see overheiser safeway stores.
issues on appeal 
in deciding what issues to address on appeal,we have no interest in denying relief to cahill on technical grounds.but it is not our role to serve as his lawyer.we will not construct arguments for him out of isolated sentences in his briefs.nor will we fill the gaps in undeveloped arguments unsupported by citations to relevant authority.see gross burggraf constr,cir.moreover,we must not be unfair to the opposing party,who should not be required to guess at what issues are being raised and must be addressed or,alternatively,to devote its brief to every argument that is possibly being raised.and it will be an unusual case in which we conside
