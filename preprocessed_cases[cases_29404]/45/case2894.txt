george and priscilla kapsimallis,ted kingsley,charles fontaine and anne splaver,individually and as proposed class representatives,filed a lawsuit against allstate insurance company,alleging allstate had intentionally denied valid claims for benefits after the northridge earthquake by improperly using january,as the date of loss for all claimants to establish whether a suit had been commenced within one year after a loss,as required by allstate policies,rather than determining the date of loss individually based on when the claimant reasonably should have discovered appreciable damage caused by the earthquake.
the trial court,assuming allstate had in fact used january,as the date of loss for all claimants,found the practice proper as a matter of law and granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings,holding plaintiffs could not allege a breach of contract,bad faith or a business and professions code section violation.because we conclude the analysis in com.insurance superior court cal d,is fully applicable to cases involving cataclysmic damage such as the northridge earthquake and precludes determining inception of the loss solely by the date of the occurrence of the physical event causing the loss,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs and the class they propose to represent are homeowners whose residences were insured,including earthquake coverage,through allstate at the time of the northridge earthquake.as required by insurance code section their policies provide that an insured has one year from the date of the loss to file an action against the insurer no suit or action may be brought against us allstate unless there has been full compliance with all the policy terms.any suit or action must be brought within one year after the loss.
alleging causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unfair,unlawful fraudulent business practices in violation of business and professions code section,plaintiffs contend allstate used the suit provision improperly to deny claims for earthquake benefits that should have been paid.specifically,they assert allstate wrongfully used january,the date of the earthquake,as the beginning of the period for all claimants,rather than determining the inception of the loss individually for each claimant based on when he or she reasonably should have discovered appreciable damage caused by the earthquake.
plaintiffs and the proposed class fall into two categories of insureds original claimants and supplemental claimants.the original claimants,whom fontaine and splaver propose to represent,are insureds who reasonably discovered appreciable damage to their homes and filed initial claims for policy benefits with allstate more than one year after the earthquake.these original claims were denied as untimely based on the suit provision.the supplemental claimants,whom the kapsimallises and kingsley propose to represent,are insureds who filed claims for policy benefits with allstate within one year of the earthquake.some received payment from allstate for damages others were informed the damage to their home was below their policy deductible.these insureds later discovered additional damage and filed supplemental claims with allstate.the total time that had elapsed between january,and the date of their initial claim,plus the time between conclusion of their initial claim and the date of their supplemental claim,exceeded one year.accordingly,allstate denied the supplemental claims as untimely based on the suit provision.
to facilitate resolution of the litigation,the trial court determined certain legal issues could be decided early in the case,before the issue of class certification was addressed the court directed the parties to brief the following issue as a matter of law,can the blanket use of january,as the triggering occurrence date with or without exceptions constitute a breach of contract,bad faith an unfair,unlawful or fraudulent business practice.after hearing argument and considering the parties briefs,the trial court issued a statement of decision,holding the date of loss applicable to all claimants was january,the date of the earthquake.the court found the analysis of the date of the inception of the loss applied in superior court,supra,cal d,in which the inception of loss was defined as that point in time in which appreciable damage occurs,is applicable only to progressive property damage such as from expansive soil as in prudential rather than cataclysmic damage such as an earthquake.the court concluded as a matter of law,the use of january,as the triggering occurrence does not constitute a breach of contract,bad faith a violation of business and professions code.the court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of allstate.
plaintiffs,individually and as proposed class representatives,filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions 
plaintiffs contend the trial court improperly found the inception of the loss analysis in,supra,cal d,inapplicable to cases involving cataclysmic damage such as the northridge earthquake.
discussion 
standard of review 
a judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant is appropriate when the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action.code civ,subd.c b ii.a motion for judgment on the pleadings is equivalent to a demurrer and is governed by the same de novo standard of review.gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d,mack state bar th,d.all properly pleaded,material facts are deemed true,but not contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law judicially noticeable matters may be considered.blank kirwan cal d,mack,at,d.
the trial court erred by finding uniform use of january,as the date of the inception of the loss for all claimants was proper 
definition of inception of the loss in 
section sets forth the standard form required for all fire insurance policies,which includes insurance against loss caused by earthquake,subd.a.this standard form provides that any action on the policy against the insurer must be commenced within months after the inception of the loss.no suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with,and unless commenced within months next after inception of the loss.
in,supra,cal d,the supreme court considered how to define the phrase inception of the loss for purposes of triggering section when the physical event causing the loss occurs some time before any damage is discovered by the insured.id.at.according to the court,inception of the loss is that point in time when appreciable damage occurs and is or should be known to the insured,such that a reasonable insured would be aware that his notification duty under the policy has been triggered.id.at.the court,therefore,held inception of the loss should be determined by reference to reasonable discovery of the loss and not necessarily turn on the occurrence of the physical event causing the loss.id.at.
to take advantage of the benefits of a delayed discovery rule,however,the insured is required to be diligent in the face of discovered facts.the more substantial or unusual the nature of the damage discovered by the insured,the greater its deviation from what a reasonable person would consider normal wear and tear,the greater the insured duty to notify his insurer of the loss promptly and diligently.citation,supra,cal d at.although the date of inception of the loss will,in many cases be an issue of fact for the jury to decide,w hen the evidence supports only one conclusion,summary judgment may be appropriate.id.at,see also id.at.
applies to the instant case 
the trial court found the inception of the loss definition from did not apply to this case because the northridge earthquake was a cataclysmic event and the date of loss was necessarily the date of the earthquake.we disagree that definition of inception of the loss is so limited.
in the court specifically held inception of the loss should be determined by reference to reasonable discovery of loss and not necessarily turn on the oc
