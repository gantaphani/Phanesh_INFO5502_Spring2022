these are from a district court decision that granted partial summary judgment to each side in an insurance coverage dispute,which also includes a bad faith claim against the insurer,the oldenkamps,sued their insurer,united american insurance company united,over united denial of a claim for coverage of a medical procedure for their infant son.on for summary judgment,the district court found in favor of the oldenkamps on their claim for breach of contract.the district court simultaneously found that united had not acted in bad faith because the state of the law was unclear and thus the denial of coverage,even though erroneous in the district court view,had been reasonable.consequently,the court granted summary judgment to united on the bad faith claim and also ruled that the oldenkamps could not be awarded punitive damages.
both sides have appealed.the oldenkamps,in addition to challenging the rulings already noted,also challenge the denial of their motion for spoilation sanctions.
this lawsuit was filed in state court by the oldenkamps and removed to federal court by united on the basis of diversity of citizenship.appellate jurisdiction is based on.
the oldenkamps had purchased a policy of insurance titled limited benefit hospital and surgical expense policy from united with an effective date of august,the policy.the policy covered the oldenkamp couple and their infant son.
the oldenkamps son was born with a congenital defect,a type of cyst on his right eyelid.the cyst was first noted by a doctor in late april during a routine examination.that doctor made a note to surgeon in his record of the exam,but in deposition said that he probably did not refer the oldenkamps to a surgeon at that time because the condition was not urgent and the baby was too young for surgery.in any event,coverage under the policy began on august,and in september,the boy was taken to see a surgeon.the surgeon recommended excising the cyst,which was done successfully later in september.
when the medical bills for the procedure were submitted for payment,united evaluated the statements,requesting medical records from various service providers and asking the oldenkamps to complete a claimant statement.united denied payment for the claims upon its determination that the cyst was a condition excluded under the policy.oldenkamp responded by letter to united,requesting reconsideration.united sent a second letter,affirming its decision to deny payment based on the condition exclusion.
the policy included the following condition limitation 
this policy does not insure you against loss incurred during the twelve months immediately after the effective date of this policy if that loss results from a condition.in addition,any condition listed on the application is not covered for the first twelve months after the policy effective date.
under the policy,a condition is defined as 
any condition for which symptoms existed which would cause an ordinary prudent person to seek diagnosis,care or treatment within the month period immediately prior to the effective date of your or the family member coverage under this policy.it also means any condition for which the family member did receive treatment or medical advice during the month period immediately prior to your or the family member effective date of coverage under this policy.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.mcknight kimberly clark,cir.under.c,summary judgment should be entered by the district court if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.on appeal,
w e examine the record to determine whether any genuine issue of material fact was in dispute if not,we determine whether the substantive law was applied correctly,and in so doing we examine the factual record and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
mcknight,at brackets and quotations omitted.
we first address united appeal from the district court ruling on the oldenkamps breach of contract claim.for purposes of the for summary judgment below,and for this appeal,the oldenkamps do not dispute united contention that their son cyst was a condition within the meaning of the policy.the oldenkamps primary contention on the breach of contract issue is that the exclusion of conditions was contrary to oklahoma law.more specifically,the oldenkamps rely on a regulation promulgated by the oklahoma insurance department.that regulation is found in the chapter of the oklahoma administrative code applicable to accident and health insurance,and it provides,in pertinent part 
prohibited policy provisions.
e policy limits or exclusions,exceptions.no policy shall limit or exclude coverage by type of illness,accident,treatment or medical condition,except as follows 
conditions or diseases,except for congenital anomalies of a covered dependent child 
admin.code.in other words,under section the regulation exclusions for conditions are allowed,but not for congenital anomalies of dependent children.
united contends that the regulation is not applicable to the policy because the policy is not a health insurance policy,under oklahoma law,but a limited benefit policy,and it argues that the regulation applies only to health insurance policies.resolution of this issue involves consideration of several oklahoma statutes.
united contends that oklahoma law recognizes a distinction between health insurance policies and limited benefit policies.united cites a statutory definition of accident and health insurance policy 
definition of accident and health insurance policy.
the term policy of accident and health insurance as used herein includes any policy or contract insuring against loss resulting from sickness,or from bodily injury or death by accident or both.provided,however,the term does not include coverage provided under a limited benefit insurance policy or contract as defined in section of this title.
stat.emphasis added.the referenced definition of limited benefit insurance is as follows 
definition of limited benefit insurance policy.
limited benefit insurance means a policy or contract designed to be purchased individually or to supplement major medical accident and health insurance and which only provides coverage that is less than the minimum standard for benefits required under basic hospital expense coverage or basic expense coverage.
a limited benefit insurance policy or contract may specify a waiting period for coverage 
the oldenkamps counter with an argument that limited benefit policies are not separate,distinct creatures,but rather are a category of accident and health insurance.they cite.stat,which instructs the oklahoma insurance department to adopt rules and regulations which establish minimum standards of benefits and identification for each of the following categories of coverage of accident and health insurance h limited benefit insurance.therefore,while sections and,when read together,directly provide that limited benefit policies are distinct from accident and health insurance policies,section suggests the contrary,because it describes limited benefit insurance as a category of accident and health insurance.
the district court resolved this conflict in the statutes by reliance on the regulation,the language of which the judge described as strong and precise.we must disagree with this approach in the circumstances of this case.as we shall explain,one of the statutes in conflict the regulation,while the other two were enacted after it.therefore,the oklahoma insurance department,in enacting the regulation,could not have been attempting to unravel the statutory puzzle that we address here.an agency authority to make rules under statutory authority is limited to the authority granted by those statutes,and such rules may not be contrary to those statutes.heiman atl.richfield.the language of the regulation can not logically be used to resolve a conflict between statutes when the regulation was promulgated before
