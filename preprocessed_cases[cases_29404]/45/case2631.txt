mary ann jordan,the plaintiff and appellant,seeks reversal of a judgment entered in favor of the respondent allstate insurance company allstate on her complaint for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief.the issue presented to us is whether jordan has a viable claim for breach of the implied covenant after the trial court granted allstate motion for summary adjudication of that issue,jordan dismissed her other two causes of action so that an appealable judgment could be entered 
while we agree with the trial court and allstate that the insurer interpretation of the language of its policy which led to its original denial of jordan claim was reasonable,it does not follow that allstate resulting claim denial can be justified in the absence of a full,fair and thorough investigation of all of the bases of the claim that was presented.jordan,in her opposition to allstate summary adjudication motion,has raised several triable issues of fact with respect to the adequacy of allstate investigation of her claim and thus the summary disposition of her bad faith claim was not appropriate.we will therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
this is the second time that this case has come before us.nearly three years ago,in jordan allstate ins.th,d jordan i,we reversed a summary judgment in favor of allstate.in that opinion,we recited the following factual background which is also relevant here 
in august of,jordan purchased a deluxe plus homeowner policy from allstate that provided coverage for her santa monica home.the policy provided coverage of up to for the dwelling and other structures.
as is common in such policies,it was subject to certain exclusions.particularly relevant to the issues before us,the policy provided that it did not cover a loss consisting of or caused by rust or other corrosion,mold,wet or dry rot italics added or a loss to covered property consisting of or caused by collapse.italics added.there was an exception to this collapse exclusion,however,that was set out in a section of the policy headed by the term additional coverage.this section provided that the policy would nevertheless cover 
a the entire collapse of a covered building structure 
b the entire collapse of a part of a covered building structure and 
c direct physical loss to covered property caused by a or b above.
italics added.
this exceptional additional coverage was limited to the collapse of a building structure specified in a or b that was a sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by one or more of the following b hidden decay of the building structure and the term collapse,however,did not include settling,cracking,shrinking,bulging or expansion.jordan i,supra,th at,d.
in early december of,jordan discovered that a window had fallen out of the wall of her living room and floorboards in the corner of a living room were giving way.on december,jordan hired jose luis delacruz of delacruz wood preservation services to conduct an investigation.he concluded that the damage was caused by a water conducting fungus known as meruliporia incrassata poria.after receiving his report jordan submitted a claim to allstate on december.allstate retained its own experts to inspect jordan property.they came to the same conclusion as delacruz as to the cause of the damage.
on january,allstate denied jordan claim on the ground that coverage was precluded under the exclusion for any loss consisting of or caused by wet or dry rot.jordan responded that poria fungus was not wet or dry rot and asked allstate to reconsider its decision.allstate,on february,replied that jordan damage had been caused by wet or dry rot and thus the exclusion applied.
jordan filed this action on august.she claimed that a poria fungus infestation did not constitute either wet or dry rot and therefore the exclusion relied upon by allstate did not apply but even if it did,she was still entitled to coverage under the collapse exception contained in the additional coverage section of her policy.allstate moved for summary judgment which the trial court granted on two grounds the wet or dry rot exclusion included a fungal infestation and the coverage for collapse did not extend to an imminent collapse which was all that was reflected by the record.
in jordan i,we reversed after concluding that the policy language relating to the wet or dry rot exclusion and the additional coverage provided under the collapse exception were contradictory and confusing,thus creating an ambiguity.we said,a s our discussion of the dictionary definition of dry rot made clear,that term necessarily involves decay.thus,the use of the term dry rot in the exclusion and the use of the term hidden decay,in the provision for additional coverage lead to a confusing contradiction.such contradiction creates an ambiguity with respect to coverage involving a claim of collapse.given our obligation to read the allstate policy so as to give full effect to all of its terms and conditions citations,we might reconcile this contradiction in one of two ways.first,we could conclude that a collapse due to hidden decay would be covered,but not if such decay was caused by wet or dry rot or,second,we could conclude that coverage for a collapse due to hidden decay was provided,but noncollapse damage caused by wet or dry rot was excluded.each of these constructions of the policy language is reasonable.the first is consistent with allstate contention that the exclusion for wet or dry rot precludes coverage irrespective of whether there is a basis for coverage under the exception to the collapse exclusion.on the other hand,the second interpretation is advanced by jordan and supports her claim for coverage under the collapse provisions of the additional coverage section of the policy.thus,when read in the context of the entire policy,particularly the provision granting coverage for a collapse caused by hidden decay,the effect and application of the exclusion for a loss caused by wet or dry rot is not at all clear.jordan i,supra,th at,d italics in original.
applying settled principles of policy construction,we resolved this ambiguity by looking to the insured objectively reasonable expectations and construed the policy language against allstate and in favor of jordan.jordan i,supra,th at,d.this meant that jordan could demonstrate the existence of coverage for her loss if she could show that an entire collapse had occurred because the record was unclear on this issue,we remanded the matter back to the trial court to give jordan an opportunity to prove that an actual collapse had occurred and had resulted in her claimed damage.
upon return of the case to the trial court,however,allstate made a motion for summary judgment,arguing that there was no evidence of such a collapse and thus there could be no coverage.the trial court denied the motion,holding that there were unresolved triable issues of fact on the collapse issue.allstate then moved for summary adjudication of jordan cause of action for bad faith,arguing that since we had,in jordan i,concluded that allstate interpretation of its policy had been reasonable,even though erroneous,there could be no claim for bad faith arising from its denial of jordan claim as a matter of law.
the trial court was persuaded by that argument and granted allstate motion thereafter,jordan dismissed her other two causes of action against allstate for breach of contract and declaratory relief.this enabled the court to enter a final judgment in the matter and jordan then filed this timely appeal.
contentions of the parties 
jordan argues that the fact that allstate interpretation of its policy was reasonable does not preclude a claim for bad faith arising from its claims handling activities,particularly its failure to conduct a full,fair and thorough investigation of her claim.had allstate done so,she argues it could have determined that a basis for coverage existed under the collapse provisions of the policy.she contends that the evidence and expert opinions that she presented on this issue were sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact and that the trial court summary resolution of her bad faith cause of action was error.
allstate disputes each of these arguments and contends that our decision in jordan i is the law of the case and binding on the question of whether allstate acted reasonably in denying coverage.it contends that the existence of a legitimate dispute about coverage precludes,as a matter of law,any claim for bad faith.moreover,allstate argues that jordan has produced no evidence of an actual collapse which,under jordan i,is a necessary predicate to coverage under the policy and,without coverage,there can be no viable bad faith claim in any event.
discussion 
standard of review 
we conduct a de novo review of this matter.price wells fargo bank d.in doing so,we apply the same rules as the trial court was required to apply in deciding allstate motion for summary judgment.
as the party moving for summary judgment,allstate bore an initial burden of production of a prima facie showing that there is no triable issue of material fact in this case and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.only if allstate carried that burden was jordan faced with a burden of production of her make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.no more is called for.id.at,d.f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof a defendant bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.code civ.proc,subd.o.id.at,d,italics and footnotes omitted.h ow the parties moving for,and opposing,summary judgment may each carry their burden of persuasion production depends on which would bear what burden of proof at trial.the california supreme court has held to the effect that the placement and quantum of the burden of proof at trial are crucial for purposes of summary judgment.citation.thus,if a defendant moves for summary judgment,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.id.at,d,fns.omitted,italics in original.

the relevant principles applicable to jordan bad faith claim 
an insurer is said to act in bad faith when it not only breaches its policy contract but also breaches its implied covenant to deal fairly and in good faith with its insured.a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every insurance contract.citations.the implied promise requires each contracting party to refrain from doing anything to injure the right of the other to receive the agreement benefits.to fulfill its implied obligation,an insurer must give at least as much consideration to the interests of the insured as it gives to its own interests.when the insurer unreasonably and in bad faith withholds payment of the claim of its insured,it is subject to liability in tort.and an insurer can not reasonably and in good faith deny payments to its insured without fully investigating the grounds for its denial.citation.frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange cal d,italics added.indeed,in egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d,the supreme court emphasized that,in order to protect the interests of its insured,it was essential that an insurer fully inquire into possible bases that might support the insured claim,at,italics added.
before an insurer can be found to have acted in bad faith for its delay or denial in the payment of policy benefits,it must be shown that the insurer acted unreasonably or without proper cause.where there is a genuine issue as to the insurer liability under the policy for the claim asserted by the insured,there can be no bad faith liability imposed on the insurer for advancing its side of that dispute.chateau chamberay homeowners associated internat.ins.th,d.moreover,it must be remembered that an insurer is not required to pay every claim presented to it.besides the duty to deal fairly with the insured,the insurer also has a duty to its other policyholders and to the stockholders if it is such a company not to dissipate its reserves through the payment of meritless claims.such a practice inevitably would prejudice the insurance seeking public because of the necessity to increase rates,and would finally drive the insurer out of business.indeed,analysis of the leading first party cases demonstrates that a rule has never been applied which holds under any circumstances that an insurer which refuses to pay benefits claimed to be due under the policy did so at its own risk.clearly,both logic and good policy dictate that no such rule ever be applied in first party cases.austero national cas.d.disapproved on another ground in egan mutual of omaha ins,supra,cal d at,fn.
allstate denial of coverage based on a reasonable interpretation of its own policy does not excuse its failure to investigate other possible bases for jordan claim 
as already indicated,an insurer can not be held liable for bad faith when it has acted to deny or delay policy benefits with proper cause.one of the ways an insurer can negate an insured claim that it has acted unreasonably or without proper cause is to demonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute regarding coverage or the amount or extent of the insured claimed loss.
it is now settled that an insurer denying or delaying the payment of policy benefits due to the existence of a genuine dispute with its insured as to the existence of coverage liability or the amount of the insured coverage claim is not liable in bad faith even though it might be liable for breach of contract.citation.chateau chamberay homeowners associated internat.ins,supra,th,d.on the other hand,if the insurer denies benefits unreasonably,without any reasonable basis for such denial,it may be exposed to the full array of tort remedies,including possible punitive damages.see morris paul revere life ins.th,d.t he reasonableness of the insurer decisions and actions must be evaluated as of the time that they were made the evaluation can not fairly be made in the light of subsequent events that may provide evidence of the insurer errors.chateau chamberay homeowners associated internat.ins,supra,th at,d.
in this case,allstate argues that since we,in jordan i,had held that its interpretation of the policy exclusion precluding coverage for a loss resulting from wet or dry rot was a reasonable one,and allstate based its denial of coverage on the application of that exclusion,it is established that it acted with proper cause and thus can not be held liable in bad faith.jordan claimed that the poria fungus that had damaged her home was not wet or dry rot and therefore the exclusion did not apply.were that contention the only one asserted by jordan to support her claim of coverage,allstate argument would be more persuasive.jordan,however,also based her claim on the additional coverage provisions in the policy which promised coverage for an entire collapse of all or part of her home caused by hidden decay.as we explained in jordan i,this provision was in conflict with the exclusion relied upon by allstate and provided a basis of coverage independent of that exclusion.since this conflict created an ambiguity that we resolved in jordan favor and since the question as to whether an entire collapse had in fact occurred was an unresolved factual issue we reversed and remanded for resolution of that question these circumstances raise the issue that is at the heart of jordan present argument relating to allstate duty to investigate her claim.
as already noted,an insurer owes a duty to its insured to investigate all of the possible bases of an insured claim.the insurer duty to give as much consideration to the insured interests as it does to its own obligates it to investigate a claim thoroughly.an insurer must fully inquire into the bases for the claim indeed,it can not reasonably and in good faith deny benefits to its insured without thoroughly investigating the foundation for its denial.egan mutual of omaha ins,supra,cal d at,italics added.an insurance company may not ignore evidence which supports coverage.if it does so,it acts unreasonably towards its insured and breaches the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.mariscal old republic life ins.th,d see also shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,d the record suggests that the insurer looked the other way when confronted with facts revealing the possibility of first party coverage,resisting both reasonable interpretation of policy language and a compelling history of negotiation to secure this coverage amadeo principal mut.life ins.cir,even assuming the insurer interpretation of its policy was not adopted in bad faith,its failure to investigate the facts surrounding the claim was evidence of bad faith.
as we made clear in chateau chamberay homeowners associated internat.ins,supra,th,d,where an insurer denies coverage but a reasonable investigation would have disclosed facts showing the claim was covered,the insurer failure to investigate breaches its implied covenant.the insurer can not claim a genuine dispute regarding coverage in such cases because,by failing to investigate,it has deprived itself of the ability to make a fair evaluation of the claim,at,d.thus,although allstate interpretation of a policy exclusion was reasonable,it also had a duty to investigate jordan coverage claim that was based on the additional coverage provisions relating to an entire collapse,which we held,in jordan i,was also reasonable and consistent with jordan objectively reasonable expectations.
we now turn to an examination of the record to see if it supports jordan contention that she has raised triable issues of fact with respect to the nature and extent of allstate investigation of the collapse basis for her claim.
the record demonstrates that jordan has raised triable issues of fact as to allstate investigation 
the record before us reflects that jordan,in opposition to allstate motions for summary judgment presented evidence in the form of declarations,deposition testimony documentary material that reflected the following matters 
despite the recommendation of its own experts and the recommendation of delacruz jordan fungus expert that a structural engineer be retained by allstate to inspect the property,allstate failed to do so.allstate adjuster stated she simply disregarded the recommendation out of hand.
allstate contended that it did not need to send out a structural engineer because its experts,pacific health safety ph s,did not describe any areas of collapse to be further inspected.however,allstate never asked ph s to determine whether there had been a collapse.the only request that is documented in the file is a request for ph s to confirm poria.allstate adjuster,tina bulmer,specifically stated in her deposition that she did not hire ph s to make any recommendations regarding structural engineering.
despite the fact that internal correspondence about the possibility that the collapse coverage might apply to jordan loss,allstate never communicated anything to jordan about this coverage potential until jordan attorney finally received a copy of the policy which he had been requesting and noted the collapse provision.
although they apparently recognized that the collapse coverage applied where there was hidden decay,allstate adjusters never made any attempt to inspect the inner walls or of the jordan home.ph s had specifically recommended an inspection by a structural engineer because there had not been any demolition of the relevant areas of the home at the time it completed its inspection.
allstate claims supervisor,dick ray,bulmer on the case stating the only reason to hire a structural engineer would be to determine if collapse has occurred.ray further advised her that if she was certain that there was collapse,then a structural engineer would be appropriate.nevertheless,bulmer never took any further steps to hire a structural engineer until a month before allstate filed its second summary judgment motion.only then did allstate retain an engineer to review photographs that had been in its possession for more than a year.
bulmer stated that she did not hire a structural engineer because jordan had not provided any proof of actual collapse.yet,jordan had not been advised that the policy provided coverage for actual collapse until several months into the claim even though she her attorney had been requesting copies of the policy.
although jordan,herself,was aware from the outset that parts of her home were collapsing,she was never interviewed by any adjuster for allstate.
bulmer refused to interview jordan expert delacruz for the sole stated reason that delacruz had been hired by the insured.
allstate left it completely up to bulmer to determine if there was collapse,despite the fact that she had no credentials or background for making structural engineering decisions.
bulmer noted in the claim file that jordan had failed to make a claim for any damages and that was one reason why she had conducted no further investigation.yet,seventeen days before bulmer documented the file with that comment,she also memorialized that she had received a letter from the insured stating that damage is now spreading at an alarming pace.further,in a file memorandum she notes that jordan had asked what allstate was going to do to prevent further damage.
allstate did nothing further to investigate coverage based on the collapse provisions after this court decision in jordan allstate claim supervisor stated specifically in a letter that no further investigation would be conducted.allstate still did not interview its insured about the collapse issue,even though that was the issue to be resolved upon remand.it was not until allstate was preparing its second motion for summary judgment that,for the first time,it hired an engineer to review the same photographs that had been reviewed and marked by jordan structural engineer,patrick huff.allstate had the unmarked photographs in its possession for over a year prior to huff submitting his marked copies 
if found to be true at trial and not countered or satisfactorily explained by allstate,such facts would constitute evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that allstate did indeed fail to conduct a full,fair,thorough and timely investigation of jordan claim as it related to and relied on the entire collapse provisions of the allstate policy.on the other hand,allstate may well be able to produce evidence that all or part of jordan factual assertions are false,or that allstate acts or omissions as claimed by jordan were justified or reasonable in the circumstances.what is clea
