this is an insurance coverage dispute.on may,a class action was filed against raytheon company raytheon under the employee retirement income security act of the erisa action.at that time,raytheon was insured under a liability insurance policy issued by federal insurance company federal and an excess policy issued by axis surplus insurance company axis.raytheon requested coverage from the insurers.in response,the insurers filed suits for declaratory judgment of,invoking the district court diversity jurisdiction.the insurers contended that the erisa action was excluded from coverage under the pending and prior litigation exclusions of the policies because there were overlapping allegations between the erisa action and an earlier securities lawsuit brought against raytheon in,before the effective dates of the policies.
the district court held that coverage was excluded under the prior and pending litigation exclusion clauses of both policies.we hold that coverage for both insurers is excluded under the federal policy.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
raytheon provides products and services in the areas of defense and commercial electronics.it is a public company listed on the new york stock exchange.on october,the wall street journal published an article reporting that raytheon,unbeknownst to investors,experienced cost overruns and was behind schedule on many contracts.later that day,raytheon reported charges totaling million and reduced earnings expectations.the charges and reduced earnings forecast caused a sharp decline in raytheon stock price.
on october,a class action invoking section the securities exchange act of,and rule,was filed in the district of massachusetts against raytheon and several of its senior officers the securities action.in re raytheon.sec.june,amended complaint.the lead plaintiff was the new york state common retirement fund,which sought to represent a class of persons who purchased raytheon stock from october,to october,the date of the wall street journal article.the complaint in the securities action alleged that during the class period,raytheon issued materially false and misleading statements regarding its financial performance.briefly,the securities complaint alleged that raytheon engineering constructors division re c failed to disclose losses on major contracts re c misleadingly reported revenues on existing and anticipated contracts raytheon failed to disclose that projects relating to the orion aircraft and other defense equipment were over budget and behind schedule and raytheon failed to disclose that the joint primary aircraft training system was over budget and behind schedule.the securities action apparently settled in december.
in may a second class action was filed against raytheon and several of its officers and employees in the district of massachusetts,this time based on the employee retirement income security act of,et.in re raytheon erisa,amended complaint.the lead plaintiffs were benjamin wall and joseph duggan iii,former raytheon employees who sought to represent a class of persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of raytheon savings and investment plan the plan at any time between october,and date of the complaint.in contrast to the securities complaint,the erisa complaint alleged that the defendants were erisa fiduciaries of the plan that the defendants regularly communicated to plan participants during the all relevant times and that the defendants had financial interests tied to the raytheon stock price at all relevant times.it then charged the defendants with four counts of breach of fiduciary duty,specifically imprudent investment failure to monitor other fiduciaries misrepresentation and failure to disclose information to beneficiaries and failure to avoid conflicts of interest.the erisa litigation is ongoing.
apart from differences in parties and legal theories,the factual allegations of the erisa complaint were in many respects nearly identical to the securities complaint,but in other respects were different from the securities complaint.with respect to alleged misdeeds by raytheon occurring prior to october,the date for the securities class action,the factual allegations of the erisa complaint mirrored those of the securities complaint including re c failed to disclose and improperly accounted for losses on major contracts re c misleadingly recognized revenues on existing and anticipated contracts and raytheon failed to disclose material cost overruns and delays affecting projects related to the orion aircraft.with the exception of allegations concerning several raytheon systems corporation projects and the joint primary aircraft training system,it is fair to say that all the allegations of raytheon misdeeds made in the securities complaint were also included in the erisa complaint.
however,in two major respects the erisa complaint included allegations not found in the securities complaint.first,there were substantial allegations of misdeeds pertaining to the,period in the erisa complaint that were not alleged in the securities complaint.for example,the erisa complaint alleged the existence of recurring indications of accounting and control irregularities at.it alleged that defendants misleading,inaccurate,and incomplete statements regarding the company fiscal health extended from through,and beyond.id.at.other,events alleged included the sec commenced an investigation into raytheon accounting practices in raytheon made material misrepresentations in selling the re c division to washington group international wgi,leading to litigation by wgi and its shareholders and the sec commenced proceedings against raytheon and its former cfo relating to violations of sec regulations.
second,to support the different legal theories asserted under erisa in contrast to the securities exchange act,relevant facts not contained in the securities complaint were alleged in the erisa complaint.the complaint alleged that the defendants were erisa plan fiduciaries.to support the imprudent investment charge,the erisa complaint alleged that at a ll relevant times,defendants knew or should have known that raytheon was engaged in the questionable business practices detailed above which made raytheon stock an imprudent plan investment.id.at.to support the failure to disclose and misrepresentation charge,the complaint alleged that raytheon regularly communicated with employees,including plan participants,about raytheon performance and failed to disclose and misrepresented material information to plan beneficiaries.id.at.to support the conflict of interest charge,the complaint alleged that the defendants compensation was closely tied to the price of raytheon stock and that the defendants had failed to avoid improper conflicts of interest.id.at.
after the erisa action was filed,raytheon sought coverage from the insurers.the insurers denied coverage and filed suit in the district of massachusetts,seeking a declaratory judgment of.the insurers contended that coverage was excluded under the prior and pending litigation clause in the federal insurance policy,which states 
the company federal shall not be liable for loss on account of any claim made against any insured based upon,arising from,or in consequence of any demand,suit or other proceeding pending,or order,decree or judgment entered against any insured,on or prior to september,or the same or any substantially similar fact,circumstance or situation underlying or alleged therein.
as an excess policy,the axis policy has a clause stating,in no event shall this policy grant broader coverage than would be provided by the most restrictive policy constituting part of the applicable underlying insurance.at.thus,if coverage is excluded under the federal policy,it is also excluded under the axis policy.the axis policy also has its own prior and pending litigation exclusion,which is worded somewhat differently,stating 
the insurer axis shall not be liable for any amount in any claim based upon,arising from,or attributable to 
a any demand,suit or other proceeding pending,or order,decree or judgment entered,against any insured on or prior to september,or any wrongful act,fact,circumstance or situation underlying or alleged therein or 
b any other wrongful act,fact,circumstance or situation whenever occurring,which together with a wrongful act,fact,circumstance or situation described in a above are causally or logically interrelated by a common nexus.
the insurers moved for judgment on the pleadings.in an oral decision,the district court construed the language based upon the same or any substantially similar fact,circumstance or situation underlying or alleged to mean that if the prior complaint contains any overlapping claims made against any insured,the exclusion is triggered.applying this test,the district court found that raytheon has not,and can not,credibly argue that the core allegations of the prior litigation complaint and the erisa complaint do not overlap.instead,the district court found that the complaints in the securities action and the erisa action revealed numerous allegations of substantially similar facts,circumstances or situations.thus,the district court concluded that coverage was excluded,there was neither a duty to defend nor liability for any loss.raytheon appeals from the final judgment of the district court.
as a preliminary matter,raytheon submits that the case should be stayed pending the outcome of the erisa litigation,and in the interim the insurers must defend raytheon.according to raytheon,whether a subsequent lawsuit is based upon any substantially similar fact,circumstance or situation underlying or alleged in a prior lawsuit can not be determined until both lawsuits are over.we disagree.
under massachusetts law as a general matter,the question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend actions against the insured is decided by matching the complaint with the policy provisions.cont l cas.gilbane.in this inquiry,if the allegations of the complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms,the insurer must undertake the defense.id.quoting sterilite cont l cas.the duty to defend is triggered even if the allegations of the complaint are baseless.airy ins.greenbaum,cir.however,when the allegations in the underlying complaint lie expressly outside the policy coverage and its purpose,the insurer is relieved of the duty to investigate or defend the claimant.herbert sullivan,utica mut.ins,quoting timpson transamerica ins,see also terrio mcdonough.
raytheon cites a line of cases holding that even if an insurer has an initial duty to defend based on the complaints alone,it may be absolved of the duty to defend and liability for loss by subsequent developments in the litigation.see,lumbermens mut.cas.belleville,sterilite,at.this line of cases provides no aid to raytheon.the insurers are not contending that there have been subsequent developments in the litigation absolving them of an initial duty to defend.rather,they are contending that they do not even have the initial duty to defend nor is raytheon contending that subsequent developments have created a duty to defend massachusetts law clearly provides that resolution of the issue of coverage,at least initially,is to be based on the allegations of the complaints,here the complaints in the securities and erisa actions.
lastly,raytheon relies on various district court cases,especially home ins.of spectrum info,for the proposition that resolution of the duty to defend on the pleadings is premature.to the extent that these cases are contrary to massachusetts law,we must follow the supreme judicial court.
on the merits,we must construe the federal insurance policy and apply it to the allegations of the complaints.in light of our conclusion that coverage is excluded under the federal policy,we need not analyze the axis exclusion.
the responsibility of construing the language of an insurance contract is a question of law for the trial judge,and then for the reviewing court.cody.life ins.we thus must independently determine the construction of the policy.in this inquiry,doubts about ambiguous insurance policy provisions are to be resolved against the insurance company,city of boston.but when the policy is plain and free from ambiguity,we do not construe them strictly against the insurer.rather,we must construe the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense.barnstable county mut.fire ins.lally.
the federal policy provides an exclusion for 
any claim made against any insured based upon,arising from,or in consequence of any demand,suit or other proceeding pending on or prior to september,or the same or any substantially similar fact,circumstance or situation underlying or alleged therein.
at.the federal policy is a policy,where liability for coverage is triggered by the filing of a claim during the policy period instead of the occurrence of an underlying event in the policy period.the policy defines a claim as including a civil proceeding commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading against any insured for a wrongful act.at.thus a claim for present purposes is equivalent to a complaint.
the language of the policy can not reasonably be given the broadest possible construction,under which any overlapping fact between the two example,the identity of raytheon as the defendant in the context of otherwise unrelated trigger the exclusion.we do not understand any party to contend otherwise.at the same time,complete identity between the lawsuits is plainly not required.indeed,all parties agree that the two complaints need not be identical,and that differences in theories of recovery or the identity of the parties in the proceedings do not in and of themselves preclude exclusion beyond that,they disagree.the district court here construed based upon any substantially similar fact,circumstance or situation underlying or alleged to exclude coverage when there are any overlapping claims.the district court,however,did not make clear the degree of overlap required for the allegations in the complaint,instead finding only that raytheon can not credibly argue that the core allegations of the prior litigation complaint and the erisa complaint do not overlap and that a comparison of the complaints reveals numerous allegations of substantially similar facts,circumstances or situations.
axis submits that all that is required is for the erisa litigation to contain any substantially similar fact,circumstance or situation alleged in the prior litigation,though we understand this to mean any overlap in determinative facts.br.of axis at emphasis omitted.federal appears to distance itself from this construction,stating that whether a single overlapping fact or claim would trigger the exclusion is not a question the court need answer,br.of federal at,but does not offer an alternative construction of the exclusion clause.for its part,raytheon advocates that the exclusion is triggered only when two lawsuits are the same or substantially similar,or alternatively where there is significant overlap between the lawsuits as a whole,br.of raytheon at,emphasis in original,apparently meaning that the two lawsuits must be virtually identical save for differences in the parties and theories of liability.see id.at purporting to cite cases articulating requirements of,inter alia,allegations of virtually identical false statements the same underlying circumstance or essentially the same set of facts.we think that the correct construction is somewhat different from the position of any of the parties.
raytheon construction,apparently relying on the same or any substantially similar fact,circumstance or situation language in the policy,is not warranted.while the exclusion clause uses the language substantially similar,it refers to the subsequent fact,circumstance or situation.the substantially similar language can not by itself be read to refer to the demand,suit,or other proceeding.
raytheon argues alternatively that the second claim must be based upon the first.this is correct and we must determine the meaning of the word based in this context.we do not agree with raytheon apparent construction of based to mean virtually identical.
