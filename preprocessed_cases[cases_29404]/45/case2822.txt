background 
a group of homeowners real parties whose homes were damaged or destroyed in the northridge earthquake brought an action against fire insurance exchange and farmers insurance exchange petitioners to recover under their policies and for damages,alleging breach of contract,insurance bad faith,fraud,and negligence.
real parties first amended complaint alleges that at the time of the earthquake,their homes were insured under the fourth edition protector plus homeowners package policy,with guaranteed replacement cost coverage,issued by fire insurance exchange it is alleged that real parties repaired or rebuilt their homes,and in doing so,incurred costs for land stabilization and for construction upgrades made necessary by changes to the building code,and that petitioners denied their claims for such costs.
the matter was assigned to los angeles superior court judge carl west.for case management purposes,prior to setting the matter for trial,judge west resolved disputed issues raised by the pleadings regarding the interpretation of the policy terms upon which coverage depended 
the court found the policy to be ambiguous and exclusions relating to damage to land and building code upgrades to be invalid and unenforceable.on august,petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition,and on november,we issued an order to show cause and ordered real parties to file a written return.
discussion 
we have construed the trial court case management order as a denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings with regard to the alleged causes of action,insofar as they are based upon coverage for costs for land stabilization and for construction upgrades made necessary by changes to the building code the denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be reviewed by means of a petition for writ of mandate.see american internat.group,superior court d.and a order is properly reviewed by petition for writ of mandate.see,hernandez superior court th,d.
a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer.american airlines,county of san mateo cal th,d.ordinarily,a general demurrer does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action,and if any part of a cause of action is properly pleaded,the demurrer will be overruled.campbell genshlea cal.the trial court has broad discretion,however,to fashion suitable methods of practice in order to manage complex litigation.rutherford,cal th,d.accordingly,courts have the power to fashion a new procedure in a complex litigation case to manage and control the case before them.cottle superior court th,d.
the trial court deemed the resolution of the issues presented here to be critical to the management of this litigation and the other earthquake cases pending before the court with similar issues.in its statement of decision,the court invoked code of civil procedure section,which provides that a judge may indicate in any interlocutory order a belief that there is a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.
since the unusual procedure undertaken by the trial court was within its power to manage complex litigation,and the parties agreed to it and no objection has been made in these proceedings,we shall not invoke the usual rule pertaining to general demurrers,but will determine whether real parties causes of action may be based upon either or both of the two claimed coverages.
in deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings,all properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true,as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.treweek city of napa th,d.a ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings resolves a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law,whether or not the factual allegations that the plaintiff makes are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.the resolution of a question of this sort calls for examination de novo.citation.gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d.

cost of repairing land beneath the covered dwelling 
petitioners first contention is that the trial court erred in finding that the replacement cost coverage in the protector plus policy includes the cost of repairing the land under damaged or destroyed buildings,when such repair is necessary before the buildings can be repaired or replaced.we agree.the absence of insurance coverage for damage or injury to land is both clear and explicit in the protector plus policy.it is error to fail to apply the plain,unambiguous language of an insurance policy.rosen state farm general ins.cal th,d.
the policy insures loss to three types of property.coverage a insures against loss to the insured dwelling,including attached structures,on the residence premises used principally as the insured private residence coverage b insures against loss to the insured separate structures,which are also referred to as other structures on the residence premises and coverage c insures against loss to personal property.italics added.the policy defines residence premises as the one or two family dwelling and separate structures or that part of any other building where the insured reside s,and which is shown in the declarations.
real parties contend that controlling authority for the trial court ruling is found in strickland federal ins.d.strickland,and snapp state farm fire cas.d.snapp,where the term dwelling,as used in the subject homeowner policies,was interpreted as including the land underlying the covered building.snapp,supra,d at.strickland,supra,d at.there is no similarity in the circumstances of this case and snapp or strickland.in each of those cases,the policy before the court was interpreted as providing policy limits where the covered peril earth movement was a continuing one,so that the insurer obligation with regard to resulting damage to the residence would continue so long as the underlying soil remained unstable,and the cost of stabilizing the land far exceeded policy limits.strickland,supra,d at.snapp,supra,d at.
we find nothing in either case that requires the definition of dwelling to include land in all insurance policies.neither case recites policy language remotely similar to the protector plus policy,other than providing coverage for the insured dwelling.in construing the policy before us,it is not our function to select a particular definition of a single word and apply it without regard to other language in the policy.see reserve insurance pisciotta cal d.ambiguity is not necessarily to be found in the fact that a word or phrase isolated from its context is susceptible of more than one meaning.citation.castro fireman fund american life ins.d.an insurance policy must be interpreted as a whole and in context.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,moving beyond the single word,dwelling,we find the following language under section,coverage a we do not cover land or the value of land,including land on which the dwelling is located,or the cost to restore,replace,repair or rebuild land.if a covered loss causes damage to the dwelling and to the land on the residence premises we do not cover any increased cost to repair or rebuild the dwelling because of damage to the land.italics added.
in the same section,under coverage structures,the policy states we cover other structures on the residence premises we do not cover land or the value of land,including land on which the separate structure is located,or the cost to restore,replace,repair or rebuild land.if a covered loss causes damage to a separate structure and to the land on the residence premises,we do not cover any increased cost to repair or rebuild the separate structure because of damage to the land.italics added.
thus,even if the word,dwelling,were interpreted as including the land under a house,regardless of its use in a particular policy,the protector plus policy would unequivocally and clearly exclude coverage for that part of a dwelling.express coverage limitations must be respected.fidelity deposit charter oak fire ins.th,d.
real parties contend that the trial court correctly resolved an ambiguity in the policy created by providing guaranteed replacement cost coverage,but excluding the cost to repair land,when such repair is required before a building can be replaced.any ambiguity or uncertainty in an insurance policy is to be resolved against the insurer.if semantically permissible,the contract will be given such construction as will fairly achieve its manifest object of securing indemnity to the insured for the losses to which the insurance relates.any reasonable doubt as to uncertain language will be resolved against the insurer.crane state farm fire cas.cal d.
a policy term is considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,but only if both are reasonable.mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,d.to determine whether both constructions are reasonable,the term must be considered in light of the language of the whole policy,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.id.at,d,bank of the west superior court cal th,d.
the policy explains guaranteed replacement cost coverage in section i,under additional coverages.paragraph is entitled,guaranteed replacement cost.italics in the original.it states we will settle covered loss to buildings under coverage and coverage structures at replacement cost regardless of the limits of insurance shown on the declarations page,subject to the following provisions we do not cover any costs required to replace,rebuild,stabilize or otherwise restore the land.italics added.
thus,although guaranteeing the replacement of a damaged home may be inconsistent in the abstract with excluding the cost of repairing damaged land so that the replacement can be built upon it,the clear,explicit,and language of the protector plus policy is not reasonably susceptible to an interpretation including such coverage.see mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.
real parties contend that their earthquake endorsement renders the land damage exclusion ambiguous,because an insured might reasonably expect the earthquake endorsement to override the land damage exclusion.we disagree.
under section not insured,the protector plus policy enumerates perils that are excluded from coverage,including earth movement.the excluded perils expressly apply to coverage a and b,the dwelling and separate structures,and coverage c,personal property.the earthquake endorsement supersedes and controls anything to the contrary.thus,since the exclusion for earth movement from coverages a,b,and c is contrary to the endorsement coverage for earthquake,the endorsement controls,and earthquake is not excluded from coverage a,b,or 
the endorsement is,however,subject to all other terms of the policy,and as the policy makes explicit and clear,coverages a,b,and c do not include damage to land.an endorsement overriding an excluded peril is not inconsistent with coverage for loss to buildings only and we may not indulge in a strained interpretation to create an ambiguity where none exists.see waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,reserve insurance pisciotta,supra,cal d at.
the trial court found the earthquake endorsement to be ambiguous,because it contains two special exclusions for loss c aused directly or indirectly by flood of any nature or tidal wave resulting from or made worse by earthquake,and loss t o exterior masonry veneer other than stucco.the court found the special exclusions to be inconsistent with the language making the endorsement otherwise subject to all other terms of the policy.we do not follow the court logic.the insertion of two special exclusions is not inconsistent with making any remaining terms of the policy applicable,so long as the remaining terms are not inconsistent with the endorsement.
the trial court explained,since by its very nature an earthquake involves land movement,it would be unreasonable to conclude that an individual buying earthquake coverage would not expect coverage for land stabilization necessary to restore his residence to its condition.an expectation of coverage,however,can not create an ambiguity it is merely an interpretive tool used to resolve an ambiguity once it is found to exist.wolf machinery insurance of north america d.
in any event,even if there is an ambiguity,we must determine whether the insured expectations are reasonable in relation to the terms of the particular insurance policy to be construed,not as a general proposition.see mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
real parties provided extrinsic evidence in the form of an internal memorandum,which they interpret as an admission that the endorsement is ambiguous.the memorandum proposed that guaranteed replacement cost coverage,be changed to read,extended replacement cost coverage,because courts may have used the term guaranteed to void the land limitation.
the goal of insurance policy interpretation,like any contract interpretation,is to determine the mutual intention of the parties at the time the policy was issued,and that intention is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the terms of the policy.aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at.we find that in light of the clear,explicit,and repeated language of the policy,it is not reasonably susceptible to the trial court interpretation.thus,there is no need to consider extrinsic evidence.garcia truck ins.exchange cal d.
in any event,in our view,the proposal does not acknowledge an ambiguity any more than evidence of a rejection of the proposal would establish clarity.at most,the memorandum suggests that someone in petitioners organization might have thought that some courts might interpret the word,guaranteed,too expansively,but there is no acknowledgement or even a suggestion that such an interpretation would be reasonable or that it was intended.
thus,we agree with petitioners that the trial court erred in rejecting the plain,unambiguous language of the policy.see rosen state farm general ins,supra,cal th at,d.
increased costs resulting from changes in building codes 
we turn to petitioners contention that the trial court erred in finding that the policy provides coverage for the increased costs of repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed buildings,when such increased costs are caused by the need to conform to changes in the building codes.
petitioners contend that the trial court erred in relying upon the legislative history of insurance code sections et,to find an ambiguity in the policy we agree.those provisions apply only to policies issued on and after july,or renewed after january.the legislature expressed its intent in the statute that n othing in this chapter is intended to expand,contract,modify,or otherwise affect the coverage provided under any policy of residential property insurance issued and in effect prior to july,italics added.thus,it is clear that the legislature did not intend that sections et provide an aid to the interpretation of insurance policies issued on before july,unless they were renewed on or after january.
there was no allegation in the first amended complaint that the policies in question were issued on or after july,or renewed between january,and the date of the earthquake,january,and there is no cause of action based upon a violation of or compliance with the disclosure requirements of section.since sections et are therefore inapplicable to the causes of action alleged in the first amended complaint,the trial court should not have relied upon them,and we shall not do so in our independent review.
petitioners contend that increased costs due to changes in the building codes are excluded by the following policy language we do not insure for loss either consisting of,or caused directly or indirectly by.enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating construction,repair or demolition of a building or other structure,unless endorsed to this policy.
we agree that the language is susceptible to such an interpretation,and that one california court has so interpreted it.see,bischel fire ins.exchange th,d bischel.that bischel court reasoned that a similar exclusion was authorized by insurance code section,which provides standard policy terms for residential property insurance policies.id.at,d.petitioners contend that the protector plus policy complies with section,and that bischel reasoning is applicable here.we disagree with both contentions.
insurance code section sets forth the standard form fire insurance policy all fire insurance policies in california must be on the standard form.the form need not be used,however,if other perils are included in the policy,as here,so long as the fire coverage is substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the insured as provided by statute.ibid.as long as the language of the policy is substantially similar to the standard form,the statutory language will control.see state farm fire casualty superior court d.thus,an exclusion will be enforced if it substantially complies with the language of the standard form.see breshears indiana lumbermens mut.ins.d.breshears.
the relevant language of section is found in the following clause insurer does insure insured to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss,but not exceeding the amount which it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss,without allowance for any increased cost of repair or reconstruction by reason of any ordinance or law regulating construction or repair.
we agree with petitioners and the bischel court that a policy containing the language of section does not cover the increased costs of replacement due to changes in the building codes.see bischel,supra,th at,d.thus,if the protector plus policy contained the statutory language or language substantially similar to it,we would agree with petitioners and with the reasoning of bischel,and our discussion would end here.but petitioners protector plus policy does not follow the standard form 
the policy replacement loss coverage is found under the heading,additional coverages.it reads in relevant part 
guaranteed replacement cost.we will settle covered loss to buildings under coverage and coverage structures at replacement cost regardless of the limits of insurance shown on the declarations page,subject to the following provisions 
a.you have insured your dwelling and separate structures to of their replacement cost as determined by our building replacement cost guide.
b.you have accepted each annual adjustment in building amounts in accordance with value protection clause in the policy.
d.you have complied with all the loss settlement provisions.
the loss settlement provisions are found in section.the relevant provision reads 
loss settlement.
coverage b covered loss to buildings under coverage a and b will be settled at replacement cost without deduction for depreciation,subject to the following methods 
settlement under replacement cost will not be more than the smallest of the following 
a the replacement cost of that part of the building damaged for equivalent construction and use on the same premises.
b the amount actually and necessarily spent to repair or replace the building intended for the same occupancy and use.
the value protection clause provides we may increase the limit of insurance applying to coverage a,b,c and d to reflect changes in costs of construction and personal property values.any such increase will be made on the renewal date of this policy,or on the anniversary date of policies paid annually.
to summarize,the policy guarantees of their replacement cost as determined by petitioners building replacement cost guide.there is no deduction for depreciation,and the amount will either be sufficient for equivalent construction and use on the same premises or the amount actually and necessarily spent to repair or replace the building intended for the same occupancy and use,whichever is smaller.and the premium will be periodically adjusted to reflect increased costs of construction and property values.
petitioners point out that the phrase equivalent construction has been held to be substantially similar to the language of section that limits replacement to material of like kind and quality.see,mccorkle state farm ins.d.mccorkle.the court concluded in that case that the insurer was not required to pay for a new cement garage floor to replace a destroyed wood floor,even though a new building code required cement.id.at.
we agree with petitioners and mccorkle that equivalent construction is substantially similar to material of like kind and quality.mccorkle,supra,d at.and we agree that if the language of the protector plus policy substantially complied with section,it would be enforced without further interpretation.see state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,d at.breshears,supra,d at.but those conclusions beg the question whether there is substantial compliance with section.
in general,s ubstantial compliance means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.stasher cal d.one objective of the standard form is to promote better understanding of policy provisions among insurers and insureds and more uniform interpretation by the judiciary.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.substantially different policy language purporting to exclude the same coverage will,of course,result in conflicting,not uniform,interpretations.see,travelers indem.royal indem.d.
the phrase material of like kind and quality,consists of six words in an independent clause of more than words.here,not only does the phrase equivalent construction,find itself nowhere near the exclusion,the policy does not use the modifying phrase,without allowance for any increased cost of repair or reconstruction by reason of any ordinance or law regulating construction or repair or any similar phrase.the language of petitioners exclusion says nothing of increased costs,and we find no similar language anywhere in the policy that would connect increased costs to the enforcement of an ordinance or law.
neither bischel nor mccorkle is of any assistance in determining substantial compliance with the statutory language,as petitioners suggest.nowhere does either opinion say that the policies before those courts included the statutory language missing from the protector plus policy,and neither court expressly found substantial compliance with the statute.see bischel,supra,th at,d mccorkle,supra,d at.thus,we have made our own comparison between the language of the protector plus policy and the language of the standard form.
we observe that the greatest difference is that they provide altogether different coverage.section sets forth actual cash value coverage,which is fair market value at the time of destruction.see jefferson ins.superior court cal d,cheeks california fair plan th,d.the protector plus policy provides replacement cost coverage,which is intended to compensate the insured for the shortfall in coverage that results from rebuilding under a policy that pays only for actual cash value.see conway farmers home mut.ins.th,d.
thus,we can not conclude that the protector plus replacement cost policy substantially complies with the standard form actual cash value policy,simply because the phrase equivalent construction,means material of like kind and quality.and since we conclude that the protector plus policy is not in substantial compliance with the statutory language of section,we shall interpret the exclusion by applying the usual rules of policy interpretation,breshears,supra,d at.state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,d at.
i nsurance coverage is interpreted broadly so as to afford the greatest possible protection to the insured,whereas exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly against the insurer.citation.mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.petitioners suggest that,despite the usual rules of interpretation,the exclusion should not be narrowly construed against the insurer in this instance,because sound policy reasons preclude payment of the increased costs of complying with building codes.
there is no public policy,as petitioners suggest,against enforcing policies that provide replacement costs over and above actual cash value,fraley allstate ins.th,d unetco industries exchange homestead ins.th,d conway farmers home mut.ins,supra,th,d.
in support of their contention,petitioners refer to a principle of the traditional indemnity concept of insurance articulated in breshears and borrowed by bischel and mccorkle,which states that the purpose of indemnity is to compensate the insured for the actual loss which he has sustained and not necessarily to place him in a better position than he was in at the time of the fire.breshears,supra,d at.bischel,supra,th at,d mccorkle,supra,d at.
the mccorkle court found that the like kind and quality or equivalent construction language served the purpose of fire compensate for the actual loss sustained,not to place the insured in a better position than he or she was before the fire.mccorkle,supra,d at.
the bischel court,relying on both mccorkle and breshears,was of the opinion that to permit recovery of costs attributable to code compliance would ignore one of the traditional concepts of fire insurance which is to indemnify and that owners of new buildings which conform with state or local building laws are merely reimbursed for costs which they actually incurred.on the other hand,the owners of buildings which do not conform with such laws are not permitted to recover costs which they never assumed in the first place.bischel,supra,th at,d,quoting breshears,supra,d at.
the policy in breshears was a traditional indemnity policy that promised to pay the actual cash value of the lost building,up to policy limits.breshears,supra,d at.actual cash value is the fair market value of a structure at the time it is destroyed.jefferson ins.superior court,supra,cal d at.since the policy in breshears did not provide additional coverage,the insured was entitled to no more than that,and if the court relied upon sound policy reasons,that sound policy may be found in the ordinary rules of contract,which required the court to enforce the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract,see mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.
it appears that the coverage in mccorkle was also limited to actual cash value,since the court relied upon section and breshears,and did not indicate that there was any additional coverage for replacement costs.see mccorkle,supra,d at.bischel,on the other hand,involved a fireman policy that provided guaranteed replacement cost coverage in language similar to the protector plus policy.bischel,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,the court,in relying upon section,breshears,and mccorkle,appears to enunciate a rule against enforcing replacement cost policies that provide coverage in excess of actual cash value,when it observed that t he common thread of these three theories is the notion that the purpose of insurance is not to put the insured in a better position than he or she was before the loss but rather to compensate for the actual loss sustained.id.at,d.
bischel reasoning is circular,coming inevitably back to the construction of an actual cash value policy,such as the traditional indemnity policy of breshears or mccorkle,which compensates for the actual loss sustained,rather than a guaranteed replacement cost policy.see,bischel,supra,th at,d.a replacement cost policy does more than an actual cash value policy it necessarily places the insured in a better position than actual cash value would provide.see conway farmers home mut.ins,supra,th at,d.
as one commentator explained,such windfalls are inherent in replacement cost policies,which obligate insurers to reimburse the insured for the actual cost of repairs and construction without deducting any amount for depreciation.for example,if an insured needed to replace a damaged roof,the insurer would be liable for the cost of the entire new roof,even if the damaged roof had been years old.wood,the insurance fallout following hurricane andrew miami,fn.omitted.
bischel underdeveloped analysis was apparently based upon the court mistaken belief that breshears involved guaranteed replacement cost coverage.summarizing the facts of breshears,the bischel court stated that the plaintiff sought benefits under his replacement cost fire policy to restore his destroyed building.bischel,supra,th at,d.the court discussion did not touch upon the distinction between actual cash value coverage and replacement cost coverage.
we conclude that bischel is an anomaly,and we note that its reasoning has not been followed in any published california judicial opinion.thus,even though bischel interpreted an exclusion that was substantially similar the exclusion in the protector plus policy,we shall rely upon our own analysis of the exclusion.see bischel,supra,th at,d.
the exclusion is found under the heading,section not insured,and the subheading,applying to coverage a and and separate structures and coverage property.its title leads the reader to expect a list of categories of injuries or damages that are excluded,but the categories of exclusions enumerated in that section relate to perils,although the word peril is not used the first on the list is the peril of earth movement.is water collecting on or soaking into the ground is nuclear hazard is faulty design and construction is the exclusion is power interruption is neglect by the insured is war is the freezing of pipes is other freezing is theft in or to a dwelling under construction is vandalism to a vacant dwelling and finally,lists nine additional perils,and expressly refers to them as perils.
it would therefore be reasonable for an insured to interpret,enforcement of any ordinance or law regulating construction,repair or demolition of a building or other structure,as describing a peril,not a type of damage or loss.indeed,similar language has been so interpreted by the courts of several other jurisdictions.see,dupre allstate ins,dupre bering strait school dist.rli ins.alaska,farmers union mutual ins.oakland,garnett transamerica ins.services idaho.
the alaska supreme court explained the significance of construing the enforcement of an ordinance or law to be a peril,as follows as we read this provision,it does not limit the insurance companies obligation for the cost of repair or replacement of the building when a loss has occurred that is covered by the policy,but merely states that if the loss itself is caused by an ordinance or law,there is no coverage.for instance,if some safety improvement of a building to which no other loss had occurred were required by an ordinance or law,the insurance company would not be liable.however,when the cost of repairing or replacing a building that had been damaged by fire is increased by the requirements of an ordinance or a law,the insurance company is not relieved of that cost.bering strait school dist.rli,supra,at,quoting garnett transamerica ins.services,supra,idaho at,at.
the colorado court provided examples of such enforcement perils,such as where fire spread to the insured building after other buildings were ordered burned by the health department to combat a plague where a drug house was demolished by a city pursuant to an ordinance and where the insured house is negligently set afire during fumigation.see dupre,supra,at.
other courts disagree and find the language of the exclusion to refer unambiguously to increased costs made necessary by changed building co
