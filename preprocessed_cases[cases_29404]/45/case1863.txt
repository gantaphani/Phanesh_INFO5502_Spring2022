do sung uhm and eun sook uhm the uhms appeal the district court order dismissing their complaint against humana health plan,and humana,collectively humana on the ground that their claims are preempted by the express preemption provision of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of act.the uhms also appeal the district court order denying their partial motion for reconsideration,in which they argued that unlike humana health plan,humana,is not regulated under the act,and therefore the claims against humana,can not be preempted.we have jurisdiction under.we affirm.
the act established medicare part d part d,a voluntary prescription drug benefit program for seniors.see et.under the act,health insurance providers contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,part of the department of health and human services hhs,to offer part d prescription drug plans pdps or plans to medicare beneficiaries.humana health plan,is a pdp provider humana,its parent company,is not 
in late,the humana as their part d provider,based in part on the representations humana made in its marketing materials in particular,the uhms relied on humana representation that they would be enrolled in the benefits plan,and therefore receive coverage for their prescription drugs beginning january,the first day part d sponsors could provide benefits under the act.
the uhms enrolled in humana pdp by filling out the humana prescription drug plan enrollment form.the uhms chose social security check deduction as their method of premium payment.accordingly,the plan premium was deducted from their january and february social security checks.
to receive benefits under the humana plan,beneficiaries were required to submit a form and allow for at least two weeks between submission of the form and receipt of their medications.as their enrollment date approached,the uhms had not yet received any information from humana about their prescription drug plan,including their identification cards,forms,or instructions on how to complete the forms and request and receive their drug benefits.concerned about their ability to obtain their medications through the plan,the uhms and their son repeatedly requested pertinent information from humana.they called,they sent humana was unresponsive.in late december,the uhms called humana telephone number to determine their status under the plan they were told by a humana representative that they were not recognized as members of the humana part d pdp.
january,came and passed,and the uhms did not receive the materials necessary for obtaining their drug benefits.the uhms were forced to buy their prescription medications at costs higher than those provided by humana plan,despite the fact that the pdp premium was deducted from their social security checks in both january and february of that year.
on february,the uhms filed a complaint against humana health plan,and humana,in the district court for the western district of washington,claiming breach of contract,violation of several state consumer protection statutes,unjust enrichment,fraud,and fraud in the inducement.the uhms filed the complaint on behalf of themselves and a putative class consisting of all persons who paid,or agreed to pay,medicare part d prescription drug coverage premiums to humana and who did not receive those prescription drug benefits in either a timely fashion or at all.
humana responded with a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,for failure to state a claim,which the district court granted.the district court concluded that the standards promulgated by cms under the act governed the uhms grievances as alleged in the complaint,that the administrative process established by the act was the appropriate vehicle for addressing each of the uhms grievances,and that therefore the uhms state law claims were preempted by the act express preemption provision.
the uhms filed a motion for partial reconsideration,arguing that their claims were not preempted with respect to humana,because humana,is not a pdp provider.the district court similarly denied that motion.the uhms timely appealed both orders

preemption provision 
humana contends,and the district court ruled,that each of the uhms state law claims are preempted by the act express preemption provision.we may find preemption only where it is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.rice santa fe elevator.because the act contains an express preemption provision,the task of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the clause,which necessarily contains the best evidence of congress intent.csx,easterwood,d.
medicare part d incorporates the express preemption provision contained in part c,the medicare advantage ma program,which provides medical benefits to seniors through managed care the part d preemption provision states 
the provisions of sections g prohibition of premium taxes and b preemption of this title shall apply with respect to pdp sponsors and prescription drug plans under this part in the same manner as such sections apply to ma organizations and ma plans under part c of this subchapter.
the part c preemption provision in turn provides 
the standards established under this part shall supercede any state law or regulation other than state licencing laws or state laws relating to plan solvency with respect to ma plans which are offered by ma organizations under this part.
b.see also a adopting same language in part d implementing regulations the standards established under this part supercede any state law or regulations other than state licencing laws or state laws relating to plan solvency for part d plans offered by part d plan sponsors.
the plain language of the statute provides therefore that cms standards supercede state law or regulations insofar as the state law or regulation is with respect to a prescription drug plan offered by a pdp sponsor.
the inclusion of the phrase law or regulation demonstrates congress intent to expressly supplant only positive state enactments.see sprietsma mercury marine,d interpreting the phrase law or regulation as indicating congressional intent to expressly preempt only positive state enactments and not common law.as the court in sprietsma reasoned,if the term law was meant to encompass common law claims,it might also be interpreted to include regulations,which would render the express reference to regulation in the clause superfluous.id.
an express preemption provision,however,may reach beyond positive enactments,such as statutes and regulations,to embrace duties.bates dow agrosciences,d.despite congress inclusion of an express preemption clause,we are not categorically preclude d from applying principles of implied preemption to determine what exactly congress intended to preempt.metrophones,global crossing,cir.the supreme court has recognized implied preemption in two realms 
field,where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,and conflict where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.
gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.there is no field preemption here.while it is true that the act augmented the scope of the preemption provision congress did not signal its intent to occupy the entire field of medicare regulation.first,congress expressly left states the authority to regulate health plans in the areas of licensure and solvency,clearly demonstrating congress recognition that the states maintain some role in the field.see b.second,the express provision provides that federal law preempts state law only to the extent that the federal government establishes standards.b.this express language signals congress intent to preempt state law only insofar as federal standards exist.metrophones,at congress did not occupy the entire field of payphone regulation by limiting federal preemption to state requirements that are inconsistent with federal regulations total tv palmer commc ns,cir recognizing that a provision superseding inconsistent state laws is simply a recognition that congress did not intend to fully occupy the field.
here,the implied conflict preemption analysis is substantially similar to the analysis of the act express preemption provision state common law is preempted to the extent that there are federal standards.allowing a common law action in a realm where federal standards exist would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.gade,at.internal quotation marks omitted.state common law actions,however,may stand in arenas where neither congress nor cms has established standards.thus,our task is to determine whether the uhms claims are subsumed by standards established pursuant to the act.humana contends that cms has promulgated govern each of the uhms claims,and therefore all of their causes of action are preempted specifically,the act and the implementing regulations contemplate disputes between pdp sponsors and beneficiaries,and cms has created two mechanisms to deal with those disputes coverage determination procedures and grievance procedures.humana maintains that the uhms complaints are actually grievances or requests for a coverage determination.cms has also promulgated extensive regulations governing the marketing of pdps,which humana argues preempts the uhms remaining claims.
the uhms argument,by contrast,is premised on the position that their claims exist outside of the act and its implementing regulations.the uhms maintain that the cms standards are irrelevant because their claims are antecedent to their participation in the plan that is,their claims all concern humana conduct,and furthermore,they assert that humana failed to ever actually enroll them in the pdp,making any remedies provided for under the act inapplicable and unavailable to them.
enrollment 
most of the uhms claims center on a single issue whether the uhms are enrollees as defined in the regulations.indeed,at oral argument,counsel for the uhms conceded that if the uhms were enrolled in humana pdp the case would die on those terms.we conclude that the pertinent question is not whether the uhms were enrolled,but rather,whether they were enrollees within the meaning of the act and its regulations.we conclude that they are properly classified as enrollees.
the uhms allege that humana failed to actually enroll them in the pdp,and therefore the act terms do not apply to them.they maintain that humana representatives explicitly told them that they were not recognized as members of the humana part d pdp when they called humana line in late december.at oral argument,counsel for the uhms argued that we must accept the uhms assertion that they were not enrolled in the pdp because their claims were dismissed under rule b.as far as purely factual assertions are concerned,that is correct.however,insofar as enroll or its derivative,enrolled,enrollment,has a legal meaning under the statute,our task is to determine the meaning of that term,and whether the facts as alleged by the uhms comport with it or not 
section of the implementing regulations,titled enrollment process provides 
a part d eligible individual who wishes to enroll in a pdp may enroll during the enrollment periods specified in,by filing the appropriate enrollment form with the pdp or through other mechanisms cms determines appropriate.
a.thus,according to this regulation,an eligible individual enrolls by filing the appropriate enrollment form with the pdp.that is precisely what the uhms allege they did.their complaint alleges that plaintiffs uhm signed the humana prescription drug plan enrollment form for medicare part d prescription drug plan benefits that humana drafted and presented to plaintiffs uhm.the regulations also require,however,that the pdp sponsor must timely process an individual enrollment request in accordance with cms enrollment guidelines and enroll part d eligible individuals who are eligible to enroll in its plan under a and who elect to enroll or are enrolled in the plan during the periods specified in.c emphasis added.
enroll,therefore has two distinct if related usages.an eligible individual enrolls by filing the enrollment form with the pdp sponsor.see a.the pdp sponsor,in turn,enrolls the individual during the periods specified by process ing the individual enrollment request in accordance with cms enrollment guidelines.c.the question remains therefore,at which point an eligible individual is enrolled in the that individual submits an enrollment form,or only after the pdp sponsor has effectively processed it 
although the uhms allege,and we accept,that a humana customer service representative told the uhms that they were not recognized as members of the humana part d pdp,the uhms do not allege that humana issued them a notice of denial of their enrollment request,in a format and manner specified by cms.see d.moreover,on the facts alleged in the complaint,we can reasonably infer that humana engaged in some processing of the uhms enrollment request because humana managed to obtain premium deductions from their social security checks.
fortunately,this case does not require us to discern the exact moment when a medicare beneficiary becomes enrolled in a pdp that is because the operative term for our purposes is enrollee.as we explain below,the uhms common law claims are better understood as coverage determinations and for resolving disputes between plans and beneficiaries under the act.the regulations specify that the coverage determination and grievance procedures are available to enrollees.see a each part d plan sponsor must have a procedure for making timely coverage determinations regarding the prescription drug benefits an enrollee is entitled to receive under the plan c individuals who can request a standard or expedited coverage determination are the enrollee the enrollee appointed representative,on behalf of the enrollee or the prescribing physician,on behalf of the enrollee.b e nrollees have t he right to have grievances between the enrollee and the part d plan sponsor heard and resolved by the plan sponsor,as described in.
according to the regulation,e nrollee means a part d eligible individual who has elected or has been enrolled in a part d plan.that is,the uhms are enrollees if they elected a part d plan.although the term elected is not defined,we discern from the above regulations that an eligible individual elects a part d plan when he submits an enrollment form to the part d sponsor.see c a pdp sponsor must timely process an individual enrollment request in accordance with cms enrollment guidelines and enroll part d eligible individuals who are eligible to enroll in its plan under a and who elect to enroll or are enrolled in the plan during the periods specified in.emphasis added a a part d eligible individual who wishes to enroll in a pdp may enroll during the enrollment periods specified in,by filing the appropriate enrollment form with the pdp or through other mechanisms cms determines are appropriate.see also webster new universal unabridged dictionary defining elect as to pick out,choose,select because the uhms complaint alleges that they filed an enrollment form with humana,the uhms are properly classified as enrollees for purposes of the act.as enrollees,the coverage determination and grievance procedures were available and applicable to them.having determined that the uhms were pdp enrollees,we proceed to determine whether each of their claims is preempted.
claims involving the failure to provide benefits 
coverage determinations 
the act provides that disputes between pdp sponsors and enrollees will be resolved through the coverage determination process.see g.the regulations define a coverage determination as 
a decision not to provide or pay for a part d drug including a decision not to pay because the drug is not on the plan formulary,because the drug is determined not to be medically necessary,because the drug is furnished by an pharmacy,or because the part d plan sponsor determines that the drug is otherwise excludable under section a of the act if applied to medicare part d that the enrollee believes may be covered by the plan 
failure to provide a coverage determination in a timely manner,when a delay would adversely affect the health of the enrollee 
a decision concerning an exceptions request under a 
a decision concerning an exceptions request under b or 
a decision on the amount of cost sharing for a drug.
although the uhms argue that their claim is antecedent to the coverage determination is,their complaint is that they were never able to request drug benefits in the first instance,let alone dispute the plan potential denial of a particular agree with humana that the plaintiffs raise a classic coverage dispute.
the uhms primary complaint,and the basis of their breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims,is that despite having paid their monthly premiums and filed the appropriate enrollment documents,humana failed to provide them with drug benefits.see,comp.plaintiffs uhm bring this action against defendants on behalf of all persons who paid were billed by humana,for enrollment in the humana part d pdp and a did not receive benefits under the humana part d pdp defendants breached each contract with plaintiffs and with each class member when they failed to provide prescription drug benefits as promised.defendants received monies as a result of payments made by plaintiffs and class member for prescription drug benefits that defendants failed to provide to plaintiffs and class members.
the appropriate recourse under the act was for the uhms to file with humana a request for a coverage determination,requesting reimbursement for the drugs they purchased.see a,b allowing for either a request for drug benefits or payment the coverage determination procedure and its related regulations preempt the uhms breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims.
grievances 
the other means to seek redress for a complaint against a pdp under the act is the grievance procedure.see f.a grievance is defined as any complaint or dispute,other than one that involves a coverage determination,expressing dissatisfaction with any aspect of the operations,activities,or behavior of a part d plan sponsor,regardless of whether remedial action is requested.insofar as the uhms claims are based solely on failure to provide id cards and forms,the uhms should have filed a grievance to seek resolution of those issues.see outlining the grievance procedure.to the extent that their complaint against humana regarding the documents is linked to the failure to receive benefits,that is a coverage determination dispute.accordingly,the uhms claims based on failure to receive relevant pdp documents from humana are preempted by the grievance procedure 
failure to enroll 
as discussed above,the uhms complaint also alleges that humana failed to properly enroll them in the pdp.it is not clear which,if any,of the uhms claims are actually based on an alleged failure to enroll.the essence of their complaint is not that they were improperly enrolled in the plan,but that they did not receive the benefits of being enrolled in the plan.their breach of contract claim is premised on the fact that they were enrolled in the plan and were not provide d prescription drug benefits as promised.the consumer protection act claims allege that humana promised prescription drug coverage would begin january,for those class members who enrolled by december,when in fact defendants knew,or should have known,that defendants would not be providing prescription drug coverage beginning january.
to the extent that any of the uhms claims can be construed to allege that humana did not properly or timely process their enrollment requests,standards governing enrollment preempt those claims.see,b a the secretary shall establish a process for the enrollment,disenrollment,termination,and change of enrollment of part d eligible individuals in prescription drug plans consistent with this subsection.b b in the case described in section h of this title relating to errors in enrollment,in the same manner as such section applies to part b of this subchapter.c a pdp sponsor must timely process an individual enrollment request in accordance with cms enrollment guidelines and enroll part d individuals who are eligible to enroll d providing that a plan sponsor must provide the individual with prompt notice of acceptance or denial of the individual enrollment request,in a format and manner specified by cms.outlining the disenrollment process a providing that a plan sponsor my not distribute an enrollment form until it has been approved by cms.
claims involving deceptive marketing 
the uhms consumer protection act and fraud claims allege that humana made material misrepresentations and engaged in other deceptive acts in the marketing and advertising of their part d plan to induce the uhms to enroll.specifically,the uhms allege that humana represented that their prescription drug coverage would begin on january,and that humana is committed to providing reliable customer service and has been a trusted medicare insurer for more than years,helping the medicare population with their health insurance needs.the uhms claims are preempted by the extensive cms regulations governing pdp marketing materials and practices.
the act provides that cms must approve all pdp marketing materials before they are made available to medicare beneficiaries.see b b vi incorporating h.the act requires that each pdp sponsor shall conform to fair marketing standards,h,and that cms shall disapprove or later require the correction of such material or form if the material or form is materially inaccurate or misleading or otherwise makes a material misrepresentation.h.cms has promulgated detailed regulations governing how pdp sponsors market their plans.see a f.pdp sponsors may not distribute any marketing materials or enrollment forms,or make such materials or forms available to part d eligible individuals unless they have been.a.cms regulations also extend to marketing activities.see f iv prohibiting activities that could mislead,confuse,or misrepresent.
marketing materials are defined in the regulations as any informational materials targeted to medicare beneficiaries which promote the part d plan.inform medicare beneficiaries that they may enroll,or remain enrolled in a part d plan.explain the benefits of enrollment in a part d plan,or rules that apply to enrollees.explain how medicare services are covered under a part d plan,including conditions that apply to such coverage.b.examples of marketing materials include brochures,newspapers,magazines,television,radio,billboards,yellow pages,or the internet marketing representative materials such as scripts or outlines for telemarketing letters to members about contractual changes and membership or claims processing activities.c.enrollment forms are also governed by these regulations.see a.
the materials referenced by the uhms are marketing materials as defined by the regulations.the promotional statements that are the focus of their claims are directly governed by the regulatory standards set out by cms.section d provides that cms will not approve marketing materials or enrollment forms that are materially inaccurate or misleading or otherwise make material misrepresentations.cms also requires that all marketing materials and enrollment forms provide adequate descriptions of all rules,an explanation of the grievance and appeals process,and any other information necessary to enable beneficiaries to make an informed decision about enrollment.d i iii.accordingly,the uhms fraud and consumer protection claims are preempted.
g.the uhms motion for reconsideration 
the uhms argued in their motion for reconside
