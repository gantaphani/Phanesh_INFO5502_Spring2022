john veysey appeals from his conviction,after a jury trial,and sentence of years in prison for mail and wire fraud,arson,and the related offense of felony by fire.the facts are amazing,but we shall resist the temptation to recount them at length.in veysey set fire to his house and inflated the claim that he then filed with his insurer.the insurer paid,and the house was rebuilt.the following year veysey married a woman named kemp,increased the insurance on the house,removed the valuable contents of the house,along with himself and his wife,and then cut the line inside the house,causing the house to fill up with gas and explode spectacularly,utterly destroying it.he grossly exaggerated the value of the property allegedly lost in the did not exist and some he had removed before the explosion.the insurance company a different one paid,and he used part of the proceeds to buy another house.the next year he tried to kill his wife by driving his van with her in it into a river.when that failed he killed her by poisoning her,and collected in the proceeds of insurance policies on her life.he placed personal ads in newspapers,seeking to meet women.he became engaged to one of the women he met through his ads,named donner,but broke his engagement after failing to procure a million policy on her life.he then took up with a beetle.this was in and the same year he burned down his house,again submitting an inflated estimate of the loss and receiving substantial proceeds from the insurance company a different one,again.he then married beetle,and they moved into a rented house.she insured her life for with him as beneficiary.one night in,after drugging her,he set fire to the house,hoping to kill both her and their infant son,on whom he had also taken out a life insurance policy and who was in the house with her.they were rescued,and soon afterwards veysey and beetle divorced.the house was rebuilt and veysey persuaded a woman named hilkin to move in with him after she had accumulated some in life insurance and named him as the primary beneficiary.he apparently intended to murder her,but he was arrested before his plans matured.there is more,but these are the highlights.
we reverse the usual order of discussion and begin with the sentence,since the reader may wonder how,egregious as veysey conduct was,it warranted the equivalent of a life sentence when the single count of arson the burning down of the rented house carried a maximum sentence of years,mail and wire fraud carry a maximum sentence of years,and the use of fire in a felony its use to commit the mail and wire fraud,that is,the fraud against the fire and life insurance companies carries a maximum sentence of years.the answer is that veysey was convicted of separate counts of mail or wire fraud and that the judge imposed the maximum sentence of years on each count and made the sentences run consecutively,for a total of years,and consecutively as well to the sentence for arson that she imposed and the sentence for using fire in a felony that she also imposed thus years.
the federal sentencing guidelines direct the judge,when there are multiple counts of conviction,to impose maximum and consecutive sentences to the extent necessary to make the total punishment equal in severity to what the guidelines would require were it not for the statutory maxima.d see also united states dumes,cir.because veysey remarkable spree included murder as well as attempted murder,multiple arsons,and multiple frauds,the guideline sentence would have been life.a,application note see also united states lanas,cir.the judge exceeded no statutory maximum in producing an equivalent sentence.
because veysey sentence exceeded no statutory maximum,the rule of apprendi new jersey,d,was not violated.apprendi holds that a fact which results in a sentence greater than what,were it not for the fact,would be the statutory maximum sentence for the defendant crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.united states bjorkman,cir.so if the maximum sentence for arson of a nonresidential building were years but of a residence,a defendant could not be sentenced to more than years without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the building he had set fire to was indeed a residence.but a fact that merely moves the defendant sentence around within the statutory sentencing range need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.harris united states,d thomas united states,cir united states de la torre,cir.
veysey contends that the case should have been severed for trial into seven different trials,but this is another frivolous claim,and likewise his objection to evidence concerning his drugging of still another woman.so closely related were all veysey criminal acts that if there had been seven trials all those acts would have been placed in evidence in all the trials,as showing intent,modus operandi,and the scope of the scheme to defraud.united states prevatte,cir united states mcgauley,cir united states prosperi,cir.
more substantial is veysey contention that the arson of the rented house was not subject to the federal arson statute because the house was not used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce,as required by the federal arson statute.i.the supreme court has held that arson of an home is not within the statute reach because home ownership is not an activity affecting commerce,jones united states,d which is why veysey other three arsons were not charged under the that arson of an apartment building consisting of rental units is within the statute because the rental of real estate is an activity affecting commerce.russell united states,d.between the two cases the supreme court conception of interstate commerce narrowed,but jones reaffirms russell,see at,and we are given no reason to doubt the continued authority of the earlier case.
the present case nestles somewhere in between jones and russell.the house was rented but the owner was not engaged in a commercial activity,as was the apartment house owner in russell.the owner of the house that veysey rented was a typical householder,who after living in the house for several years had moved to another state and after trying unsuccessfully to sell the house decided to rent it.he rented it first to a family for six months and then to veysey for a year at a monthly rental of.the lease gave veysey an option to buy the house at the end of the year for.had veysey burned down the house while the original owner was living in it,or had he burned it down after exercising his option and buying the house,the arson would have been beyond the reach of the federal statute,by virtue of the jones case.at argument a member of the court remarked the awkwardness of property drifting in and out of interstate commerce.and under pressure of that awkwardness one might try to distinguish the present case from russell by noting that the owner of the apartment building in that case was in the business of renting,while the owner of the house that veysey torched was an accidental renter.he rented the house only because he could sell it at an acceptable price.he did want to be in the real estate rental business.but he was,and the real estate rental market is interstate,as this case illustrates the owner was in a different state both when he rented the house to veysey and when the arson occurred.to decide this case differently from russell would imply a need to inquire in every case into the motives for renting,and the inquiry would complicate decision making without offsetting gain.we repeat that the real estate rental market really is an interstate market and the rental in this case was an interstate transaction.
the last issue we consider is veysey objection to testimony by an actuary,charles mcclenahan,that the probability of four residential fires occurring by chance during the months between april when veysey bought the first house that he is known to have set fire to and january when he set fire to his last house was only one in trillion he described this as a conservative estimate.we can imagine two distinct grounds for veysey objection to the actuary evidence.the first
