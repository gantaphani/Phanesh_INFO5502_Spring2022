introduction 
patrick ojo ojo,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated appeals the district court dismissal under.b of a class action suit brought against farmers group,and its affiliates,subsidiaries,and reinsurers collectively farmers.the complaint alleges,inter alia disparate impact race discrimination in violation of the federal fair housing act fha,et.
ojo,an resident of houston,texas,alleges that farmers used a number of undisclosed factors to compute credit scores and price homeowners insurance policies.as a result,farmers charged minorities higher premiums for homeowners property and casualty insurance than the premiums charged to similarly situated caucasians.farmers moved to dismiss the complaint under b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and under b for failure to state a claim the district court granted farmers b claim on the grounds that it was by the act,et.
in dismissing ojo claim,the district court erred in two respects.first,the district court erroneously read ojo claim as challenging the practice of credit scoring per se.second,the district court erroneously interpreted texas state insurance law as permitting disparate impact race discrimination that results from credit scoring,thereby triggering.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.
ii.background 
a.the class action complaint 
patrick ojo is an resident of houston,texas,and the owner of a homeowner property and casualty policy issued by farmers group,in january,farmers increased the premium on ojo homeowner policy by nine percent,despite the fact that he had made no prior claims on the policy.farmers allegedly advised ojo that the increase was due to unfavorable credit information obtained through the company automated credit scoring system also referred to as farmers automated risk assessment system.
according to ojo,o ver the years farmers has employed geographical distinctions and various other artifices to identify and target minorities for the purpose of charging minorities higher premiums than the premiums charged to similarly situated caucasians.specifically,he contends that the credit scoring system is a formula that uses a number of undisclosed factors to produce a credit score for each applicant for homeowners property and casualty coverage the complaint further alleges that m inorities as a group have lower credit scores than whites,and that the effect of farmers credit scoring system is that minorities are charged disparately higher prices in violation of the federal fha 
ojo also alleges that farmers has vigorously defended its use of this credit scoring system as actuarially sound,whilst keeping secret the formula,the actuarial basis for the formula,and the specific credit factors which impact a policyholder score.the result is that the price an individual pays for a policy is largely dependent on a secret credit score allegedly justified by secret actuarial information.as a result of farmers unlawful practices,ojo and those similarly situated have lost and face losing millions of dollars in premiums paid as a result of overcharges due to racial discrimination.
the act or act provides that t he business of insurance shall be subject to the laws of the several states which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business.a.provides that n o act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance.id.b see als humana forsyth,d.in sum,the act establishes a form of inverse preemption which prevents a federal law of general applicability from inadvertently impairing state laws regulating the business of insurance.see also merchants home delivery serv.frank hall,cir.
the supreme court has outlined the analytical framework for questions when federal law does not directly conflict with state regulation,and when application of the federal law would not frustrate any declared state policy or interfere with a state administrative regime,the act does not preclude its application.humana,at.stated differently,three requirements must be met before a state insurance law preempts a federal statute the federal law in question must not be specifically directed at insurance regulation there must exist a particular state law or declared regulatory policy enacted for the purposes of regulating insurance and application of federal law to the controversy in question must invalidate,impair or supersede that state law.dehoyos allstate,cir emphasis added 
the supreme court has defined the terms invalidate,impair,and supersede as they are enumerated in.invalidate is defined as render ing ineffective,generally without providing a replacement rule or law.humana,at.supersede is defined as displac ing and thus render ing ineffective while providing a substitute rule.id.
as for impair,humana concluded that congress did not intend for state insurance laws to completely and automatically preempt any federal statute not specifically directed at insurance regulation.at.we reject any suggestion that congress intended to cede the field of insurance regulation to the states,saving only instances in which congress expressly orders otherwise.while states have administrative regimes and mechanisms in place to regulate insurance fraud,the question is not whether the state administrative regime has occupied that field.instead,the question is whether the state and federal regulatory goals are in harmony.dehoyos,at quoting humana,d.
humana also held that when state law proscribes conduct similar to that proscribed by federal law,the fact that federal law provides different or stronger remedies does not bar application of federal law.humana,at.emphasis added.in such circumstances,federal law complements,rather than impairs,frustrates or interferes with state law.id.at.
c.the federal fair housing act 
the federal fair housing act states that it is unlawful t o discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.b emphasis added.
the sixth and seventh circuits recognize that the fha ban on racial discrimination extends to the underwriting of homeowners property insurance.nationwide mut.ins.cisneros,cir concluding that no congressional intent exists to preclude the application of the fair housing act to insurance underwriting practices am.family mut.ins,cir the federal fair housing act applies to discriminatory denials of insurance,and discriminatory pricing,that effectively preclude ownership of housing because of the race of the applicant fair housing alliance,prudential ins.of,d,the application of the fha to homeowners insurance is fully consistent with the statute purpose in eliminating discrimination resulting in segregated housing and lack of equal housing opportunities,citing trafficante metropolitan life ins,d.
while the federal fha applies to cases involving discriminatory denials of homeowners insurance to persons based on race,the act is not specifically directed at insurance regulation.see cisneros,at b ecause the fha does not mention insurance,it is covered by the act and can not be construed to invalidate,impair or supersede any state law enacted to regulate the business of insurance am.family mut.ins,at recognizing that the fair housing act does not mention insurers.
texas state law 
like most states,texas has a statutory scheme regulating the business of insurance.the texas insurance code broadly prohibits unfair discrimination in the premium rate charged for insurance because of race,color,religion or national origin,as well as age,gender,or disability.a.section a provides 
a person may not refuse to insure or provide coverage to an individual,refuse to continue to insure or provide coverage to an individual,limit the amount,extent,or kind of coverage available for an individual,or charge an individual a rate that is different from the rate charged to other individuals for the same coverage because of the individual 
race,color,religion,or national origin 
age,gender,marital status,or geographic location or 
disability or partial disability.
id.section contains various exceptions to certain subsections of.section b states that a person does not violate section a age,gender,marital status,or geographic location or disability or partial disability if the increased insurance coverage charge is based on sound underwriting or actuarial principles reasonably related to actual or anticipated loss experience.id.b.significantly,the district court emphasized that,d iscrimination on the basis of race is conspicuously excluded from the exceptions provided in b.
subsection c of provides another exception to an insurer does not violate the unfair discrimination provision of a or if the refusal,limitation,or charge is otherwise required or authorized by law or a regulatory mandate.c.this provision is particularly important because,in,texas enacted a new insurance law authorizing and regulating the use of credit scoring by insurers.act of june,leg.ch.sess.law serv.vernon,codified in.et hereinafter credit scoring law.in pertinent part,the credit scoring law requires insurers who use credit scores in underwriting to disclose certain credit scoring information,notify applicants of any adverse actions,and file their credit scoring models with the texas department of insurance.importantly,nowhere does texas insurance law explicitly require insurers to file,reveal,or make known the specific factors used in its credit scoring models.
farmers attempts to invoke the public filing requirements,enumerated in.and,as a shield against any scrutiny of its credit scoring practices.but ojo does not challenge farmers use of credit scoring per se.he challenges only the use of certain undisclosed factors used in farmers credit scoring model.the sections pertaining to filing requirements do not explicitly require that insurers file or make public the specific factors used in calculating a homeowner risk assessment rate.because ojo should be permitted discovery so that he can unearth farmers homeowners insurance credit scoring system,we reverse the district court.see generally swierkiewicz sorema,d recognizing that,at least insofar as a claim of employment discrimination is concerned,i t may be difficult to define the precise formulation of the required prima facie case before discovery has unearthed relevant facts and evidence.ojo deserves his day in court.
moreover,the texas credit scoring legislation imposes another critical limitation on insurers doing business in that state.an insurer may use credit scoring,except for factors that constitute unfair discrimination,to develop rates,rating classifications,or underwriting criteria.id.emphasis added.section makes actionable a violation of an insurer may not use a credit score that is computed using factors that constitute unfair discrimination.id.furthermore,in the same legislation that authorized credit scoring,texas also enacted a statute defining unfairly discriminatory for purposes of insurance rates used under this code.b.the statute provides,inter alia,that a rate is unfairly discriminatory if it is based in whole or in part on the race of the policyholder or an insured.c.
the credit scoring law also empowers the texas commissioner of insurance commissioner to adopt rules that prescribe the allowable differences in rates charged by insurers due solely to the difference in credit scores.id.b.accordingly,farmers points to a regulation adopted by the commissioner stating that differences in rates charged due solely to credit scoring are permissible,provided that they are based on sound actuarial principles and supported by data filed with the department.admin.code a.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a case on federal preemption grounds.olympic pipe line city of seattle,cir williamson dynamics,cir.we also review de novo a district court interpretation of federal statutes.olympic pipe line,at.
iv.discussion 
as stated earlier,the district court erred in two respects.first,it erroneously read ojo complaint as challenging credit scoring per se,when in fact ojo challenges only farmers use of certain undisclosed factors in credit scoring and the disparate impact that resulted.second,the district court erred in concluding that ojo claim was by the act.
a.the district court erred by misinterpreting ojo complaint 
when reviewing a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.carson harbor village,city of carson,cir wolfe strankman,cir.as the district court acknowledged,this requires a reviewing court to construe the allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.ojo farmers group,wl at citing doe mann,d.
ojo complaint alleges that farmers credit scoring system has a disparate impact on minorities because it uses a number of undisclosed factors and has resulted in minorities being charged higher premiums for p olicies than caucasians.nowhere does the complaint challenge credit scoring per se.despite the lucidity of the complaint,the district court nonetheless concluded that ojo challenges the very practice of credit scoring.ojo at.on that basis,the district court concluded that,if ojo prevailed,then his victory would likely render certainly frustrate and interfere use of credit scoring models that are actuarially sound.id.
read in the light most favorable to ojo,the complaint does not advance an all or nothing challenge to the practice of credit scoring.the complaint alleges only that certain undisclosed factors used by farmers in its credit scoring system produces a disparate impact on minorities.therefore,the district court erred in concluding that ojo claim impaired texas state law because the claim challenged credit scoring per se.
b.the district court erred in dismissing ojo claim based on 
a claim is by when a federal law of general applicability conflicts with a state law relating to the business of insurance and when applying the federal law would frustrate any declared state policy or interfere with a state administrative regime.humana,at.importantly,where the state and federal regulatory goals are in harmony,is not triggered.dehoyos,at.
the district court properly concluded that the first two prongs of the framework were satisfied the federal fha is a law of general applicability and both the texas insurance code and texas subsequent credit scoring law were enacted specifically to regulate insurance.as to the third prong,however,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that the federal fha would invalidate,impair,or supersede texas state insurance law.
we review whether the district court was correct in concluding that ojo federal fha claim impairs texas state law.as the district court stated,t he question thus becomes whether texas credit scoring law requires or authorizes insurers to charge different rates on the basis of credit information such that they are exempt from the general prohibition on discrimination set forth in section of the texas insurance code.ojo at.
the district court recognized that the credit scoring law does not explicitly authorize the alleged disparate impact that results from credit scoring.ojo at.but based on its statutory analysis,the district court read the phrase in question,except for factors that constitute unfair discrimination,as prohibiting only disparate treatment based on invidious classifications,and not the use of actuarially sound credit scoring models that disparately impact minorities.id.for purposes of analysis,we hold that the district court erred in reading texas insurance law as permitting disparate impact race discrimination resulting from credit scoring.
in interpreting the phrase unfair discrimination,the district court applied texas rules of statutory construction w hen a statute is ambiguous,texas courts must consider all laws in pari materia,meaning we are to consider all laws related to the subject of the act and the general system of legislation of which the act forms a part.ojo at citing collins county of el paso,at.the district court stated,o ur objective is to ascertain the consistent purpose of the texas legislature in the enactment of the laws and to carry out the legislative intent by giving effect to all laws bearing on the same subject matter.id.the cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy.it is the court duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,rather than to emasculate an entire section estate of reynolds martin,cir quoting united states menasche.
first,while the district court properly referred to the statutory construction principle of consider ing all laws,the court failed to abide by that principle.in interpreting the phrase in question,unfair discrimination,the district court failed to consider other important provisions within texas law and its legislative history which prohibit unfair discrimination based on race.
the most significant oversight was the district court failure to consider that texas own fair housing act prohibits disparate impact race discrimination.et texas fha.a court must consider all laws related to the subject of the act in question and the general system of legislation of which the act forms a part.collins,at citation omitted.here,the act in question is texas credit scoring law and the subject is disparate impact race discrimination resulting from farmers credit scoring system.the general system of legislation of which the credit scoring law forms a part is the texas fha.
in enacting the texas fha,the texas legislature sought to provide rights and remedies substantially equivalent to those granted under federal law,b d see also meadowbriar home for children,gunn,cir.the federal fha prohibits both disparate treatment and disparate impact race discrimination.et.in implementing the texas fha,the state adopted a regulation identical to the federal regulation that banned both intentional and disparate impact race discrimination by insurers in refusing to provide property insurance or providing such insurance differently.admin.code b d.
considering all laws in pari materia,collins,at,we would be remiss in recognizing the texas fha prohibition against disparate discrimination while condoning the district court interpretation that texas credit scoring law permits the same.in failing to consider the texas fha,the district court erroneously concluded that the phrase unfair discrimination,read in light of texas general system of legislation,permits disparate impact race discrimination by insurers.
the district court also failed to consider another texas law that prohibits discrimination texas insurance code article.article c states that an insurance rate is unfairly discriminatory if it is i not actuarially sound,ii not correlated to risk,or iii based in whole or in part on race.c emphasis added.the use of the disjunctive term or indicates that an insurance rate based on one factor such as race is unfairly discriminatory even though it may be actuarially sound and correlated to risk.trading,cir in re porter.thus,article c further suggests that the district court erred in reading the phrase unfair discrimination as precluding disparate impact race discrimination.
second,in addition to failing to consider all laws in pari materia,the district court failed to apply the cardinal principle of statutory construction to save and not destroy.applying that rule to the phrase except for factors that constitute unfair discrimination necessitates the conclusion that texas insurance law prohibits all forms of unfair discrimination,and not just one.farmers,by contrast,urges us to bifurcate the phrase into two treatment and disparate impact to give meaning to one while flatly dismissing the other but we must give effect to a statute as a whole,and not render it partially or entirely void.id.quoting bresgal brock,cir.therefore,we understand unfair discrimination to prohibit both disparate treatment and disparate impact discrimination.
third,the district court overlooked that texas credit scoring laws themselves were designed to prevent discrimination.the district court stated that the texas legislature authorized the practice of credit scoring to help creat e a transparent process that would protect consumers and prevent discrimination.ojo at citing tx.
it is difficult to imagine that a state legislature would at once seek to proscribe insurance practices that are unfairly discriminatory as to race,color,religion,ethnicity,or national origin,and explicitly seek to prevent discrimination,while permitting insurers to use a credit scoring system that results in disparate impact race discrimination.while the district court is correct that texas clear legislative desire was to authorize at least some use of credit scoring,texas numerous prohibitions against any type of discrimination certainly do not support the conclusion that the texas legislature intended to permit disparate impact race discrimination.
fourth,the district court erred in concluding that,because texas law permits differences in rates due solely to credit scoring so long as the differences are based on sound actuarial principles.admin.code a,an actuarially sound system can inflict disparate impact discrimination on minorities and still be lawful.texas insurance law generally prohibits discrimination by insurers.this general prohibition,read together with texas insurance code broad ban against discriminatory insurance practices.d,strongly suggests that the credit scoring law was not intended to permit disparate impact discrimination on minorities 
the eleventh circuit decision in moore liberty ins,cir is instructive.in interpreting whether reverse preempted insurance discrimination claims brought by african american policyholders against an insurer,the court held 
we have not been directed to any relevant alabama authority that has required,condoned,or suggested that racial distinctions in the provision of life insurance are acceptable.indeed there is nothing in alabama insurance law that directs or encourages insurers to engage in such practices 
moore,at.similar to the texas law at issue here,the alabama law at issue in moore forbade unfair discrimination between individuals that occupied the same class of risks.id.at.in an argument similar to the one that farmers posits,the insurer in moore argued that alabama permitted racial discrimination so long as it was actuarially based.id.at.the eleventh circuit rejected the insurer argument and refused to construe alabama scheme of insurance regulation in such a formalistic and narrow way.id.at.
the moore court concluded that,absent convincing evidence that racial discrimination in the insurance context is an integral part of alabama regulatory scheme,no direct conflict exists between the federal fha and alabama state law.id.at.therefore,moore claims were not by because texas law is similarly bereft of evidence that texas encourage s or condone s racial distinctions in the provision of insurance,moore,at,we hold that the federal fha and texas fha are in regulatory harmony.ojo claim is therefore not by.dehoyos allstate,cir,further corroborates our decision.in dehoyos,six policyholders alleged that an insurance company credit scoring system targeted minorities by placing them in more expensive policies based on credit report information.plaintiffs brought a class action asserting violations of the federal fha and of and.allstate moved to dismiss,citing.the district court denied the motion to dismiss and the fifth circuit affirmed,holding that allstate had failed to identify any state statute or declared policy goal of a state scheme that would be frustrated by application of federal laws.id.at.
our case is analogous to dehoyos here,farmers has not identified any declared policy goal within texas state law that permits disparate impact race discrimination.while dehoyos was decided at a preliminary stage of litigation during which the district court decided not to differentiate between disparate treatment and disparate impact claims,at,the court nonetheless rejected the insurer claim that disparate impact claims are particularly likely to impair state insurance law.id.
lastly,we note the importance of a case decided after the district court decided ojo.in lumpkin farmers group.april,reconsideration denied july,a case involving an set of facts as those before us,the district court held that tennessee state insurance is almost identical to texas insurance no distinction between intentional and disparate impact discrimination.on that basis,the lumpkin district court denied the insurer motion to dismiss based on.
lumpkin,an plaintiff,on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated,brought a class action against farmers alleging disparate impact race discrimination in the issuance and pricing of homeowners insurance policies,in violation of the federal fair housing act.in a claim almost identical to ojo,lumpkin alleged that farmers credit scoring system resulted in disparately high premiums charged to racial minorities than those afforded to similarly situated caucasians.lumpkin,order denying def.motion to dismiss order denying mtd at.farmers moved to dismiss on the grounds that barred lumpkin claim because tennessee law prohibited disparate treatment discrimination,but not disparate impact.id.
for purposes of the analysis,we note that tennessee insurance law is almost identical to its texas counterpart in pertinent part,tennessee prohibits insurers from using an insurance score that is calculated using an ethnic group as a negative factor in any insurance scoring methodology.id.at.similarly,texas prevents an insurer from calculating a credit score using factors that constitute unfair discrimination,and prevents an insurer from us ing a credit score that is computed using factors that constitute unfair discrimination.
in denying farmers motion to dismiss,lumpkin expressly rejected farmers reading of tennessee same reading that farmers urges us to adopt here.lumpkin,order denying mot.for recons.at.there,the phrase that required interpretation was unfairly discriminatory.id.just as the district court did here,lumpkin looked to other provisions of state law to interpret whether unfairly discriminatory permitted disparate impact race discrimination.the lumpkin court concluded that farmers fail ed to show how tennessee permits disparate impact in insurance rates between caucasians and.id.at.
the lumpkin court went on to explain that a distinction between intentional discrimination and disparate impact discrimination has not been recognized in controlling case law and is not mandated by tennessee insurance law.id.at.significantly,the district court also stated that,e ven if such a distinction were acknowledged by courts,careful scrutiny of the tennessee insurance law scheme indicates that defendants motion to dismiss should have been denied because tennessee insurance law does not create such a distinction.id.emphasis added.
the lumpkin court criticized farmers for reading the phrase unfairly discriminatory too broadly to permit disparate impact as long as the rates are actuarially sound.id.it stated that the goals of federal and tennessee law are the same,preventing impermissible racial and ethnic discrimination,and that the two bodies of law can be applied in harmony to effect that purpose.order denying mtd at.lumpkin is indistinguishable from the case here the goals of the federal fha and texas fha,including the credit scoring law,are to prevent unlawful discrimination based on race,regardless of whether the discrimination involves disparate treatment or disparate impact.
conclusion 
the district court erred by misconstruing ojo complaint as challenging credit scoring per se,when in fact it only challenged farmers use of credit scoring that resulted in disparate impact discrimination against minorities.the district court also erred in interpreting texas credit scoring law as permitting disparate impact race discrimination despite evidence that the texas legislature intended to prohibit insurers from engaging in unfair discrimination.because ojo federal fha claim was not by,the district court erred in dismissing ojo complaint under.b.
we therefore reverse and remand to the district court to allow ojo federal fha claim to proceed.
reversed and remanded.
i respectfully dissent because the district court got it precisely right ojo complaint does not state a valid claim for relief because it does not allege that farmers uses any racebased considerations in its credit scoring system for the computation of insurance premiums.that is an essential allegation in a disparate treatment claim under the fair housing act fha,et.
but,the majority opinion is correct that ojo claim is not really a disparate treatment claim,but is a disparate impact claim.op.at.all right then,why is his claim nonetheless valid as a disparate impact claim,as the district court correctly insurance law,unlike the fha,makes it perfectly legal to use credit scores to price insurance policies,even if doing so causes a disparate impact on racial minorities,so long as race is not used as a criteria in computing the credit scores.but,of course,he does allege race is used as a factor.therefore,he fails to allege a viable claim for relief under either a disparate treatment or a disparate impact theory.
ojo does allege that farmer policy of using credit scores to price insurance policies results in a disparate impact on racial minorities.to make out a claim under texas law,ojo needs to allege that farmers uses race either directly to price policies or as a factor in determining a credit score that is used to price policies.texas law allows the use of credit scores to price policies where race is not a factor in the computation of the credit score,even if such use happens to have a disparate impact on racial minorities.c,vernon.admin.code a.
accordingly,the application of a federal law,such as the fha,which does not allow such use of credit scores if the credit scores have a disparate impact would invalidate,impair,or supersede texas law.thus,under the act,the district court was correct when it found that texas law reverse preempts the claims ojo makes under federal law,and was correct in dismissing the case for lack of federal jurisdiction 
the majority holds two things ojo complaint adequately states a claim for relief for disparate impact racial discrimination in violation of the fha and texas insurance law does not apply to effect a reverse preemption of the fha because ojo has alleged that undisclosed factors were used by farmers in computing its credit scoring.those undisclosed factors,as alleged by ojo,are interpreted by the majority as perhaps including considerations.such considerations would be equally illegal under the fha and texas insurance law.where both state and federal law prohibit a practice,the act does not provide for reverse preemption.therefore,the majority reasons,if discovery uncovers that considerations were a factor in farmers credit scoring algorithms,and such credit scores caused disproportionately higher insurance premiums to be charged to racial minorities,then ojo has alleged a valid class action claim under both federal and texas law.this reasoning sounds like it runs on rails,but there are actually several problems with it.
ojo failed to plead a disparate impact claim under texas law because,under texas law,there is no such thing 
the majority correctly describes ojo complaint as a disparate impact claim under the fha.in paragraph of his complaint,ojo directly complained of farmers use of credit data to underwrite and price homeowners insurance policies by alleging 
the automated credit scoring program has an adverse impact on minorities.minorities as a group have lower credit scores than whites.the effect of farmers credit scoring system is that minorities are charged higher premiums.
as is clear from this allegation,the majority is simply wrong when it says that ojo does not challenge farmers use of credit scores per se.that is exactly what the above allegation challenges.
a measure has a disparate impact on a racial group when its effect has a higher incidence in that group than in similarly situated groups of other races.there are no disparate impact cases under the fha title viii.the closest cases are found in federal employment discrimination cases title vii.
by citing ojo allegations of undisclosed factors which perhaps could be considerations,the majority appears to confuse disparate treatment and disparate impact claims.unlike a disparate treatment claim,a disparate impact discrimination claim does not require proof of intentional racial discrimination.watson fort worth bank trust,d.in federal disparate impact cases under title vii,after the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that a facially neutral practice has a disparate impact on racial minorities,the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to justify the practice as a business necessity.connecticut teal,d.
even under statutes that allow an action for claims based on disparate impact,such as title vii,not all measures that have a disparate impact are actionable.for instance,in association of educators california,cir en banc,we held that where the state gave teachers a legitimate test of the skills needed for their positions,the state had a valid affirmative defense that its test was a business necessity.this is also the statutory standard under title employer can defend a prima facie disparate impact case by proving business necessity.thus,the state was not liable.
by contrast,where a test was given that did not relate to the skills needed for the position,that measure was actionable.d iscriminatory tests are impermissible unless shown,by professionally acceptable methods,to be predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.albemarle paper moody,d.
texas insurance law differs from federal law when the practice being challenged is the use of credit scores to price homeowners insurance.texas law allows the use of credit scores,without an insurance company having to prove in each case that the use of credit scores satisfies a business necessity.in effect,texas law has already decided that the use of credit scores to price homeowners insurance constitutes a valid business necessity a defendant does not have to prove such business necessity in each case.
the texas insurance code specifically allows an insurer to use a policy holder credit score in the pricing of its policies,so long as the insurance company does not use race as a factor in computing the credit score 
an insurer may use credit scoring,except for factors that constitute unfair discrimination,to develop rates,rating classifications,or underwriting criteria regarding lines of insurance subject to this chapter.
vernon.insurance companies may set differences in rates due solely to credit scoring,as long as these differences are based on sound actuarial principles.admin.code a.texas law also provides that the use of credit scores is allowed even if it has a disparate impact on racial minorities.subsection c of states,a person does not violate section unfair discrimination based on race if the refusal,limitation,or charge is required or authorized by law or a regulatory mandate,as is the use of credit scores.c emphasis added.this is an exception to all of the discriminatory bases prohibited by,including race.
given that texas law specifically authorizes the use of credit scores,even if that practice results in a disparate impact on racial minorities,application of the would require a defendant to justify the use of credit scores as a business necessity in each invalidate,impair,or supersede the application of texas law.this means that under the act,texas law the fha.because ojo can not rely on federal law,the district court lacked federal jurisdiction.
to avoid the application of the act,ojo needed to have alleged a practice that violated not only federal law,but also texas law.what ojo needed to have alleged is that farmers uses considerations in its credit scoring algorithms.
which brings us to the question on which this case turns did ojo adequately allege that farmers credit scoring uses considerations when he alleged farmers used undisclosed factors in computing a policyholder credit score under the pleading standards set forth in bell atlantic,twombly,d,the answer is clearly no.
ojo did not plead a claim of racial discrimination 
the majority holds that when a plaintiff pleads the defendant is doing something unknown to harm the plaintiff,the court can fill in the missing facts and presume the plaintiff has pleaded the facts necessary to state a claim for relief.this holding could have far reaching implications because now the great unknown would conceivably save every complaint from a motion to dismiss.
perhaps recognizing that ojo does not have a valid disparate impact claim,the majority actually fills in the gaps in ojo complaint to provide him with a disparate treatment claim.
both the fha and texas law contain provisions prohibiting discrimination based on race in certain commercial situations.the fha does not directly address the sale of homeowners insurance,but it does state it is unlawful to discriminate against any person in the provision of services in connection with the sale or rental of a dwelling because of that person race.a b.this statute is the basis of ojo claim for relief.
our court has not yet decided whether the fha applies to discrimination claims with respect of the sale of homeowners insurance.the sixth and seventh circuits have decided the fha does apply to a disparate treatment claim in the sale of homeowners insurance.see nationwide mut.ins.cisneros,cir naacp am.family mut.ins,cir.the fourth circuit held the fha does not apply to homeowners insurance.mackey nationwide ins,cir the majority wisely refrains from deciding whether the fha applies to either a disparate treatment claim or a disparate impact claim in the sale of homeowners insurance.
under texas insurance law an insurance company can not use race as a factor in setting premiums.see.c.a vernon.similarly,insurance companies can not compute a credit score using factors that constitute unfair discrimination,such as race.a see also.
but ojo does not allege that farmers uses race either directly to set pricing or indirectly as a factor in its calculation of a policyholder credit score,which is in turn used to set pricing.all he alleges is that certain undisclosed factors are used.
the supreme court has made clear that a complaint f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atlantic.at citing wright miller,federal practice and procedure,ed.the pleading must contain something more than a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion of a legally cognizable right of action.
in bell atlantic,the court held that allegations of parallel conduct by the defendants in an antitrust case were insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss because that parallel conduct could just as easily result from sound business decisions independently made by each defendant,as from an agreement to collude with one another to fix prices.
it is just as plausible that the undisclosed factors upon which farmers relies in its credit score computations are.the disparate impact could as easily be caused by a legacy of historical societal discrimination and mistreatment,with which farmers had nothing to do.to state a claim of disparate treatment,the complaint must allege that farmers uses race as a factor in computing credit scores.
here,to remedy ojo deficient complaint,the majority reads disparate racial treatment allegations into ojo does so without a great deal of sense given that an insurance company credit scoring methodology is not undisclosed it is a matter of public record filed with the texas insurance commissioner.
insurance companies in texas using credit scores to price their policies are required to disclose certain credit scoring information,notify applicants of any adverse actions,and file the company credit scoring models with the commissioner of texas department of insurance,who is authorized to resolve any disputes.any party dissatisfied with an action of the commissioner may file a petition for judicial review against the commi
