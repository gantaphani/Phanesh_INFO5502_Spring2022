the cincinnati insurance company issued a financial responsibility bond guaranteeing that dixie management group,would deliver to the state of illinois taxes collected on sales of motor fuel at dixie truck stops.cincinnati surrendered the bond amount to the state after dixie incurred a substantial tax liability and declared bankruptcy cincinnati then brought this suit in diversity seeking indemnity from timothy leighton,a former dixie executive who signed dixie bond application as an individual indemnitor for cincinnati but was fired from dixie four years before cincinnati paid on the bond.on from the parties,a magistrate judge,presiding by consent,entered judgment as a matter of law for leighton,and later denied cincinnati motion to vacate under federal rule of civil procedure b.we affirm both decisions.
leighton was the corporate secretary and executive vice president of dixie,which operated several truck stops in illinois.in december,dixie applied to cincinnati for a financial responsibility bond for a motor fuel distributor guaranteeing dixie payment of the fuel taxes it collected.illinois will not issue a license to sell fuel without such a bond.leighton,in his capacity as executive vice president,signed a miscellaneous bond application on behalf of dixie.he and the other corporate officers,mark and kathy beeler,also signed the application as individual indemnitors.based on that application,cincinnati issued a bond for,an amount determined by the illinois department of revenue idor.the bond transaction was brokered by rodney brent of van gundy insurance,an independent agency that represents cincinnati in central illinois.
in the bond application dixie and its three officers,as individual indemnitors,requested that cincinnati become dixie surety for any bond,including the extension or renewal thereof.dixie and the individual indemnitors also certified their assent to nine paragraphs under the heading indemnity that identify specific obligations of the parties.three of those paragraphs are relevant here.in paragraph two,dixie and the individual indemnitors agreed to indemnify cincinnati from and against any liability,loss,cost,attorneys fees,and expenses whatsoever,including the enforcement of this agreement that cincinnati shall at any time sustain as surety or by reason of having been surety on this bond or any other bond issued for dixie.in paragraph six,dixie and the individual indemnitors agreed to waive notice of any change,alteration,or extension of any bond,and further agreed that their promise to indemnify cincinnati extended to any subsequent bond of any type issued for dixie.finally,in paragraph eight,cincinnati agreed that this indemnity may be cancelled as to subsequent liability by an indemnitor upon registered mail written notice to cincinnati home office.
in april,less than four months after issuing the bond,cincinnati increased the bond amount to.cincinnati provided idor with a change rider purportedly memorializing dixie agreement to the increased amount.leighton name,again in the capacity of executive vice president,appears on the signature line for dixie.cincinnati did not require dixie or the individual indemnitors to execute a new bond application prior to issuing the change rider.
in december,dixie terminated leighton under circumstances not disclosed in the record.the beelers,who remained with dixie,barred leighton from all dixie property and refused even to permit him back in the office to retrieve personal papers.leighton immediately met with brent,the van gundy agent,and told brent that his relationship with dixie had been severed leighton,however,did not write cincinnati to terminate formally his indemnity of dixie financial responsibility bond.
in the fall of,cincinnati began the process of renewing dixie bond.cincinnati wrote the van gundy agency in october requesting updated financial statements for dixie,leighton,and the beelers cincinnati also requested that a new bond application be executed because it had not obtained one before increasing the bond amount to.a van gundy employee,ruth hargis,returned cincinnati correspondence two weeks later after typing her own note at the bottom that leighton no longer worked for dixie.the next day,october,cincinnati faxed hargis a reply to her note it was our understanding that timothy leighton was a partner of dixie truckers.was there a change in ownership structure we used leighton financial status as part of our underwriting consideration for the bond.please advise as to the status of the ownership structure.hargis answer is not in the record,nor is there any evidence in the record concerning cincinnati communications with van gundy and dixie during the three months that followed.
in late january,dixie and the beelers executed the new application and indemnity agreement,which contained identical terms as the agreement.mark beeler signed in his corporate capacity on behalf of dixie,and both he and kathy not again as individual indemnitors.the beelers,though,still had not supplied updated financial statements,and cincinnati in early february threatened to cancel the bond.a month later,on march,cincinnati sent idor notice that it was cancelling the bond effective in days that action apparently produced the desired financial statements because on march cincinnati notified idor that it was rescinding its cancellation notice.
what cincinnati did not discover at the time,however,is that during dixie had accrued significant arrears in its tax payments to the state.in may,idor demanded that cincinnati surrender the full amount of its bond to cover unpaid fuel taxes assessed for the period between november and march.cincinnati wrote dixie and the beelers in july,reminding them of their duty to indemnify cincinnati and demanding that they create a cash reserve sufficient to cover cincinnati anticipated loss on the bond.idor contended that dixie still owed,and cincinnati paid idor in february.by then dixie and the beelers had filed for bankruptcy.
cincinnati then brought this lawsuit,naming as defendants the beelers and leighton.cincinnati attached to its complaint a copy of the original bond application bearing leighton signature,along with a copy of the bond issued for.the insurance company also attached a copy of the partially executed april change rider bearing the signature of its own representative but no signature from anyone at dixie.cincinnati alleged that leighton had executed the change rider,but the company could not locate in its records a copy of the fully executed document.cincinnati claimed that the agreement,as amended by the change rider which increased the bond amount to,remained in force and demanded that the beelers and leighton indemnify the company for the bond amount and associated costs.the beelers,because of the automatic stay arising from their bankruptcy petition,see,were promptly dismissed without prejudice,leaving only leighton to defend the suit.it is undisputed that prior to serving leighton with its lawsuit cincinnati had made no effort to seek indemnity from him.
leighton denied liability.in answering the complaint,he explained that he lacked sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to whether dixie had ever executed the change rider attached to cincinnati complaint.by way of affirmative defense,however,leighton went further and contended that cincinnati had given him no notice whatsoever of the change rider,and thus by trying to increase the bond amount without his knowledge had released him from the indemnity agreement.
leighton later filed what he styled as a motion for judgment on the pleadings,advancing the affirmative defense from his complaint and also arguing that the renewal of the bond agreement in early acted as a novation of the agreement.cincinnati had not yet mentioned the renewal,so leighton attached to his motion a copy of the new agreement and the related correspondence between cincinnati and the van gundy agency.cincinnati moved for summary judgment that same day.cincinnati argued that leighton could not defend that he lacked notice of the change rider because under paragraph six of the indemnity section of the agreement he had waived notice of changes to the bond.cincinnati also argued that leighton only means of securing a release from his obligation to indemnify the insurance company was to send written notice of cancellation pursuant to paragraph eight of the indemnity section since leighton had not done so,cincinnati argued that it was entitled to enforcement of the indemnity agreement.
leighton and cincinnati then exchanged responses to their respective motions.in defending against cincinnati motion for summary judgment,leighton submitted his affidavit describing steps he took after his termination to alert cincinnati that he no longer worked for dixie and that he wished to cancel his liability under the agreement.according to the uncontroverted affidavit,on the same day he was fired,leighton personally informed van gundy agent brent about his termination.brent,who represented himself to leighton as an agent of cincinnati,acknowledged during their meeting that he knew already from speaking with mark beeler that leighton had been fired.several weeks later,in january,leighton and brent spoke again,and brent promised to inform cincinnati that leighton had severed his relationship with dixie.brent assured leighton that he was not required to take any further steps to secure a release from the indemnity agreement.in his affidavit leighton also averred that in february he telephoned cincinnati at its home office to discuss his coverage under dixie directors and officers liability policy but was told that cincinnati could not discuss the matter because leighton was no longer employed by dixie.after that,leighton said,brent initiated another meeting in june,explaining that cincinnati was trying to collect unpaid insurance premiums from dixie and wanted brent to get from leighton whatever helpful information he might have about dixie.at that meeting brent confirmed that he had told cincinnati that leighton no longer worked at dixie,and once more assured leighton that he had done all that was needed to be released from liability to cincinnati.
for its part,cincinnati responded to leighton motion for judgment on the pleadings by repeating its premise that leighton had waived prior notice of the increased bond amount.cincinnati also reasserted its position that leighton only means of ending the indemnity agreement had been to send written notice to its home office.the insurance company said little about leighton novation theory,except to reject it in general terms and contend that a novation would not release leighton from liability for unpaid taxes that accrued in before the new bond agreement was executed.cincinnati also replied to leighton response to its motion for summary judgment,asserting for the first time that the bond was increased because idor wanted the higher amount as a condition of licensing dixie to sell fuel.cincinnati repeated its allegation that dixie agreed to the change rider,but the insurance company offered no supporting evidence.nor did cincinnati produce any evidence concerning its negotiations with dixie or the van gundy agency about the increase.
in october the magistrate judge addressed both parties motions in a single order,denying cincinnati and granting leighton.in ruling against cincinnati,the court reasoned that the evidence at summary judgment was consistent with leighton theory that the renewal of dixie bond agreement in had acted as a novation of leighton promise to indemnify cincinnati under the agreement,and thus the insurance company had not established as a matter of law its right to recovery under the agreement.then,in granting judgment for leighton,the magistrate judge concluded as a matter of law that the increase in the bond amount to was such a material change that it could not have been contemplated when leighton agreed to the waiver provision in paragraph six of the indemnity section of the agreement,and that,indeed,the increase was so substantial that it altogether invalidated the indemnity provision of the agreement.the court,of course,was still unaware that leighton name appears on the change rider filed with idor in.
cincinnati timely moved to reconsider under federal rule of civil procedure.the insurance company disputed the court view that leighton could not have foreseen the degree of increase in bond amount effected by the april change rider when he agreed to the waiver of notice in paragraph six of the indemnity section.cincinnati also contended that the court had erred in relying on leighton novation theory to defeat summary judgment because leighton never pleaded novation as an affirmative defense or included a novation argument in his response to cincinnati motion for summary judgment rather than in his own motion for judgment on the pleadings.on the same day it filed its rule motion,cincinnati also moved for leave to amend its complaint.cincinnati explained that it had obtained from idor a copy of the fully executed change rider bearing leighton signature.cincinnati proposed to amend its complaint by substituting this copy of the change rider for the copy of the partially executed document submitted previously.leighton opposed both motions.
in,the magistrate judge issued a brief order denying cincinnati rule motion,reasoning that it mostly rehashed arguments already raised and rejected.cincinnati then filed a motion to vacate the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.cincinnati argued that the presence of leighton name on idor copy of the april change rider refuted leighton contention that he lacked notice of the increased bond amount.according to cincinnati,the magistrate judge in granting judgment for leighton had relied heavily on leighton patently false representation that he was unaware of the change rider.cincinnati asserted that it was entitled to relief because of leighton fraud,misrepresentation,or other misconduct,and also because the company had been certainly surprised to discover defendant leighton signature on the original change rider obtained from idor.leighton responded to this motion by noting that cincinnati had offered no evidence that leighton signed the document,and by arguing that cincinnati had no excuse for waiting to obtain the copy from idor until after judgment was entered.
the magistrate judge denied cincinnati motions to vacate and to amend the complaint.while expressing concern with what in hindsight appear to be inaccurate assertions made by leighton regarding his knowledge,the court reasoned that cincinnati had offered no reason for waiting until after the entry of judgment to obtain a copy of the fully executed change rider.the court added,moreover,that the alternative basis for its wholly unaffected by what cincinnati characterized as new evidence.and,the court added,cincinnati motion for leave to amend was untimely and futile.
cincinnati appeals from both the underlying judgment and the denial of its rule b motion.the parties are in agreement that illinois law governs the substantive issues in this case.
as an initial matter,we must determine the nature of the grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of leighton.although the magistrate judge initially accepted leighton characterization of his motion as one for judgment on the pleadings,it is clear to us that the court actually treated it as a motion for summary judgment.cincinnati contests this view and argues that if the court did construe leighton motion as one for summary judgment then the court should have apprised cincinnati of that fact consistent with federal rule of civil procedure c.that rule provides that if matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule,and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent by such a motion by rule.see.c church motors,cir.
leighton the magistrate judge himself characterized as a summary judgment motion when he later denied cincinnati rule b cincinnati opposition plainly discuss matters that are not included in the pleadings and which the magistrate judge did not exclude from consideration.for example,leighton motion relies extensively on the attached copy of the bond application,which is not even mentioned in either the complaint or answer,and this newer application underlies one of the court two bases for finding in favor of leighton.furthermore,both leighton brief in support of his motion and cincinnati response brief discuss correspondence between cincinnati and van gundy from late and early that first appeared in the record as an attachment to leighton motion.thus it is apparent that the parties and the court disregarded its literal title and addressed the heart of leighton motion,which went well beyond the pleadings.see byrne nezhat,cir hughes vanderbilt,cir.
because we conclude that leighton was really asking for summary judgment,what matters is whether the magistrate judge afforded cincinnati notice and an adequate opportunity to respond,consistent with federal rule of civil procedure.cincinnati insists it was blindsided,but we can not see how.the fact that cincinnati had filed its own motion for summary which it maintained that no disputed issues of material fact it on notice that summary judgment for either party was a possibility.see advantage consulting group,adt sec,cir jones union pac,cir bridgeway citibank,cir goldstein fid.guar.ins.underwriters,cir simpson merch.recovery bureau,cir.moreover,cincinnati does not argue that it lacked an adequate opportunity to respond to leighton novation defense,which is the only legal issue linked to the bond renewal that first surfaced in leighton motion.instead,cincinnati claims it was denied a chance to marshal evidence that leighton indeed knew about the change rider.that contention is frivolous.cincinnati knew when it filed suit that it did have a copy of the fully executed change rider,and it knew as soon as leighton answered the complaint that the absence of his signature would be at the heart of his defense.but over the next five months cincinnati made no move to obtain a copy with leighton signature and moved for summary judgment without ever getting one,gambling that leighton actual knowledge of the rider would prove immaterial given the waiver provision in paragraph six of the indemnity section of the agreement.that gamble,however,had everything to do with cincinnati own motion for summary judgment,and nothing to do with its ability to respond to the novation argument in leighton motion.
we thus turn to the court ruling.the magistrate judge at times seems to suggest that cincinnati cancelled leighton indemnity obligation by increasing the bond amount to from without telling him.but our reading of the court decision leads us to conclude that the magistrate judge actually reasoned that leighton awareness of the change rider was immaterial because,in the court view,such a significant change in the underlying agreement was beyond the contemplation of the parties and could not be waived under paragraph six of the indemnity section of the bond application.whichever position the court intended,however,can not be reconciled with the language of the agreement or the illinois law that we must look to in interpreting it.
if the magistrate judge thought the increased bond was significant because there was no evidence that leighton agreed to the change,then the court ruling turns on its willingness to elide paragraph six,in which leighton waived notice of any change,alteration,or extension of any bond.although usually the obligations of a guarantor are discharged when parties to a contract unilaterally effect a material change in their own relationship that also affects the potential liability of the guarantor,a guarantor is free to give prior consent to such leighton did by agreeing to paragraph six.see brzozowski northern trust,d,see also reliance ins.penn paving,data sales diamond z,collecting cases.on the other hand,if the magistrate judge viewed leighton waiver in paragraph six as ineffective in view of the size of the increased bond amount,we find no support for the proposition that the increase from to was so great that it essentially nullified the agreement the court cited no pertinent authority for this conclusion.see itt diversified credit kimmel,holding guarantor liable despite dramatic increase in liability because changes fit within the plain terms of waiver clause jacobson devon bank,d,same see also united states stump home specialties,cir same rule under indiana law.the waiver language in paragraph six unambiguously states that leighton waived notice of any change,alteration,or extension in the underlying bond,which plainly includes the increase in the bond amount.parties to such a guaranty contract are entitled to enforce its terms to the holding a party to its waiver of the consent to material alterations that may increase liability.see bank one,springfield roscetti,d.we have warned parties of the binding nature of these waiver clauses before.see stump home specialties,at stating that if guarantors had agreed to guaranty agreement waiver provision without consulting a lawyer and perhaps without even reading the agreement,that is their tough luck.leighton is presumed to have understood these clear terms when he signed the agreement.see fdic rayman,cir.accordingly,we reject the magistrate judge conclusion that leighton was released from liability when the original bond amount was increased to 
nevertheless,we do agree with the court alternate basis for holding that leighton indemnity obligation under the agreement was discharged the renewal of the bond agreement in acted as a novation that terminated his liability.a novation is the substitution of a new obligation for an existing one,which is thereby extinguished.faith martoccio,d.the four elements of a novation,which the party establishing the defense must prove by a preponderance of the evidence,are a previous,valid obligation a subsequent agreement of all the parties to the new contract the extinguishment of the old contract and the validity of the new contract.phillips arnold,frederick borgsmiller,d.for there to be a novation,the obligee must assent to the substitution and agree to release the obligor,at.the obligee assent need not be express,however,but may be implied from the circumstances of the transaction or the obligee subsequent behavior.burnett madison state bank.
cincinnati does not challenge the validity of the and agreements under factors one and four,and instead focuses on factors two and three.the insurance company argues that the express terms of the agreement prevent the renewal from acting as a novation.the company further contends that the record does not establish conclusively its intention to extinguish the agreement and replace it with the agreement.finally,cincinnati argues that even if a novation took place,leighton must still indemnify it against any tax delinquency incurred by dixie before the novation took place.
cincinnati first paragraph six of the indemnity section of the agreement forecloses leighton novation.as we have noted,paragraph six states that leighton waives notice of any change,alteration,or extension of any bond,and agrees that this indemnity shall cover any subsequent bond of any type for the applicant.to support its argument,cincinnati cites to champaign bank babcock,d,and united states fid.guar.klein,d,two cases in which illinois appellate courts held that a second agreement did not act as a novation because of contract language in the original agreement.yet these cases do not help cincinnati because in both,unlike this case,the first agreement expressly anticipated and rejected the possibility that a subsequent agreement could relieve the guarantor.in babcock,the agreement provided that no release of any person primarily or secondarily liable shall affect the liability of any of the undersigned hereunder,and that the guaranty would remain in full force and binding upon the undersigned until written notice of its discontinuance shall be received by the bank,at.in klein,the agreement provided that the indemnitor shall not be relieved of liability hereunder by any change,addition,substitution,continuation,renewal,extension,successor or new obligation,at emphasis added.by cont
