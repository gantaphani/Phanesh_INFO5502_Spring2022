factual and procedural background 
appellant civil complaint 
an investigation by the state bureau of automotive repair into appellant business,state auto body paint center,revealed that appellant had,among other things,inflated the cost of repairs,charged for repairs that were not made,and refused to release vehicles when payments were not made for unauthorized repairs.based on the investigation,criminal charges were filed,and a jury convicted appellant of four counts of misdemeanor grand theft and three counts of misdemeanor insurance fraud.he was placed on months of summary probation,ordered to serve days in county jail,and ordered to pay approximately in restitution to four individual victims and approximately in restitution to two insurance company victims.in september,the criminal trial court referred appellant to a financial evaluator to determine his ability to pay restitution,and ordered him to cooperate.
throughout the criminal proceedings,appellant was represented by several different attorneys,both appointed and retained.respondent was appointed to represent appellant in postconviction matters relating to alleged violations of probation for refusing to pay restitution and refusing to cooperate with the financial evaluator in determining his ability to pay.
the operative pleading is appellant first amended complaint the complaint.appellant purported to allege causes of action for professional negligence,fraud,intentional misrepresentation,concealment,deceit,constructive fraud,negligent misrepresentation,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,intentional infliction of emotional distress,abuse of process,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and violations of business and professions code section.the claims were supported by the following allegations.
in august,appellant appealed from the judgment of conviction in the underlying criminal case.respondent was appointed to represent appellant in november.respondent told appellant that he did not have time to spend on appellant case because he had more important cases to work on.appellant repeatedly asked respondent to review critical documents and evidence that demonstrated that restitution was not owed to various alleged victims and also that the amounts of restitution the prosecution could prove were incorrect,but respondent never informed the court that appellant contested the amount of restitution and failed to meet with him to prepare for restitution hearings.although appellant did not believe he owed restitution,from november,into december,he repeatedly told respondent that he could make small restitution payments as a gesture of good faith.
on november,the court remanded appellant into custody for failure to cooperate with the financial evaluator.thereafter,without appellant authorization or consent,respondent and the prosecutor induced appellant brother to pay the restitution,and assured his brother that any payment he made would be held in safekeeping in an account of the city of los angeles pending the appeal of appellant case.at a december probation violation hearing,respondent failed to inform the court that appellant was willing to make small restitution payments and improperly told the court that his brother volunteered to pay the restitution.
appellant attached to his complaint a declaration from his brother,stating that respondent and the prosecutor asked him to pay more than in restitution for appellant.appellant brother wrote that he delivered the check to respondent in the courtroom on december,but the money was not kept in a government account,as allegedly promised by respondent and the prosecutor.according to the complaint,appellant brother delivered a check for at a december,court hearing,and,despite the representation that the funds would be held in safekeeping pending appellant appeal from the judgment of conviction,the funds were instead to be distributed directly to the victims.appellant alleged that his brother has repeatedly demanded repayment from appellant.
appellant claimed that because of respondent conduct,the proceedings regarding restitution were unnecessarily delayed,appellant was found to be in violation of probation for failing to cooperate with the financial evaluator,and he was forced to remain in custody longer than would otherwise have been required.appellant alleged that as a result of remaining in custody,he suffered emotional distress damages of and lost income of.for all but his claim under business and professions code section,he sought damages for these sums,plus the sum of,the amount his brother paid in restitution,as well as punitive damages.for his claim under business and professions code section,he sought disgorgement of any funds paid to respondent by any source in consideration for representing appellant.
respondent demurrer 
respondent filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint.along with the demurrer,he submitted records from the underlying criminal proceedings,and asked the court to take judicial notice of the records.in the demurrer,respondent argued,among other things,that the demurrer must be sustained because appellant was unable to establish actual innocence of the underlying charges and probation violations and did not obtain postconviction relief.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to all the causes of action,but did not state specific reasons.
discussion 
on appeal from an order of dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer,our standard of review is de novo,we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citation.in reviewing the complaint,we must assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded by the plaintiff and matters properly judicially noticed.citation.however,we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law and may disregard allegations that are contrary to the law or to a fact which may be judicially noticed.citation.haro city of solana beach th.
when a former criminal defendant sues his or her attorney for legal malpractice resulting in conviction,the former defendant actual innocence of the underlying criminal charges is a necessary element of the cause of action.wiley,supra,cal th.moreover,the plaintiff must obtain postconviction relief in the form of a final disposition of the underlying criminal case for example,by acquittal after retrial,reversal on appeal with directions to dismiss the charges,reversal followed by the people refusal to continue the prosecution,or a grant of habeas corpus relief as a prerequisite to proving actual innocence in a malpractice action against former criminal defense counsel.coscia,supra,cal th at.hereafter in our opinion,when we refer to the actual innocence requirement,we mean to refer to both these elements actual innocence of the convictions and postconviction relief from the convictions.
as we explain below,we conclude that all appellant causes of action are based on alleged legal malpractice resulting in appellant being found in violation of probation,which in turn caused the harm for which he seeks compensation his incarceration and the restitution payment his brother made on his behalf for which the brother now seeks repayment the policy rationale of the actual innocence requirement mandates that appellant show actual innocence of the probation violations,and obtain exoneration because appellant did not comply with these requirements,the demurrer was properly sustained but because appellant has appealed to the appellate department of the los angeles superior court,and the record before us does not show the outcome of that appeal,we conditionally reverse the judgment as to the order denying leave to amend and remand the case to the trial court.
appellant causes of action 
appellant purported to allege not simply a claim for legal malpractice arising from the restitution and probation violation proceedings at which respondent represented him,but also claims for fraud,intentional misrepresentation,concealment,deceit,constructive fraud,negligent misrepresentation,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,intentional infliction of emotional distress,abuse of process,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and violations of business and professions code section.however,the nature of a cause of action does not depend on the label the plaintiff gives it or the relief the plaintiff seeks but on the primary right involved.bird,marella,boxer wolpert superior court th,bird.here,it is clear that the primary right involved in all of appellant claims is the right to competent legal representation id.at,and thus,for application of the actual innocence requirement,all are properly characterized as claims for legal malpractice.
in our analysis,we find the decision in lynch warwick th lynch helpful.there,the plaintiff,after pleading guilty to charges on the advice of subsequent counsel,sued his first privately retained attorney,alleging that he failed to interview witnesses,failed to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence,and otherwise failed to prepare for trial.id.at.defendant labeled his alleged causes of action legal malpractice,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duty.id.at.
on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,the court noted that despite the labels,a ll three causes of action seek damages attorney fees paid either to warwick the first attorney or to the attorney hired to replace warwick based on warwick negligent or inadequate representation and,thus,while titled differently,all three causes of action seek recovery for legal malpractice.lynch,supra,th at,fn.the court concluded that the actual innocence requirement innocence of the underlying convictions applied,because all the claims related to the alleged loss of a meritorious defense to the charges.indeed,even as to the claimed damages for having to retain a second attorney who advised him to plead guilty,guilt or innocence would be at issue since if lynch the plaintiff were guilty,lacked any meritorious defenses,or was reasonably advised by warwick to plead guilty,it could not be said that warwick was the cause of lynch incurring the expense of a second attorney.rather,the cause of the additional expense would have been lynch failure to earlier plead guilty as advised by warwick.id.at.
further,although the plaintiff sought a damage expenses for attorney fees and label ed one of his cause s of action as a breach of contract,he was actually seeking recovery on a tort theory for warwick negligence,lynch is seeking recovery for legal malpractice lynch,supra,th at and proof of the claim would involve proof of his guilt or innocence of the underlying charges.id.at bird,supra,th at distinguishing lynch,holding that the actual innocence requirement did not apply where plaintiff sued his former criminal attorneys for breach of contract,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and money had and received based on allegations not related to the quality of representation in the criminal trial,but on allegations of unethical and fraudulent billing practices such as not performing the work they claimed they performed,not incurring the costs they claimed they incurred,not using paralegals to perform tasks when appropriate,not confining bills for travel costs to travel.
in the instant case,although appellant gives various labels to his causes of action,the alleged facts supporting the claims show that all of them are based on legal malpractice,the primary right being the right to competent representation in the proceedings involving restitution and the related probation violations.see bird,supra,th at.
as alleged in his complaint,appellant was found in violation of probation for not cooperating with the financial evaluator and not timely paying restitution.his complaint alleges that respondent deficient performance in the restitution and probation violation proceedings caused the court to find him in violation of probation,resulting in his being incarcerated longer than was necessary.for that incarceration,he seeks damages for emotional distress and lost income caused by the incarceration.in so far as his claims are based on these allegations,the primary right sought to be vindicated is the right to competent representation in the restitution and probation violation proceedings.
similarly,appellant alleges that in the course of representing him,while appellant was in custody on the probation violation matters,respondent induced appellant brother to pay restitution on appellant behalf,without appellant permission,and did not inform the court that appellant was willing to make small installment payments.because his brother is demanding that appellant repay the restitution payment a payment not kept in a government account as purportedly promised,but rather distributed to the victims appellant seeks that sum in damages.again,regardless of the various labels appellant gives his claims,to the extent the claims are based on these allegations,the primary right is the right to competent representation,in particular,competent representation in seeking appellant release from custody by arranging payment of appellant restitution obligation to his victims.
finally,for the claim under business and professions code section alone,appellant seeks disgorgement of funds paid to respondent by any source in consideration for representing appellant.the entitlement to such disgorgement is premised on respondent alleged deficiencies in representing appellant in the restitution and probation violation proceedings.
in short,all of appellant claims are based on legal malpractice that allegedly resulted in his being found in violation of probation,and he seeks compensation for the consequences of those violations damages for his incarceration and for his brother restitution payment as well as disgorgement of fees paid by any third party to respondent based on respondent allegedly deficient performance.
actual innocence 
having determined that all of appellant claims are premised on attorney malpractice,we now consider whether the actual innocence requirement applies to these claims.
as we have noted,in a criminal malpractice action actual innocence of the underlying criminal cha
