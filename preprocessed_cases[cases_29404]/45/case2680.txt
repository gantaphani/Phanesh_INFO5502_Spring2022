lexington national insurance corporation lexington appeals the trial court denial of its motion to exonerate a bail bond and entry of summary judgment against it on forfeiture of the bond lexington contends the statutory bail scheme imposes a mandatory duty on the trial court clerk to provide notice of a forfeiture and,when the clerk failed to send notice of an initial forfeiture declared when the bonded defendant missed an appearance,the trial court lost jurisdiction to declare a later forfeiture and enter summary judgment against lexington.see,subsequent statutory references are to this code unless noted otherwise.alternatively,lexington argues a bail agent it terminated had no authority to reassume the bond and therefore the trial court reinstatement of the bond after the initial forfeiture was invalid,and reinstatement was also invalid absent notice from the court clerk.we agree the court clerk failure to provide lexington notice of the initial forfeiture constitutes jurisdictional error,and we therefore reverse and remand for entry of judgment exonerating the bond.because lexington alternative arguments are moot,we do not address them.

discussion 
lexington contends the trial court erred in denying its motion to exonerate the bond and in entering the resulting summary judgment.the abuse of discretion standard applies to the trial court resolution of a motion to set aside a bail forfeiture people legion ins.th,d legion,subject to constraints imposed by the bail statutory scheme.w hen a statute requires a court to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular manner,to follow a particular procedure,or to act subject to certain limitations,an act beyond those limits is in excess of its jurisdiction.people ranger ins.th,d ranger.the law traditionally disfavors forfeitures and this disfavor extends to forfeiture of bail.citations.thus,penal code sections dealing with forfeiture of bail bonds must be strictly construed in favor of the surety to avoid the harsh results of a forfeiture.the standard of review,therefore,compels us to protect the surety,and more importantly the individual citizens who pledge to the surety their property on behalf of persons seeking release from custody,in order to obtain the corporate bond.county of los angeles surety ins.d.surety ins.
section states in relevant part if the amount of the bond exceeds four hundred dollars,the clerk of the court shall,within days of the forfeiture,mail notice of the forfeiture to the surety,subd.b,italics added.subdivision b further provides that t he surety shall be released of all obligations under the bond if any of the following conditions apply the clerk fails to mail the notice of forfeiture in accordance with this section within days after the entry of the forfeiture.the clerk fails to mail the notice of forfeiture to the surety at the address printed on the bond.the clerk fails to mail a copy of the notice of forfeiture to the bail agent at the address shown on the bond,italics added.
the statute has two related objectives to provide for a reasonably effective means of notice,and to create a reasonably reliable record of that notice.people american bankers ins.d.american bankers,overruled on another point in people national automobile casualty ins.th,d.the purpose of notice is to alert the surety when its bond is in danger of being forfeited,so it can choose to act one way or another.ranger,supra,th at,d.the statute places the burden of mailing notice of forfeiture on the only neutral party involved,the court itself.id.at,d.
section,along with section are said to be jurisdictional prescriptions.county of los angeles ranger ins.th,d ranger.section is jurisdictional in the sense it sets forth certain prerequisites before a court can order forfeiture of bail.people national automobile casualty ins.th,d.failure to follow the jurisdictional prescriptions in sections and renders a summary judgment on the bail bond void.ranger,supra,th at,d see also ranger,supra,th at,d mistake s can be raised at any time,including for the first time on appeal.
the surety and bail agent are entitled to separate notice under the statute every time a forfeiture is declared.people american contractors indemnity th,d american contractors.when the clerk of the court does not send the notice both to the surety and to the bail bondsman as required by the statute,the surety is exonerated from its obligations under the bond.ranger,supra,th at,d other cases,and the statute itself,make abundantly clear that notice must be sent both to the surety and to the bail agent see also county of los angeles resolute ins.d.summary judgment held void since surety bond had been released as a matter of law for lack of prescribed notice.
because the statute goal is effective notice ranger,supra,th at,d,when the surety receives actual notice despite a technical mistake by the court clerk,forfeiture of the bond will stand if neither the surety nor bondsman produces the defendant.ibid.notice of first forfeiture effective when former bail agent forwarded it to surety,but exoneration required because clerk,who knew surety new address,nevertheless sent notice of a second forfeiture to same former agent and it was not forwarded see also american bankers,supra,d at.no exoneration where clerk inadvertently placed notice in envelope addressed to a different bail bondsman,but that bondsman forwarded it to the proper agent.here,it is undisputed the court clerk failed to mail lexington notice of the march,forfeiture and that lexington never otherwise received actual notice.we therefore agree with lexington the trial court abused its discretion by failing to exonerate the bond.see,subd.b the surety shall be released of all obligations under the bond if any of the following conditions apply the clerk fails to mail the notice of forfeiture in accordance with this section within days after the entry of the forfeiture italics added.
resisting this conclusion,the county argues the purpose of a bail bond is simply to assure the defendant appearance and,when the court has vacated a forfeiture upon the defendant reappearance,the clerk failure to send notice is no reason for bai
