order certifying a question to the supreme court of oregon 
plaintiffs,who are former employees of defendant city of medford,argue that the city policy of denying health insurance coverage to retirees violates oregon revised statutes section,city resolution,and the due process clause of the united states constitution.plaintiffs contend that section and resolution confer on them a vested property interest in health care benefits after retirement,of which the city deprived them without due process of law.because the question whether the statute and resolution confer on plaintiffs a protected property interest raises an important and unresolved issue of oregon law that will dispose of the only remaining federal claim on appeal,we respectfully certify a question to the supreme court of oregon.we offer the following statement of relevant facts and explanation of the nature of the controversy in which the question arose.
background 
factual and procedural history 
in,the oregon state legislative assembly enacted oregon revised statutes section,which read,in pertinent part 
the governing body of any local government that contracts for or otherwise makes available health care insurance coverage for officers and employees of the local government,may,in so far as and to the extent possible,make that coverage available for retired officers and employees of the local government and for spouses and unmarried children under years of age of those retired officers and employees.the governing body may prescribe reasonable terms and conditions of eligibility and coverage,not inconsistent with this section,for making that coverage available.the local government may agree to pay none,part or all of the cost of making that coverage available.

in,the statute was amended.the most significant change was that the legislature replaced the discretionary word may with the mandatory word shall.the statute currently reads 
the governing body of any local government that contracts for or otherwise makes available health care insurance coverage for officers and employees of the local government shall,insofar as and to the extent possible,make that coverage available for any retired employee of the local government who elects within days after the effective date of retirement to participate in that coverage and,at the option of the retired employee,for the spouse of the retired employee and any unmarried children under years of age.the health care insurance coverage shall be made available for a retired employee until the retired employee becomes eligible for federal medicare coverage,for the spouse of a retired employee until the spouse becomes eligible for federal medicare coverage and for a child until the child arrives at majority,and may,but need not,be made available thereafter.the governing body may prescribe reasonable terms and conditions of eligibility and coverage,not inconsistent with this section,for making the health care insurance coverage available.the local government may pay none of the cost of making that coverage available or may agree,by collective bargaining agreement or otherwise,to pay part or all of that cost.
emphasis added.
in,the city adopted resolution,which set forth the city plan for complying with section.the resolution interprets section as requiring that continuation of health insurance be offered to employees who retire from city service.the resolution provides that a retired employee has days from the date of retirement in which to elect to continue his or her participation in the city health insurance program.the retiree also can elect to enroll his or her spouse and unmarried children under age in the program,if they were covered while the retiree was employed by the city.under the resolution,coverage continues until one of several events including the retiree attainment of medicare eligibility or termination of the retiree program by the city or its carrier occurs.
before,the city permitted all employees to elect to continue their health insurance coverage upon retirement.in,however,the city negotiated with its police officers union for a health insurance program that did not give officers the opportunity to continue coverage after retirement.in,the city placed all of its employees under that same health insurance program,which does not cover retirees.in,the city placed its employees in both its parks and recreation department and public works department in the same program.
the city contracts with the oregon teamsters employers trust to provide health insurance to its employees.the teamsters contract with the city states p articipants are not allowed to participate in the trust retiree plan or any insured or hmo option available through it.this provision means that retirees are excluded from coverage under the teamsters plan.the members of the teamsters are responsible for voting on the extent of coverage.according to the city,the teamsters were willing to provide health insurance benefits to retired employees,but only if the members of the teamsters voted for such coverage.to date,the members of the teamsters have not approved an extension of health insurance benefits to retirees.
although the city does not provide health insurance coverage after retirement,retirees can choose to remain covered for months after their retirement under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of.after that period expires,retired employees can enroll in the oregon public employees retirement system health insurance program,into which the city has paid so that its retired employees can obtain coverage.
plaintiffs are former city police officers or employees who have retired and who have been denied benefits under the teamsters plan in august,plaintiffs filed suit against the city and city manager michael dyal,alleging that defendants had violated resolution and oregon revised statutes section the due process clause the age discrimination in employment act of adea and the parallel oregon age discrimination statute.defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.
in its order granting summary judgment,the district court held that neither section nor resolution afforded plaintiffs a constitutionally protected property interest.because no oregon court had yet interpreted either the statute or the resolution,the court examined ninth circuit case law and reasoned that the statute text did not sufficiently limit the conditions under which the city would be required to extend health insurance coverage to retirees.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs remaining state law claims,dismissing them without prejudice and with leave to refile in state court.
following the district court grant of summary judgment,plaintiffs filed their state law claims in oregon state court.plaintiffs alleged four claims the city violated section,which plaintiffs argue provides a private right of action the city violated resolution,which plaintiffs also argue provides a private right of action the city violated oregon age discrimination law and the city breached an implied contract it had made with plaintiffs.the state trial court held in november that the claims of two of the four plaintiffs steinberg and deuel were barred on statute of limitations grounds,but that the claims of the other two plaintiffs doyle and miller could proceed the court held that section afforded plaintiffs a private right of action,but that resolution did not.
the court rejected the city argument that it was not required to allow its retired employees to continue the same coverage offered to current employees because providing such coverage is impossible under the city contract with the teamsters.the court held that defendants can not escape the requirements of section by conspicuously contracting with an insurance provider whose coverage does not include retirees.because defendants did not present the court with undisputed evidence that no entity providing health care insurance was and is willing to provide health care coverage for both current and retired employees of the city of medford,the court refused to s
