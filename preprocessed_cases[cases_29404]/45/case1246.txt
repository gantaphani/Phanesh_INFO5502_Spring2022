officer sent a claim to chase in april as the beneficiary of theresa life insurance policy.chase sent officer,representing the amount the officers had paid in premiums.officer filed suit in august in jasper county,indiana,to recover the face value of the million dollar policy.chase removed the case to the northern district of indiana.officer filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the suicide provision was ambiguous and constituted an unenforceable forfeiture.the district court denied officer motion,finding that as a matter of law the insurance policy was unambiguous,valid,and enforceable.the parties then stipulated that theresa death was a suicide and filed an agreed motion for entry of final judgment in chase favor,with officer reserving the right to appeal the denial of his summary judgment motion.the court entered final judgment on the uncontested facts in favor of chase on july,and officer now appeals.

insurance contract ambiguity 
when sitting in diversity,we must apply the substantive law of the state as we believe the highest court of that state would apply it when faced with the same issue.allstate ins.keca,cir.both parties agree that indiana law applies here.officer does not argue that indiana law prohibits the exclusion of suicide under life insurance policies indiana has long permitted exclusions of this type.see,nw.mut.life ins.hazelett,discussing a suicide exclusion and noting that i t is neither unlawful,nor against public policy,for a contract of life insurance to stipulate that upon certain conditions or contingencies the policy shall become void kunse knight of the modern maccabees,enforcing a suicide exclusion.instead,officer argues that the provision is ambiguous and should be construed in his favor.to determine whether officer is entitled to receive the face amount of the insurance policy,we refer to indiana law of contract interpretation.athletic sportswear,westfield ins,cir.an insurance contract is subject to the same rules of interpretation as other contracts under indiana law.morris econ.fire cas.if the language in the insurance policy is clear and unambiguous,then it should be given its plain and ordinary meaning,but if the language is ambiguous,the insurance contract should be strictly construed against the insurance company.id.indiana law is clear that an ambiguity does not arise merely because the two parties are able to create different interpretations of the policy language at issue.usa life one ins.of nuckolls.rather,the policy is ambiguous only if it is susceptible to more than one interpretation and reasonably intelligent persons would differ as to its meaning.id.internal quotation omitted.
chase suicide provision states 
we will limit the proceeds we pay under this policy if the insured commits suicide,while sane or insane 
within years from the date of issue and 
after years from the date of issue,but within years from the effective date of the last reinstatement of this policy.
the limited amount will equal all premiums paid on this policy.
although courts in indiana and other others states have frequently analyzed suicide clauses in insurance contracts,no court has construed the exact language at issue here.see,commonwealth life ins.jackson,construing a suicide clause that stated the amount payable shall be limited to the premium or premiums paid hereunder without interest cont l assurance krueger,construing a suicide clause that stated the liability of the company shall be limited to an amount equal to the premiums actually paid on this policy aetna life ins.doerr,construing a suicide clause that stated if the insured shall commit suicide within one year this policy shall be null and void.
officer argues that the exclusion is susceptible to two meanings.first,the amount payable could equal the face value minus the premiums paid,or.second,the amount payable could equal the amount of premiums paid,or.obviously,officer prefers the first interpretation and chase prefers the second.
the district court rejected officer interpretation of the suicide provision and concluded that it was unambiguous as written.the court noted that the plain and ordinary meaning of the words proceeds and amount are virtually interchangeable.officer chase ins.life annuity,d.although we can imagine improved ways to write this exclusion,we,too,conclude that the policy is not ambiguous as written.the first clause of the insurance provision sets out chase exclusion by stating we will limit the proceeds we pay.it then sets out the circumstances under which it will limit the proceeds.the final sentence states the limited amount will equal all premiums paid on this policy.none of these terms is defined,and so the limited amount most logically refers back to the first phrase.combining those two phrases,the policy meaning is clear the limited amount of proceeds we pay will equal all premiums paid on this policy.officer alternate interpretation we will limit the proceeds,and the amount by which they will be limited will equal the premiums paid is not a reasonable interpretation.if,as he suggests,the limited amount were equal to the face value minus the premiums paid,chase would be required to pay more money where an insured committed suicide one day after buying the policy than it would have to pay one day before the suicide exclusion expired.reasonably intelligent persons would not find that the provision was susceptible to officer interpretation.
officer also argues that another portion of the policy uses clearer language the proceeds payable on the death of the insured are equal to he asserts that because chase knew how to clearly write proceeds payable elsewhere,the term limited amount can reasonably mean something else in the suicide provision.it is appropriate to look at the insurance contract as a whole in determining ambiguity,and courts should attempt to harmonize provisions rather than placing them in conflict.dunn meridian mut.ins.these two provisions are not in conflict,though.chase could have used the same language in both provisions,but the fact that it used different language to express the amount of proceeds payable does not compel the conclusion that two otherwise unambiguous statements have become ambiguous.
disproportionate forfeiture 
officer argues that,if the exclusion is not ambiguous,then indiana courts would find that it was a disproportionate forfeiture or an illegal penalty.he asserts that there is no rational relationship between the harm chase suffered by the breach of the suicide clause and the loss he will suffer by being repaid only the premiums.
officer cites several cases in which liquidated damages clauses were included in the parties contracts.liquidated damages refers to a specific sum of money that has been expressly stipulated by the parties to a contract as the amount of damages to be recovered by one party for a breach of the agreement by the other,whether it exceeds or falls short of actual damages.time warner entm t whiteman.while liquidated damages claus
