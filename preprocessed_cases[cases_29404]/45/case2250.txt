tyco healthcare group lp and mallinckrodt,collectively,tyco appeal from a summary judgment invalidating the two claims of patent the patent for obviousness.we affirm.
temazepam is a hypnotic drug that is one of a class of compounds known as benzodiazepines.pharmacological formulations of temazepam have been marketed internationally for the treatment of insomnia since the,and in the united states since under the name restoril.tyco holds the rights to the patent,which has two claims for temazepam formulations.claim reads 
a hard gelatin capsule containing a temazepam formulation consisting essentially of to milligrams of crystalline temazepam having a surface area of from to and of the temazepam having a particle size of less than microns in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.
claim is identical except that it recites a composition containing milligrams of crystalline temazepam.the patent issued in may with a priority date of september.tyco began marketing restoril in mg dosages in.
in november,mutual pharmaceutical company,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration fda seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of mg temazepam capsules.tyco responded in march by filing an infringement action against mutual and united research laboratories,collectively,mutual.in july,after mutual had received tentative fda approval of its anda,tyco moved for a preliminarily injunction to prevent mutual from selling its generic temazepam capsule.the district court denied tyco motion based on uncontroverted evidence that mutual anda disclosed a product that could not literally infringe the patent because the anda required the surface area of the crystalline temazepam to be at least square meters per gram.see bayer ag elan pharm.research.
mutual then moved for summary judgment of noninfringement and invalidity.the district court granted mutual motion with respect to invalidity,concluding that mutual had shown by clear and convincing evidence that the claims were obvious and that no reasonable trier of fact could find to the contrary.in reaching that conclusion,the court noted,first,that restoril capsules had been sold in the united states in mg and mg dosages more than a year before the priority date of the patent.second,the court looked to a volume of the british national formulary bnf,a medical reference book published in the united kingdom,which directed physicians to the use of temazepam at a dosage between and mg for the treatment of insomnia in the elderly.third,the court observed that the parties did not dispute that physicians always seek to prescribe the lowest effective dose of any medication,particularly hypnotics such as temazepam.based on those undisputed facts,the court concluded that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the preexisting mg restoril capsule with the dosage range identified in the bnf reference.tyco appeals the district court order invalidating the claims.
the only physical feature distinguishing the claims from the restoril mg capsules is the amount of temazepam contained in the capsule.in,tyco filed a supplemental new drug application with the fda for manufacture and sale of mg temazepam capsules within the scope of both claims.the application stated that 
t he formulation and manufacture of restoril capsules,mg are similar to that used for the and milligram capsules the formulation differs only in the reduction of the dose the capsule manufacturing method is exactly the same as has been described for the currently marketed doses.
given that uncontested description,the only limitation of the two claims that was not fully disclosed by the prior art restoril capsules is the lower dosage of temazepam.
the bnf is a medical reference book published semiannually by the british medical association and the pharmaceutical society of great britain.the preface to the bnf explains that it serves as a pocket book for rapid reference for prescribing and dispensing drugs,and that its entries are intended to help in the choice of appropriate treatment of each patient.the bnf entry for temazepam reads as follows 
indications insomnia useful in the elderly 
cautions see under nitrazepam but except at high dosage hangover is uncommon and doses less cumulative.less appropriate in patients with early wakening 
dose mg elderly patients mg,increasing in severe insomnia to mg,minutes before bedtime 
bnf at emphasis added.the district court concluded that t his entry plainly tells one of skill in the art to treat insomnia in the elderly by administering a dose in the range of to mg.the court noted that a physician would be motivated to prescribe a temazepam dosage lower than mg because of the preference for the lowest effective dose,particularly in the case of elderly patients sensitive to the side effects of hypnotic medications.
ordinarily,where there is a range disclosed in the prior art,and the claimed invention falls within that range,there is a presumption of obviousness.iron grip barbell usa sports,accord lazare kaplan int l,photoscribe.that presumption is rebuttable either by a showing that the prior art taught away from the invention or by a showing of new and unexpected results relative to the prior art.iron grip barbell,at.tyco argues first that the bnf reference does not direct a person of ordinary skill in the art to temazepam hard capsules in the to mg dosage range.it then argues that the prior art as a whole taught away from a range of to mg.finally,tyco contends that secondary considerations of new and unexpected results and commercial success support a finding of.
tyco contests the district court interpretation of the bnf reference.it relies on the declaration of its expert,william orr,who stated that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not interpret the bnf reference as recommending any particular dose.the district court,however,concluded that orr had not offered a factual basis for his conclusion or explained his rationale and therefore discredited his characterization of the bnf.
in support of his interpretation of the bnf reference,orr stated that the bnf reference nowhere states that a temazepam dose of mg,to mg,or mg,is effective in treating insomnia,nor does it state that mg was effective.he added that the bnf reference provides n o clinical or statistical evidence demonstrating that a dose within a range of mg would work in treating insomnia.
those statements by orr correctly describe the contents of the bnf reference,but they do not undermine the district court conclusions as to obviousness.the claims do not discuss the intended use of the capsules in a particular treatment regimen.the manufacture of a mg temazepam capsule with the disclosed claim limitations would infringe both claims of the patent,irrespective of the efficacy of the product.orr statements did not contest the fact that the bnf refers to dosages of temazepam between and mg his statements are directed to the utility of temazepam as a treatment for insomnia.
tyco argues that all the properties of a composition of matter relevant to patentability must be considered in evaluating whether that composition would have been obvious in light of the prior art,and that the unclaimed property of effectiveness in treating insomnia renders the claims at issue nonobvious.that argument is unavailing.the discovery of a new property or use of a previously known composition,even when that property and use are unobvious from the prior art,can not impart patentability to the known composition.in re spada,noting that a new use of a known composition may be patentable as a process.the recommendation in the bnf of a range of temazepam dosages that include the dosages claimed in the patent renders obvious the claims to those dosages even in the absence of documentation in the bnf of the effectiveness of such dosages.
orr noted that the bnf reference listed several brands of commercially available temazepam formulations,which had dosages of mg and mg,but not mg.that observation,however,does not call into doubt what the bnf reference disclosed.tyco does
