may a commercial general liability cgl insurer obtain reimbursement of its expenses of defending its insured against a third party lawsuit,when it is ultimately determined,as a matter of law,that the policy never afforded any potential for coverage,and that a duty to defend thus never arose where,as here,the insurer properly reserved its right to such reimbursement,we conclude that the answer is yes.
defendant mv transportation mv was sued by a third party third party action.plaintiff scottsdale insurance company scottsdale advanced the costs of defending mv,its insured,in the third party action,but did so under a reservation of its right,if any,to recoup such costs.while the third party action was pending,scottsdale sued mv the insurance action,seeking a declaration,inter alia,that because its policies afforded no potential coverage of the third party action,it owed no defense,and was therefore entitled to reimbursement of its defense costs.
the third party action ended in settlement.thereafter,in the insurance action,the superior court found a potential for coverage,but the court of appeal ultimately disagreed.for reasons of law,the court of appeal held that the allegations in the third party complaint never triggered any possibility of coverage under scottsdale policies.nonetheless,the court of appeal concluded that scottsdale was not entitled to reimbursement.the court of appeal reasoned,in essence,that its determination extinguished scottsdale defense duty only from that time forward.hence,the court of appeal determined,scottsdale could not retroactively recover defense costs expended before its duty was extinguished.
we disagree.by ruling,as a matter of law,that the third party action never presented any possibility of coverage by scottsdale policies,the court of appeal established not that the duty to defend was thereupon prospectively extinguished,but that it never arose.therefore,scottsdale may recover amounts it expended in defending the insured under its reservation of rights.to the extent the court of appeal held otherwise,its judgment must be reversed.
defendants in this action by scottsdale are scottsdale insured,mv,and several of mv employees.the underlying lawsuit,for which scottsdale seeks reimbursement of defense costs,was filed by mv competitor in the transportation industry,laidlaw transit services,laidlaw.the parties do not dispute the pertinent facts as stated by the court of appeal.we therefore adopt the court of appeal statement,as follows with bracketed insertions by this court and deletions indicated by ellipses 
the underlying lawsuit by laidlaw 
in january of,laidlaw filed an action against mv and several of mv employees who had previously worked for laidlaw,including mv new president and chief operating officer jon monson.laidlaw complaint alleged causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,tortious inducement to breach the duty of loyalty and fiduciary duty,intentional interference with contractual relations and with prospective business advantage,misappropriation of trade secrets,and unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business practices.
in essence,laidlaw suit alleged certain contractual breaches,unlawful business practices,and misappropriation of trade secrets by using laidlaw confidential,proprietary information to compete unfairly in bidding for and obtaining new busing contracts in urban public transportation services markets.the complaint specified two markets in particular,lawrence,kansas,and indianapolis,indiana,and noted other unspecified cities as well.the confidential,proprietary information included bidding models,bidding formulas,and other nonpublic information used in developing laidlaw bids,such as laidlaw overhead costs and financial objectives allocated to each project.as alleged in the complaint,mv used such information,as well as laidlaw customer list and other trade secrets,to significantly impede laidlaw ability to market itself as a unique provider of its services.
soon after laidlaw filed its complaint,mv legal counsel tendered the defense to its insurer,scottsdale.scottsdale asserted that although one ninth circuit case had concluded that certain trade secret misappropriation claims fall within the scope of the advertising injury liability coverage of a general liability policy,the underlying facts in that case were distinguishable,and scottsdale defense obligations were not triggered by the laidlaw suit.nonetheless,scottsdale agreed to provide a defense to mv and the individuals named in the laidlaw suit under a reservation of certain rights,including the right to seek a declaration of its rights and duties under the policy and t he right to seek reimbursement of defense fees paid toward defending causes of action which raise no potential for coverage,as authorized by the california supreme court in buss superior court transamerica ins.cal th d.
in december of,laidlaw and mv agreed to settle the suit by laidlaw.pursuant to the settlement agreement,mv and the individual defendants agreed to return to laidlaw documents containing allegedly misappropriated bid models,bid formulas and other trade secrets,and to refrain from using such material in developing mv bids or proposals to customers in the public transportation market.however,the settlement agreement did not require that mv pay any money to laidlaw.attorney fees and costs incurred by scottsdale in defending the laidlaw suit were approximately.
the coverage dispute between scottsdale and mv 
scottsdale issued two cgl policies to mv,one effective from december,to december,hereinafter,the first cgl policy,and the other from december,to december,hereinafter,the second cgl policy.the first cgl policy included scottsdale agreement to defend mv against any suit and to pay any damages due to advertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising mv goods,products or services.the policy defined the term advertising injury as including the m isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.
the second cgl policy also obligated scottsdale to pay mv damages and costs of suit for any advertising injury.the policy language,however,was somewhat different from that in the first cgl policy.specifically,the second cgl policy defined advertising injury as,in pertinent part,t he use of another advertising idea in the insured advertisement.and the policy defined advertisement as a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about the insured goods,products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.
during the course of the underlying laidlaw litigation,in june of,scottsdale filed the present declaratory relief action against mv and other defendants named in the laidlaw action.after settlement of the underlying action,scottsdale moved for summary judgment seeking a determination that it owed no legal defense obligations,and seeking reimbursement of the full amount paid for defense costs and fees and a declaration that it owed no further costs and fees.the trial court denied scottsdale motion for summary judgment and ruled that it had a duty to defend.the court observed that laidlaw alleged a broader audience than simply the two cities noted in the complaint where mv sought business,lawrence,kansas,and indianapolis,indiana,and concluded that b roadly construed,the c omplaint alleged misappropriation of laidlaw advertising ideas,for which there is at the very least the potential of coverage,and therefore scottsdale duty to defend is established as a matter of law.
recognizing that the trial court ruling on the motion for summary judgment disposed of the entire case,the parties stipulated to a final judgment against scottsdale.in april,the superior court entered a stipulated judgment.
scottsdale appealed,urging that advertising,as used in standard cgl policies covering advertising injury,was limited to widespread promotional activities directed to the public at large.bank of the west superior court cal th,fn,d,bank of the west.hence,scottsdale argued,advertising did not include solicitation of individual customers through a competitive bidding process for services.in a opinion,the court of appeal disagreed.it concluded that advertising could include mv business solicitations that used a common style and promotional information disseminated to more than one customer.the court of appeal thus found a potential for coverage giving rise to scottsdale duty to defend.it affirmed the judgment against scottsdale.
we granted scottsdale petition for review and held the case for hameid national fire ins.of hartford cal th,d,hameid,then pending.in hameid we adopted the language of bank of the west,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,quoted above,and interpreted advertising,as used in a standard cgl policy covering liability for advertising injury,to mean widespread promotional activities usually directed to the public at large.hameid,supra,cal th,d.we held that use of a competing hair salon customer list to identify the competitor clients,and to solicit them through mailers and telephone calls,did not constitute advertising under such a policy.accordingly,we concluded that the insurer had no duty under its advertising injury clause to defend the competitor suit seeking damages for harm caused by such activities.we noted we had no occasion to decide whether widespread promotional activities directed at specific market segments constitute advertising under the standard cgl policy,at,fn,d,italics added.
we transferred this case to the court of appeal for reconsideration in light of hameid.upon reconsideration,the court of appeal concluded,contrary to its prior determination,that neither cgl policy issued by scottsdale to mv afforded potential advertising injury coverage for mv improper use of laidlaw trade secrets to prepare tailored competitive bids for specific urban transportation contracts,as alleged in the laidlaw complaint.
as to the first cgl policy,which used advertising injury language substantially identical to that construed in hameid,supra,cal th,d,the court of appeal directly applied hameid to conclude that the policy did not cover solicitations of individual customers.as to the second cgl policy,which defined advertising as a notice broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about the insured goods,products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters italics added,the court of appeal reasoned that the laidlaw complaint did not allege information was broadcast or published as the policy required.
though it concluded that neither scottsdale policy ever afforded potential coverage of the laidlaw suit,and that mv should not have tendered to scottsdale its defense in the laidlaw action italics added,the court of appeal nonetheless ruled that scottsdale could not recover fees and costs previously advanced toward mv defense.the court of appeal reasoned that scottsdale defense duty arose and continued until extinguished by a judicial determination that no potential for coverage existed.in the court of appeal view,scottsdale reimbursement claim was an unavailing attempt to terminate its defense duty retroactively.
to limit its defense obligation,the court of appeal asserted,scottsdale could have denied mv a defense,thus risking a bad faith suit by mv,or obtained a prompt declaration of its rights and duties while the laidlaw action was still pending.having failed to do either,the court of appeal held,scottsdale could not recover defense costs already advanced.
we granted scottsdale petition for review.we now agree with scottsdale that the court of appeal erred in its analysis of the reimbursement issue.the court of appeal ruled,as a matter of law,that scottsdale never had a duty to defend mv in the laidlaw action.accordingly,scottsdale is entitled to reimbursement of the costs and expenses it advanced,under a reservation of rights,toward the defense of that action on behalf of mv.to the extent the court of appeal denied such reimbursement,we will therefore reverse its judgment 
discussion 
general principles.
we summarize familiar principles pertaining to an insurer duty of defense.an insurer must defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity under the policy.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose gray zurich insurance cal d,gray.the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,and it may apply even in an action where no damages are ultimately awarded.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d.
determination of the duty to defend depends,in the first instance,on a comparison between the allegations of the complaint and the terms of the policy.montrose,supra,cal th,d.but the duty also exists where extrinsic facts known to the insurer suggest that the claim may be covered.ibid.moreover,that the precise causes of action pled by the complaint may fall outside policy coverage does not excuse the duty to defend where,under the facts alleged,reasonably inferable,or otherwise known,the complaint could fairly be amended to state a covered liability.gray,supra,cal d,cna casualty of california seaboard surety d.
the defense duty arises upon tender of a potentially covered claim and lasts until the underlying lawsuit is concluded,or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage.montrose,supra,cal th,d.when the duty,having arisen,is extinguished by a showing that no claim can in fact be covered,it is extinguished only prospectively and not retroactively.buss superior court cal th,d,buss see also transport indemnity cal th,d.
on the other hand,in an action wherein none of the claims is even potentially covered because it does not even possibly embrace any triggering harm of the specified sort within the policy period caused by an included occurrence,the insurer does not have a duty to defend.citation.this freedom is implied in the policy language.it rests on the fact that the insurer has not been paid premiums by the insured for such a defense t he duty to defend is contractual.the insurer has not contracted to pay defense costs for claims that are not even potentially covered.citation,supra,cal th,d,quoting buss,supra,cal th,d.
from these premises,the following may be stated if any facts stated or fairly inferable in the complaint,or otherwise known or discovered by the insurer,suggest a claim potentially covered by the policy,the insurer duty to defend arises and is not extinguished until the insurer negates all facts suggesting potential coverage.on the other hand,if,as a matter of law,neither the complaint nor the known extrinsic facts indicate any basis for potential coverage,the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance.
scottsdale right to reimbursement.
scottsdale advanced fees and costs to defend mv against the laidlaw suit,but did so under a reservation of rights.by a letter dated march,counsel for scottsdale informed mv general counsel that,although scottsdale did not believe laidlaw claims fell within the scope of its policies advertising injury provisions,scottsdale would provide a defense subject to various reservations of rights.these included t he right to seek a declaration of scottsdale rights and duties under its p olicies regarding its defense indemnity obligations,and t he right to seek reimbursement of defense fees paid toward defending causes of action which raise no potential for coverage,as authorized in buss,supra,cal th,d,scottsdale thus served notice that it might seek to recover defense fees and costs already expended if it were later determined that scottsdale had owed mv no defense.
as we explained in buss,supra,cal th,d,the insurer may unilaterally condition its proffer of a defense upon its reservation of a right later to seek reimbursement of costs advanced to defend claims that are not,and never were,potentially covered by the relevant policy.such an announcement by the insurer permits the insured to decide whether to accept the insurer terms for providing a defense,or instead to assume and control its own defense,at,fn,d.
despite its conclusion that the scottsdale policies never afforded any potential coverage of the laidlaw claims,and despite scottsdale explicit reservation of its reimbursement rights,the court of appeal held that scottsdale may not recover the costs it advanced to defend mv in the laidlaw action.the court of appeal based this ruling on the premise that a judicial no duty determination extinguishes the duty to defend only prospectively and not retroactively.buss,supra,cal th,d,see,supra,cal th,d.thus,the court of appeal reasoned,if the insurer wishes to limit its liability for defense costs,it either must adopt the risky strategy of refusing a defense outright,thus exposing itself to a bad faith suit by the insured,or must seek,during the pendency of the third party action,to terminate its defense duty from that time forward by proving no potential for coverage.
mv and its amicus curiae advance the same premise here they urge as follows in a cgl policy,the insured purchases a guarantee that the insurer will absorb all costs of defending the insured against a third party action that includes one or more potentially covered claims,and that it will continue to do so until the third party action is concluded or the insurer can establish that no claim is even potentially covered.under this bargain,the insurer bears the entire risk of its incorrect decision to provide or withhold a defense.thus,if the insurer wrongly concludes that no duty to defend has arisen,and therefore declines the insured tender of defense,the insured may recover its damages in contract and tort.on the other hand,if the insurer seeks to avoid that pitfall by assuming the costs of the insured defense,those costs can not be shifted back to the insured,even if the insurer reserved its rights and a court later determines,as a matter of law,that there was never any potential coverage.
we disagree with this analysis.we are persuaded that an insurer,having reserved its right to do so,may obtain reimbursement of defense costs which,in hindsight,it never owed.
buss,supra,cal th,d,succinctly explained the scope of the contractual right to a defense that the insured purchases with its premiums.t he insurer duty to defend runs to claims that are potentially covered,in light of facts alleged or otherwise disclosed.citations,at,d,italics added.this duty,having arisen,is discharged when the action is concluded.citation.it may be extinguished earlier,if it is shown that no claim can in fact be covered.citation.if it is so extinguished,however,it is extinguished only prospectively and not retroactively before,the insurer had a duty to defend after,it does not have a duty to defend further.citations,italics added.
thus,the insurer duty to defend arises whenever the third party complaint the available extrinsic facts suggest,under applicable law,the possibility of covered claims.in such circumstances,if the insured tenders defense of the third party action,the insurer must assume it.the duty to defend then continues until the third party litigation ends,unless the insurer sooner proves,by facts subsequently developed,that the potential for coverage which previously appeared can not possibly materialize,or no longer exists.the insurer must absorb all costs it expended on behalf of its insured while the duty to defend was in,before the insurer established that the duty had ended.montrose,supra,cal th,d,see also,haskel,superior court th,d haskel hartford accident indemnity superior court th,d.
however,we have made clear that where the suit never presented any potential for policy coverage,the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance,and the insurer may properly deny a defense.moreover,the law governing the insurer duty to defend need not be settled at the time the insurer makes its decision.as several courts have explained,subsequent case law can establish,in hindsight,that no duty to defend ever existed.if the terms of the policy provide no potential for coverage,the insurer acts properly in denying a defense even if that duty is later evaluated under case law that did not exist at the time of the defense tender.citations.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,italics added see also hameid,supra,cal th,d,mclaughlin national union fire ins.th,d duty to defend did not arise in first instance where only potential for liability turned on legal question later resolved in insured favor state farm mut.auto.ins.longden d.same.
these principles are equally true where,as here,the insurer does not deny a defense at the outset,but instead elects to provide one under a reservation of its right to reimbursement.by law applied in hindsight,courts can determine that no potential for coverage,and thus no duty to defend,ever existed.if that conclusion is reached,the insurer,having reserved its right,may recover from its insured the costs it expended to provide a defense which,under its contract of insurance,it was never obliged to furnish.
in buss,supra,cal th,d,we confirmed an insurer entitlement,under a reservation of rights,to recoup its costs of defending against third party claims that are not potentially covered.buss addressed an insurer rights and obligations with respect to a mixed third party action,in which potential coverage appears as to some claims,but not as to others.in such circumstances,buss noted,the insurer must defend the entire mixed action,at,d.this is so,buss explained,because the contractual duty to defend the potentially covered claims immediately and meaningfully implies the prophylactic duty to defend entirely,without pausing to parse among potentially covered and clearly uncovered claims,at,d.nonetheless,we held that the insurer,having reserved its rights,may recover its costs of defense attributable to the claims for which there was no potential coverage,at,d.
the court of appeal,echoed here by mv and its amicus curiae,reasoned that buss reimbursement analysis applies only to mixed actions,where the insurer must defend even clearly uncovered claims and has no option to deny a defense at the outset,or to minimize its liability by seeking a prompt judicial declaration that it has no duty to defend.we are not persuaded.though buss itself involved a mixed action,buss analysis of the reimbursement issue applies equally where the insurer,acting under a reservation of rights,defended an action in which,as it turns out,no claim was ever potentially covered.
as buss explained,the duty to defend,and the extent of that duty,are rooted in basic contract principles.the insured pays for,and can reasonably expect,a defense against third party claims that are potentially covered by its policy,but no more.conversely,the insurer does not bargain to assume the cost of defense of claims that are not even potentially covered.to shift these costs to the insured does not upset the contractual arrangement between the parties.thus,where the insurer,acting under a reservation of rights,has prophylactically financed the defense of claims as to which it owed no duty of defense,it is entitled to restitution.otherwise,the insured,who did not bargain for a defense of noncovered claims,would receive a windfall and would be unjustly enriched.buss,supra,cal th,d.
buss itself made clear that this analysis does not apply only when the insurer was forced,in a mixed action,to defend noncovered claims along with those that were potentially covered.on the contrary,buss indicated it was simply extending law to mixed actions.
thus,buss declared as to claims that are not even potentially covered,the insurer may seek reimbursement for defense costs.apparently,all the decisional law considering such claims in and of themselves so assumes.see,hogan midland national ins.cal d,american motorists ins.food services,th,d reliance ins.alan d.insurance of the west haralambos beverage d.travelers ins.lesher d.western employers ins.arciero sons,d.walbrook ins.goshgarian goshgarian,applying california law omaha indem.ins.cardon oil,affd.cir,wl same accord,ins.north america insulations cir,applying illinois and new jersey law,but speaking generally.so it has been held california law clearly allows insurers to be reimbursed for attorney fees and other expenses paid in defending insureds against claims for which there was no obligation to defend.omaha indem.ins.cardon oil,supra.at.buss,supra,cal th,d,italics added accord,truck ins.exchange superior court th,d if insur
