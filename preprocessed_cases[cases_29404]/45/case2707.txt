in the published portion of this opinion,we discuss whether plaintiff may recover for negligent handling of her claim despite the fact there is no coverage under the terms of her policy.as will be noted,we conclude plaintiff may not recover for the negligent handling of her claim because there is no coverage under the terms of the policy.further,none of the circumstances which allow for a contract claim to be pursued as a tort cause of action are present.hence,we reverse plaintiff judgment against state farm for negligent investigation.we affirm the judgment in all other respects.
