on june,plaintiffs lee and nina bullard the bullards were injured in a collision.the driver of the pickup truck that struck their car was uninsured.the trial court denied the bullards petition to compel defendant california state automobile association csaa to arbitrate the claim under the bullards uninsured motorist policy,concluding,among other things,that the petition was untimely under the provisions of insurance code section applicable at the time 
on appeal,the bullards argue they are entitled to reversal because the amendment to section,subdivision i,effective january,applies retroactively the amendment to code of civil procedure section extended the limitations period in former section,subdivision i from one year to two years by implication the court erred in finding there was no factual basis for estoppel and the trial court abused its discretion under code of civil procedure section in permitting csaa to file its opposition to the bullards petition to compel arbitration after the statutory deadline.we shall affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
the bullards were injured on june,when a pickup truck driven by michael hall hall struck their lincoln sedan from behind.the bullards were insured under an automobile liability policy issued by csaa which included uninsured motorist coverage.
the relevant provision of the bullards insurance policy appears under the heading arbitration 
if an insured person makes a claim under this part and we do not agree that such person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury to such insured person,or,if so entitled,do not agree as to the amount,then either party,on written demand of the other,shall institute arbitration proceedings as provided in section and the following sections of the insurance code of the state of california 
after discovering that hall was uninsured,the bullards notified csaa by letter dated february,that they intended to pursue an uninsured motorist claim.the letter did not mention arbitration.csaa assigned the claim to sue lowry.
lowry contacted the office of the bullards attorneys several times between april and june.on april,lowry spoke with paralegal michaela fossum.in part of that conversation,lowry informed fossum that the statute of limitations did not apply.in response,fossum indicated that the law office had already submitted an arbitration demand.fossum stated in her declaration that lowry remained silent and ended the telephone conversation.
lowry had a different recollection of this conversation.she did not dispute that the conversation took place,but did not recall that fossum told her the law office had already sent a written demand for arbitration.had the bullards made such a demand,lowry would have forwarded the file to the litigation department in accordance with csaa policy.
in june,lowry received a demand for settlement from the bullards and spoke with fossum.on june,lowry contacted the bullards attorney,arthur morgan,in connection with their settlement demand.she asked him if the bullards had filed suit against hall.morgan indicated that no lawsuit had been filed.he told lowry he believed that the statute of limitations was two years from the date of the accident.lowry responded that the statute of limitations was one year for first party claims.morgan stated that the bullards had demanded arbitration by letter in february.
lowry reviewed the letter dated february,and found no demand for arbitration.she contacted morgan and informed him that the letter was insufficient to preserve the bullards right to arbitration under the policy.
on june,one year and three days after the collision the bullards filed their personal injury action against hall,the driver of the pickup,and john luntey,its owner.
on september,csaa denied the bullards uninsured motorist claim on the ground that the bullards had failed to preserve their right to arbitrate the first party claim under the automobile liability insurance policy and section.the bullards responded that the governor had just signed legislation extending the statute of limitations for uninsured motorist claims to two years,effective january.csaa maintained that the change in law was not retroactive.
the bullards filed their petition to compel arbitration on march.the trial court granted csaa motion for relief under code of civil procedure section to file their opposition to the petition to compel arbitration,after the filing deadline had passed.following oral argument on april,which was not reported,the trial court denied the bullards petition.the court found that the amendment to section was not retroactive the february correspondence was insufficient to lead a reasonable person to conclude that arbitration was being demanded the bullards therefore failed to comply with the terms of section,subdivision c section did not alter the requirement that the bullards preserve their rights under the provisions of section and there was no factual basis for estoppel.we shall affirm the order.
discussion 
ithe amendment to section is not retroactive 
the bullards argue that the trial court misread the legislature intent when it ruled that the amendment to section,subdivision i,that changed the limitations period from one to two years,was not retroactive.
