coregis insurance company coregis appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut peter dorsey,senior judge granting summary judgment to plaintiffs and denying summary judgment to defendants on the sole disputed issue of coregis right to disclaim coverage under plaintiffs organization liability insurance policy the policy pursuant to the policy insolvency exclusion.plaintiffs,and,are companies that operate,manage and administer nursing homes in connecticut the companies.the companies and certain of their directors,officers,and affiliates brought this action seeking to have coregis defend and indemnify them in connection with two lawsuits charging that plaintiffs failed to repay certain loans allegedly obtained through fraudulent misrepresentations about the financial health of the companies the lawsuits.because we find that a claim for coverage for the lawsuits is a claim a rising out of,based upon or related to the insolvency or financial impairment of the companies within the meaning of the policy exclusion at issue,we reverse the district court order and judgment and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of coregis.
background 
a.the lawsuits 
the lawsuits both allege that,in january,the companies received the proceeds of health care facilities revenue bonds issued by the connecticut development authority pursuant to certain loan agreements in,the companies applied to the state of connecticut health and educational facilities authority chefa to refinance these loans.chefa refinanced the loans by,among other things,issuing new bonds the chefa loan.the lawsuits claim that the companies applications to refinance the loans contained certain financial misrepresentations,discussed more fully below,upon which chefa relied to its detriment in making the chefa loan.
in or before,the companies are alleged to have begun experiencing severe financial problems,resulting in a cash flow that was insufficient to service the debt on the chefa loan.on or about may,upon the motion of the state of connecticut commissioner of public health,the connecticut superior court ordered the appointment of a receiver for pursuant to a connecticut statute providing for such appointment where a nursing home has sustained a serious financial loss or failure which jeopardizes the health,safety and welfare of the patients or there is a reasonable likelihood of such loss or failure.the court subsequently appointed that receiver and on july,issued a similar order appointing the same individual as receiver for.
the lawsuits were filed on december,alleging that plaintiffs supplied false information in the companies chefa loan applications and falsely warranted in associated documents that such information was accurate.one lawsuit was brought by chefa the chefa action against all plaintiffs and the other by the receiver appointed for the companies,cortright phillips,against all plaintiffs except the companies the receiver action.
the complaints in both actions allege that,in connection with the companies chefa loan application,the companies hired a certified public accounting firm to compile forecasted financial statements for the five years ending december,through december,for the and nursing homes and to issue a forecast report.the accounting firm prepared this forecast report allegedly relying on representation letters from the companies and their officers that purported to demonstrate the companies ability to meet operating expenses and to service the debt owed to chefa the representation letters.the representation letters provided data on i rental income ii operating expenses iii occupancy rates and sic iv patient income and v patient mix and a projection of taxable income,cash flow from operations,and other information.
the lawsuits charge that plaintiffs knew or should have known that the information provided by them to the accounting firm and to chefa with regard to the projected operating results of the companies nursing homes lacked any reasonable factual basis.the complaints further allege that at the december,closing for the chefa loan transaction,plaintiffs provided chefa with unaudited financial results for the nursing homes that showed million more in revenue than the audited results released seven months later.the scope of the companies financial problems was allegedly revealed in full,however,when the companies nursing homes subsequently suffered virtual financial failure and never performed in accordance with the representations provided by the defendants to chefa.
based on the above,the chefa action asserts claims of negligence against all plaintiffs,breach of contract against the companies for violating the warranties of accuracy in the loan agreements they signed in,and deceptive business acts and practices against all plaintiffs.in the receiver action,the receiver,standing in the shoes of the companies,alleges negligence,breach of duty of care,and unfair or deceptive business acts against the companies officers,directors,and affiliates,claiming that b ut for the misrepresentations,the companies would not have committed themselves to the debt restructure which was executed on december,but would have instead pursued alternative means of restructure which means would not have led the companies to sustain the current financial loss or failure.
b.the policy and the insolvency exclusion 
coregis issued the policy effective january,insuring all plaintiffs.after the lawsuits were filed,plaintiffs claim that they forwarded copies of the complaints to coregis requesting that coregis defend and indemnify them.by letter dated december,coregis law firm rejected their request,stating that t he chefa action and the receiver action are barred from coverage by the insolvency exclusion additionally,the insolvency exclusion precludes coverage for any claim made by or on behalf of any federal,state or local governmental agency or office.
the policy insolvency exclusion the provision states 
insolvency exclusion 
in consideration of the premium charged,it is further understood and agreed that the insurer shall not incur any obligation under the terms and conditions of this policy for,or on account of,any claim 
arising out of,based upon or related to 
a.the insolvency of the company named in the declarations 
b.a financial impairment of the company named in the declarations or 
any action,ruling or intervention of any federal,state or local governmental agency or office 
made by,or on behalf of,any federal,state or local governmental agency or office.
the policy does not define the terms arising out of,based upon,or related to.
c.the district court ruling 
plaintiffs filed this action against coregis on june,seeking a declaratory judgment of coverage.subsequently,both sides moved for summary judgment on what they agreed was the sole dispositive interpretation of the provision.coregis claimed,inter alia,that the lawsuits would not have been brought but for the insolvency of the companies,and that consequently the lawsuits arise out of,are based upon,or are related to the insolvency financial impairment of the companies within the meaning of clauses a or b of the provision plaintiffs contended that,because the claims against them were based on alleged misrepresentations made prior to the occurrence of the companies financial failure,such claims could have been brought whether or not the companies became insolvent and thus did not come within the scope of the provision.
by order entered on september,the district court agreed with the plaintiffs,granted their motion,and denied defendant motion.the court held that the provision did not exclude coverage for the lawsuits,whether interpreted under connecticut or ohio law because 
the clause concerns claims arising directly from,or based on pending actions premised upon,plaintiffs insolvency.the claims alleged against plaintiffs were viable whether or not plaintiffs encountered financial difficulties.though and receiverships prompted the complaints,the claims alleged are not claims for insolvency such as the failure to pay an outstanding debt because of bankruptcy,nor do they arise from insolvency nor are they the result of state action.
although plaintiffs financial condition may have triggered the making of the claims and the lawsuits arguably to be defended,the suits arise not from the plaintiffs insolvency nor the commissioner actions,but from plaintiffs conduct which gave rise to the financial plight and their misrepresentations related thereto.

discussion 
standard of review and applicable law 
we review a district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.see henry nancy horton bartels trust united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
because we agree with the district court that connecticut and ohio law do not differ in any respect relevant to this case,we similarly find no need to resolve the potential choice of law issue regarding the law applicable to the interpretation of the policy.under the law of both states,if the language of an insurance policy is not otherwise defined by the policy,but is clear on its face,the court must give effect to the reasonable and natural interpretation of such language.see hammer lumberman mut.cas,holding that,in interpreting an exclusion from coverage,i f the words in the policy are plain and unambiguous the established rules for the construction of contracts apply,the language,from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced,must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning internal quotation marks omitted watkins brown,ohio app d,ohio contract terms are to be given their natural and usual meaning if they are not defined in the policy i f an exclusionary clause has only one reasonable interpretation,a court is bound to enforce the provision accordingly.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.any ambiguities in an insurance contract are construed against the insurer.see heyman assocs.insurance,w hen the words of an insurance contract are,without violence,susceptible of two equally responsible interpretations,that which will sustain the claim and cover the loss must,in preference,be adopted.t his rule of construction favorable to the insured extends to exclusion clauses.internal quotation marks and citations omitted second and third alterations in original watkins,ohio app d at,at w here policy language is ambiguous,that language is to be construed in the way that is most favorable to the insured.this general principle applies with even greater force to language that purports to limit or to qualify coverage.internal citations omitted.finally,the law of both states provides that an insurer duty to defend is measured solely by whether the complaints against the insured allege facts that,if proven true,would present a claim within the scope of the policy coverage see springdale donuts,aetna cas.and sur,i t is well settled that an insurer duty to defend,being much broader in scope and application than its duty to indemnify,is determined by reference to the allegations contained in the underlying complaint.internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original cincinnati indem.martin,ohio,ohio a liability insurer obligation to its insured arises only if the claim falls within the scope of coverage.the insurer need not provide a defense if there is no set of facts alleged in the complaint which,if proven true,would invoke coverage.
interpretation of the provision 
as set forth in the district court ruling,coregis argued below that although the charges in the lawsuits sound in contract and tort,they substantively relate to insolvency,as they would not have been brought under any other circumstances,and further argued that the fraudulent behavior at issue assured the companies financial failure.although the district court agreed that a s alleged,plaintiffs behavior caused the financial failure which resulted in the appointment of a receiver,it nevertheless held that both the chefa action and the receiver action were not excluded from coverage under the policy.the court concluded that while and receiverships prompted the complaints,the claims alleged are not claims for insolvency such as the failure to pay an outstanding debt because of bankruptcy,nor do they arise from insolvency,and that a lthough plaintiffs financial condition may have triggered the making of the claims and the lawsuits arguably to be defended,the suits arise not from the plaintiffs insolvency nor the commissioner actions,but from plaintiffs conduct which gave rise to the financial plight and their misrepresentations related thereto.emphasis added.
the district court holding that the lawsuits did not arise from insolvency,even if correct,does not fully dispose of the coverage issue,however,because the provision excludes not only claims arising out of the insolvency or financial impairment of the companies,but also claims related to such a situation.both connecticut and ohio law instruct us not to interpret words or provisions in an insurance policy as mere surplusage if,under a reasonable interpretation of such words,they may be given independent meaning.see larson lawlor ins.agency,every provision of a contract of insurance is to be given effect,if possible,and no word or clause eliminated as meaningless,or disregarded as inoperative,if any reasonable meaning consistent with the other parts of the policy can be given to it.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original affiliated fm ins.fiberglas,cir under ohio substantive law,the courts construe insurance contracts in accordance with the same rules as other written contracts in construing a contract,a court must give meaning to every paragraph,clause,phrase and word,omitting nothing as meaningless,or surplusage.internal citations omitted.here,the ordinary meaning of the term related to as used in the provision is broader than the term arising out of,and,giving effect to this independent meaning of related to,the provision excludes coverage for the lawsuits.
to arise out of means to originate from a specified source.webster third new international dictionary see also black law dictionary ed defining arise as.to originate to stem from.to result from.the phrase arising out of is usually interpreted as indicat ing a causal connection.american states ins.guillermin,ohio app d,ohio see also holy trinity church aetna cas.sur,finding that the phrase arising out of in an insurance policy exclusion signifies that a causal relationship between the injury and the excluded activity,as defined therein,removes the injury from the ambit of the policy coverage.
the term related to is typically defined more broadly and is not necessarily tied to the concept of a causal connection.webster dictionary defines related simply as connected by reason of an established or discoverable relation.webster third new international dictionary,supra,at.the word relation,in turn,as used esp ecially in the phrase in relation to,is defined as a connection to or a reference to.id.at.courts have similarly described the term relating to as equivalent to the phrases in connection with and associated with,see jackson lajaunie,so d,and synonymous with the phrases with respect to,and with reference to,see phoenix leasing,sure,aff,cir,and have held such phrases to be broader in scope than the term arising out of.see jackson,so d at in connection with is a broader term than arising out of the use of the premises for the purposes of a service station this injury was linked to the station,associated with the station,related to the station,and,in the absence of a new and restrictive definition of an old and well understood word,connected with the station.internal citations and footnote omitted cameron mut.ins.skidmore,it appears to us that in connection with any premises has a broader meaning than arising out of any premises.
we find that,regardless of whether coverage for the lawsuits would constitute a claim arising out of the companies insolvency or financial impairment,the ordinary meaning of the broad term related to as used in the provision is clear and unambiguous in its application to exclude such coverage thus,the rules of interpretation discussed above requiring ambiguities to be construed in favor of th
