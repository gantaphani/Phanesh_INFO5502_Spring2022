on november,richard kimmel applied for a life insurance policy from western reserve life assurance company and paid an initial premium.in return for his application and payment,he received a conditional receipt.both richard application and the conditional receipt contained a clause that expressly terminated after days any life insurance coverage provided by the company pending its review of richard application.sixty days then passed without western reserve either accepting or rejecting richard application.on february,richard was killed in an automobile accident.richard widow june kimmel sought benefits under the terms of the conditional receipt.when western reserve denied her claim,june brought this suit.the district court granted western reserve motion for summary judgment,finding that the conditional receipt expired on its own terms and that western reserve had not acted in bad faith under indiana law.the court denied as moot june motion for summary judgment on western reserve defense of material misrepresentation.june has appealed from the judgment.we review de novo decisions made at the summary judgment stage.see franklin city of evanston,cir.in doing so,we draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,quoting williamson indiana university,cir.we affirm.
conditional receipt 
because we find that the express language of the conditional receipt controls june claim for benefits,we begin there.the relevant facts are undisputed.
the application richard submitted to western reserve was five pages long and contained the following language 
the company shall have sixty days from the date hereof within which to consider and act on this application and if within such period a policy has not been received by the applicant or notice of approval or rejection has not been given,then this application shall be deemed to have been declined by the company.
the language was on the last page of the application,which was also the signature page.when he submitted his application,richard also paid a premium.in return,he received a conditional receipt that disclosed the following terms 
the policy you applied for will not become effective unless and until a policy contract is delivered to you and all other conditions of coverage are met 
any conditional coverage provided by this receipt will terminate on the earliest of a days from the date the application was signed b the date the company either mails notice to the applicant of the rejection of the application mails a refund of any amounts paid with the application c when the insurance applied for goes into effect under the terms of the policy applied for or d the date the company offers to provide insurance on terms that differ from the insurance for which you have applied.
if one or more of this receipt conditions have not been met exactly the company will not be liable except to return any payment made with the application.
if the company does not approve and accept the application for insurance within days of the date you signed the application,the application will be deemed to be rejected by the company and there will be no conditional insurance coverage.in that case,the company liability will be limited to returning any payment s you have made upon return of this receipt to the company.
this receipt does not provide any conditional insurance until all the conditions and requirements are met as outlined above.
the day limit of coverage expressed in the application and in the conditional receipt expired on january.by that time,western reserve had not accepted or denied richard application or taken much action on his application at all,as described below.richard died on february.on july,western reserve returned the premium richard had paid with his application,with interest 
an insurance policy is interpreted as any other contract.see hoosier insurance audiology foundation of america,smith allstate insurance.where there is no ambiguity in a contractual provision,that provision plain language controls.burress indiana farmers mutual insurance group,citing brunner economy preferred insurance.ultimately,the court role is to give effect to the intent and reasonable expectations of the parties as expressed in the contract,and does not extend to changing the contract terms.colonial penn insurance guzorek.june argues that this longstanding tenet of indiana law,that the plain language controls,is tempered by other indiana cases holding that,until a life insurance company notifies an applicant during his lifetime that his application has been denied and returns his premium,the insurer can not terminate insurance coverage regardless of the plain language.we disagree with this view of indiana law.
in making her argument,june relies primarily on two indiana cases.the first,kaiser national farmers union life insurance,indeed held that an insurance company could not terminate life insurance coverage under a conditional receipt unless,within the applicant lifetime,it had both notified the applicant of its denial and returned the applicant premium.kaiser,who was years old at the time,applied for a term life insurance policy and paid the first quarterly premium due on the policy.due to his age,the insurance company agent told kaiser that he could not purchase a term policy but instead could apply for a whole life policy.he did so,tendering an additional premium and receiving a conditional receipt,but he was killed in an accident before the company formally accepted or denied his application.the court in kaiser found that the conditional receipt created a contract for temporary interim life insurance subject to the company rejection of kaiser application.because the company did not reject kaiser application prior to his death,it was liable for the benefit stated in the application.as the court explained 
any conditions contained in the receipt are to be treated as conditions subsequent thereby compelling an insurer to act affirmatively or negatively on the application.moreover,where an applicant is not acceptable,he must be notified and the premium returned.an insurer can not terminate the risk so assumed unless the applicant is so notified in his lifetime.
kaiser,at.the second case on which june relies,monumental life insurance hakey,looked to kaiser and echoed its holding in finding that a contract existed and the insurer was liable for the benefits stated in hakey application where the company had not notified hakey of the need for a medical examination within his lifetime,it had accepted his premium,and it had issued a receipt.
kaiser and hakey do not control here.the applicants for life insurance in those cases did not receive a conditional receipt that expressly terminated interim coverage at the expiration of a specified time period,as did the conditional receipt that richard received from western reserve.we relied on precisely that distinction in hornaday sun life insurance of america,cir,which also applied indiana law.hornaday applied for life insurance from sun life,paid a premium,and received a conditional receipt in exchange.one condition of the conditional receipt was that the insurance provided by the receipt terminated after days.sun life accepted hornaday application and issued the policy,but the company was unable to deliver the policy to and to collect the full premium from hornaday in spite of several attempts to do so.hornaday then died after the day time limit for the conditional receipt had expired.hornaday widow sought benefits under the conditional receipt.
relying on hakey and kaiser as june does here,hornaday widow argued that under indiana law,an insurance company could terminate a temporary insurance contract only if the company notified the applicant of the termination within the applicant lifetime and returned the premium the applicant had paid.see hornaday,at.because the insurer had satisfied neither of those requirements,hornaday widow argued that the insurer was on the hook for coverage regardless of the expiration of the time limit in the conditional receipt.the insurer,in turn,argued that barr v.the insurance of north america,control
