this appeal has generated thorny questions involving the appropriate standard of judicial review under the employee retirement income security act erisa.it is now before us for a second time.our initial encounter produced a proliferation of views three separate opinions from the three panelists,each of which grappled with the methodological problem facing a reviewing court in regard to an erisa decision made by a plan administrator operating as both adjudicator and payer of such claims.see denmark liberty life assur,cir lipez,id.at selya,concurring id.at howard,dissenting.for ease in exposition,we refer to the three constituent opinions comprising that splintered decision,collectively,as denmark ii.
dissatisfied with the outcome,the plaintiff sought rehearing and rehearing en banc.see fed.cir.the en banc court withheld action on the petition until the supreme court had decided metropolitan life insurance glenn,d.believing that glenn had shed new light on the standard of review,the panel withdrew its earlier decision and requested supplemental briefing.see denmark liberty life assur,cir per curiam.by separate order,the petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot.
the supplemental submissions,together with a welter of helpful amicus briefs,led to a new round of oral argument.we took the matter under advisement and now reaffirm our existing abuse of discretion standard of review,albeit with certain refinements.we nonetheless recognize that the ultimate resolution of the case may be informed,under glenn,both by the aforementioned refinements and by the obtaining of further information.consequently,we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court so that it may obtain that information and reevaluate the case with the guidance supplied by glenn and by this opinion.
background 
we presume the reader familiarity with the facts of the case as set forth in denmark ii.we rehearse here only those events necessary to put this appeal,in its present posture,into a workable perspective.
in,a primary care physician diagnosed diane denmark as suffering from fibromyalgia.the plaintiff,who was a group leader employed by genrad,nonetheless continued to work.at the times relevant hereto,she was covered under two interlocking,disability insurance plans genrad disability plan the std plan and its disability plan the ltd plan liberty life assurance company liberty administered both plans,albeit under different arrangements.
the employer the std plan.under it,liberty provided an initial claims review and benefits determination.its decisions were appealable to the employer,which paid approved claims from its own exchequer.
in contrast,liberty underwrote the ltd plan.pursuant to its terms,liberty reviewed all claims,made the initial benefits determinations,adjudicated any appeals,and paid approved claims from its own coffers.
the plaintiff stopped working on october,and applied for std benefits.the std plan defines disabled to include a person who is unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of her occupation because of an injury or sickness.in an effort to satisfy this definition,the plaintiff supported her claim with reports from three doctors her primary care physician,a cardiologist,and a rheumatologist.after reviewing the tendered medical records and a job description,debra kaye,a nurse employed by liberty as a case manager,requested that clay miller conduct a peer review.based on miller assessment,liberty denied the claim.
the plaintiff appealed this decision to her employer.the appeal papers included a response from her primary care physician disputing miller conclusions.the employer asked peter schur to perform an independent medical examination ime.when schur found the plaintiff disabled,the employer agreed to pay her std benefits.
in june of,the plaintiff filed for benefits.an applicant qualifies as disabled under the ltd plan if,for the first two years,as a result of injury o r sickness,she is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of her own occupation and thereafter is unable to perform,with reasonable continuity,the material and substantial duties of any occupation.nurse kaye reviewed the file,which contained medical support for a finding that the plaintiff symptomatology had worsened as well as a completed activities questionnaire in which she claimed to have severe restrictions on her ability to sit,stand,walk,drive,and concentrate.
in her second review,nurse kaye discounted the ime report,suggested that the plaintiff condition was not as grave as the completed questionnaire implied,and concluded that the plaintiff did not qualify for ltd benefits.thus,liberty denied the claim.
the plaintiff requested further review.liberty responded by,among other things,determining that her job involved light to sedentary work and hiring a private investigator to surveil the plaintiff activities.the sleuth furnished written reports and photographs showing that the plaintiff was very active.
with this ammunition in hand,liberty submitted the entire file to network medical review nmr,a referral service furnishing physicians to evaluate the functional abilities of claimants.nmr forwarded the assignment to one of its correspondents,john bomalaski,who concluded that the plaintiff was capable of working in her primarily sedentary position.on december,liberty reaffirmed its earlier denial of ltd benefits.
nearly fourteen months later,an administrative law judge ruled the plaintiff entitled to social security disability benefits,see,retroactive to her last day of actual work.the judge premised this decision on a subsidiary finding that the plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the social security act.see id.d see also.although the definition of disability under the act differed from the definition of disability under the ltd plan,the plaintiff transmitted this ruling,along with a further report from her rheumatologist,to liberty based on these documents,she sought reconsideration of the refusal to pay ltd benefits.liberty stood firm.
ii.travel of the case 
on september,the plaintiff sued liberty in a massachusetts state court.liberty removed the action to the federal district court.see see also id.the case proceeded on the plaintiff claim under a b.
the district court permitted the plaintiff to conduct limited discovery anent liberty relationship with nmr and its correspondent physicians as part of an effort to show that liberty actions were influenced by a conflict of interest.liberty acknowledged that it had paid upwards of to nmr physicians between and,and identified files that it had referred to nmr during that interval.but liberty refused,on burdensomeness grounds,to answer interrogatories regarding the proportion of those files in which claims ultimately had been allowed.as a sanction for this recalcitrance,the court drew an inference that nmr had found against the claimants in all cases and,thus,applied heightened scrutiny to bomalaski opinion.denmark liberty life assur.denmark i,civ,wl,at.
in due season,the parties for summary judgment.noting that the plan documents delegated discretionary authority to liberty,qua plan administrator,the court reviewed the decision under this circuit historic abuse of discretion standard.id.at.although the court acknowledged the potential conflict of interest posed by liberty dual role in making benefits determinations and paying claims it found no significantly probative evidence that the conflict had in fact influenced liberty decisionmaking.id.at.in discussing that issue,the court opined that a bare structural conflict,in and of itself,did not warrant the application of a less deferential standard of review.id.at.
the court proceeded to find the denial of ltd benefits supported by substantial evidence and,thus,within the plan administrator discretion.id.at.accordingly,it granted liberty summary judgment motion and denied the plaintiff.see id.
on appeal,the plaintiff pursued two lines of attack.first,she contended that the district court had employed an incorrect standard of review.second,she contended that,whatever the standard of review,the denial of ltd benefits was insupportable.we have recounted the rest of the tale above the panel,by a divided vote,affirmed the district court ruling the plaintiff petitioned for rehearing the supreme court decided glenn and the litigation then entered its current phase.
iii.analysis 
the focal point of this appeal has become the standard of judicial review.for that reason,we think it useful to rehearse how the case law in that area has evolved.
among its panoply of remedial devices for plan participants,erisa provides for suits to enforce rights conferred under the terms of an plan.see a b.suits for the recovery of benefits come within the ambit of this provision.congress did not elucidate a standard of judicial review applicable to such actions.the supreme court filled this void when it decided firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
the firestone court noted that erisa abounds with the language and terminology of trust law and that congress anticipated the development of a federal common law of rights and obligations under plans.id.at.invoking trust principles,the court held that when an plan vests discretion in the plan administrator,the latter resolution of benefits claims must be reviewed deferentially.id.at.absent such a delegation of discretionary authority,a plan administrator decisions are to be reviewed de novo.id.at.
in a brief aside,the court observed that if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.at.dictum quoting restatement second of trusts cmt.d.for the next eighteen years,courts struggled both with this dictum and with how to handle structural conflicts of interest in erisa cases.a number of different approaches emerged.
this court clung to the classic abuse of discretion model,taking account of the impact,if any,of a conflict in evaluating whether a denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious and thus,an abuse of discretion.see,leahy raytheon,cir doe travelers ins,cir.other circuits,however,adopted divergent approaches.see kathryn kennedy,judicial standard of review in erisa benefit claim cases,am,collecting cases.
this compendium included a presumptive neutrality approach,under which abuse of discretion review obtains except in cases of actual conflict that is,cases in which the plan administrator decision is shown to be.see,kobs united.ins,cir pulvers first unum life ins,cir woo deluxe,cir.it also included a combination of factors approach under which abuse of discretion review treats both actual and potential conflicts of interest as relevant factors.see,abatie alta health life ins,cir calvert firstar fin,cir.several courts favored a approach.see,pinto reliance standard life ins,cir vega life ins,cir en banc chambers family health plan,cir doe group hosp med,cir.one court preferred a approach.see williams bellsouth,cir.because our standard was central to the decisions in both denmark i and denmark ii,we explore its parameters.
in doyle paul revere life insurance,cir,we acknowledged that the firestone dictum could be read to imply a heightening of the standard of review for structural conflict cases.id.at.we noted,however,that market forces were at work employers are unlikely to contract with insurers who acquire reputations for miserliness.id.thus,it seemed prudent to adhere to the baseline abuse of discretion standard in cases involving structural conflicts,but to give that standard more bite that is,a special emphasis on reasonableness.id.the inquiry should be whether the plan administrator had substantial evidentiary grounds for a reasonable decision in its favor.id.this approach left the claimant free to show an actual if she succeeded in doing so,that showing would influence the decisional calculus.
in doe,at,we supplied a gloss on doyle,explaining that reasonableness is the basic touchstone in all cases.we again rejected a special standard of review for structural conflict cases,observing that gradations in phrasing are as likely to complicate as to refine the standard.id.in any event,the requirement of reasonableness is flexible thus,that requirement may have substantial bite when a court is faced with a specific decision on a specific set of facts.id.explaining that reasonableness review necessarily takes cognizance of conflicts.
in itt hartford life accident insurance,cir,we stressed two points.the first dealt with nomenclature we made pellucid that the terms abuse of discretion,arbitrary and capricious,and reasonableness were functionally equivalent in the erisa context.id.at.none of those terms heralded a heightened standard of review for structural conflict cases.id.our second point remarked the obvious the possible existence of a conflict of interest would necessarily affect the court determination of what was reasonable conduct by the insurer under the circumstances.id.when speaks of the potential for conflict,we understand that usage as a reference to the existence of a structural conflict,and not the possibility of finding an actual conflict or improper motivation.id 
following this trilogy of cases,we consistently have reviewed the resolution of benefits claims by structurally conflicted plan administrators for abuse of discretion,taking into account both the potential for conflict and the mitigating effect of market forces see,buffonge prudential ins,cir wright donnelley sons.group benefits plan,cir glista unum life ins,cir lopes metro.life ins,cir leahy,at dandurand unum life ins,cir.
this brings us to glenn.there,the supreme court reviewed a denial of benefits by an administrator that both passed judgment upon and paid claims under an plan.the denial had been upheld by the district court but set aside by the sixth circuit under its combination of factors standard of review.
picking up on the firestone dictum,the glenn court clarified what sort of relationships might suffice to create a conflict of interest.it concluded that courts should take cognizance of structural conflicts in erisa cases that is,that a conflict exists whenever a plan administrator,whether an employer or an insurer,is in the position of both adjudicating claims and paying awarded benefits.glenn.at.in reaching that conclusion,the court rejected the market forces rationale,explaining that erisa imposes quality standards on insurers.id.at.the court left open the possibility that market forces might inform the significance of a structural conflict in a given case.see id.
the court then turned to the question of how best to weigh structural conflicts.in charting this course,it held fast to the standard of review previously announced in firestone abuse of discretion.id.analogizing to trust law,which asks merely whether a conflicted trustee has abused his discretion either substantively or procedurally.the court rejected rules as a mechanism for ensuring proper judicial review of decisions made by structurally conflicted plan administrators.id.at.
on a more affinitive note,the court commented approvingly that when judges review the lawfulness of benefits denials,they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.id.it likened this approach to that used in the administrative law context id.the court added that judges should weigh a conflict as they would weigh any other pertinent factor that is,when the relevant considerations are in equipoise,any one factor,including a structural conflict,may act as a tiebreaker.id.in this regard,the court counselled judges to take account of both the degree of closeness and the tiebreaking factor inherent or importance.id.
the court acknowledged the resemblance between its approach and the sixth circuit combination of factors approach those approaches give a structural conflict some weight but,in the absence of aggravating circumstances say,evidence of arbitrariness or of actual bias,do not treat it as a dispositive influence.id.at.
the court also described what kind of evidence might impact the relative weight of an identified conflict 
the conflict of interest at issue here,for example,should prove more important
