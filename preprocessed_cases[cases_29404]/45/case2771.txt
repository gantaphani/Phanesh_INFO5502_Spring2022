douglas bell appeals from a summary judgment in favor of general contractor greg agee construction,and its principal greg agee collectively agee on bell complaint for personal injuries he sustained after a wall fell on him at his workplace.agee successfully moved for summary judgment on the ground there was no evidence it affirmatively contributed to bell injuries,and therefore bell causes of action were barred by privette superior court cal th,d,privette and other cases adopting its rationale.on appeal,bell contends the public policy rationales of privette and its progeny do not apply because his employer was not covered by workers compensation insurance at the time of his accident.we conclude bell employer uninsured status does not affect agee liability or lack thereof under privette,and accordingly affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in april,bell,an employee of kincaid construction kincaid,was working at a construction site when a gust of wind caused a framed wall to fall on him,injuring his back.kincaid was the roofing subcontractor for the project agee was the general contractor.kincaid personnel had failed to properly brace the wall.kincaid foreman conceded it was overlooked.at the time of the incident,kincaid was not carrying workers compensation insurance 
bell sued agee,kincaid,and kincaid principal jeffrey kincaid,asserting causes of action for negligence,special risk and premises liability.bell alleged agee,alone and as a joint venturer with kincaid,had a contractual and legal duty to exercise reasonable care for the worksite safety of employees,and breached that duty by failing to exercise control over safety conditions at the site and oversee workers safety.bell further alleged agee should have recognized that the work of framing was likely to create a special risk of bodily harm to others unless special precautions were taken.he alleged agee failed to guard or warn against a dangerous condition at the site.bell later filed a claim for workers compensation benefits with california uninsured employers fund.
agee moved alternatively for summary judgment and summary adjudication.it argued bell negligence and premises liability causes of action were barred under the california supreme court decision in hooker of transportation cal th,d,hooker,because agee did nothing to affirmatively contribute to bell injuries.in connection with the motion,the parties did not dispute that agee never directed any of the operative details of kincaid work,and agee did not contribute in any way to bell injury.relying on lopez development th,d lopez,agee argued its liability was not increased or affected by kincaid failure to maintain workers compensation insurance.agee argued summary adjudication of bell remaining causes of action asserting peculiar risk theories was proper under privette,supra,cal th,d,toland sunland housing group,cal th,d,toland,and camargo tjaarda dairy cal th,d,camargo,which preclude employees from suing the hirer of their employer under various theories of the peculiar risk doctrine.
in a tentative ruling,the superior court granted summary judgment.it ruled agee demonstrated there was no triable issue of material fact as to bell negligence and premises liability causes of action in that agee did not affirmatively contribute to bell injuries.the court agreed agee liability was not impacted by kincaid failure to hold workers compensation insurance at the time of the incident.the court similarly ruled there was no triable issue of material fact as to bell other causes of action for joint venturer liability and special risk on the ground that agee as a general contractor could not be sued under those theories as a matter of law.after considering arguments on the matter,the court confirmed its tentative ruling and entered judgment for agee.
kincaid thereafter filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy act in federal bankruptcy court 
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from a summary judgment,w e review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.merrill navegar,cal th,d.the evidence must be viewed in favor of the plaintiff as the losing party,construing the submissions of the plaintiff liberally and those of the defendant strictly.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.
in this appeal bell raises no issue as to peculiar risk liability under the theories of retained control and affirmative contribution set out in hooker,supra,cal th,d,bell challenge is limited to a single question of law on undisputed facts,namely,whether peculiar risk liability may be imposed on agee notwithstanding privette,because his employer kincaid was without workers compensation coverage at the time he sustained his injuries.
ii.privette 
bell contends his causes of action against agee should not be governed by the rule set out in privette barring liability for hirers of independent contractors under the peculiar risk doctrine.he maintains the policies underlying privette holding do not apply when the general contractor does not carry workers compensation insurance,like agee in this case.
in privette,the california supreme court determined whether the peculiar risk doctrine should apply in circumstances where an independent contractor employee who is injured on the job as a result of the contractor negligence seeks to recover against the person who hired the contractor.in that case,an employee of a contractor hired to install a roof was burned after his employer instructed him to carry hot buckets of tar up a ladder.privette,supra,cal th at,d.the employee sought workers compensation benefits for his injuries,and also sued the property owner who had hired the contractor under the doctrine of peculiar risk.ibid.
reviewing the peculiar risk doctrine evolution,the court observed the doctrine served as an exception to the common law rule of nonliability for a hirer of an independent contractor for the contractor negligence in performing work,so as to ensure innocent third parties injured by the contractor negligence would not have to depend on the contractor solvency in order to be compensated for their injuries.privette,supra,cal th at,d.underlying the exception was the idea that it was more fair to allocate the risk of loss to the person for whose benefit the job was undertaken and that such loss spreading would promote workplace safety.ibid.in turn,the court noted,the hirer was entitled to equitable indemnity from the independent contractor.id.at,d.in california,the peculiar risk doctrine had expanded to permit employees of hired contractors to obtain recovery from the nonnegligent property owner for their injuries.id.at,d.courts had not,however,addressed the validity of this expansion of the doctrine in view of the workers compensation act,under which all employees are automatically entitled to recover benefits for injuries arising out of and in the course of the employment.id.at,d,citing,subd.a.
resolving that question,the california supreme court barred the employee recovery,finding the extension of tort liability under peculiar risk to the employees of an independent contractor hired to do dangerous work advances no societal interest that is not already served by the workers compensation system.id.at,d.it explained that the workers compensation system provides the exclusive remedy for such injury in borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d,we articulated four distinct objectives of the workers compensation act to ensure that the cost of industrial injuries will be part of the cost of goods rather than a burden on society,to guarantee prompt,limited compensation for an employee work injuries,regardless of fault,as an inevitable cost of production,to spur increased industrial safety,and in return,to insulate the employer from tort liability for his employees injuries.citations.
when the conditions of compensation exist,recovery under the workers compensation scheme is the exclusive remedy against an employer for injury or death of an employee.citation.the purpose of this exclusivity provision is to give efficacy to the theoretical compensation bargain between the employer and employee.citation.w e described that bargain as follows t he employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations in the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.citations.citation.the act exclusivity clause applies to injuries regardless of fault,including those attributable to the employer negligence or misconduct citation as well as the employer failure to provide a safe workplace citation.but the exclusivity clause does not preclude the employee from suing anyone else whose conduct was a proximate cause of the injury.
to encourage employers to obtain workers compensation insurance for their employees,the workers compensation act exclusive remedy clause does not apply in favor of employers that fail to obtain such insurance,and consequently they are not immune from tort liability for such injuries.citation.conversely,an employer that provides compensation coverage has no further liability for workplace injuries to an employee.therefore,if a nonnegligent third party pays damages for an employee injuries that are attributable in whole or in part to the negligence of the employer,the workers compensation act limitation on employer liability precludes the third party from obtaining equitable indemnity from the employer.privette,supra,cal th at,d.
the court rejected the expansive view of the peculiar risk doctrine in this context because it would unfairly subject a nonnegligent person to greater liability than the contractor who actually caused the injury,but whose tort liability is limited by workers compensation when an independent contractor causes injury to the contractor own employee,the workers compensation act exclusive remedy provision shields the contractor from further liability for the injury.yet,under the expansive view of the peculiar risk doctrine that has been adopted in california and a minority of other jurisdictions,the person who hired the independent contractor can,for the same conduct of the contractor,be held liable in a tort action for the injuries to the contractor employee.because this expansive view produces the anomalous result that a nonnegligent person liability for an injury is greater than that of the person whose negligence actually caused the injury,it has been widely criticized.privette,supra,cal th at,d.
the court concluded that in the case of injury to an employee of an independent contractor,the workers compensation system of recovery regardless of fault achieves the identical purposes that underlie recovery under the doctrine of peculiar risk it ensures compensation for injury by providing swift and sure compensation to employees for any workplace injury it spreads the risk created by the performance of dangerous work to those who contract for and thus benefit from such work,by including the cost of workers compensation insurance in the price for the contracted work and it encourages industrial safety.privette,supra,cal th at,d.
the court supported its conclusion with policy considerations.it observed that to permit injured employees to recover from both the workers compensation system and the contractor hirer would provide employees of independent contractors an unwarranted windfall,giving them an opportunity denied to other workers and also exempting those employees from the statutorily mandated limits of workers compensation.privette,supra,cal th at,d.the court also pointed out that a significant policy justification for imposing peculiar risk liability on hirer ability to seek equitable indemnity from the negligent independent absent because the exclusivity provisions of workers compensation shields the negligent contractor from such actions.id.at,d.
the california supreme court reaffirmed its view that the workers compensation system provides a sufficient remedy for an injured worker in toland,supra,cal th,d,and camargo,supra,cal th,d.in toland,the court held privette barred recovery under the peculiar risk doctrine for the hirer liability under both sections and of the restatement second of torts toland,at,d.toland involved similar facts as in the present case a subcontractor employee sued the general contractor for injuries caused when a framed wall fell upon him,and also sought workers compensation benefits.id.at,d.the employee asserted that privette did not bar recovery for direct liability under section,but only for vicarious liability under section.toland,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court rejected the notion that there was a clear distinction between the two sorts of liability under peculiar risk theory.p eculiar risk liability is not a traditional theory of direct liability for the risks created by one own conduct liability under both sections is in essence vicarious or derivative in the sense that it derives from the act or omission of the hired contractor,because it is the hired contractor who has caused the injury by failing to use reasonable care in performing the work.id.at,d.the court held that,contrary to the plaintiff assertion,privette bars employees of a hired contractor who are injured by the contractor negligence from seeking recovery against the hiring person,irrespective of whether recovery was sought under the theory of peculiar risk set forth in restatement second of torts section or section in either situation,it would be unfair to impose liability on the hiring person when the liability of the contractor,the one primarily responsible for the worker injuries,is limited to providing workers compensation coverage.toland,cal th at,d.in camargo,the court extended privette to bar recovery for negligent hiring under restatement second of torts section under the same rationale.camargo,supra,cal th at,d.
iii.bell contentions 
in a series of arguments based on privette underlying policies and objectives,bell contends privette should not bar his claims against agee.specifically,he maintains it is not inequitable to shift the financial burden of his injuries to agee because his uninsured employer,kincaid,is not immune from tort liability and agee is not prevented from seeking equitable indemnity from kincaid,thus eliminating privette concern over imposing excessive liability on the nonnegligent hirer.he contends that in cases where a subcontractor is uninsured by workers compensation,the contractor will not bear inequitable costs because the subcontractor bid price is necessarily discounted by the absence of such coverage.he further contends the injured worker receives no compensatory windfall because under the statutory scheme,workers compensation benefits are offset from any tort recovery.bell asserts that imposing peculiar risk liability to general contractors like agee in these circumstances ensures that the cost of compensation will be spread to the hirer benefiting from the contracted work,and will also serve to promote safe construction practices because hirers would insist on retaining properly insured independent contractors.
agee counters that such arguments were addressed and rejected by the court in lopez,supra,th,d.in lopez,a property owner desiring to develop its property hired a general contractor,who in turn retained a subcontractor to frame the roof.id.at,d.although the subcontractor was licensed,it did not have workers compensation insurance.id.at,d.when lopez,one of the subcontractor employees,was injured on the job,he sued the owner for negligence,alleging it had maintained dangerous,conditions at the jobsite and had not provided him with safety equipment.ibid.on appeal from summary judgment,lopez argued he could recover damages from the owner based on the peculiar risk doctrine in part on the theory that the rationales of privette and toland did not apply because the subcontractor did not have workers compensation coverage.lopez,supra,at,d.
the court rejected lopez attempt to avoid p
