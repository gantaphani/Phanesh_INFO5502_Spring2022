this case presents the question whether an employer was insured against workers compensation liability at the time of an inspection of its premises by the department of industrial relations,division of labor standards enforcement.we conclude coverage existed as a matter of law,even though evidence of insurance in the form of policy documents had not yet been issued by the insurer.as a consequence,the division penalty assessment of against the employer for being uninsured on the date of the inspection must be withdrawn and the judgment against the employer reversed.
factual and procedural background 
the facts in this case are undisputed.on may,the division of labor standards enforcement division,represented by deputy labor commissioner diana chen,conducted an inspection at catalina car wash on beverly boulevard in los angeles.chen asked to see proof catalina had secured workers compensation insurance coverage,as required by statute catalina was unable to produce proof of coverage.catalina supervisor contacted its insurance agent,who faxed a certificate of insurance.the certificate was not satisfactory,as it was marked for information only and listed an address in anaheim.chen then called the workers compensation insurance rating bureau,which had no record of coverage for catalina beverly boulevard location the bureau records also showed that coverage at the anaheim address had expired december.
since catalina could not produce evidence of coverage on the date of the inspection,chen issued a stop assessment under labor code sections and.section requires issuance of a stop order when an employer has no workers compensation insurance the stop order prohibits use of employee labor until the employer has secured coverage.section requires issuance of a penalty assessment order at the time a stop order is issued.the penalty assessment order requires the uninsured employer to pay per this case,an additional penalty for being uninsured at the time the stop order is issued 
the following day,may,catalina insurer,legion insurance company legion,issued a formal policy of insurance covering the period december,to december.prior to legion issuance of the formal policy on may,the following events had occurred relating to catalina insurance 
in september,legion issued a workers compensation liability policy,no,to catalina for the period september,to december,showing the insured address in anaheim.
on december,the insurance agent,western carwash insurance agency,sent catalina an insurance binder for the policy period december,to december,evidencing coverage for workers compensation insurance,which is being issued pending receipt of your renewal policy.the agent cover letter stated an invoice was enclosed for the deposit premium,and asked catalina to p lease remit payment within days.the insurance binder,dated december,showed legion as the insurer,the location of the property on beverly boulevard,the policy period of december,to december,and limits of each for employers liability limit,limit and employee.the binder also contained the notation bound to am.
although the deposit premium was not paid within the requested period,catalina made payments of on january,and on march,totaling well over half of the estimated annual premium.
at no time did legion insurance give catalina notice of nonrenewal of the workers compensation insurance policy legion issued for the period september.
on may,deputy commissioner chen continued her investigation of the status of catalina insurance coverage she telephoned legion and spoke to a customer service representative,who responded to chen inquiry about catalina policy by stating that the policy number chen gave was a renewal number,but the system shows that it was expired on december of.chen was told any other questions should be addressed in writing to legion underwriting department.chen then faxed legion,asking when catalina had requested coverage,when the coverage information was entered into legion system,when the policy was effective,and the locations included in the policy.
legion responded on may,telling chen that catalina requested coverage in november because agent bound with a policy period of to.legion response stated the policy was entered into legion system on may,and that b inding information was not received from agent until.legion stated the policy was effective on december,and covered the beverly boulevard location.
chen concluded her penalty assessment was appropriate,based on legion admission that catalina policy was not entered into legion system until after the date of the inspection,and so advised catalina owner,masoud aminpour.on may,chen served another copy of her may,penalty assessment on aminpour,and on may,aminpour filed a request for an appeal hearing.
a hearing was held on november.the information related above was presented,and the division also offered as an exhibit a letter and affidavit dated november,from andrew walsh,legion senior vice president,secretary and general counsel.walsh affidavit stated that catalina actual renewal policy was not issued on a timely basis due to administrative error,but that catalina has had continuous workers compensation insurance coverage with legion insurance company since september.walsh also testified by telephone at the hearing,and was questioned by the hearing officer about the nature of legion administrative error.he concluded his explanation by stating 
it was,however,our we believe our issue a renewal policy in the absence of having issued a nonrenewal notice.so this was just an administrative.we just did have the right people following up with the agent to get all the information necessary.it just sort of slipped through the cracks.but in the meantime it was always our position that there was coverage.
the hearing officer issued findings on january,affirming the penalty assessment.the hearing officer concluded the evidence established catalina did not have a current workers compensation insurance policy in effect on may.he pointed particularly to legion may statement that the policy was entered into its system on may,and to walsh november,affidavit stating that,due to administrative error,the policy was not issued until may.he also cited woodline furniture department of industrial relations th,d,for the proposition that employers can not avoid penalties by purchasing a insurance policy after the penalty has been assessed.thus,absent any conclusive,convincing or substantial evidence to the contrary,the hearing officer concludes that on may,catalina did not have a current worker compensation insurance policy,while employing persons,as required by labor code section.
catalina and legion sought a writ of mandate.the trial court denied the writ,concluding that substantial evidence supported the hearing officer finding that catalina did not have workers compensation insurance coverage in effect at the time of the may,inspection.the trial court emphasized that the insurance binder issued to catalina in december,evidencing coverage for the to policy period pending receipt of the renewal policy,bound the insurance agent only until january.thus the binder expired,and coverage was not obtained thereafter until may,day after the inspection 
judgment was entered on october,and catalina and legion insurance filed this appeal.
discussion 
we conclude the hearing officer and the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding catalina was not insured against workers compensation liability on may.the undisputed facts show that,while no documentary evidence of coverage existed until may,both insurer and insured intended catalina initial policy was to be renewed.as a legal matter,when an insurer fails to give timely notice of nonrenewal of a workers compensation insurance policy,insurance code section mandates the policy shall be continued for a period of days after the insurer gives the notice,subd.d.because no notice of nonrenewal was ever given,catalina policy continued in effect as a matter of law it necessarily follows that catalina may not be penalized for being uninsured at the time the stop order was issued,subd.a.
the division argues catalina may not rely o
