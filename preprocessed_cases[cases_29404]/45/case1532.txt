background 
in april,a tate topa elementary school student was sexually assaulted by a student at the fort totten public high school.in august,vivian lohnes,the guardian of the elementary school student,brought a negligence suit in spirit lake tribal court against tate topa lohnes action.at the time of the incident,auto owners insured tate topa through a commercial general liability policy and a commercial umbrella policy.
auto owners brought this declaratory judgment action in federal district court,seeking a determination of whether the insurance policies provided coverage for the alleged sexual assault of the elementary school student.in response,tate topa filed a motion to dismiss the federal action,asserting that tate topa was immune from suit absent an express and unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.tate topa also argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.lohnes also filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the tribal exhaustion doctrine applied.
in response to the motions to dismiss,auto owners moved the district court for permission to amend its initial complaint.auto owners revised complaint alleged federal question jurisdiction and sought a declaration that the tribal court was without jurisdiction to hear the lohnes action.tate topa opposed the motion to amend,arguing that the tribal exhaustion doctrine gave the tribal court the first opportunity to address whether it had jurisdiction over the lohnes action.in the interim,tate topa moved the tribal court for dismissal of the lohnes action based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction,as federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims implicating the federal tort claims act ftca.
on september,the district court granted auto owners motion to amend the complaint,finding that tribal court jurisdiction issues invoked federal question jurisdiction.the district court also found that the tribal exhaustion doctrine was inapplicable because,by statute,the underlying lohnes action implicated the ftca.the district court thus denied tate topa and lohnes motions to dismiss.thereafter,tate topa renewed its motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity.four months later,auto owners filed a motion for summary judgment as to its obligation to defend and indemnify tate topa.
on september,the district court denied tate topa renewed motion to dismiss,holding that sovereign immunity is not applicable here as the tribal court has exceeded its jurisdictional authority.the district court gave tate topa days to respond to the outstanding motion for summary judgment.tate topa timely filed a notice of appeal from the district court september,order but did not appeal the september,order.on january,the district court granted auto owners motion for summary judgment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,tate topa argues that the district court erroneously concluded that it had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action when it denied tate topa motion to dismiss and tate topa can not raise a sovereign immunity defense because the tribal court exceeded its jurisdictional authority in the lohnes action.
in response,auto owners notes that the district court ruling that the tribal court lacks jurisdiction over the underlying lohnes action is unchallenged.thus,the crucial issue is whether the district court may also exercise jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action.according to auto owners,tate topa sovereign immunity is not a bar to the continuing exercise of jurisdiction because the remaining claim is only for declaratory relief.specifically,auto owners seeks a declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify tate topa.moreover,auto owners asserts that the district court must address the pending summary judgment motion for declaratory relief because the tribal court has ignored the district court finding that the tribal court lacks jurisdiction.

federal question 
in addition to diversity subject matter jurisdiction,a federal court has original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.weeks,at quoting.while a claim of a right or remedy under a federal statute is sufficient to invoke federal question jurisdiction,the fact that a tribal entity is created by and operates on behalf of an indian tribe is not alone sufficient to find the existence of a federal question.id.holding that corporation that contracted with the oglala housing authority to build housing units on the reservation could not bring breach of contract suit against the housing authority because the district court lacked federal question jurisdiction over the action,as the rights which the corporation s ought to enforce were based on its construction contract with the housing authority,interpretation of which is governed by local,not federal,law see also gaming world,at in terms of jurisdiction there is a significant difference between ordinary contract disputes involving indian tribes and those raising issues in an area of extensive federal regulation.internal citations omitted.
