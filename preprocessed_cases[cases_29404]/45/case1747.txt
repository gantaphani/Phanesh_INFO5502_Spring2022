parker,circuit judge 
plaintiff jerald friedman,a medicare beneficiary,purchased private supplemental health insurance through a group medigap policy held by defendant aarp insurance plan aarp,and underwritten and sold by defendant unitedhealth care insurance company unitedhealth.medigap policies offer supplemental private health insurance to cover costs not covered by medicare.friedman filed this putative class action alleging,in essence,that aarp,through its arrangement with medigap,transacts insurance without a license in violation of the california insurance code.friedman sought relief pursuant to california unfair competition law and the common law.the district court granted defendants motion under rule b and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.we reverse.
aarp,a corporation formerly known as the american association of retired persons,is a dominant figure in the market for medigap health insurance.see vencor states ins,cir.describing medigap health insurance approximately of all medigap policyholders nationwide are enrolled in aarp program,more than three times aarp closest competitor.aarp does not itself provide insurance coverage,nor is it licensed to do so.rather,it is the group policyholder for medigap coverage underwritten and sold by unitedhealth,the country largest health insurer.in,friedman purchased unitedhealth medigap coverage through aarp group policy.
aarp and unitedhealth medigap arrangement is governed by a joint venture agreement the agreement or the agreement.the agreement requires that individuals wishing to purchase medigap coverage from unitedhealth do so through aarp group policy.the agreement also requires that aarp administer key aspects of the program,which involves two principal tasks.
first,aarp solicits its members enrollment in the medigap program.an agreement between aarp and its subsidiary trust,defendant aarp insurance plan the aarp trust contractually obligates aarp to solicit member participation in the medigap plan by direct mail and otherwise.er aarp discharges this duty through television commercials,its website,and other forms of advertisements.for example,a website owned by defendant aarp services,a,subsidiary of aarp,explained why aarp members should get an aarp medicare supplement plan.er.it emphasized that i aarp medicare supplement plans are the only medicare supplement plans endorsed by aarp ii the plans are i nsured by unitedhealthcare insurance company,the insurer serving the most medicare supplement enrollees nation wide and iii there is a customer satisfaction rate of those surveyed.er.many of the marketing materials owned and controlled by aarp state in bold font this is a solicitation of insurance.see,er.
second,aarp collects insurance premiums from members through the aarp trust and remits the appropriate payment to unitedhealth.the agreement also allows aarp to invest the collected payments prior to remittance to unitedhealth.significantly,aarp deducts and retains of each dollar paid by unitedhealth medigap enrollees prior to remitting the premiums to unitedhealth.whether this deduction was plausibly alleged to be an insurance commission is a key issue on this appeal.
the initial version of the agreement referred to this retained amount as an allowance.er.however,following settlement of a dispute with the internal revenue service,aarp and unitedhealth amended their agreement to provide that the allowance would be referred to as a royalty.compl,er.defendants assert that the retention is a permissible royalty payment made by unitedhealth in exchange for its use of aarp intellectual property,its logo in connection with the medigap program.the complaint,however,characterizes this arrangement quite differently 
i n exchange for aarp administering of the insurance program and the marketing,soliciting,and selling or renewing aarp medigap policies on behalf of unitedhealth,as well as its collecting and remitting insurance premiums on behalf of unitedhealth,aarp earns a commission,disguised as a royalty,on each policy sold or renewed.
compl,er.in short,friedman alleges that the retained by aarp is a commission on the sale of insurance that is charged over and above the actual monthly premium that unitedhealth charges for medigap coverage which aarp is not entitled to collect because it is not licensed to transact insurance in california.see cal.ins.code providing that persons subject to the california insurance code shall not solicit,negotiate,or effect contracts of insurance without a license.
friedman is not the first to question aarp retention of its fee pursuant to the agreement.at some point,according to allegations in the complaint,regulators began to question aarp status in light of the substantial income aarp was earning through this arrangement.in,the house committee on ways and means reviewed the circumstances surrounding aarp retention of the fee.although defendants argue here that this fee is taken out of the insureds premium payments,br.of appellee,aarp ceo testified to the committee that the royalties have nothing to do with the premiums of beneficiaries,and that n one of the money is taken out of any of the premiums,compl,er internal quotation marks omitted.friedman alleges that aarp has concealed the fact that the supposed royalty was an insurance commission collected in addition to the actual premium charged by unitedhealth,and was an amount he otherwise would not have paid.
friedman filed a putative class action alleging violations of california unfair competition law,cal.bus.code money had and received and conversion.the gravamen of his complaint is that by soliciting insurance and accepting an insurance commission,aarp unlawfully transacts insurance without a license in violation of the california insurance code.this conduct,according to friedman,constitutes an unfair business practice under california law that has caused harm to him and the purported class.
defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to rule b.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.the court concluded that plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that aarp acted improperly as an unlicensed insurance agent who was paid a commission for the sale of insurance.er.rather,it concluded that aarp actions are entirely consistent with a permissible arrangement.er.the court rejected friedman allegation that the fee was an improper commission,concluding that the payment,labeled a royalty by the agreements between aarp and unitedhealth,is not a commission under the facts alleged.er.the court also rejected friedman allegation that aarp solicited insurance,reasoning that none of the marketing materials identified by plaintiff permits an individual to purchase insurance coverage or submit an application for insurance.er.this appeal followed.
we review a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss de novo.fed.trade comm mobility llc,cir.to survive dismissal,a plaintiff must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly.our review is confined to the complaint face because,a s a general rule,we may not consider any material beyond the pleadings in ruling on a rule b motion.united states corinthian,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.however,c ertain written instruments attached to pleadings may be considered part of the pleading,and e ven if a document is not attached to a complaint,it may be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff claim.united states ritchie,cir.a court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.rowe educ.credit mgmt,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.finally,a s a federal court sitting in diversity,we must apply the substantive law of california,as interpreted by the california supreme court.hinojos kohl,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
friedman principal contention is that aarp medigap arrangement violates california unfair competition law ucl.see cal.bus.code.the ucl broadly prohibits unfair competition,defined as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.cal.bus.code.because the statute is written in the disjunctive,it is violated if a defendant violates any of the unlawful,unfair or fraudulent prongs.davis hsbc bank,cir.the california supreme court has emphasized that the ucl scope is broad,and its coverage is sweeping.people ex rel.harris pac anchor,cal.quoting commc ns,cellular,cal.
with respect to the unlawful prong of section,it is clear that v irtually any state,federal,or local law can serve as the predicate.see people ex rel.lockyer fremont life ins,cal.rptr.app.internal quotation marks omitted.friedman allegations focus primarily on purported violations by aarp of the california insurance code,a ucl predicate,see stevens superior court,cal.rptr.app.friedman relies most specifically on section,which states that 
unless exempt by the provisions of this article,a person shall not solicit,negotiate,or effect contracts of insurance,or act in any of the capacities defined in article commencing with section unless the person holds a valid license from the commissioner authorizing the person to act in that capacity.
cal.ins code.section,referenced in section,defines a life licensee as a person authorized to act on behalf of a life insurer or a disability insurer to transact insurance.cal.ins code.further,section provides that a ny person who transacts insurance without a valid license so to act is guilty of a misdemeanor.cal.ins code.see also stevens,cal.rptr.at t ransacting insurance without a license is not a mere technical violation as defendants contend it is unlawful.the insurance code defines the term transact to include solicitation,negotiations preliminary to execution,execution of a contract of insurance,or transaction of matters subsequent to execution of the contract and arising out of it.cal.ins.code.
friedman alleges and defendants do not dispute that aarp is not licensed in california to solicit,negotiate,or effect contracts of insurance,nor is it licensed to transact insurance.at issue therefore is whether friedman has adequately pled that aarp has engaged in any of those listed activities we conclude that he has.in short,friedman has adequately pled that aarp both transacts and solicits insurance without a license in violation of the california insurance code.
first,the complaint alleges that aarp transacts insurance by charging a commission to its members who sign up for unitedhealth medigap coverage although the insurance code does not define commission,california labor code defines commission wages as compensation paid to any person for services rendered in the sale of such employer property or services and based proportionately upon the amount of value thereof.cal.lab.code addressing commission wages in context of employees at car dealerships see also wayne staples,cal.rptr.app.relying on labor code definition of commission wages in assessing whether a fee retained in connection with the sale of an insurance product constitutes a commission for purposes of the insurance code.if,as friedman alleges,the fee is an insurance commission and not a royalty,its retention by aarp could plausibly violate california law.
defendants argue that the fee aarp receives does not meet that definition of commission because unitedhealth payment to aarp is calculated as a percentage of all premiums paid in connection with the program,regardless of their source.br.of appellees.while seemingly true,given friedman allegations,we are not persuaded that the method of calculation,in and of itself,places the arrangements between aarp and unitedhealth outside the definition of commission.significantly,friedman alleged that a ny consumer who wants to purchase medigap coverage from unitedhealth must purchase the aarp medigap plan.compl,er.therefore,every enrollee in unitedhealth medigap program signed up for the program through aarp and remits their monthly payments to aarp specifically,the aarp trust.accordingly,we see no source other than through aarp for the premiums paid to unitedhealth for medigap coverage.at this early stage of litigation,it appears that,in practice,the fee received by aarp is directly tied to the portion of policies sold by aarp,and is,in effect,a percent of the price of the product,wayne,cal.rptr.at.regardless of the nominal form of the arrangement called for by the agreement,the complaint alleges that aarp receives a fee for every member that enrolls in unitedhealth medigap program.at the motion to dismiss stage,we conclude that friedman has plausibly alleged this payment to be a commission.
the complaint contains other allegations lending further support to the contention that aarp fee is an insurance commission rather than a royalty.as previously noted,aarp ceo testified to congress that royalties have nothing to do with the premiums of beneficiaries,and that n one of the money is taken out of any of the premiums,compl,er,and aarp recharacterized the fee as a royalty rather than an allowance following settlement of a dispute with the irs.compl,er.additionally,according to the complaint,other associations with insurance structures similar to aarp,such as the automobile club aaa,acquire a license to act as an insurance agent,compl,er.in sum,we conclude that friedman has met the not especially onerous burden imposed at the pleading stage of alleging facts making it plausible that aarp transacts insurance by collecting commissions from its members who purchase unitedhealth medigap policy.
second,friedman also adequately alleged that aarp solicits insurance in violation of the insurance code.most significantly,aarp marketing materials,which aarp owns and controls expressly state in bold font this is a solicitation of insurance.next,the agreement itself envisions that certain aarp member communications may constitute solicitation materials.see supra note.additionally,the aarp trust governing document contractually obligates aarp to solicit its members participation in the unitedhealth medigap program.finally,aarp marketing materials contain language that a reasonable observer could plausibly interpret as soliciting his or her business.for example,aarp marketing documents explain why members should get an aarp medicare supplement plan,and then list supporting reasons.er.aarp website also allows consumers to view plans and pricing and call a number to speak to an insurance agent and receive complete information including benefits,costs,eligibility requirements,exclusions and limitations.er.in light of aarp direct financial incentive in securing additional enrollees in unitedhealth medigap program,we have little difficulty in concluding that these representations support plausible allegations of solicitation.
despite the foregoing,the district court concluded that the complaint failed to adequately allege that aarp solicits insurance.the court primary rationale was that none of those websites permits an individual to pu
