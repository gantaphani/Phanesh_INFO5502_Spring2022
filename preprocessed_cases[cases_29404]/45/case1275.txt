the paul travelers companies,paul filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of its obligation,if any,to cover the claims of a corn island shipyard,corn island employee under an insurance policy paul had issued to corn island.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of paul concluding that because corn island failed to provide paul adequate notice of its claim,coverage was barred as a matter of law.although we reach the notice issue by a different path,we affirm the judgment for paul.
corn island owns and operates a shipyard along the ohio river near grandview,indiana.through its insurance broker,corn island purchased several insurance policies to cover its various liabilities,including a workers compensation and employers liability insurance policy from fremont industrial indemnity company fremont and an ocean marine bumbershoot policy from paul 
on february,rick williams,a corn island employee,sustained burns over percent of his body after his clothes ignited while he was cleaning paint equipment with flammable thinner on corn island premises.after williams received extensive treatment,the united states department of labor dol declared him permanently and totally disabled and entitled to payment from corn island of permanent total disability benefits under the longshore harbor workers compensation act the lhwca,et.under the policy it had issued to corn island,fremont was responsible for both williams medical expenses and the permanent disability benefits due under the lhwca fremont paid out under its policy in medical expenses and in benefits,but ceased paying benefits in the summer of when it became insolvent.after learning of fremont insolvency,corn island insurance broker contacted the indiana insurance guaranty association,which agreed to accept williams claim up to a maximum limit of 
on september,the dol notified corn island that corn island remained liable for williams benefits under the lhwca despite fremont insolvency.nearly five months later,on february,corn island contacted paul about williams accident and sought coverage for williams benefits.in its response letter,paul reserved its rights under its policy to deny coverage and raised a potential issue of late notice and questioned whether its policy covered corn island claim.after an investigation,paul denied corn island claim on june,stating,in part,that it had no obligation under its policy for williams benefits.
paul then filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to pay corn island claim for williams injuries or,alternatively,if it had an obligation under its policy,that corn island provided late notice of the claim thereby precluding coverage.the parties filed for summary judgment.without addressing the coverage issue,the district court granted paul motion and denied corn island motion.the district court concluded that the notice provision of the lhwca did not apply,but rather new york law applied,and that under new york law,corn island delay in notifying paul of williams claim barred coverage as a matter of law.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court held that the choice of law provision in the paul policy that elected new york law was valid and enforceable.the district court also concluded that the lhwca did not apply to the paul policy because corn island never treated paul as a carrier under the lhwca and because the notice provisions of the lhwca did not apply to excess carriers.accordingly,the district court held that the notice provisions of new york law governed.because corn island notice to paul was late under new york law,the district court concluded that coverage was barred,regardless of whether the paul policy provided coverage for williams lhwca claims.corn island appeals.
on appeal,corn island argues that the district court erred in granting paul summary judgment.specifically,corn island claims that the lhwca governed,and not new york law,the issue of notice and that under the lhwca,it provided paul with adequate notice.corn island further asserts that the paul policy provides coverage for williams claims.we review a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.cady sheahan,cir citation omitted.
it is undisputed by the parties that williams injuries and resulting claims fall under the lhwca,and that corn island is responsible for those claims.what is disputed,though,is whether paul is obligated to provide coverage for those claims under the policy it issued to corn island.also,while the parties do not dispute that new york law governs the interpretation of the paul policy,the parties disagree as to whether the lhwca or new york law should govern the notice issue in this case.under the lhwca,notice to the employer constitutes notice to the carrier.under new york law,however,compliance with the notice provisions of an insurance contract is a condition precedent to an insurer liability.am.ins.fairchild,cir citation omitted.an insured failure to provide timely notice of an injury,without a valid reason for the delay,frees the insurer from covering the claim.id.corn island asserts that new york law does not govern the question of notice because it contravenes the lhwca,particularly and.paul responds that new york law does not contravene the lhwca,and to the extent that the lhwca applies,paul is not a carrier under the lhwca.
because it is undisputed that the lhwca governs the injury for which coverage is sought,we first review the lhwca provisions concerning insurance coverage,including the role established for insurance carriers,who qualifies as an insurance carrier,and what constitutes timely notice.this backdrop is necessary to determine whether the lhwca or new york law applies to the notice issue in this case and ultimately to determine whether paul is obligated to cover williams claims under the policy it issued to corn island.we are not addressing simply an insurance contract coverage issue which generally would be governed by state law in a case based on diversity jurisdiction rather,we are determining whether a particular insurance policy provides coverage for a federal claim which addresses insurance carriers and notice to them.therefore,we must look to the lhwca first.
as its name suggests,the longshore and harbor workers compensation act is a statutory scheme created to compensate maritime employees for injuries leading to death or disability.bunge carlisle,cir.under the lhwca,employers are responsible for compensating injured employees regardless of fault.see.an employer may substitute an insurance carrier for itself to discharge its obligations and duties under the lhwca.specifically,section provides,in relevant part 
in any case where the employer is not a,in order that the liability for compensation imposed by this chapter may be most effectively discharged by the employer,and in order that the administration of this chapter in respect of such liability may be facilitated,the secretary shall by regulation provide for the discharge,by the carrier for such employer,of such obligations and duties of the employer in respect of such liability,imposed by this chapter upon the employer,as it considers proper in order to effectuate the provisions of this chapter.for such purposes notice to or knowledge of the employer of the occurrence of the injury shall be notice to or knowledge of the carrier 
id.emphasis added.
under the lhwca,a carrier is any person or fund authorized under section of this title to insure under this chapter and includes.section,in turn,provides 
any marine protection and indemnity mutual insurance corporation or association,authorized to write insurance against liability for loss or damage from personal injury and death,and for other losses and damages,incidental to or in respect of ownership,operation,or chartering of vessels on a mutual assessment plan,shall be deemed a qualified carrier to insure compensation under this chapter.
on appeal,paul argues that it is not a carrier for purposes of the lhwca and therefore the lhwca notice provisions do not apply.in support of its position,paul cites pennsylvania national mutual casualty insurance spence,cir,and united states casualty company taylor,cir,claiming that these cases show that only those insurers identified with the dol as carriers qualify as carriers under the lhwca.however,contrary to paul position,neither of those cases addressed that issue.rather,in spence,the fourth circuit addressed whether the insurance carrier that provided coverage at the time of an employee injuries was also liable for the employee later death that resulted from the injuries.spence,however,did not discuss carrier designation.spence,at.similarly,in taylor,the fourth circuit did not address carrier designation,but instead held that an insurance carrier had a right to intervene in a case involving an employee claim under the lhwca,but did not address that carrier designation.taylor,at.corn island,in reply,contends that paul has not asserted that it is not authorized to underwrite insurance under the lhwca.nothing in the record indicates whether paul is authorized to issue policies under the lhwca,that is,whether paul is a carrier.therefore,we are unable to determine whether paul is a carrier as defined by the lhwca.regardless,even if paul qualifies as a carrier under section,this does not resolve whether paul is corn island carrier,which is determinative of whether new york law or the lhwca governs notice in this case.
the district court noted that corn island had never treated paul as its carrier under the lhwca.whether corn island ever treated paul as a lhwca carrier,however,is inconclusive in determining whether paul is a carrier under the lhwca.rather,the insurance policy that established a relationship between paul and corn island dictates whether paul is corn island lhwca carrier.see tarantola williams,of course,the subjective notions of parties to contracts do not determine the legal rights and duties created by a writing of the agreement.see also feder caliguira,w e must look to the rights it the agreement confers and the obligations it imposes in order to determine the true nature of the transaction and the relationship of the parties.quoting new york mcgoldrick,ebc i,goldman sachs,generally,where parties have entered into a contract,courts look to that agreement to discover the nexus of the parties relationship and the particular contractual expression establishing the parties interdependency quoting wellington.
in concluding that new york notice law applied,the district court stated that section of the lhwca the notice provision did not apply to excess carriers.neither the district court nor paul provided any citation in support of this conclusion.nor do we find any support in the statutory language for the proposition that the lhwca does not apply to excess carriers.rather,the language of the statute does not address excess carriers or differentiate between primary and secondary policies.
the question remains,then,whether paul is an lhwca carrier for corn island.the language of the statute,particularly section,requires analysis of the policy itself to determine whether a carrier provides coverage under the lhwca to a company.therefore,if the policy creates a relationship whereby an insurance company becomes an employer lhwca carrier,then that company is subject to the lhwca as it relates to insurance carriers,including the notice provision set forth in section.thus,we turn to an analysis of the paul policy to determine if the policy provided corn island coverage under the lhwca.
initially,though,we pause to clarify the governing law.in this suit where our subject matter jurisdiction is premised on diversity,indiana choice of law rules determine the applicable substantive law in this case.see sound of music.mining,cir citations omitted.indiana favors contractual stipulations as to governing law.allen great am.reserve ins,citations omitted.the paul policy states that it shall be governed by the internal laws of the state of new york in all respects,including matters of interpretation and performance therefore,we apply new york law as stipulated in the policy.

as a bumbershoot policy,the paul policy provides excess coverage for underlying insurance policies.specifically,the paul policy provides,in relevant part,that paul 
shall only be liable for the excess of either 
a the amount s of the limit s set out in the underlying insurances identified in the attached schedule of underlying insurances with respect to general average,salvage,salvage charges,and sue and labor expenses,the sum s of said expenses actually insured under the underlying policies shall be deemed the amount s of said underlying policies,or 
b of the ultimate net loss in respect of each occurrence not covered by said underlying limits all hereinafter called the underlying limits and then only up to a further of the ultimate loss in respect of each occurrence 
paul policy,insuring agreement ii.
schedule of underlying insurances is defined as those insurance policies listed on the schedule attached to this policy.the schedule lists various policies including the fremont policy and contains three columns entitled coverage,company,and primary limits,respectively.the portion of the schedule relevant for our consideration appears as follows 
the primary limit of liability shown above is the minimum limit required by our policy regardless of any sublimit that may be contained in these primary policies.
the paul policy also defines ultimate net loss as 
the total sum which the assured becomes obligated to pay by reason of matters set out in the insuring agreement,clause i,including compromise settlements,and shall include hospital,medical,and funeral charges and all sums paid as salaries,wages,compensation,fees,charges,and law costs,premiums on attachment or appeal bonds,interest,expenses for doctors,lawyers,nurses,and investigators and other persons,and for litigation,settlement,adjustment,and investigation of claims and suits which are paid as a consequence of any occurrence covered hereunder,excluding however,the salaries of the assured regular officers and employees and general office overhead and also excluding in any part of such expenses for which the assured is covered by other valid and collectible insurance.
corn island asserts that it is covered by sections ii a and b of the paul policy because the schedule provides coverage in excess of for the fremont policy.in response,paul argues that its policy does not cover workers compensation benefits,including lhwca benefits,because the fremont policy provided full coverage for those benefits.to the extent that its policy provides coverage in excess of fremont policy,paul contends that it applies to fremont employer liability insurance,which has a maximum coverage of.in other words,according to paul,because fremont provided unlimited lhwca coverage,there is no excess for its policy to cover.paul further asserts that coverage is precluded under its policy because its policy does not cover claims arising from insolvency,bankruptcy of the underlying insurer,and failure to maintain underlying insurance coverage.
while neither party claims that the paul policy is ambiguous,corn island objects to paul reference to the fremont policy in interpreting the paul policy because corn island asserts the fremont policy is not incorporated by reference.we disagree.the p
