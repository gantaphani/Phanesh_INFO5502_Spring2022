this case presents a novel issue arising from the intersection of the death on the high seas act dohsa,united states code appendix section et,and the california workers compensation law.the question is whether dohsa preempts an employer state law claim in a subrogation action to recover from a third party tortfeasor sums the employer was obligated to pay for an employee injury.we hold that it does.we also hold that california courts have concurrent jurisdiction over dohsa claims.
factual and procedural background 
appellant and plaintiff in intervention southern california permanente medical group kaiser employed jackie garofalo.in the course of her employment with kaiser,garofalo suffered injuries that aggravated her preexisting respiratory ailments.as a result,a workers compensation proceeding rated garofalo percent disabled.a workers compensation award required kaiser to provide lifetime medical care for garofalo.
in september,garofalo and her husband frank garofalo went on a cruise on the ship sky princess,operated by respondent and defendant princess cruises princess.during the cruise,while the ship was on the high seas,a fire broke out in the ship cinema.garofalo claimed to have sustained injuries when she inhaled smoke from the fire.
in september,garofalo and her husband filed a complaint in superior court against princess,alleging state law claims for personal injuries,medical negligence,and loss of consortium,allegedly resulting from the shipboard fire.on or about november,kaiser intervened as a plaintiff under labor code sections and.it sought from princess the costs of additional medical care it had provided to garofalo allegedly as a result of the aggravation of her injuries due to the fire.kaiser complaint alleged,in relevant part 
intervenor refers to and incorporates herein by reference each and every charging allegation contained in plaintiff complaint for damages on file herein.
as a proximate result of said injuries to plaintiff and the carelessness and negligence or other conduct or misconduct of the,and each of them,intervenor has been required to furnish,has furnished and will in the future be required to furnish compensation benefits under the provisions of the workers compensation laws of the state of california to and on behalf of plaintiff in an undetermined amount.
in march,approximately months after the cruise,garofalo died as a result of medical conditions allegedly aggravated by the shipboard fire.in december,frank and his daughter karen garofalo filed a second lawsuit in superior court against princess,alleging state law claims for wrongful death,medical negligence,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.in that complaint,frank and karen contended that,as a direct and proximate result of princess negligence,garofalo was injured in her health,strength and activity all of which injuries subsequently caused death on march.kaiser did not intervene in the wrongful death action.in april,frank dismissed the personal injury complaint with prejudice against all defendants.kaiser remained the sole plaintiff in the personal injury action against princess.
princess moved for summary judgment in the garofalos wrongful death action,claiming dohsa,united states code appendix section,preempted the wrongful death claim,and that california courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over dohsa claims.in march,the trial court granted the summary judgment motion on the grounds that the garofalos had failed to oppose it.thus,the only remaining litigation was kaiser subrogation claim in the first personal injury action,seeking costs of medical care provided to garofalo.
in march,princess moved for summary judgment against kaiser.it argued,inter alia,that dohsa preempted kaiser state court claim for negligence as a matter of law,and that kaiser negligence complaint against princess failed for lack of evidence of causation.kaiser opposed the motion.it argued that princess had not established that dohsa preempted the suit,and that triable issues of fact existed regarding causation.
on may,the trial court issued a minute order denying princess motion for summary judgment.the order stated the court concludes that there exist triable issues of fact concerning whether any exposure to smoke by garofalo aggravated her medical condition,and that defendant has not shown that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
princess subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandate.this court issued an alternative writ of mandate and ordered the trial court to vacate its order denying summary judgment insofar as the order is based on any finding that the action is not preempted by the federal death on the high seas act dohsa appen.or in the alternative show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue directing you to enter an order based on the determination the action is preempted by dohsa.
on july,the trial court determined that dohsa preempted the present action and vacated the may,order.the trial court issued a new minute order,granting princess motion for summary judgment.that order concluded that under dooley korean air lines,d,dohsa preempted the action and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the court entered judgment and kaiser filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions 
kaiser contends that dohsa does not govern its claims,because dohsa should not be applied for the benefit of a wrongdoer dohsa only preempts wrongful death actions,not the personal injury action in which kaiser intervened kaiser has an independent property right,not derived from garofalo wrongful death claim and dohsa does not apply because kaiser does not contend the shipboard fire caused garofalo death.
princess asserts that dohsa provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful death and survival actions caused by an injury occurring on the high seas kaiser claim is derivative of garofalo and because dohsa preempts her claim,dohsa also preempts kaiser claim kaiser has asserted the shipboard fire was a cause of garofalo death,and there is no material issue of fact on this point and dohsa applies regardless of whether the high seas injury was the sole cause or a contributing cause of garofalo death.

the standards applicable to our review of a summary judgment motion are well settled.summary judgment is properly granted if there is no triable issue of material fact and the issues raised by the pleadings may be decided as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c spray,gould bowers associated internat.ins.th,d.a defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.o.because our review of the grant or denial of summary judgment involves pure questions of law,we review the record independently.wilkins national broadcasting th,d.

an employer subrogation rights under california workers compensation laws.
when an employee is injured in the course of his or her employment,california workers compensation laws generally provide the employee exclusive remedy against the employer.employers mutual liability ins.cal th,d,finney manpower,d.however,the workers compensation laws do not preclude the employee from suing a negligent third party proximately responsible for his or her industrial injuries,employers mutual liability ins.co,supra,cal th at,d.
labor code section also provides that an employer who is obligated to pay a workers compensation award for an industrial injury has the right to sue a third party responsible for the injury in order to recoup the amount paid to the employee.when an employee is injured by a third party tortious act,an employer is indirectly injured to the extent the employer must pay out workers compensation benefits.san diego unified port dist.superior court d.therefore,u nder labor code section,an employer who pays workers compensation benefits to an employee may sue a third party in order to recover a sum equivalent to the benefits which the employer must provide the employee,if the third party,and not the employer,is responsible for the employee injury.county of san diego sanfax cal d,fn.omitted.to this end,the employer may intervene in the employee suit,or obtain recovery through various other procedural means.san diego unified port dist.superior court,supra,d at.
the employer may also seek recovery from a third party tortfeasor who subsequently injures the employee in a accident,if the employer thereby becomes obligated to pay additional compensation such as medical benefits.for example,in abdala aziz th,d,employee abdala sustained an industrial back injury.the worker compensation carrier became obligated to provide medical and other benefits to abdala.weeks after the industrial injury,abdala was injured in an automobile accident which aggravated her back injury.the carrier was obligated to pay the additional medical bills resulting from the automobile accident.the court reasoned that,section et must be interpreted to allow employers subrogation rights whenever,and to whatever extent,an employee suffers a subsequent tortious injury which also increases the employer liability for compensation.this is true whether or not that subsequent injury is industrial in nature.abdala aziz,supra,th at,d.
the employer right to recoup these costs from a third party merely codifies the principles of equitable subrogation.employers mutual liability ins,supra,cal th at,d,county of san diego sanfax,supra,cal d at,fn.accordingly,w here the employer intervenes in an employee suit against a third party tortfeasor,its status is akin to that of a subrogee.demkowski lee d.under labor code section,the employer subrogation right survives the employee death.
workers compensation subrogation provisions are procedural,not substantive.county of san diego sanfax,supra,cal d at,these statutory provisions are primarily procedural.internal quotation marks omitted breese price cal d.moreover,t he workers compensation statutes governing employer and employee actions against third parties do not define the substantive law which determines whether an employee or an employer will in fact recover.citation.instead,the substantive law which governs employer and employee actions is usually the general tort law.county of san diego sanfax,supra,cal d at.
in bringing a subrogation action under labor code section,the employer stands in the same shoes as its injured employee.its action is purely derivative of the employee action.the employer right to recover workers compensation benefits derives from and does not extend beyond the employee tort remedy against the negligent third party.demkowski lee,supra,d at.substantively,as well as procedurally,employer and employee actions are interchangeable regardless of who brings an action,it is essentially the same lawsuit.county of san diego sanfax,supra,cal d at.as a subrogee,an employer rights do not differ from those which would be conferred by an assignment of the same claim.finney manpower,supra,d at.for that reason,an insurance carrier or employer may not recover any damages in excess of those recoverable by the employee.san diego unified port dist.superior court,supra,d at.breese price,supra,cal d at.indeed,it would be anomalous for an employer or insurer to recover damages greater,in nature or amount,than those afforded the injured employee.breese price,supra,at.
the death on the high seas act.
in,congress passed the death on the high seas act,united states code appendix section et,creating a wrongful death action for deaths occurring on the seas more than three miles from shore.mobil oil higginbotham,d.until passage of dohsa,there was no remedy for death on the high seas caused by breach of one of the duties imposed by federal maritime law.citation.it was in this atmosphere that congress considered legislation designed to provide a uniform and effective wrongful death remedy for survivors of persons killed on the high seas.offshore logistics,tallentire,d.
section of dohsa appen.a provides in pertinent part w henever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act,neglect,or default occurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of any state the personal representative of the decedent may maintain a suit for damages in the district courts of the united states,in admiralty,for the exclusive benefit of the decedent wife,husband,parent,child,or dependent relative against the vessel,person,or corporation which would have been liable if death had not ensued.
the act limits recovery to a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is sought.citation.dooley korean air lines,supra,at.thus,dohsa authorizes recovery for the dohsa beneficiaries pecuniary losses only it does not authorize recovery for the decedent own losses,nor does it allow damages for losses.ibid.
appendix section of united states code provides a limited survival provision.if a person die s as the result of such wrongful act,neglect,or default as is mentioned in section of this title during the pendency in a court of admiralty of the united states of a suit to recover damages for personal injuries in respect of such act,neglect,or default,the personal representative of the decedent may be substituted as a party and the suit may proceed as a suit under this chapter for the recovery of the compensation provided in section of this title.ibid.
as the united states supreme court has explained,the death on the high seas act announces congress considered judgment on such issues as the beneficiaries,the limitations period,contributory negligence,survival,and damages.citation.the act does not address every issue of law,but when it does speak directly to a question,the courts are not free to supplement congress answer so thoroughly that the act becomes meaningless.mobil oil higginbotham,supra,at.
the death itself need not actually occur on the high seas in order for dohsa to apply.the key inquiry is where the event occurred.dohsa provisions have been held to refer to the site of an accident on the high seas,not to where death actually occurs or where the wrongful act causing the accident may have originated.bergen patrick cir,motts green wave cir,howard crystal cruises,cir.for example,in motts green wave,a seaman hip and pelvis were crushed in an accident while the ship was on the high seas.the ship personnel and management company failed to provide adequate medical care for him for over two weeks.the seaman eventually underwent surgery in texas and died onshore approximately a month after the accident.the fifth circuit held that dohsa applied,even though all of the ship management company actions and motts death occurred onshore.motts green wave,supra,at.
dohsa preempts state wrongful death and survival claims when death is caused by a wrongful act occurring on the high seas.
several united states supreme court decisions address the relationship between dohsa,state wrongful death laws,and the general maritime law of the united states.
we preface our discussion by quoting a cogent description of how wrongful death and survival actions differ.although they are often lumped together without any distinction,citation,they are,in fact,quite distinct.citation.a wrongful death cause of action belongs to the decedent dependents or closest kin in the case of the death of a minor.it allows the beneficiaries to recover for the harm that they personally suffered as a result of the death,and it is totally independent of any cause of action the decedent may have had for his or her own personal injuries.damages are determined by what the beneficiaries would have received from the decedent and can include recovery for pecuniary losses like lost monetary support,and for losses like loss of society.citation.a survival action,in contrast,belongs to the estate of the deceased although it is usually brought by the deceased relatives acting in a representative capacity and allows recovery for the injury to the deceased from the action causing death.under a survival action,the decedent representative recovers for the decedent pain and suffering,medical expenses,lost earnings both past and future,and funeral expenses.calhoun yamaha motor,cir,affd,d.
in mobil oil higginbotham,supra,the court held that in an action for wrongful death on the high seas,the appropriate measure of damages is that established by dohsa.there,passengers on a helicopter flight were killed in a crash over the high seas.the plaintiffs,decedents widows,sought damages for loss of society under the general maritime law.the court found that,because dohsa represented congress considered judgment on the issue of recovery of damages for wrongful death on the high seas,the plaintiffs were limited to pecuniary losses.thus,the plaintiffs could not supplement their dohsa recovery with claims brought pursuant to the general maritime law.id.at.
in offshore logistics,tallentire,supra,the court held that dohsa preempted louisiana wrongful death statute.there,widows of two drilling platform workers killed in a helicopter crash over the high seas brought wrongful death claims under louisiana wrongful death statute,as well as under dohsa and the outer continental shelf lands act.the plaintiffs relied upon dohsa section,which provides in relevant part,the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this chapter.appen.they argued that section therefore allowed them to maintain claims for their husbands deaths under state laws.after tracing the legislative history of dohsa,the supreme court held that the statutory language was not meant to preserve the applicability of state law wrongful death statutes and remedies outside territorial waters,but was merely a jurisdictional saving clause.the court found once it is determined that acts as a jurisdictional saving clause,and not as a guarantee of the applicability of state substantive law to wrongful deaths on the high seas,the conclusion that the state statutes are by dohsa where it applies is inevitable.as we held in higginbotham,congress has struck the balance for us in determining that survivors should be restricted to the recovery of their pecuniary losses offshore logistics,tallentire,supra,at.offshore logistics declined to consider whether the dohsa recovery for the beneficiaries pecuniary loss may be supplemented by a recovery for the decedent pain and suffering before death under the survival provision of some conceivably applicable state statute that is intended to apply on the high seas.id.at,fn.
the court most recent pronouncement on the subject,dooley korean air lines,supra,likewise stressed dohsa preeminence.in dooley,petitioners were the personal representatives of three passengers killed when the former soviet union shot down korean air lines flight after the plane strayed into soviet air space.the petitioners sought to recover for their decedents pain and suffering.they argued that although dohsa did not permit such damages,general maritime law provided for a survival action allowing the decedents estates to recover for pain and suffering.id.at.petitioners contended that,because dohsa was a wrongful death statute,it had no bearing on the availability of a survival action.id.at.the airline,on the other hand,argued dohsa provided the exclusive cause of action for deaths occurring on the high seas.id.at.the supreme court granted certiorari to resolve a split in the circuit courts regarding the availability of a general maritime survival action in cases of death on the high seas.id.at.
the supreme court agreed with the airline that dohsa provides the exclusive remedy for death on the high seas.dohsa expresses congress judgment that there should be no such cause of action for the decedent pain and suffering in cases of death on the high seas.by authorizing only certain surviving relatives to recover damages,and by limiting damages to the pecuniary losses sustained by those relatives,congress provided the exclusive recovery for deaths that occur on the high seas.petitioners concede that their proposed survival action would necessarily expand the class of beneficiaries in cases of death on the high seas by permitting decedents estates and their various beneficiaries to recover compensation.they further concede that their cause of action would expand the recoverable damages for deaths on the high seas by permitting the recovery of nonpecuniary losses,such as pain and suffering.because congress has already decided these issues,it has precluded the judiciary from enlarging either the class of beneficiaries or the recoverable damages the comprehensive scope of dohsa is confirmed by its survival provision which limits the recovery in such cases to the pecuniary losses suffered by surviving relatives.the act thus expresses congress considered judgment,citation on the availability and contours of a survival action in cases of death on the high seas.for this reason,it can not be contended that dohsa has no bearing on survival actions rather,congress has simply chosen to adopt a more limited survival provision in sum,congress has spoken on the availability of a survival action,the losses to be recovered,and the beneficiaries,in cases of death on the high seas.because congress has chosen not to authorize a survival action for a decedent pain and suffering,there can be no general maritime survival action for such damages.dooley korean air lines,supra,at.
these cases make clear that dohsa preempts state wrongful death and survival claims when the incident leading to death occurs on the high seas and dohsa limits recovery to pecuniary damages and prohibits litigants from supplementing their dohsa claims with claims brought either under state law or the general maritime law,zicherman korean air lines,d.
application of dohsa to kaiser claim.
applying these principles to the case before us,we conclude that dohsa preempts kaiser state law claim.because kaiser stands in garofalo shoes and can have no greater recovery than could garofalo,we look to dohsa effect on garofalo claim.as kaiser concedes,dohsa provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful death and survival actions resulting from death on the high seas,and the garofalo family has no remedy but dohsa.neither does kaiser.
preliminarily,we note neither party disputes that the sky princess was on the high seas when the fire occurred.it is also clear that,if the fire was a cause of garofalo death,the fact she died in california approximately months later does not affect dohsa coverage,motts green wave,supra,at.
as set forth above,kaiser rights against princess are strictly derivative of garofalo.kaiser can have no greater right to recovery than could garofalo,its injured employee.the two actions are interchangeable,and essentially the same lawsuit.county of san diego sanfax,supra,cal d at.moreover,the california workers compensation subrogation and intervention provisions were not meant to provide the substantive law governing a claim against a third party tortfeasor they are procedural only.id.at.labor code section does not guarantee that an employer has a right to recover under the substantive law governing the action.thus,our analysis of kaiser claim must begin and end with an analysis of garofalo claim.
assuming that injuries on board the sky princess caused garofalo death,dohsa would have governed her claim.mobil oil,offshore logistics and dooley stand for the proposition that dohsa preempts state wrongful death claims and survival actions and therefore governs the types of recovery available.dohsa survival provision,united states code appendix section,covers exactly the circumstance here an employee is injured on the high seas,sues,and later dies of the injuries.under these circumstances,the only action available is for pecuniary damages under dohsa,united states code appendix section et.other state law claims are not cognizable.accordingly,because dohsa preempts state law wrongful death and survival actions if a decedent dies of high seas injuries,dooley korean air lines,supra,d,the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of princess,jacobs northern king shipping,cir,holding dohsa preempted claim based upon state survival act.
kaiser claims have no merit.
kaiser makes several arguments in support of its position,but none are persuasive.first,kaiser urges that because dohsa was enacted for the benefit of the wronged not the wrongdoer,it should not be invoked to the detriment of the decedent beneficiaries.the law does not support this argument.as princess points out,dohsa has frequently been invoked to limit or reduce the recovery that might otherwise have been available to the decedent family,dooley korean air lines,supra,d holding dohsa precludes recovery for decedent pain and suffering.kaiser cites no authority supporting the novel proposition that dohsa only applies when it favors the decedent representative or estate.
second,kaiser appears to argue that because it did not intervene in the garofalo wrongful death claim,it can successfully sue on the personal injury claim filed by garofalo before her death.dooley made clear,however,that dohsa preempts all state wrongful death claims and state survival actions,claims for personal injury occurring before a decedent death.
next kaiser suggests that dohsa only preempts wrongful death and survival actions it does not preempt actions which are not affected by common law rules of abatement.kaiser cites no persuasive authority for this reading of the law.
kaiser also posits that dohsa should not preempt california law governing workers compensation subrogation rights,in that dohsa does not address subrogation rights.kaiser points out that preemption should be disfavored unless the evidence of preemptive purpose appears in the text and structure of the statute,and dohsa contains no express preemption clause.however,as explained above,an employer subrogation rights depend upon the employee rights against the tortfeasor.because dohsa preempts the employee state law wrongful death claims and provides the only survival remedy for injuries to the decedent occurring before death,dohsa necessarily preempts kaiser state law claims.
in conjunction with its other arguments,kaiser urges that dohsa should not apply because kaiser sued not for wrongful death,but for damages to its property rights.kaiser attempts to recast its rights as separate from the employee cause of action,arguing that it has an independent right of action against princess for property damage.apparently kaiser hopes,in this way,to avoid the fact that its action is derivative of garofalo.in support of its argument,kaiser retreats to several early cases holding that labor code section created an independent property right,morris standard oil cal,limited mutual.ins.billings d.to the extent these cases can be read to suggest an employer has a cause of action that is not derivative of the employee cause of action,they are no longer good law.county of san diego sanfax,supra,cal d at.
finally,kaiser argues that neither it nor princess has asserted that the shipboard fire caused garofalo death.kaiser claims it does not allege that garofalo death was in any way caused by or resulted from any negligent act committed by respondent or by the fire that occurred on respondent cruise ship.therefore,kaiser posits,dohsa can not apply,as dohsa comes into play only when death is caused by the high seas injury or omission.it claims,certainly,where neither party to the lawsuit contends that garofalo death resulted in any way from defendant conduct,the death on the high seas act can have no application.
we find that kaiser conduct of the litigation demonstrates it repeatedly has asserted the shipboard fire was a contributing cause of garofalo death.while it is true that princess has steadfastly maintained the shipboard fire did not injure garofalo,much less cause her death,kaiser has taken the opposite position.kaiser did not dispute,in response to the separate statement filed by princess,that garofalo died as a result of medical conditions which kaiser asserts were aggravated by the shipboard fire.kaiser argued below,and in this appeal,that garofalo asthma and chronic lung disease were dramatically worsened by breathing smoke from the shipboard fire garofalo was not terminally ill prior to the cruise and her condition was stable.in discovery,kaiser took the position that princess was responsible for all medical expenses incurred by garofalo from approximately the date she returned from the cruise,until the day she died,nearly million.these assertions are entirely inconsistent with kaiser claim that the shipboard fire did not cause garofalo death.if the fire did not play some role in garofalo death,then kaiser could not have attempted to shift the responsibility for all her medical expenses to princess.kaiser can not now raise a material issue of fact by claiming that the shipboard fire played no role in garofalo death.
dohsa provides the exclusive remedy as to the high seas tortfeasor when a high seas injury is a contributing cause of death.
we next consider whether dohsa comes into play where the high seas injury is one cause,but not the sole cause,of death.we hold that,under such circumstances,dohsa provides the exclusive measure of recovery for the decedent as against the high seas tortfeasor.
perhaps because of the catastrophic nature of most high seas deaths,there is a dearth of case law in which the decedent death was caused by a high seas injury in combination with another cause.princess points out that where concurrent acts of negligence were the cause of a high seas death,courts have applied dohsa.bergen patrick,supra,at finding it irrelevant to dohsa coverage that decisions contributing to the patrick unseaworthiness may have occurred onshore when accident causing death occurred on high seas motts green wave,supra,at dohsa applied though ship management company allegedly negligent failure to establish evacuation plan contributed to fatal injury even though the negligence occurred onshore,the fact that the accident occurred on the high seas implicates dohsa.princess also notes that,as discussed above,dohsa applies even where the decedent death occurs off the high seas,if the injury itself occurred on the high seas.
in other words,dohsa applies as long as the injury occurs on the high seas,even if some of the negligent actions leading to the accident occurred on land,and even where the decedent death occurred on land.the operative question is where the accident occurred.accordingly,here the fact that garofalo preexisting illness did not originate on the high seas does not affect dohsa coverage.
moreover,the language of dohsa does not suggest that the statute applies with any less force when the high seas injury is not the sole cause of death.the statute provides dohsa applies w henever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act,neglect,or default occurring on the high seas.appen.emphasis added.there is nothing in the plain language of the statute to suggest caused means sole cause.kaiser cites no authority,or persuasive argument,suggesting that dohsa is inapplicable when the high seas injury is not the sole cause of death.
we also take note of united states code appendix section,governing contributory negligence.that section provides in suits under this chapter the fact that the decedent has been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar recovery,but the court shall take into consideration the degree of negligence attributable to the decedent and reduce the recovery accordingly
