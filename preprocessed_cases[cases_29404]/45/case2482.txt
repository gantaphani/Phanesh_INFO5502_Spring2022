in this opinion we resolve the following issue did the addition of subdivision c to insurance code section abrogate denny workers comp.appeals bd.th,d denny the answer is no.we therefore conclude that the trial court properly invoked the denny rule when it granted summary judgment and concluded that the appellant city of laguna beach city can not obtain reimbursement from respondent california insurance guarantee association ciga under section,subdivision c.though that provision renders the obligation of an insolvent excess workers compensation insurer a covered claim that ciga must ordinarily reimburse,ciga need not reimburse a permissibly employer for benefits paid to an employee for cumulative injury if the employer liability is based in part on a period of time when the employer was and chose not to buy excess insurance for the particular risk.
the judgment is affirmed.
background 
continental casualty company continental issued a workers compensation policy to the city providing coverage from may,to may.the policy was excess to the city retention and covered cumulative injury only if it first manifested during the policy period.reliance national indemnity company reliance issued a workers compensation policy to the city for the period may,to july.this policy,too,was excess to the city retention.but it differed from continental policy in that it was triggered by cumulative injury if the last date of exposure to the conditions causing the disease occurred during the policy period.
a city employee filed a workers compensation claim for cumulative injury from to june.the case was resolved in,but the employee reopened the case in to seek more benefits.the city incurred workers compensation liability that exceeded its retention and sought reimbursement from continental.in addition,because reliance was insolvent,the city sought reimbursement from ciga.continental and ciga both determined that they did not have to pay the city claim.
the city action 
the city sued ciga and continental and requested a declaration that they owe the city reimbursement.ciga filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.it argued that the city status and the continental policy constituted other insurance under section,subdivision c and therefore ciga had no statutory obligation to pay any portion of the benefits that were due under reliance policy.
according to the trial court,the city bore the burden of proving the nonexistence of other insurance but failed to meet its burden.the trial court granted ciga motion and entered judgment.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
we review summary judgment de novo.reyes kosha th,fn,d.in assessing whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment,the pivotal question presented is whether the city claim is a covered claim under section,subdivision c or barred under subdivision c because its status qualifies as other insurance.the city contends that section,subdivision c clearly applies to this case,and that the trial court reliance on denny is unexplainable.in particular,the city posits that section,subdivision c specifically abrogated denny.what the city fails to appreciate is that the reach of section,subdivision c is unclear,and we are obligated to harmonize it with denny to the extent possible.finally,the city contends that ciga failed to meet its burden of proof.we disagree.
a.the applicable interpretive principles.
before assessing the impact of section,subdivision c on denny,it behooves us to acknowledge that u nless expressly provided,statutes should not be interpreted to alter the common law,and should be construed to avoid conflict with common law rules.citation.goodman zimmerman th,d.as a result,a statute will be construed in light of common law decisions,unless its language clearly and unequivocally discloses an intention to depart from,alter,or abrogate the rule concerning the particular subject matter citations.citation.citation.accordingly,t here is a presumption that a statute does not,by implication,repeal the common law.citation.repeal by implication is recognized only where there is no rational basis for harmonizing two potentially conflicting laws.citation.california of health facilities department of health services cal th,d.
moreover,when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citations.id.at.if the statute does not have a plain meaning and legislative history is unhelpful,we must apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.citation.registry,municipal court th,d.
b.the common law.
when an employee suffers a cumulative injury,he may claim workers compensation benefits against any one or more of successive employers or insurance carriers that employed or insured the employee during a maximum injury period.citations.denny,supra,th at,d,subd.a setting the period during which employers and insurers are liable.the employers and insurers are jointly and severally liable for the entire award.they can apportion their relative liabilities in separate workers compensation appeals board proceedings.citations.id.at,d.w here an insured has overlapping insurance policies and one insurer becomes insolvent,the other insurer,even if only a secondary or excess insurer,is responsible for paying the claim.in other words,ciga is an insurer of last resort and does not assume responsibility for claims where there is any other insurance available.citation.id.at,d.
in denny,an employee claimed that she suffered a cumulative injury and the cumulative injury period spanned may,to may.denny,supra,th at,d.the employer was through july.ibid.thereafter,it was covered by a primary workers compensation policy from a private insurer.when the insurer was declared insolvent,the employer sought reimbursement from ciga.the court concluded that the retention was other insurance.the court noted that o ur determination comports with the intent of the guarantee act.as an insurer of last resort,ciga assumes responsibility for claims only when no secondary insurer is available.citations.the legislature did not establish ciga to protect denny as a,but rather,to protect the injured employee as a member of the insured public by ensuring she received a full disability award.citations.id.at,d.
the denny court went on to explain we also find no reason to assess liability against ciga on equity grounds.as a,denny placed itself in the position of a private insurer.if denny had been covered by a third party insurer instead of being during the first portion of the employee cumulative injury period,that insurer would be liable for the entire disability award.citation.denny made a decision to,gambling that it could lower its costs by not purchasing third party workers compensation insurance.denny can not reap the benefits of without accepting its burdens.moreover,denny could have limited its liability by purchasing a special excess workers compensation policy to discharge any or all of its continuing obligations as a to pay compensation or to secure the payment of compensation.citation.by not purchasing a special excess workers compensation policy,denny effectively chose not to insulate itself from the long tail of potential liability.denny,supra,th at,d.
c.the statutory scheme.
ciga must pay covered claims,subd.a.a covered claim is an obligation of an insolvent insurer,subd.b.however,c overed claims does not include any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance,subd.c.in,section,subdivision c was added by assembly bill to provide that covered claims include obligations arising under an insurance policy written to indemnify a permissibly employer for its liability to pay workers compensation benefits in excess of a specific or aggregate retention.subdivision c does not subdivision c or purport to elimina
