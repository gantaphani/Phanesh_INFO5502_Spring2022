factual and procedural background 
this case involves an underlying lawsuit the suit arising out of a contract dispute between technology corporation and united space.usbi company usbi and then subsequently united space,were general contractor for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa space shuttle program.is a nasa subcontractor that supplied separation bolts used to detach the shuttle solid rocket boosters from the shuttle after launch.in,and usbi entered into a contract under which would provide delay cutter assemblies that are used to deploy the parachutes on the solid rocket boosters.united space assumed this contract from usbi in late.alleges that after entering into the contract,usbi materially altered its scope by adding work that was to perform.performed this additional work,but its payment requests were refused.

discussion 
personal injury coverage 
we find that the district court was correct to apply the eight corners rule,and in determining that ahac has a duty to defend united space under the policy.am.states ins.bailey,cir quoting national union fire ins.merchants fast motor lines,in determining an insurer duty to defend,texas courts utilize the eight corners rule.the eight corners rule provides that an insurer duty to defend is determined by the language of the insurance policy and a liberal interpretation of the allegations against the insured,that if true,potentially state a cause of action covered by the policy.union fire ins.merchs.fast motor lines,am.guar.liab.ins.underwriters.in determining coverage texas state courts focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of the damages rather than on the legal theories alleged.adamo state farm lloyds,dist,writ denied.an insured bears the initial burden of showing that there is coverage.guar.ins.vic,cir.united space satisfied its burden because the alleged facts giving rise to causes of action include conduct that potentially falls within the enumerated offenses in that policy 
we are not persuaded by ahac argument that a potential cause of action covered under the policy does not exist because any alleged disparagement of by united space occurred only after the alleged breach of contract and fraudulent inducement,and thus were not within the coverage period.filed its complaint against united space on november.its complaint includes allegations of conduct by united space both before and after the may,termination of the contract,as well as prior to october,the date the policy coverage expired.thus,the potential stated causes of action against united space are covered under the policy period,and united space has satisfied the requirements of the eight corners rule.
ii.policy exclusions 
we also find the district court was correct to hold that the policy exclusions such as the knowing falsity exclusion,listed in the policy did not preclude ahac duty to defend because some of the allegations against united space fell outside of the listed policy exclusions.an insurer must defend when there is at least one cause of action within the policy coverage,brooks,tarlton,gilbert,douglas kressler united states fire ins,cir,and once coverage has been found for any portion of a suit,an insurer must defend the entire suit.stumph dallas fire ins.
here,some of the causes of action and allegations of conduct,such as breach and repudiation of contracts,as well as disparagement,are not types based on and do not involve knowingly fraudulent statements.furthermore,texas courts have held that even where allegations involve false statements,if liability can be imposed without proving that the false statements were made with the knowledge that they were false,the knowledge of falsity exclusion will not apply to preclude coverage.see,bay supply,travelers lloyds ins,d,stating that because knowledge was not a requirement for a finding of liability in the,the insurer had not carried its burden of showing that the knowledge of falsity exclusion bars defense coverage 
iii.district court denial of judgement as matter of verdict 
the district court correctly denied ahac motion seeking reversal of the jury verdict which found that ahac breached its duty to defend united space in the suit.as noted above,this court can not reverse a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law unless the jury factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence,or if the legal conclusions implied from the jury verdict can not in law be supported by those findings.here,the jury had before it the following facts in concluding that ahac breached its duty to defend 
the insurance policy itself which provides that ahac has the duty to defend united space in specific circumstances 
undisputed evidence that even after united space proved to ahac that the retention had been exhausted,no defense costs were 
the absence in the policy of the requirement of a formal request for defense,to trigger the duty to defend.the only duty required on united space part was a duty to notify ahac of any occurrence of an offense as soon as practicable which may result in a claim.united space notified ahac of the suit with a letter on november,three days after the suit had been filed 
the documentation submitted to verify that the retention had been exhausted in the form of i invoices showing the amount that was being charged on a monthly basis ii united space internal processing forms that showed someone had reviewed the bill,signed off and authorized it for payment as a defense cost in the action and iii copies all the cancelled checks paid to the law firm 
furthermore,the jury properly did not factor into its deliberations a tender rejected by united space because ahac chose,of its own volition,not to present this offer before the jury this court has clearly stated that in reviewing a jury verdict,the question to ask is whether the jury finding could,with reason,be made upon the evidence before it.liberty mut.ins,at.thus,this rejected tender can not be considered by us in reviewing the jury verdict here.in looking at the evidence that the jury had before it,we find that the jury verdict was reasonably based on substantial evidence and should be affirmed.
iv.judgment as a matter of law jury 
ahac filed a judgment as a matter of law motion seeking reversal of the jury award of attorney fees to united space,for both the defense and the instant coverage action.the district court denied this motion.ahac asserts that there was a lack of evidence demonstrating that the awarded fees were reasonable and necessary,and thus the district court should have granted its motion.ahac also argues that the fees requested by united space as damages and for the coverage action were not properly segregated.the attorney fees awarded by the jury were both as damages for ahac breach of duty to defend united space in the action,and as attorney fees due a successful claimant in a breach of contract action.therefore,we will analyze them separately to determine if the district court erred.we will also analyze the segregation of fees issue separately to ascertain if the district court committed any error in that regard.
attorney fees as damages 
ahac notes that while united space offered the testimony of its chief counsel in the action,michael levin levin,it did not designate him as an expert,nor did it offer a designated expert to testify about the reasonableness and necessity of the attorney fees.testimony and documentary evidence as to reasonableness and necessity were precluded by the district court after it had granted united space motion in limine to prevent ahac from raising such issue.essentially,the evidence presented by united space was proof of how much it had paid levin law firm in defending united space against the suit.
texas courts have held that attorney fees incurred involving litigation with a third party are recoverable as actual damages.see,united states casualty schlein,cir southwestern indemnity national surety,cir turner turner,lesikar rappeport,pet.denied.these courts have stated that the recovery of attorney fees in such circumstances are appropriately based upon the equitable ground that the claimant was required to defend against litigation as a consequence of the wrongful conduct of the defendant.see united states casualty,at powell narried,paso,writ ref lesikar,at nationwide mut.ins,at.however,these courts have also held that attorney fees sought to be recovered as damages must be reasonable and necessary.southwestern indemnity,at powell narried,at lesikar,at.to show the reasonableness and necessity of attorney fees incurred,texas courts have generally held that a party seeking such fees must offer the testimony of a witness who has been designated as an expert,see hutton youngblood,lesikar,at,or at the very least,some testimony by the claimant attorney that the fees being sought as damages are reasonable.gulf paving lofstedt,nguyen ngoc giao smith lamm,dist,no writ.furthermore,texas courts have held that a court may take judicial notice of the reasonableness of attorney fees based on the testimony given.see ragsdale progressive voters league,lesikar,at.however,these courts have also held that when a court does not clearly take judicial notice of reasonableness,and the testimony offered as to reasonableness and necessity is that of an interested witness,even if uncontradicted,such testimony does no more than raise a fact issue to be determined by the jury.id.
levin testified as to how his firm had to develop sufficient technical knowledge of the space shuttle program,interview dozens of persons who worked in the program,as well as review thousands of pages of documents.however,in keeping with the motion in limine,the district judge narrowed the scope of levin testimony to cover only an overview of what was done in the defense and cautioned levin to avoid discussing issues of reasonableness and necessity.furthermore,while united space submitted the bills from its attorneys for the legal fees it incurred in the defense,it did not submit the backup documentation for those bills which detailed the attorneys whose work was being billed,the type of legal work that they had performed,and the number of hours being billed.united space claimed that such was covered under the privilege.in sum,because the motion in limine prevented either party from even discussing the reasonableness and necessity of the attorney fees,there was no evidence presented as to such.while united space argues that section provides a presumption of reasonableness for requested attorney fees,as we explain below,that section only applies to attorney fees sought as costs incurred in bringing a successful claim for breach of contract.it does not apply to the damages that a successful breach of contract claimant recovers,even if such are attorney fees.here,the jury did not have before it any evidence that the attorney fees incurred by united space in the action were reasonable and necessary.it only had before it proof of the internal approval process involved in authorizing the payment of the attorney fees,and the amount of fees that had actually been paid.because there was no evidence of reasonableness and necessity offered,there was no evidence to support a finding by the jury that such fees were reasonable and necessary,as is required.furthermore,there is no indication from the record that the district court took judicial notice of the reasonableness and necessity of the awarded attorney fees,and we thus conclude that no such judicial notice was taken.therefore,we find that the district court erred in denying ahac judgment as a matter of law motion seeking reversal of the jury award of attorney fees as damages,and remand for a proper determination as
