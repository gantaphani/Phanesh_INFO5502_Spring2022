ngoc tran appeals from an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend and an order granting summary adjudication,which together disposed of all her causes of action against respondents farmers group,truck underwriters association,and fire insurance exchange.a final judgment was entered after the notice of appeal was filed.we shall treat the notice of appeal as filed after the entry of judgment.lee newman,wells fargo bank th,d.
respondents accurately point out that tran briefing is defective in many respects.we ignore tran statement of facts,which is devoid of record references.there are,however,sufficient citations to the record in the body of tran argument to allow us to assess the merits of the appeal we reverse the judgment,and direct the trial court to overrule the demurrer and deny the motion for summary adjudication as to farmers group and truck underwriters association.
background 
farmers insurance exchange,truck insurance exchange,and fire insurance exchange are reciprocal insurers operating within the farmers insurance group.see,jade viguri d.bell farmers ins.exchange th,d.while the record is not entirely clear on this point,farmers group is for at least some of the farmers group exchanges.truck underwriters association is for truck insurance exchange 
tran first and second amended complaints included causes of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing breach of fiduciary duty fraud conspiracy to defraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress.she alleged the following facts all the insurance company defendants share the same general management,accounting system,trademarks,and advertising.on december,farmers insurance group agent david song sold tran a new commercial insurance policy for her grocery store.tran increased her coverage from the level in her original policy from farmers insurance exchange,which was issued in november.she signed a loan agreement for an annual premium of,and paid for the first two months installments.tran did not receive a copy of her policy,and relied on song representations that the substantially increased premiums would provide adequate coverage for her business.on december,tran store was by an arsonist and nearly burned to the ground.three other grocery stores in the neighborhood suffered similar attacks.
tran was unable to get a copy of her policy from defendants after the fire,and the processing of her claim was delayed.on january,defendants produced a truck insurance exchange policy made out to tran,in which they retroactively altered her premium to annually,which reduced tran coverage by over.the fire cost tran over a million dollars in lost business and property damage.by reducing her coverage after the fire,defendants lowered tran coverage to less than half of her actual losses.furthermore,defendants deducted from tran property coverage expenses for asbestos services that were neither authorized nor justified.
farmers group,truck underwriters association,and fire insurance exchange demurred to the cause of action in the first amended complaint for breach of fiduciary duty.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the same defendants moved for summary adjudication of the remaining causes of action in the second amended complaint,contending that because they issued no policies to tran and did not participate in the adjustment or handling of her claim,they could not be held liable.they relied on declarations by employees of truck insurance exchange and farmers insurance exchange to support these factual claims.
tran response to the summary adjudication motion was unintelligible.the court gave her counsel another month to clarify his statement of facts and memorandum of points and authorities.tran amended response was somewhat more focused.she presented a securities and exchange commission sec filing explaining the relationship between farmers group and the three insurance exchange defendants,referred to as the p c group.this filing states that the p c group insurers are owned by their policyholders,not by farmers group.the policyholders appoint farmers group as their exclusive to provide management services.as manager of the p c group,the company selects risks,issues policies,prepares and mails invoices,collects premiums,manages the investment portfolios and performs certain other administrative functions.the insurers of the p c group are responsible for the claims functions,including the settlement and payment of claims and claims adjustment expenses.they are also responsible for the payment of commissions,benefits for agents and district managers,and their respective premium and income taxes.
tran also provided an installment policy payment agreement dated december,showing total premiums of a declarations page from a farmer insurance exchange policy in her name for the period from december,to december,showing limits of for personal property and for lost business income,with a corresponding invoice for a premium of a truck insurance exchange policy with the same number,for the same period,showing limits of for personal property and for lost business income,with a total premium of and another truck insurance exchange policy with the same number,for the same period,showing limits of for personal property and for business income,with an invoice dated april,reflecting a change in coverage but no total premium amount.
tran presented deposition excerpts from various farmers employees.jeffrey abston identified himself as an employee of farmers insurance exchange,but explained that he investigated claims on behalf of both farmers insurance exchange and truck insurance exchange.he investigated tran claim,and concluded she had nothing to do with the arson.abston had signed a letter regarding tran coverage in his capacity as claims representative for truck insurance exchange,although the letter referred to a farmers insurance exchange policy issued to tran in december.abston could only explain this discrepancy by saying he may have made a mistake.
michelle mason was a commercial service representative for farmers insurance group in.she testified that she had reinstated tran account on december,after speaking with agent david song.she authorized song to reinstate the account,and he set it up for a premium of.song normal procedure after receiving a check from an insured would have been to deposit it into a general farmers account,which farmers group would sweep,taking the money and applying it to where it belongs.the underwriting department of farmers insurance group made the decision whether a policy was issued by farmers insurance exchange or truck insurance exchange.
sharon larsen,a commercial service team manager employed by farmers group,testified that she understood neither farmers insurance exchange nor truck insurance exchange had any employees of their own.larsen identified truck underwriters association as the management company for the exchanges,though to her knowledge it also had no employees of its own.employees of farmers group would issue policies on behalf of the exchanges,acting as the exchanges representatives,and following guidelines provided by the exchanges.however,larsen acknowledged that all the guidelines were generated by the home office of farmers group.an analyst or underwriter on larsen team would decide whether to insure a particular person or business,and which exchange would issue the policy.the agent would initially bind the insured to certain policy limits,then the analyst or underwriter would verify that the limits were available and acceptable.both the underwriter and the agent had a responsibility to make sure the policyholder was carrying adequate insurance.
larsen could not explain why her group computer generated policies for tran from both farmers insurance exchange and truck insurance exchange for the same period she had never seen that happen before.she testified that david song was an agent authorized to represent all the farmers insurance companies.
in her points and authorities,tran argued the defendants were so that they all shared liability.she claimed all defendants owed her a fiduciary duty and a duty of good faith and fair dealing.she also relied on the fiduciary duty imposed by insurance code section which provides that funds received by an insurance agent as premium for a policy are held in a fiduciary capacity.
the court granted the summary adjudication motion in its entirety.it ruled that the cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing failed as a matter of law because there was no contract between tran and the moving defendants.the court also found no merit in the fraud,conspiracy to defraud,and intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action,because any acts by farmers group employees were conducted in their capacity as agents for the exchanges.
discussion 
the nature of reciprocal insurers 
before reaching the merits,we briefly review the basic organizational aspects of reciprocal insurers,also known as interinsurance exchanges,which are governed by section et.an interinsurance exchange is an unincorporated business organization made up of subscribers and managed by an.the exchange is the insurer and the subscribers are the insureds.the subscribers execute powers of attorney appointing the to act on their behalf.the executes the exchange insurance contracts,lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d industrial indem.golden state d.
the subscribers may provide for the exercise of their rights by a board composed of subscribers or their agents,lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d.courts which have considered the relationship between a reciprocal insurer board,its and its subscribers have concluded the relationship is analogous to the relationship between the directors,management and participants in other kinds of organizations.for example,at least one court has held that t he position of the of a reciprocal insurance exchange,who manages the business of the exchange under powers of attorney of the subscribers is fiduciary in character to the same extent as that of the management of an incorporated mutual insurance company industrial indem.golden state,supra,d,italics added.another court has observed that a reciprocal insurer basic differences from a mutual insurance company are in mechanics of operation and in legal theory,rather than in substance.cal.state auto.bureau downey d.lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d,italics in original.
the lee court rejected the argument that the fiduciary duties owed to subscribers by the boards and of reciprocal insurers preclude application of the business judgment rule.this rule protects the business decisions of a business owner management from judicial interference.the court noted the business judgment rule has been applied to limited partnerships,corporations,and mutual insurance companies,even though the managements of these forms of business are deemed to be agents and fiduciaries of limited partners,shareholders,and members.lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d.
the demurrer 
respondents prevailed on their demurrer to tran cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.a demurrer admits all properly pleaded material facts.if those facts support a cause of action under any valid theory,the complaint survives the demurrer.holland morse diesel,th,d.we review the sufficiency of the complaint de novo.city of pomona superior court th,d.
tran raises a number of different bases for assigning fiduciary responsibilities to respondents.she claims the california supreme court has recognized the fiduciary duty owed by insurers to their insureds.respondents were not tran insurers,but we address this claim because tran complaint includes allegations sufficient to state a claim that all defendants operated as a single enterprise.see las palmas associates las palmas center associates d,d,discussed in part,infra.respondents correctly note that california courts have refrained from characterizing the relationship as a fiduciary one.
tran relies on dicta in egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d,and frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange cal d.recently,however,our supreme court declared the relationship is not a true fiduciary relationship in the same sense as the relationship between trustee and beneficiary,or attorney and client.citation.it is,rather,a relationship often characterized by unequal bargaining power citation in which the insured must depend on the good faith and performance of the insurer citations.this characteristic has led the courts to impose special and heightened duties,but w hile these special duties are akin to,and often resemble,duties which are also owed by fiduciaries,the duties arise because of the unique nature of the insurance contract,not because the insurer is a fiduciary.citations.vu prudential property casualty ins.cal th,d,italics in original see also croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group et.
we agree with the authorities suggesting that an insurer breach of its duties is adequately redressed by a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the insurance contract.gibson government employees ins.d.love fire ins.exchange d.new plumbing contractors,nationwide mutual ins.th,d croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
tran also cites section,which states all funds received by any person acting as insurance agent,broker,or solicitor as premium on or under any policy of insurance are received and held by that person in his or her fiduciary capacity.any such person who diverts or appropriates those fiduciary funds to his or her own use is guilty of theft and punishable for theft as provided by law.tran complaint includes allegations that respondents farmers group and truck underwriters association,in their capacity as for the exchange defendants,diverted some of her premium funds and issued her coverage in an amount less than she purchased from agent david song.
however,even if we assume that the of a reciprocal insurer qualifies as an insurance agent see,section declares that insurance code provisions regarding the appointment,licensing,qualification and regulation of insurance agents,brokers and solicitors,apply neither to the of a reciprocal or interinsurance exchange,nor to the salaried representatives of such exchange or attorney who receive no commissions,but do apply in the case of any agent,broker or solicitor of any reciprocal or interinsurance exchange who receives any commission.tran contends the receives a commission in the form of a percentage of the exchange gross premiums.we think it is clear the statute contemplates commissions earned as personal income,not the fees charged by a corporate.section precludes the imposition of a fiduciary duty on respondents under section.
tran identifies a third source of fiduciary obligation,however,that withstands scrutiny.farmers group or truck underwriters association,or perhaps both,are her,and as such owe her a fiduciary duty in regard to the insurance contract or contracts they executed on her behalf.delos farmers group,d.delos.in delos,the court noted that both farmers group and farmers insurance exchange had conceded their fiduciary duties by failing to respond to requests for admissions.however,the court also declared that farmers group,as for the plaintiffs,owed them a fiduciary duty in reference to insurance matters involving the exchange.id.at.respondents contend delos is no longer good law.but the arguments and authority marshalled by respondents do not pertain to delos reasoning on farmers group fiduciary duty as.they pertain to the holding on the group liability for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which we discuss in part,infra.
we believe respondents,having chosen to conduct their insurance business through interinsurance exchanges that require the appointment of to execute contracts on behalf of,are bound by the ordinary rule that an is an agent owing a fiduciary duty to the principal.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.agency and employment,delos,supra,d at.
respondents contend their fiduciary duty runs not to individual subscribers,but to the exchange as a collective whole.section,however,clearly states that when the executes contracts,it is acting for the subscribers under powers of attorney.nor does the authority cited by respondents support their position.in lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d,and industrial indem.golden state,supra,d at,the courts held that the of a reciprocal exchange owe fiduciary duties to the subscribers analogous to the duties owed to shareholders by corporate management.respondents claim that the trustee of a trust owes a fiduciary duty to the trust itself but not to the beneficiaries is absurd.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts.the business decisions made by the on behalf of the exchange are protected by the business judgment rule,but this does not absolve them of fiduciary responsibility to individual subscribers.lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d.
respondents are on firmer ground when they argue that assigning fiduciary responsibilities to them would be inconsistent with the rule that the relationship is not a true fiduciary relationship.vu prudential property casualty ins,supra,cal th at,d.there is some tension between this argument and respondents strenuous claim they are not insurers for purposes of liability for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.however,in light of the practical reality that function as the management of reciprocal insurers lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d,we agree with respondents that the fiduciary duties flowing from their status should not be significantly disproportionate to the obligations owed by the management of other kinds of insurance organizations.
appropriate guidelines for the scope of respondents fiduciary duty can be drawn from the law governing powers of attorney and from the law of insurance.the scope of a power of attorney depends on the language of the instrument,which is strictly construed.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,agency and employment.the record in this case does not include the power of attorney executed by tran.however,by statute the instrument must include the authority to execute the insurance contract on tran behalf.tran has alleged that respondents mishandled the execution of her contract by issuing her less coverage than she requested.the evidence developed in the summary adjudication proceedings indicates that respondents issued no fewer than three policies to tran after the fire,with differing terms.clearly,these allegations and potential amended claims directly implicate respondents fiduciary duties regarding the execution of the insurance contract.
whether respondent fiduciary obligations also extend to the adjustment of tran claim is yet to be determined.in delos,supra,the court deemed farmers group a fiduciary for purposes of all the exchange insurance business,because it was convinced that the group exercised all the functions of an insurer,including control over claims processing.d at.here,respondents insist they have nothing to do with the claims functions of the exchanges.for purposes of the demurrer,tran has sufficiently stated a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty in regard to the execution of her policy.respondents fiduciary duty would extend to claims processing only if they assumed some responsibility for tran claim under the power of attorney executed by her.
furthermore,because an fiduciary obligations flow from its legal obligation under section to execute the insurance contract on behalf of the insured,and because the operates as the management of the exchange,we hold that its fiduciary duties can extend no further than the terms of the power of attorney and the contract of insurance.thus,like the management of any other insurer,the is not subject to the strict principles of true fiduciary responsibility.gibson government employees ins,supra,d at.the fiduciary duties arising from its status as for the insured are analogous to the special and heightened duties imposed on an insurer due to the unique nature of the insurance contract.vu prudential property casualty ins,supra,cal th at,d.the scope of an fiduciary responsibilities depends in each case on the terms of the power of attorney and the nature of the functions performed by the on behalf of the insured.
we conclude that the facts stated by tran in her complaint support a cause of action against respondents for breach of the fiduciary duty owed to the insured by the of a reciprocal insurer.the demurrer to the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty must be overruled.
the summary adjudication 
we review the trial court summary adjudication ruling de novo,to determine whether the moving and opposing papers show a triable issue of material fact.stamm theatres,hartford casualty ins.th,d.respondents claimed the undisputed facts established that tran could not prove the elements of her four remaining causes of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,conspiracy to defraud,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.a defendant making such a claim must either present evidence conclusively negating an element of a cause of action,or provide affirmative evidence that the plaintiff lacks any factual support for her claims,such as an admission by the plaintiff that extensive discovery has yielded nothing.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
respondents attempted to negate elements of tran causes of action by showing that they did not issue her an insurance contract,or have any involvement in the making of such a contract or the adjustment of her claim.tran concedes she has no viable claim against fire insurance exchange.however,she disputes respondents factual showing as to farmers group and truck underwriters association,noting that she provided testimony from employees of farmers group showing they were personally involved in the issuance of policies,including tran policy.she also claims that as for the exchanges,these respondents are parties to the insurance policies at issue.
it is clear that under section,the is involved as a matter of law in the execution of insurance contracts by a reciprocal insurer.the insurer can issue contracts only through the agency of the.truck underwriters association has conceded its role as for truck insurance exchange,and the deposition testimony of the various farmers group employees presented by tran supports the statement in farmers group sec filing that it operated as for farmers insurance exchange.tran evidence showed that employees of farmers group were indeed personally involved in the issuance of tran policy or policies.thus,the only undisputed facts respondents managed to establish is that they did not issue insurance policies in their own name to tran,and that tran claim was handled by exchange employees.this is insufficient to show tran could not maintain her tort causes of action other than breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.none of those causes of action depend on respondents status as parties to the contract,and none are affected by respondents role as agents of the exchanges see croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
a more difficult question is presented by tran claim against respondents for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.it is settled that this cause of action lies only against the insurer,and is based on the contractual relationship between insurer and insured.gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,old republic ins.fsr brokerage,th,d croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
tran contends respondents may be held liable for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under delos,supra,d.the delos court held that
