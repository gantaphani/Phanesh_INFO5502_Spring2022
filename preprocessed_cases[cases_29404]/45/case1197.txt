this case illustrates the difficult problems presented by claims for disability insurance by people with serious and painful conditions that do not have objectively measurable symptoms.plaintiff lanette holmstrom worked as a senior training specialist at a large credit management company.she participated in an employee welfare benefit plan administered by defendant metropolitan life insurance company metlife.holmstrom stopped working in january when she developed a painful nerve condition in her right arm.metlife began paying disability benefits under an standard.three surgeries failed to remedy the condition,and holmstrom was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome crps.
after holmstrom benefits expired,she submitted a disability claim under the more stringent definition that applied to benefits.metlife approved that claim in july and began paying benefits.metlife performed a periodic review in.it determined then that holmstrom was no longer disabled and terminated her benefits.after metlife upheld its decision on administrative appeal holmstrom final administrative remedy,holmstrom filed suit in federal court under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.see a b.holmstrom voluntarily dismissed the action when metlife offered a second administrative appeal,which yielded the same result.holmstrom then returned to federal court,filing this second erisa action to recover benefits.metlife counterclaimed to obtain a setoff based on disability insurance benefit payments that holmstrom received from the social security administration.in a careful opinion describing the case as a close one,even under the deferential standard of review,the district court granted summary judgment for metlife on holmstrom claim for benefits and metlife counterclaim.holmstrom metropolitan life ins,d.holmstrom appealed.
we respectfully disagree with the district court.we believe that metlife and in turn the district court gave undue weight to the absence of objective measurements for holmstrom impairment.there is ample corroboration that her pain has been genuinely disabling.we also find that metlife selective use of evidence and its repeated moving of the targets for the evidence of disability show that metlife decision to terminate benefits was arbitrary and capricious.we reverse and order retroactive reinstatement of benefits for holmstrom,subject to the for social security disability insurance benefits she has received.we leave the issues of attorney fees and prejudgment interest to the district court in the first instance.
i.the facts 
we take the facts from the administrative record compiled by metlife in considering holmstrom claim.holmstrom was employed as a senior training specialist at experian information solutions.through this employment,she participated in a group disability insurance plan underwritten and administered by metlife.
in late,holmstrom sought the care of eric lomax to treat pain,numbness,and tingling she experienced in her right upper arm.in january,holmstrom had surgery to remedy a right ulnar nerve compression and neuropathy.the surgery provided little relief,and her symptoms soon worsened.in june,she had another surgery to relieve what was thought to be nerve compression.her symptoms worsened further after this second procedure,prompting her to visit a pain clinic.the clinic doctors diagnosed crps type i,a chronic neurological syndrome characterized by severe pain 
in march,holmstrom underwent a third surgery,which also failed to relieve her symptoms.she saw another pain specialist,weber.according to metlife records,weber made a definitive diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome it was clear to holmstrom and her doctors that surgery could do nothing to help her,leaving medication as her only recourse holmstrom pain medication regimen has included a variety of powerful drugs,including amitriptyline,bextra,clonidine,methadone,ms contin,msir,neurontin,oxycontin,oxycodone,oxyfast,percocet,topamax,and prior to its recall vioxx 
holmstrom symptoms persisted without improvement for the next three years.metlife records from describe a high pain med ication regimen causing side effects such as confusion and memory loss,and pain of such intensity that holmstrom was considering having nerve severed since all other kinds of pain management techniques have failed.the record reveals no improvement through and.ted vant,who has been holmstrom treating physician from to the time of this lawsuit,prescribed significant doses of strong medications in an attempt to manage her symptoms.
in early,metlife approved disability benefits under the plan.after the plan benefits expired,metlife found that holmstrom was still unable to perform her previous job duties,and it approved disability benefits under the plan definition.under the terms of the plan,those benefits expired after months,at which point holmstrom was required to establish that she was unable to perform the duties of any occupation.upon the expiration of her benefits,holmstrom submitted an disability claim.metlife initially denied her claim,but after holmstrom submitted additional medical evidence,metlife reversed its decision and approved benefits in july.
at some point during the claim administration,metlife referred holmstrom to a service that it retained to help beneficiaries apply for social security disability insurance benefits.holmstrom applied for and qualified to receive these benefits under the social security act.
in august,metlife performed a periodic review of holmstrom benefits and decided to terminate payments to her.the letter announcing the termination indicated that thomas,retained by metlife to perform the review,determined that there is no medical information to support the restrictions provided by vant,holmstrom treating physician.the letter added that medical information no longer supports a severity in your impairment preventing you from doing your previous job.the letter told holmstrom that she could appeal the decision by providing office notes,physical exam findings,emg results,mri results,pain management notes,neurology notes,physical therapy notes.
holmstrom appealed and provided to metlife an august functional capacity evaluation fce performed by a physical therapist a june attending physician statement completed by vant vant examination notes from july,to july,the results of an august nuclear bone scan images and the analysis of kenneth sato the results of a may emg nerve conduction test numerical data,graphs,and the analysis of gary klein the social security administration notice of award and letters from three family members.
the august fce was only one page long and included very little testing of holmstrom arm,but it noted that she was unable to support any body weight on hands due to pain vant detailed,statement included the crps diagnosis and concluded that holmstrom suffered from a permanent disability and could perform essentially no hand function.vant examination notes included prescriptions for pain medications such as amitriptyline,clonidine,elavil,hydrocodone,and large dose s of methadone.he noted no real changes,continue d sweating and spasm,and said that holmstrom was still feeling numb.sato bone scan analysis stated that there was normal blood flow to the arm and that no abnormalities of either arm,hand or wrist are seen.klein emg was negative in that it rule d out nerve entrapment syndrome,the malady that holmstrom doctors had thought she suffered from before her surgeries.klein found a minor irregularity in the nerves of her forearm and dysesthesia around the right elbow.he otherwise found her nerves to be absolutely normal and her sensory responses to be within normal limits,and he noted that her power is normal and r eflexes are well preserved.however,regarding her general condition,klein stated that her pain and dysesthesia continue and if anything,are slowly getting worse.the family testimonials described in detail how holmstrom condition affected her everyday life and the lives of those around her,including descriptions of her significant pain,physical deficiencies,and compromised mental function from pain medication.the social security notice of award stated only that the government had concluded that holmstrom was totally disabled under its stringent standards 
metlife denied the appeal,notifying holmstrom in a february letter that summarized the opinion of janet collins,the physician retained by metlife to perform the medical review.collins did not examine holmstrom.metlife letter addressed holmstrom claims of intractable pain,significant physical limitations,and cognitive deficiency as identified by holmstrom and vant.metlife found,however,that the lack of objective findings to support ongoing total disability prevented metlife from determining whether her disability was genuine.metlife stated that the august fce was unreliable based on the emotional component displayed by holmstrom during the exam and her inability or unwillingness to move parts of her body known not to be affected by her pain complaints,specifically her lumbar spine.metlife concluded by stating that it could have reached a different decision on disability if holmstrom had provided another fce in order to more precisely quantify appropriate restrictions and limitations and a battery to assess her neurocognitive status.
holmstrom then filed suit in federal court.the parties voluntarily remanded the case for a third administrative review.in an effort to comply with the requests of the february letter,holmstrom submitted another fce and the results of a battery of cognitive analysis tests called a schubert general ability battery.
this report on the fce was much more detailed than the fce report from.it contained more tests germane to holmstrom specific pain complaints.each test result included detailed numerical data and was specifically interpreted to demonstrate the result significance with regard to holmstrom ability to perform a job in the sedentary exertion category the least demanding,as defined by the department of labor.the new fce concluded that her function was below the sedentary level for most tests involving her hands or arms.to determine endurance and consistency,each test was performed on both days.on the second day,all measured parameters recorded a reduction of about,with increased pain and discomfort,placing holmstrom in the low endurance category.the fce concluded that it could not recommend any path for returning to work given holmstrom significantly low function and endurance.the fce stated that it was conceivable that holmstrom might do a minimum amount of work while using voice recognition software relieving her of the challenges of sitting and typing.if she did so,she could work a maximum of only three hours per day,divided into six sessions of minutes each,and only two to three days per week.the fce tempered this observation even further,stating that this possible form of work would depend,however,to a large extent,on her mental and cognitive status,reflecting her mental ability 
the schubert general ability battery,performed by kent noel,revealed significant cognitive impairment.it found that holmstrom intelligence quotient had diminished from in as established by the same type of testing to in.the results put her in just the fifth percentile among management candidates.noel concluded that these results strongly suggest that holmstrom would experience difficulty focusing,retaining,processing,and making decisions.if considered for a return to the workforce,it would be at the most menial level using her physical skills,if these were suitable.
metlife enlisted robert manolakas and carol walker to consider the new fce and the schubert general ability battery,respectively.manolakas stated that holmstrom had physical limitations but not severe limitations.rejecting the march fce,he stated 
the report did not include the raw data or validity observations so it is unclear on what basis precisely the lack of performance is due to ie,physical incapacity or poor effort for whatever reason.the language suggests poor effort or endurance,but without the entire report or a repeat study this is not able to be determined for sure.
manolakas challenged the diagnosis of crps altogether,stating that it had not been established by the available medical data in the file and the physical exam findings to support it are currently few 
addressing holmstrom cognitive impairments,walker rejected the schubert general ability battery results and noel conclusions 
h e is a not a neuropsychologist,but a clinical psychologist,and does not perform neuropsychological evaluations.noel has apparently based his opinions on a test that is developed to be used for an estimate of intellectual capacity and one that does not have appropriate measures of symptom validity.such a measure will not allow an individual to make inferences regarding the person overall cognitive ability c hanges in individual performances can not be determined to be reliable or valid without specific measures of symptom validity.
walker found that the medical documentation did not support cognitive impairment.
before metlife final decision,holmstrom responded to the quoted reports with letters from vant and noel.vant asserted that no objective tests existed for crps,and he said that he had observed obvious physical deficits upon examination that were fully corroborated in the detailed fce.vant also added more detail about holmstrom right arm range of,how far in each direction she was able move her arm.manolakas responded with an addendum to his report in which he acknowledged that vant latest letter offered data of greater,if not dispositive,significance.he stated that the letter,combined with the evidence already in the record,led him to conclude that more likely than not,the right upper extremity would be limited currently to occasional handling and grasping and fingering,in an eight hour work day,at least.it is up to metlife if they want to consider medical evidence in the letter sufficient to support this restriction of limitation,but i do.manolakas added that an independent physical exam and file review is a higher level of medical evidence especially in a case such as this,and concluded that an independent medical examination with file review would be in order for the next step of claims administration.metlife did not take this recommendation,and no independent examination or review was ever conducted.
noel defended his expertise and credentials specifically,his extensive experience in evaluating cognition for the purposes of workplace function and the ability of the schubert general ability battery to assess accurately holmstrom cognitive deficiencies and their impact on her ability to work.walker responded with an addendum stating while intellectual assessment is often part of the battery of the neuropsychologist,it is not used alone to make a determination of an individual abilities.on october,after receiving these additional reports,metlife again upheld its determination.
left with no further administrative recourse,holmstrom bled this lawsuit.metlife counterclaimed to recover payments it had made that should have been discounted based on the social security benefits that holmstrom had received.in the district court,judge dow wrote a detailed opinion granting summary judgment for metlife on both holmstrom erisa claim and the counterclaim,and holmstrom appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.love national city.welfare benefits plan,cir.judicial review of an erisa administrator benefits determination is de novo unless the plan grants the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch.when the administrator has such discretionary authority,as the vast majority now do,the court applies a more deferential standard,seeking to determine only whether the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.metropolitan life ins.glenn,jenkins price waterhouse long term disability plan,cir.the plan here provided such discretionary authority,so we review under the standard.review under this deferential standard is not a rubber stamp,however,and we will not uphold a termination when there is an absence of reasoning in the record to support it.hackett xerox.disability income plan,cir erisa also requires that specific reasons for denial be communicated to the claimant and that the claimant be afforded an opportunity for full and fair review by the administrator.tate long term disability plan for salaried employees of champion international,cir internal quotations omitted 
an administrator conflict of interest is a key consideration under this deferential standard.in conducting this review,we remain cognizant of the conflict of interest that exists when the administrator has both the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and the obligation to pay benefits when due.jenkins,at,citing glenn.at.in such cases,like the one before us,the conflict of interest is weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.see glenn.at internal quotations omitted 
disability determination 
holmstrom has shown that metlife termination of benefits was arbitrary and capricious for several reasons.she has also raised several arguments that are not persuasive,which we address first.
first,holmstrom places great emphasis on metlife abrupt termination of benefits despite its prior determination that her functional deficits would likely be permanent.holmstrom br.holmstrom asserts that this note made in meant the insurer was obligated to continue paying her for another years,the remainder of the plan.holmstrom br.we reject this argument.erisa does not prohibit a plan administrator from performing a periodic review of a beneficiary disability status.see leger tribune.long term disability benefit plan,cir we are not suggesting that paying benefits operates forever as an estoppel so that an insurer can never change its mind,quoting mcosker paul revere life ins,cir quotation marks omitted.the plan administrator is entitled to seek and consider new information and,in appropriate cases,to change its mind.
second,holmstrom argues that metlife could not properly terminate her benefits without proving that her condition had actually improved.we have rejected this argument before in leger,at,though we ruled that the administrator denial decision in that case was arbitrary for other reasons.one case examiner opinion of permanence,given before the beneficiary underwent another surgery and received a new diagnosis,did not bind the administrator indefinitely.this circuit and the eighth circuit have noted that the previous payment of benefits is just one circumstance,factor,to be considered in the court review process it does not create a presumptive burden for the plan to overcome.see leger,f d at considering the prior determination among other factors to conclude that administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious,citing mcosker,at same.the prior determination does not decide the case.it is merely part of the overall set of facts that we consider.
third,holmstrom argues that glenn gave the unequivocal directive that district courts should consider an administrator adverse judgments in other federal cases as evidence supporting a conflict of interest.holmstrom br.in doing so,holmstrom relies on the portion of glenn that states that a conflict should prove more important perhaps of great importance where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision,including,but not limited to,cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.at,citing john langbein,trust law as regulatory law the scandal and judicial review of benefit denials under erisa,northwestern.holmstrom contends that this passage allows her to use a string of federal decisions reversing metlife administrative denials as evidence that metlife inherent conflict of interest dominates and corrupts its claims determinations.holmstrom misreads this portion of glenn.glenn did not invite a batting average approach,assessing conflict by comparing the number of benefits decisions affirmed and reversed in federal court.the sampling problems with that approach would be daunting.rather,to support the quoted assertion,the glenn court cited a law review article that detailed the long and unfortunate history of the inner workings of the insurance company unum provident,this history was not a list of unfavorable court decisions.it was a detailed,account of systemic flaws and misconduct in the company administrative review process,supported by discovery,investigative journalism,and the accounts of inside whistleblowers.see langbein,supra,at.
metlife is one of the country largest insurance companies.it makes many thousands of administrative benefits decisions every year.it is not surprising that some of its claim decisions have led to litigation and that it has lost some of those cases.surely in others,perhaps many others,it has won and no abuse of discretion was found.holmstrom does not provide that list for comparison.but whether metlife cases were won or lost,abuse of discretion is a inquiry.this court is concerned only with holmstrom claim and the context and circumstances of metlife denial as demonstrated by the administrative record in this case.without evidence of systematic bias like that in the langbein article cited in glenn,the evidence that metlife has been found to have abused its discretion toward a few other plaintiffs bringing other claims in other courts has little value.see gessling group long term disability plan for employees of management company,d.
in addition to these weak arguments,however,holmstrom has shown several other reasons for finding that metlife acted arbitrarily and capriciously in terminating her benefits and then sticking with that decision through the administrative reviews for which holmstrom provided exactly the sort of detailed information that metlife had demanded.
normal test results 
to support its determination,metlife has relied on the results of the nuclear bone scan and emg.metlife suggests that the normal results of these tests undermined the diagnosis of crps and provided further evidence that the fces functional capacity evaluations were not a reliable objective measure of holmstrom functional capacities.metlife br.the record shows beyond reasonable dispute,however,that these tests only sometimes reveal indicia of crps and that severe crps is not inconsistent with normal bone scan or emg findings.metlife cites the crps concise review for clinicians in the medical journal mayo clinic proceedings to support its reliance on the test results.the cited article rejects metlife position 
although no specific diagnostic test is available for crps,several tests can be supportive in making the diagnosis,but the most important role of testing is to help rule out other conditions these tests attempt to identify abnormal sympathetic activity or abnormal limb blood flow,but as mentioned previously,these phenomena are not always present.
richard rho,et,complex regional pain syndrome,mayo clinic proceedings.emphasis added last visited july,
in their analyses of the test results,neither sato nor klein questioned the crps diagnosis or the severity of holmstrom symptoms.sato declined to conclude anything about holmstrom arm.klein only conclusions from the negative result were that it rule d out nerve entrapment syndrome and that her pain and dysesthesia continue and if anything,are slowly getting worse.vant letters to metlife repeatedly explained why these test results were not significant.yet there is no acknowledgment of his assertion or of the specialists actual conclusions in any of metlife physician reports or disability determinations.nor has metlife ever acknowledged the clinically observable indicia of crps that vant included in his examination notes and,spasm,sweating,and temperature of which support a diagnosis of crps according to metlife own sources.contrary to metlife assertion,the bone scan and emg results do not contradict the diagnosis of crps or undermine the validity of the fces 
functional capacity evaluations fces 
subjectively painful conditions like crps and fibromyalgia pose difficult problems for private disability insurance plan administrators and the social security administration,who understandably seek to make decisions based on the most objective evidence available.but we have rejected as arbitrary an administrator requirement that a claimant prove her condition with objective data where no definitive objective test exists for the condition or its severity.see hawkins first union corporation disability plan,cir reversing denial of benefits where administrator determined that there were no objective findings to support restrictions,and noting that pain often can not be detected by laboratory tests and that the amount of pain and fatigue that a particular case produces can not be tested objectively diaz prudential ins.of america,cir claimant pursuit of extensive treatment including heavy medication and repeated surgical procedures supports an inference that his pain,though hard to explain by reference to physical symptoms,was disabling.
at the same time,even in these difficult cases involving conditions where subjective symptoms of pain are not manifest in objective clinical data,we have allowed a plan administrator to require a certain degree of objectivity in terms of the measurement of physical limitations as observed in a functional capacity evaluation.a distinction exists however,between the amount of fatigue or pain an individual experiences,which as hawkins notes is entirely subjective,and how much an individual degree of pain or fatigue limits his functional capabilities,which can be objectively measured.williams aetna life ins,cir.the district court correctly identified this distinction and focused on it.however,the quantity and quality of the functional capacity and other data that holmstrom provided to metlife readily distinguish this case from williams 
like holmstrom,the claimant lee williams suffered from a condition chronic fatigue syndrome that is diagnosed by subjective patient complaints.and like metlife,the administrator in williams aetna rejected the claimant functional capacity data as insufficient.unlike the present case,however,the williams record lacked any specific data reflecting williams functional impairment.williams,at.williams never presented an actual fce or any measurement of specific limitations.he offered only his treating physician unexplained conclusions that he could perform only jobs and could not lift anything over ten pounds.aetna gave this physician a functional capacity questionnaire asking for the results of very specific functional tests,how long williams was able to stand before needing to sit down,which were answered unknown or untested.no specific tests of physical ability or endurance were ever performed.
in this case,holmstrom provided a physician opinion similar to the one in williams,but she also presented two fces,at least one of which from provided exactly the kind of detailed and specific information that the williams court found lacking.at oral argument,metlife urged us to take a critical look at the fces under the williams standard.we have examined them,and we find that the fce provides objective support showing functional limitations amounting to total disability 
the fce report included different detailed tests.six examined arm function,and seven examined hand function.each result included specific weight and time data,and applied that data to the lowest possible occupational exertion category as determined by the department of labor.holmstrom fell short of the requirements of sedentary work in the majority of these tests.the tests were repeated one day later,with all measured parameters recorded at a reduction of about,which suggested consistency of effort and very poor endurance.those results indicated that it was unlikely that holmstrom would be able to sustain even her severely compromised level of function over consecutive workdays,as needed for employment.
despite the thoroughness of this fce,metlife rejected it.metlife was obliged to explain why it found the fce unreliable.see leger,at finding administrator decision arbitrary.metlife offers several explanations,but they lack substance and reflect arbitrary action.
in addressing the fce,manolakas opined and metlife adopted the conclusion that it is unclear on what basis precisely the lack of performance is due to physical incapacity or poor effort.he stated the language suggests poor effort and endurance,but without the entire report or a repeat study this is not able to be determined for sure.in other words,according to manolakas,who was only reviewing the report,there was no way to tell whether holmstrom was faking her poor function.the professionals who conduct fces for the purposes of occupational assessment are aware of this common concern,and they look for disability exaggeration.the fce report makes no observation of any kind that might call holmstrom effort into doubt.metlife ignores the consistency of the fce,with nearly identical reductions in measured performance on the second day across all measured parameters.nothing in this fce or those from and calls holmstrom effort into question 
metlife also challenges the validity of the fce procedures,arguing that a valid fce must include raw data and algorithms for scoring functionality.metlife br.metlife further cites sources that purport to explain how an fce should be done.however,the cited sources in metlife brief are consistent with the methodology used in the fce,and at oral argument metlife counsel was unable to explain how a valid fce would differ from this one.
we look then to the fce,which metlife found satisfactory,and we see no material nothing in the way of raw data or algorithms with the exception of range of motion data,which vant had provided to manolakas satisfaction in a separate letter prior to metlife decision confirming the termination of benefits.when questioned at oral argument about the perceived differences in the and fces,metlife counsel answered that the fce contained five things that the one did not range of motion data,strength tests,reflex tests,sensory tests,and detailed pain descriptions.again,vant provided range of motion data to metlife physician satisfaction.the fce contained strength tests the fce also contained that show no discernable difference in character or detail from the strength tests of.while the fce had no reflex tests,the fce explicitly indicated that holmstrom right elbow reflex was not tested.the fce lacked sensory testing,but her sensory testing results in the fce were normal.finally,there is no appreciable difference in the level of detail between the and pain descriptions.there is no reason to think that an fce performed in under the same standards as the fce would have produced a conclusion any different from the one that holmstrom submitted for her final appeal.
furthermore,metlife never communicated to holmstrom that it would require an fce of the same format and level of detail as the one from.at oral argument,metlife counsel conceded that metlife never communicated to holmstrom these specific criteria for an fce that it later demanded.
metlife has therefore failed to explain its rejection of the conclusions of the fce,and there is an absence of reasoning in the record to support metlife conclusion that the fce does not establish disability.see leger,at,quoting tate,at.
social security determination 
the social security administration determined that holmstrom was completely disabled and awarded disability benefits.as mentioned above,the social security standard for total disability is more stringent than the plan standard for disability at issue here.moreover,it was metlife that insisted that holmstrom apply for social security benefits.as a result,metlife received a benefit from the social security determination that she was disabled,but then failed to consider that determination when it terminated benefits 
this issue was an important factor in the supreme court analysis in glenn.approving the sixth circuit analysis,the glenn court stated 
in particular,the circuit court found questionable the fact that metlife had encouraged glenn to argue to the social security administration that she could do no work,received the bulk of the benefits of her success in doing so and then ignored the agency finding in concluding that glenn could in fact do sedentary work.this course of events was not only an important factor in its own right but also would have justified the court in giving more weight to the conflict because metlife seemingly inconsistent positions were both financially advantageous.
glenn.at citations omitted see also raybourne,at after glenn,the administrator advocacy of a disability finding before the ssa should have been treated as a serious concern for the court to consider internal quotations omitted ladd itt,cir reversing denial of benefits in part because administrator supported claimant efforts to demonstrate total disability to the social security administration,then denied claimant was totally disabled even though her condition had not improved.
an administrator is not forever bound by a social security determination of disability,but an administrator failure to consider the determination in making its own benefit decisions suggests arbitrary decisionmaking.glenn.at.this is especially so when the social security determination was made under a similar or more stringent disability definition,as it was here.in its denial letters,metlife never stated why it disagreed with the social security determination rather,it stated only that black decker disability plan nord,essentially dissolved any relevance of social security determinations in erisa cases.the discussion of social security benefits in glenn directly rejected this flawed interpretation of nord.
medical history 
holmstrom overall objective medical history is also highly relevant.see diaz prudential ins.of america,cir finding medical history that included heavy medication and repeated surgical procedures to be relevant in determining that claimant was disabled.while the significance of a procedure or a prescription can be disputed,the existence of such things when established in the record can not be.holmstrom has undergone three surgeries and continues to endure what is,even by metlife doctors accounts,a heavy regimen of pain medication.metlife claims that the surgeries have resolved her condition,despite the utter lack of support for this conclusion and the wealth of medical opinion including from metlife consultants that surgical options were abandoned because more operations would be futile.metlife speculates that the medication regimen does not support the existence of genuine pain but instead exists only to feed behavior.metlife attorneys and consultants support this conclusion with no evidence and ignore evidence of their own doctor conclusion that her pain is genuine and that she does not suffer from addiction,a conclusion reached by metlife doctor after an examination of holmstrom.
we do not suggest that a social security disability finding,multiple and unsuccessful surgeries for pain relief,and a heavy pain medication regimen will together always compel an award of benefits.but with this evidence in the record,a plan administrator must address it and provide a reasonable explanation for discounting it.see leger,at.in this case,the social security award,the surgeries,and the medication provide strong evidence in support of a finding of continuing disability.metlife explanations for discounting them are not supported by the record,
cognitive impairments 
metlife also acted arbitrarily and capriciously in discounting evidence of holmstrom cognitive impairments resulting from her heavy pain medication.in its denial,metlife stated that holmstrom could substantiate her claim of cognitive impairments with a battery to assess her neurocognitive status.without more specific direction from metlife,holmstrom submitted a schubert general ability battery performed by noel,a with significant experience in evaluating cognition for the purposes of workplace function.the battery of tests replicates tests that holmstrom had done in under controlled conditions,allowing comparisons of her current abilities.noel shared the numerical results of the battery and expressed extreme doubt that holmstrom could resume employment if considered for a return to the workforce,it would be at the most menial level using her physical skills,if these were suitable.metlife reviewing doctor,walker,opined that noel was not the proper professional to conduct cognitive testing because he was not a neuropsychologist,but a clinical psychologist.walker rejected the battery itself because it did not have appropriate measures of symptom validity.although noel responded with a detailed defense of his credentials and the battery,metlife still rejected holmstrom cognitive impairments as insufficiently substantiated.metlife never explained specifically what it meant by battery of neurocognitive testing or symptom validity or why a neuropsychologist was necessary while it deemed noel qualifications and training insufficient,other than the need for the proper level of experience,which noel attested without refutation that he possessed.noel was obviously frustrated by what he saw as walker wrong assumptions about his qualifications and training.
erisa requires plan administrators to provide claimants a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial decision.given the nature of the exchange and the data provided,we find metlife rejection of the cognitive evidence to be arbitrary and capricious,failing to provide a full and fair review.metlife acted within its rights by asking for tests showing holmstrom cognition,but its request was general.metlife provided no guidance as to what testing she should provide,much less how or by whom it should be done.the phrase neurocognitive testing did not give holmstrom fair notice of the additional criteria that metlife later insisted would need to be met before it would give weight to the results.when an administrator asks for additional information in broad terms,it is too easy to find later a reason to deem what it was given to be insufficient.if the administrator believes that a procedure must have certain characteristics,or that it must be performed by a certain kind of professional,it must provide at least some level of guidance,unless the test sought is so that a claimant or her attorney or other representative can reasonably be expected to know what the administrator expects.metlife provided no such guidance here.
also,of course,if a plan administrator requires a test and has detailed expectations for the way it is to be conducted,it may arrange for the testing itself.holmstrom policy,like most such policies,requires her to appear for testing that the administrator arranges.metlife was free to make such a demand,but it did not.having passed on that opportunity and having provided only a broad request for neurocognitive testing,metlife reasons for rejecting noel results reflect arbitrary and capricious that suffers from an absence of reasoning in the record to support it.see hackett,at.
examining physicians 
holmstrom argues that metlife improperly failed to consider the opinion of her treating physician and relied instead on the opinions of metlife doctors who only reviewed records and never examined her.the supreme court has cautioned nothing in erisa suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.nor does the act impose a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician opinion.black decker disability plan nord.however,a plan determination must still have a reasoned basis to survive judicial review,even under the deferential standard of review.administrators may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including opinions of a treating physician.id.at.metlife would be entitled to disagree with vant opinion if there were evidence in the record providing a reasoned basis for doing so.no substantial evidence exists to that effect.
none of the doctors who concluded that holmstrom failed to establish disability ever examined her.every doctor who has actually seen her in the pertinent time period has concluded that she is disabled.an administrator may give weight to doctors who did only a records review,see nord,at,but in this case,the evidence provided by the doctors who examined her in person is so overwhelming that the reliance on doctors who selectively criticized this evidence is part of a larger pattern of arbitrary and capricious.see love national city.welfare benefits plan,cir denial of benefits was arbitrary where neither denial letter explained why the reviewer chose to discredit the evaluations and conclusions of love treating physicians and every doctor that personally examined love concluded that she was unable to work mote aetna life ins,upholding denial decision where treating physicians uniformly concluded that claimant was disabled,but surveillance evidence contradicted those physicians conclusions.
metlife reliance on the opinions of its reviewing doctors here is all the more arbitrary in light of the fact that it ignored the key final recommendation of one of those doctors.after receiving vant range of motion data.manolakas retracted his prior conclusion that disability had not been established.instead,he recommended an independent clinical examination for resolution of the issue.yet metlife ignored this recommendation and instead adopted manolakas original one he retracted after receiving additional information from vant.metlife decision not to order the examination and its failure to explain that decision are further evidence of an arbitrary and capricious decision.
cases involving claims of persistent and serious pain that is difficult to evaluate in objective terms pose great challenges to plan administrators and to courts,and of course to the affected patient.plan administrators and courts are understandably concerned about the possibility of malingering and exaggeration.accordingly,we must note the absence here of any evidence of malingering or behavior.the problems of malingering,drug addiction,and behavior are to professionals who treat painful conditions,and they look for them.metlife internally expressed concern about the possibility of behavior,and it enlisted the aid of mark carlson to evaluate that concern.after examining holmstrom back in,carlson concluded that her chronic pain was genuine and that there was no addiction.metlife never revisited this issue,save for a record review that cited no evidence beyond carlson prior conclusions and the evidence that carlson had already evaluated.the problems of malingering and addiction were not found here,and the subsequent reviewers speculation is not a substitute for evidence.
the moving target 
another sign of metlife arbitrary and capricious is that it repeatedly moved the target.over the course of the administrative appeals,metlife invited additional evidence to establish disability,but when holmstrom provided it,metlife repeatedly found that the new evidence was not sufficient under new standards or expectations that had not been communicated to holmstrom.such conduct frustrates fair claim resolution and is evidence of arbitrary and capricious behavior.see dabertin hcr manor care,cir administrator unfairly imposed new,undisclosed requirements on claimant for severance benefits an erisa benefit can not be a moving target where the plan administrator continues to add conditions precedent to the award of benefits bard boston shipping ass n,cir awarding disability benefits where claimant was faced with a constant shift in what he was required to show,and thus administrator conduct was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to consider the evidence he submitted in an attempt to meet a moving target 
as described above,metlife moved the target regarding both the cognitive testing and functional capacity evaluation.metlife made general requests.holmstrom complied with the requests as a reasonable person would understand them.metlife then rejected the new information for failure to meet new requirements that had not been revealed beforehand.
an even more troubling example of moving the target was metlife decision to discount all medical evidence obtained after the initial termination of benefits on august.since that date,metlife has asked for a significant amount of medical data,some of which could be provided only by conducting new tests.yet in its final october denial,metlife stated its general disregard for holmstrom many submissions because it would instead need additional medical information dating to the time the claim was terminated.in the same denial letter,metlife employed a similar strategy to get around its own consultant determination that holmstrom indeed had disabling physical deficits although manolakas noted that currently holmstrom would be limited to occasional function in an eight hour work day,the time period in review is effective august.in its brief on appeal,metlife emphasized manolakas use of the word currently to express only holmstrom condition as of september,claiming that she had failed to establish that she was disabled as of august.metlife br.as the district court properly pointed out,accepting this argument would mean that metlife initial termination of benefits for lack of supporting evidence could never be successfully appealed if the claimant had not already undergone functional testing that satisfied metlife precise but specifications before the august termination decision.holmstrom metropolitan life ins,d.metlife asked holmstrom to undergo more testing,and rejected the results at least in part because the testing was not done before it made the request.that behavior also reflects arbitrary and capricious.
selective consideration of evidence 
holmstrom has offered sufficient evidence to establish continuing disability under the plan,and metlife has failed to support its contrary conclusions with sound reasoning in the record.see leger,at.holmstrom key fces,vant opinion,the consistent crps diagnoses,the surgeries,the social security disability determination under more stringent disability criteria,the strong pain medication regimen,and the results of the neurocognitive all competent evidence that supports a finding of total disability.
metlife rejection of that evidence has been based on selective readings that are not reasonably consistent with the entire picture.this approach is another hallmark of an arbitrary and capricious decision.see majeski metropolitan life ins,cir holding that denial decision was arbitrary where insurer selectively relied on pieces of evidence to support denial of benefits,while that evidence in context demonstrated disability leger,at denial decision was arbitrary where insurer the statements from her medical history that supported the decision to terminate her benefits,while ignoring a wealth of evidence to support her claim that she was totally disabled see also glenn metropolitan life ins,cir holding denial decision was arbitrary where plan selectively considered evidence to reach decision unsupported by the record as a whole,aff.approving sixth circuit reasoning.
conflict of interest 
as discussed above,a structural conflict of interest is a relevant factor where the administrator has both the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and the obligation to pay those benefits.glenn.at jenkins price waterhouse long term disability plan,cir.a structural conflict is one factor among many that are relevant in the analysis and will act as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced.raybourne cigna life ins.of new york,cir,quoting glenn.at.however,lengthy analysis of any potential conflict of interest at work here is unnecessary,as we do not view this as a close case for judicial review.ample evidence in this record shows arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking.that being said,it is worth commenting on some of the factors present in this case that suggest that a conflict of interest was at work.
glenn and its progeny have identified several indicia that can signal the effects of a conflict of interest.several are present here.first,metlife selective consideration of the evidence not only indicates that its decision was arbitrary as discussed above,but also demonstrates the effects of a conflict of interest.selective consideration of e
