in september,the united states food and drug administration the fda issued an alert advising that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach due to an outbreak of coli that was possibly linked to consumption of bagged fresh spinach.the fda advisory disclosed that there had already been reports of cases of illness and one death.the fda withdrew its advisory two weeks later after the source of the outbreak had been identified.
plaintiff fresh express incorporated fresh express,which markets bagged fresh spinach and other leafy greens,was not the source of the coli outbreak,but it suffered a significant loss of business in the wake of the fda advisory.fresh express sought to recover these losses under its totalrecall insurance policy issued by defendants beazley syndicate at lloyd and qbe insurance europe limited collectively beazley.beazley denied fresh express claim,and fresh express filed a breach of contract action against beazley.fresh express prevailed at trial and recovered the million policy limit.
beazley appeals and claims that,because the trial court erroneously defined the insured event under the policy as the coli outbreak,the court awarded fresh express damages for losses that did not come within the policy coverage for losses that were the direct result of an insured event of accidental contamination.beazley also contends that the trial court alternative theory that fresh express losses arose from accidental contamination is not supported by substantial evidence.fresh express from the trial court denial of its request for prejudgment interest.we agree with beazley that the trial court erred in defining the insured event.we also conclude that the trial court alternative theory lacks substantial evidentiary support.therefore,we reverse the judgment and dismiss fresh express as moot.
factual background 
a.the insurance policy 
beazley issued a totalrecall brand protection policy to fresh express which took effect on august,and expired on september.the policy type was identified as malicious contamination,accidental contamination and products extortion insurance.only the accidental contamination coverage is at issue here.the policy,for which fresh express paid a premium of,had a liability limit for accidental contamination of million per insured event and in the aggregate.
the policy insuring agreement provided that beazley would reimburse fresh express for losses as specified in this policy arising out of insured events incurred by fresh express only where such losses arise because of section two accidental contamination,covering pre recall expenses,recall expenses,customer recall expenses,product rehabilitation,loss of gross profits and increased cost of working and crisis response fees accidental contamination was defined by the policy as error by fresh express in the manufacture,production,processing,preparation,assembly,blending,mixing,compounding,packaging or labelling including instructions for use of any insured products or error by fresh express in the storage or distribution of any insured products whilst in the care or custody of fresh express which causes fresh express to have reasonable cause to believe that the use or consumption of such insured products has led or would lead to i bodily injury,sickness,disease or death of any person s or animal s physically manifesting itself by way of clear,obvious or visible symptoms within days of use or consumption or ii physical damage to or destruction of tangible property other than the insured products themselves.insured event was defined by the policy as malicious contamination,products extortion or accidental contamination.
recall expenses was defined as t hose reasonable,customary and necessary expenses itemised below which are incurred by fresh express and which are devoted exclusively to the purpose of the recall or withdrawal of contaminated product s arising out of an insured event.product rehabilitation was defined as s ales and marketing expenses,including reasonable and customary shelf space and slotting fees,up to an amount forming part of but not exceeding the amount in item of the schedule,necessarily incurred by fresh express in order to meet legal rehabilitation requirements to reasonably the sales level and the market share of those insured product s affected by an insured event to the level reasonably projected,taking into account the reasonable projection had no insured event occurred and all material changes in market conditions of any nature whatsoever,prior to the insured event.
gross profits was defined as loss of gross profit,incurred as a result of an actual and ascertainable reduction in fresh express sales revenue caused solely and directly by an insured event for the period i three months,following discovery of the insured event,or during which fresh express sales revenue remains less than the level that would have been reasonably projected had the insured event not occurred whichever shall be the period first to expire.gross profit shall mean the difference between a fresh express revenue that would have been reasonably projected,but which has been lost solely and directly as a result of an insured event,and b the variable costs that would have been incurred,but which have been saved as a result of not making those sales including the cost of raw materials,and all other saved costs.
the policy provided for a number of exclusions.it excluded a any expenses incurred by fresh express or any loss of gross profit for any reason other than as a direct result of an insured event g any governmental ban of or loss of public confidence in any insured product or any material or substance used in any insured products and i loss or damage directly or indirectly occasioned by the order of any governmental or public or local authority.
b.the september coli outbreak and its aftermath 
coli is a very virulent organism and an extremely dangerous pathogen that causes illness.cattle are the primary source of coli contamination,but the pathogen may also be spread by wild animals and birds.this pathogen can attach to fresh produce,and it can not be removed in processing or washed off by the consumer.therefore,coli contamination poses a serious risk to consumers of fresh leafy greens that are eaten raw.a very small amount of contaminated produce can cause the contamination of a large amount of produce if the contaminated produce is processed in the same processing facility as previously uncontaminated produce.there are many strains of coli.laboratory testing can distinguish between these strains,which can help in tracking an outbreak to a source.
in,fresh express was the largest bagged spinach producer,and dole was the only other producer with a large market share fresh express did not own any farms.it purchased all of its produce.fresh express primary spinach supplier was fresh farms.although fresh farms grew most of its own produce,it also sometimes made spot purchases from other growers.fresh farms followed fresh express good agricultural practices gaps,which were designed to reduce the risk of contamination.
michael osterholm was a epidemiologist who began working as a food safety consultant to fresh express in.fresh express had never been involved in a outbreak,which osterholm attributed to fresh express requirement that its suppliers follow its gaps.while good manufacturing practices gmps at the processing plant can help to reduce the impact of contamination,gmps are inadequate to exclude contaminated produce.gaps are the primary bastion against contamination.osterholm considered it a serious and major error to permit produce to enter the processing plant if the produce was not the subject of a audit,which is part of fresh express gaps,because that may allow contaminated produce to enter the system and spread that contamination.
although fresh farms supplied most of fresh express spinach needs,fresh express occasionally needed more spinach than fresh farms could supply.this situation led to fresh express making spot purchases.fresh express had a company policy regarding spot purchases.there were two types of spot purchases those from fresh express certified suppliers and those from suppliers who were not certified suppliers for fresh express.fresh express certified suppliers were those that fresh express had determined followed its gaps.before a supplier could become a certified supplier,fresh express would perform a food safety audit to ensure that the supplier was following fresh express gaps.fresh express gaps did not permit produce to be grown within a mile of a cattle yard because cattle are the primary source of coli contamination.if a supplier was not one of fresh express certified suppliers,fresh express company policy required that fresh express perform a food safety audit before making a spot purchase from that supplier.a food safety audit is a field visit during which a visual inspection of the field is made to assess possible sources of contamination.if obvious sources of potential contamination were seen during a food safety audit of a field,fresh express company policy was that it would not purchase produce from that field.
between july,and august,fresh express made spot purchases of spinach.some of these purchases violated fresh express company policies in the first week of august,fresh express made several blind spot purchases of spinach from seco packing,which was not one of fresh express certified growers.this spinach had been grown at bloomfield farms.no food safety audit had been conducted at bloomfield farms to assess sources of potential contamination.in the third week of august,fresh express three times purchased spinach from braga farms,one of fresh express certified suppliers,that had been grown on lot at eade ranch fresh express had inspected eade ranch in october and july and determined that certain lots,including lot,at eade ranch were within a mile of a cattle yard.therefore,fresh express had determined that its gaps prohibited purchasing produce grown on those lots these august seco packing and braga farms purchases violated fresh express food safety policies.after august,all of fresh express spinach purchases were from fresh farms,its primary certified supplier.
between september and september,the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc was informed by investigators in two states that they suspected bagged fresh spinach was the source of an coli outbreak.on september,the cdc confirmed that coli infections in multiple states were from the same strain of the pathogen.a number of the infected patients reported having consumed dole bagged baby spinach in the week before becoming ill.
the fda became involved on september,by which time a third state had made a similar report on september,the fda learned that the strain of coli involved in the outbreak appeared to be more virulent than other strains of coli.at that point,there were reported cases,and they continued to appear to be linked to bagged fresh spinach.the outbreak was a nationwide event and involved many more people than one would typically see from a outbreak.the constantly increasing number of cases was quite alarming to the fda.
on september,the fda contacted fresh express and two other spinach processors,told them that the fda would be issuing an advisory,and recommend ed that they take steps to recall.the fda also sent investigators to the processing facilities of these three spinach processors.at that point,the fda had no idea which brands were responsible for the outbreak,so it lacked the authority to do anything more than issue an advisory.
on september,the fda issued a no consumption advisory which advised that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach due to an outbreak of coli that was possibly linked to consumption of bagged fresh spinach.the fda advisory received extreme media coverage and became one of the major news stories in the united states within hours,bagged spinach had been completely removed from grocery stores throughout the united states.the fda had never before issued such a broad advisory regarding a commodity.a advisory was issued because coli could not be removed by washing the spinach.the fda advisory did not prevent producers from legally marketing fresh bagged spinach.the fda did not have the authority to ban the sale of spinach unless it could show that a particular brand or particular lot is adulterated 
most spinach processors responded to the advisory by withdrawing their products from the market that is,they stopped sending spinach to retailers but did not recall the spinach that had already reached retailers.within a few hours of the fda advisory,fresh express decided to stop harvesting,processing,and distributing spinach products due to the fda advisory and the resulting loss of public confidence in spinach products.although the fda advisory said nothing about products,there was also an immediate big consumption drop in all leafy greens.
after the fda issued the advisory,fresh express reviewed its supplier records and discovered that two percent of the spinach it had processed in the prior days had been purchased from growers other than fresh farms and could have been from growers who also supplied dole on september,fresh express wrote to the fda and sought permission to,at the earliest possible time,continue to provide with your blessing fresh spinach products to our customers and consumers.fresh express stated that it had halted all spot purchases from suppliers other than its certified supplier as of august pursuant to its new company policy of using raw products from only its primary suppliers.although fresh express letter to the fda mentioned spot purchases,fresh express did not disclose to the fda any concerns about or even the fact of the braga ranch lot purchases or the seco farms purchases.indeed,the letter did not mention any concerns about the spot purchases,but merely stated that fresh express new policy was to make no spot purchases.the fda did not grant fresh express request.
on september,natural selection foods nsf voluntarily recalled its spinach,which was marketed under the dole label.although the fda had identified nsf as a source of the outbreak,the fda continued to investigate the sources of nsf spinach,as it was possible that other brands had used the same spinach suppliers as nsf.by september,there were cases of infection,and the fda epidemiologist reported that this was a particularly hot strain of coli.
on september and,infected individuals implicated fresh express as a possible source of the spinach they had consumed.this patient identification information was the primary reason that the fda believed at that point that fresh express was implicated in the outbreak.fresh express spinach appeared to be linked to two cases in kentucky.there were these cases in kentucky that looked like they were related to fresh express,and the fda was not going to release fresh express from the advisory until the fda could confirm that they the kentucky cases were not from their product.the fda was also concerned that it had been unable to verify the source of fresh express spinach and assure that the sourcing of the product by fresh express was one of the implicated lots.until we could specifically say they were not involved,they would have been considered to be still suspect.
on september,fresh express performed a super scrub on its plants.on september,the state asked fresh express to recall the specific lots of bagged spinach associated with the kentucky cases.by this point,fresh express had discovered that its spot purchases during the relevant period had included purchases of spinach from braga ranch lot and from seco farms in august that had been done in violation of its company policies fresh express was aware that both braga farms and bloomfield farms had at times supplied dole.although fresh express was concerned that these two suppliers might also have supplied spinach to nsf,it did not inform the fda or the state that fresh express had purchased from these particular suppliers,nor did it investigate whether nsf had purchased from these suppliers during the relevant period because fresh express did not consider this issue important.fresh express saw no need for a recall because the advisory had already resulted in all of the spinach being removed from stores by retailers,and consumers being advised not to eat spinach.had that not occurred,fresh express would have recalled its spinach products due to these spot purchases.i f there had been a fda advisory,we would have done a recall.fresh express believed that a recall would not have been as effective as the fda advisory and would have damaged the company reputation.the specific lots of spinach associated with the kentucky cases had been sourced from fresh farms,and had been processed in georgia,not in california.there was not yet any confirmation that the kentucky bags of spinach were actually contaminated with coli.fresh express rejected the state request that it implement a voluntary recall of those specific lots because it was convinced that the advisory had already succeeded in disposing of the spinach associated with the kentucky cases.
on september,the fda limited the advisory to spinach grown in monterey,san benito,and santa clara counties because all of the suspect produce had been sourced from those three counties.this included all of fresh express spinach.the fda remained concerned about fresh express possible implication in the kentucky cases.the fda position was that the advisory was not going to be lifted for any of the brands until the public health establishment was very,very sure that the product was not contaminated.
fresh express notified beazley on september,that it was making a claim under its totalrecall policy.at that point,the fda was still investigating whether fresh express was linked to the outbreak.the cdc had just received and was still testing two bags of fresh express spinach,which had been submitted by state health officials who considered these bags suspect.the cdc had evidence that implicated nsf as the source of most of the cases,but it had not been able to eliminate other producers.fresh express had contacted the fda and said,we do think that our product is suspect,and we the fda disagreed with them,and told them,yes,in fact,that we were not going to exclude them from the advisory at that time.fresh express position was,because of their practices,they were confident that their product was not involved in the outbreak,but the fda was unconvinced due to the patient reports in the kentucky cases.
nothing had changed as of september.by september,infections were reported in states.around this time,the fda became convinced that the outbreak was narrower than it had first thought.on september,fresh express learned that it had been cleared in the kentucky cases.
by september,the fda had determined the source of the outbreak was a single ranch associated with nsf.on september,the fda announced that all of the spinach implicated in the outbreak had been traced to nsf and that spinach produced by other manufacturers had not been implicated.the paicines ranch was ultimately determined to be the sole source of the outbreak.it was located within a mile of a cattle grazing area.coli was subsequently found at eade ranch on a lot further from the cattle feed lot than lot,but it was not the strain of coli associated with the outbreak.fresh express had not purchased any spinach from paicines ranch or from the eade ranch lot where coli was found.
beazley ultimately denied fresh express claim.
ii.procedural background 
fresh express filed an action against beazley for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.fresh express first amended complaint alleged that fresh express violations of its company policies in making the braga ranch lot and seco farms purchases were errors under the policy which gave fresh express reasonable cause to believe that its products were partially responsible for the coli outbreak.fresh express sought to recover the policy limit of million plus prejudgment interest and attorney fees.
the action was tried to the court.fresh express two damages witnesses testified that fresh express had suffered million in losses between september and december attributed to the coli outbreak,which they assum ed was the insured event.we had no other explanation for the decrease in demand for our product,and the decrease in demand happened immediately after the coli outbreak.they did not distinguish between the coli outbreak and the fda advisory they proceeded on the assumption that the coli outbreak was an event that occurred on september,when the fda issued its advisory.fresh express damages witnesses made no attempt to attribute any of the losses to errors by fresh express or to any event other than the coli outbreak.
fresh express damages witnesses identified eight categories of damages caused by the coli outbreak million in lost profits on spinach million in lost profits on products million for contractual payments million for contractual obligation costs million for customer credit memo costs million for facility centers disposal costs million in rebranding costs and for consultant costs these losses included the impact on both spinach and products.this was done because the coli outbreak caused a substantial decrease in sales and decrease in demand for all of our products,not just our spinach products.
the lost profits were calculated for the period from september,to december,because the policy limited lost profits to a period.fresh express damages expert attributed the total disparity between expected profits and actual profits to the coli outbreak because he saw no other reasonable explanation for the deviation in sales.the contractual payments and contractual payment s categories of damages consisted of the payments that fresh express was contractually required to make to farms for produce and the cost to destroy produce that fresh express did not require due to the decrease in demand caused by the coli outbreak.these two categories included payments associated with both spinach and products.the credit memos category referred to the amounts that fresh express credited its customers with for produce that the customer had been unable to sell the disposal costs category was the cost of disposing of bagged spinach that had been at fresh express regional locations at the time of the coli outbreak or was rejected by the customer.the rebranding costs were the costs fresh express incurred for a marketing campaign to rebuild the brand,customer demand,and consumer confidence after the coli outbreak 
in august,the trial court issued a written ruling finding that fresh express was entitled to recover million from beazley.the court made the following findings in its august ruling.fresh express quick response team qrt assembled immediately upon learning of the outbreak and conducted investigations that determined fresh express had violated its own food safety policies and protocols in acquiring and processing raw product used in its fresh bagged spinach products.because of these errors,the qrt found reasonable cause to believe that fresh express spinach products had led or would lead to its consumers becoming injured.the court concluded that beazley had breached the insurance policy because fresh express had established errors within the meaning of the policy in the form of purchases from seco packing and braga eade ranch in august.s ales of bagged fresh spinach without enforcing fresh express gap good agricultural practices standards through a food safety audit program would create an unacceptable risk of harm to others.fresh express verification of gap compliance through grower audits was an integral and inseparable part of its safe manufacturing practices.the court found that fresh express had reasonable cause to believe that these errors had led or would lead to bodily injury.as to beazley affirmative defenses,the court found inapplicable the exclusion regarding a governmental ban because the fda advisory was not a ban.fresh express losses were not caused by the fda advisory or a loss of public confidence.instead,it appeared that the ultimate cause of the losses suffered by fresh express was the coli outbreak,the insured event in this case.to adopt beazley interpretation of the policy would render the coverage provisions under the policy meaningless.the court found that fresh express had proven that it suffered losses in excess of the policy million cap,that those losses were caused by an insured event,here the coli outbreak,and that those losses are covered by the policy.the court rejected fresh express breach of the implied covenant cause of action and postponed deciding the issue of prejudgment interest.
fresh express subsequently filed a motion seeking prejudgment interest from january,under civil code section,subdivision a or from january,the date the action was filed,under civil code section,subdivision b.
the court subsequently issued a lengthy statement of decision making numerous findings.the court again found that fresh express qrt assembled immediately upon learning of the outbreak and determined that fresh express had violated its own food safety policies and protocols in acquiring and processing raw product used in its bagged fresh spinach products.because of these errors,the qrt found reasonable cause to believe that the consumption of fresh express spinach products had led or would lead to illness or death.the court found that fresh express had made errors within the meaning of the policy.these errors were spot purchasing spinach from seco packing,without conducting the required audit,and then manufacturing,processing,preparing,assembling,blending,and mixing that spinach with other,properly inspected spinach at its processing plant,thereby creating an unacceptable risk of and spinach from lot at braga eade ranch,a lot that had been specifically prohibited by fresh express food safety auditor gary mittel,and allowing this spinach to be mixed and blended with spinach from other sources at fresh express processing facilities thereby allowing possible.the court found that the fresh express qrt had identified the seco purchases as serious errors within a day after the fda advisory.the trial court concluded that the policy does not require a recall for accidental contamination coverage to be triggered.
the court rejected beazley affirmative defense that fresh express had not provided adequate notice to beazley of the nature of its claim because it had not provided a full description of the insured event.the court found the insured event is not an error.t he insured event here was the spinach coli crisis the court also found that,in any event,beazley was not prejudiced by any delay in notifying it of the nature of the insured event.after addressing liability and affirmative defenses,the statement of decision addressed damages.the court found that fresh express damages were directly caused by an insured event,here the coli outbreak 
notwithstanding its express finding that the ultimate cause of fresh express losses was the coli outbreak itself,the trial court alternatively found that,even under beazley interpretation of the policy,fresh express expenses and losses would be covered because fresh express errors prevented fresh express from seeking a full exemption from the fda advisory against eating all bagged spinach,and fresh express errors were particularly serious and would have required a recall but for the fda advisory.
on november,the court entered judgment for fresh express.fresh express recovered damages of million.the court found that fresh express entitlement to prejudgment interest did not begin until the court august ruling.beazley timely filed a notice of appeal.fresh express timely filed a notice of.
iii.discussion 
interpretation of insurance policy 
beazley primary contention on appeal is that the trial court misinterpreted the meaning of the policy when it concluded that the coli outbreak was an insured event under the policy coverage for accidental contamination.beazley does not challenge the trial court factual finding that an insured event of accidental contamination occurred.it contends that the trial court erred because all of the losses established by fresh express at trial were attributed to the coli outbreak,an event that was not covered by the policy,rather than to accidental contamination,the only event that was covered by the policy.

beazley contends that,under the clear and unambiguous language of the policy,insured event was equated with accidental contamination,and accidental contamination was narrowly defined to refer to actual or potential contamination by an e rror committed by fresh express.since the coli outbreak was not attributable to an error by fresh express,beazley argues,the outbreak could not qualify as an insured event under the policy.
fresh express,on the other hand,claims that the policy did not require that the insured event be the result of any e rror by fresh express.fresh express claims that all the policy required was that fresh express errors were sufficiently serious to link it to the coli outbreak.fresh express maintains that the insured event is the product recall or withdrawal that follows from the recognition there is reasonable cause to believe that the insured products have caused or will cause harm if not removed from the market.italics added.in fresh express view,n othing in the policy requires that the products actually cause the outbreak.
the policy language unambiguously rebuts fresh express position.the policy provides that beazley will reimburse fresh express for losses as specified in this policy arising out of insured events incurred by fresh express only where such losses arise because of accidental contamination or another specified insured event.boldface italics added.therefore,the only insured losses are those that arise from,and because of,an insured event.only three insured events are covered by the policy,and the only insured event at issue here is accidental contamination.accidental contamination is defined by the policy as e rror by fresh express in the manufacture,production,processing,preparation,or assembly of any insured products which causes fresh express to have reasonable cause to believe that the use or consumption of such insured products has led or would lead to bodily injury.
since the policy equates insured event and accidental contamination,the policy restricts recoverable losses to those arising out of and because of an error by fresh express which causes fresh express to have reasonable cau
