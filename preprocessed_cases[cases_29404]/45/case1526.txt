from until december,rogers provided medical services to hawaii patients on behalf of islands.on may,an attorney representing rogers sent a demand letter to ems.the letter discussed potential medical malpractice and business tort claims against ems.on march,rogers filed suit against ems in hawaii state court.
the original complaint alleged the following six counts i promissory estoppel as to partnership representations ii negligent intentional misrepresentations as to partnership representations iii promissory estoppel as to tax representations iv negligent intentional misrepresentations as to tax representations v accounting and vi negligent intentional infliction of emotional distress.on august,rogers filed his first amended complaint,which added a medical malpractice claim.each claim was alleged alternatively and each was asserted as a separate,claim.
relevant to this appeal,the complaint alleged that in early summer of,rogers helped kinports retain islands contract to provide emergency services for kona hospital,where rogers was the chairman of the emergency department.kinports represented to rogers that from that point forward rogers was an equal partner in islands operations and would be compensated as such.the complaint stated that rogers partnership status was confirmed on subsequent occasions,including a september,press release that was attached to the complaint as an exhibit.also,in addition to the injuries in the complaint,rogers also alleged that on june,rogers suffered the first of a series of neurologic events known as transient ischemic attacks,or.according to the complaint,rogers condition grew increasingly worse because of the actions and demands of kinports.by january,a number of significant cerebral vascular accidents had left rogers permanently unable to practice medicine,either as an emergency physician or as an administrator.
count vi of rogers first amended complaint,entitled intentional negligent infliction of emotional distress,alleged that ems inflicted pain,suffering,mental and emotional distress,anguish and humiliation on rogers and their conduct and omissions in doing so were either negligent intentional.the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress nied incorporated by reference allegations made in all of the previous paragraphs of the complaint.
on september,ems controller sent an email to aon risk services aon,which was ems insurance broker and the company listed as paul agent in the policy.the email was a to a telephone conversation the controller had approximately a week earlier with an aon representative.during this conversation,the controller requested that the aon representative put ems general liability carrier on notice of the underlying lawsuit.several days after receiving the email,aon notified hartford fire insurance company hartford,but not paul,of ems claim and demand for coverage and a defense.hartford denied coverage in a letter dated march.
on april,the hawaii state court approved a settlement of the underlying lawsuit between ems and rogers.the parties filed a stipulated dismissal of the underlying lawsuit,with prejudice,on june.
once hartford had denied coverage and during settlement negotiations with rogers,ems investigated its right to coverage and a defense from paul.in a letter dated may,ems provided direct notice of the underlying lawsuit to an employee of paul for the first time.paul refused to reimburse ems for any of its losses incurred in defending the underlying lawsuit.on october,ems filed this suit against paul in missouri state court,seeking defense costs and indemnity relating to the underlying lawsuit.paul removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of missouri.
on september,the parties filed for partial summary judgment.the district court granted ems motion,determining that because rogers nied claim was potentially within the policy coverage,paul had a duty to defend ems the court also found that ems notice to aon satisfied the policy notice requirement,but that in any case,paul was not prejudiced by the delay in receiving notice.the parties then filed a joint stipulation as to the amount of reasonable defense costs owed to ems as a result of paul breach of its duty to defend.in entering its judgment,the district court granted ems request for in attorney fees and denied its request for prejudgment interest.
paul appeals,arguing that the district court erred in finding that it had a duty to defend ems under the policy.first,paul contends that the allegations of emotional distress made by rogers in his first amended complaint do not constitute bodily injury as defined by the policy,and that the first amended complaint did not include allegations that any bodily injury rogers suffered was caused by an event.second,paul argues that rogers claims fell within exclusions contained in the policy an employee exclusion and an expected or intended bodily injury exclusion.third,paul argues that the district court erred when it found that ems provided timely notice to paul of the underlying lawsuit and that paul was not prejudiced by the lack of notice.fourth,paul claims that the district court erred by finding that ems was entitled to attorney fees,or in the alternative,that the amount of attorney fees granted was unreasonable.ems the district court denial of its claim for prejudgment interest.we review each of the parties arguments in turn.

iii.analysis 
coverage issues 
paul first argues that the district court erred in holding that rogers nied claim is subject to a duty to defend under the policy.specifically,paul argues that the allegations of emotional distress made by rogers do not constitute bodily injury under the policy and that the complaint does not include allegations that any bodily injury he suffered was caused by an event as required under the policy.we agree with the district court that rogers claim of nied is covered by the policy.
as quoted above,under the policy,bodily injury means any physical harm,including sickness or disease,to the physical health of other persons.it includes any mental anguish,injury,illness,e motional distress,c are,loss of services,or death that results at any time from such physical harm,sickness,or disease.paul argues that the emotional distress rogers suffered is not the result of physical harm,sickness,or disease.instead,paul argues,the emotional distress rogers suffered was the result of the business torts or the medical malpractice alleged in the complaint.we disagree.rogers nied claim is a claim,which incorporates by reference the physical injuries alleged at the beginning of the complaint.ems and the district court interpretation is the only plausible reading of the complaint because physical injury to a person is generally required under hawaii law in order to state a claim for nied.calleon miyagi,see john jane roes,fhp,stating the general rule that,under hawaii law,recovery for nied is permitted only when there is a predicate physical injury to someone.thus,a logical reading of the complaint leaves open the possibility that the emotional distress alleged in count vi was caused by the physical injuries alleged earlier in the complaint.
paul reliance on cim ins.masamitsu,d,is misplaced.the court in cim found that under the policy at issue,any mental injury must arise out of a covered offense,and that the nied claim in that case was asserted as a separate tort.id.at.the court noted that a t best,the mental injury arose from the uncovered fraud,misrepresentation,contract,or promissory estoppel claims.id.here,however,the situation is different.unlike the counterclaim at issue in cim,rogers complaint alleges numerous physical injuries at the beginning of the complaint.again,these injuries are incorporated by reference in count vi,the nied claim,at least leaving open the possibility of coverage under the policy.rogers claim of emotional distress is bodily injury because it is emotional distress that results from physical harm,sickness,or disease.
paul also contends that rogers complaint does not include allegations that any bodily injury he suffered was caused by an event as defined by the policy.we find this argument unpersuasive as well.the policy defines event as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.to be an accident,ems conduct must be unexpected.we do not believe that the expected result of ems conduct was the extensive neurological injuries that rogers suffered.hawaiian ins.and guar.blanco,haw,stating that if the insured did something,and the insured expected result of the act or omission was the injury,then the injury was not caused by an accident,rev on other grounds,dairy.partners,at.rogers pleaded alternative theories and allegations,one of which was negligence.
ems has met its burden of proving a possibility of coverage under the policy.
exclusion issues 
paul also appeals the district court determination that the employee exclusion and the expected or intended bodily injury exclusion do not apply in this case.we agree with the district court that rogers claim does not fit within either exclusion at issue 
the policy excludes bodily injury to an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his or her employment by the insured or performance of duties related to the conduct of the insured business.paul argues that the policy employment exclusion applies because rogers was an employee of ems.paul points to instances in the first amended complaint that refer to kinports as rogers employer and the forms rogers attached to his complaint.paul contends that rogers was treated like an employee,and is therefore an employee for purposes of this exclusion.ems argues that because rogers complaint alleged he was an equal partner with kinports,the employee exclusion does not apply.
the complaint alleges that rogers was hired by ems in september of.on march,rogers became medical director for islands.there is no doubt that rogers was an employee of ems during this time period.the complaint then alleges,however,that in early summer of,kinports told rogers that he was an equal partner with him in the islands operations and that he would be compensated for that to the same extent as kinports.the complaint also alleges that rogers partnership status was thereafter confirmed on various occasions by ems.one of those occasions was a press release,attached to the complaint as an exhibit.
we recognize that the complaint does refer to kinports as rogers employer a number of times,and that rogers filed forms.however,because the complaint alleges that rogers became a partner in,the employee exclusion does not apply in this case.for purposes of determining whether a duty to defend exists,we resolve all doubts in favor of the insured,at.the alleged facts regarding partnership provide the possibility that rogers is a partner therefore,paul has a duty to defend ems.
paul also argues that the underlying lawsuit contains allegations of conduct on the part of ems that resulted in expected or intended bodily injury,which is expressly excluded under th
