michele adkins was involved in an automobile accident in that seriously injured her and her unborn daughter.at the time of the accident,michele husband was employed by a subsidiary of the american electric power company.american electric had three insurance policies then in force that provided for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.the adkinses brought the present action seeking coverage under these policies.exercising its diversity jurisdiction,the district court concluded that the ohio supreme court decision in westfield insurance galatis,ohio,ohio,was controlling,and granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers.
on appeal,the adkinses argue that galatis is void ab initio and therefore not controlling because of an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction and because the decision violated the galatises due process rights.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
in january of,michele adkins was involved in a automobile accident in licking county,ohio.she was seriously fractures to her femur,knee,arm,and face,as well as extensive abdominal a car driven by lori deckard crossed the center line and collided with her car.at the time of the accident,michele was eight months pregnant with lindsay adkins.following the accident,lindsay was born prematurely and now suffers from cerebral palsy,microcephaly,mental retardation,and other related handicaps.the adkinses maintain that lindsay condition is a direct and proximate result of the accident.
michele was not at fault in the collision.she later settled her claims with deckard and deckard insurer in return for a payment,the limit of deckard automobile liability insurance policy.michele and her husband,charles adkins,also had an automobile insurance policy in effect with the penney casualty company at the time of the accident.that policy provided for coverage of up to for uninsured motorists and up to for underinsured motorists.after litigation against penney,wherein the adkinses had alleged that it had acted in bad faith,penney paid the adkinses for the settlement of all claims.
at the time of michele accident,her husband,charles,was employed by a subsidiary of american electric power company.american electric was the named insured on several automobile insurance policies in effect during this time that provided coverage.the primary policy,obtained through the insurance company of north america ina,provided for motorist coverage in the amount of.american electric was also covered by two umbrella insurance policies.the first,with twin city fire insurance company,provided for automobile liability coverage with a limit of million in excess of the ina policy.another,from first state insurance company,also provided for additional coverage in an amount not specified in the record.
procedural background 
in,the ohio supreme court drastically altered ohio insurance law with its decision in liberty mutual fire insurance,ohio,ohio.the court ruled that ohio law permitted the employees of corporate insureds to receive coverage under the provisions of their employers insurance polices even if,at the time of their accidents,the employees were driving their own vehicles and acting outside the scope of their employment.extending this principle in ezawa yasuda fire marine insurance of america,ohio,ohio,the ohio supreme court held that the coverage was also available to the family members of a corporation employees.
relying on the ohio supreme court decisions in and ezawa,the adkinses brought this action in ohio state court in june of,over years after michele accident.the case was removed to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio and was joined with a declaratory judgment action that had been previously filed in federal court by twin city that raised essentially the same issues.all parties filed for summary judgment.while these motions were pending,the ohio supreme court issued its decision in westfield insurance galatis,ohio,ohio.the court in galatis overruled ezawa and limited.after reviewing supplemental briefs from the parties,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers on the basis of galatis,thereby precluding the recovery sought by the adkinses.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,thermoscan,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
b.the district court did not err in concluding that the galatis decision was controlling and in granting summary judgment for the insurers on that basis 
a federal court in ohio exercising its jurisdiction must apply the substantive law as determined by the ohio supreme court.see john hancock fin.servs.old kent bank,cir because jurisdiction in this case is based upon diversity of citizenship between the parties,we apply state law in accordance with the then controlling decision of the highest state court.quotation marks omitted.the district court in the present action concluded,and the parties agree,that this dispute is governed by ohio law.
in westfield insurance galatis,ohio,the ohio supreme court was presented with a fact pattern analogous to the one before us a father and mother sought a recovery on behalf of their dependent child who was killed in an automobile accident,with coverage claimed under the policies previously issued to their employers.expressly overruling its decision in ezawa yasuda fire marine insurance of america,ohio,and limiting its decision in liberty mutual fire insurance,ohio,the court held that a policy of insurance that names a corporation as an insured for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage covers a loss sustained by an employee of the corporation only if the loss occurs within the course and scope of employment and such a policy does not extend insurance coverage to a family member of an employee of the corporation galatis,at.
if galatis is held to be the controlling authority in the present action,then the district court was unquestionably correct in granting summary judgment.see henry wausau bus.ins,cir applying galatis after observing that i n determining questions of ohio state law,the court must follow the controlling decisions of the ohio supreme court.by failing to argue to the contrary in their brief,the adkinses impliedly concede the correctness of this conclusion.they state that t he lynchpin,if not the sole authority for the district court decision herein,is galatis.if galatis is void ab initio,then the district court decision herein is erroneous.
the district court erred in failing to make findings regarding the validity of the galatis decision 
on appeal,the adkinses primary contention is that the galatis decision is not controlling authority because the decision was rendered without subject matter jurisdiction and in violation of the galatises due process rights.they frame this argument as an attempt to collaterally challenge the ohio supreme court decision in galatis.the adkinses insist that their collateral attack in federal court on the galatis decision is permitted through a number of exceptions to the doctrine.this federal jurisdictional doctrine holds that the lower federal courts do not have jurisdiction over challenges to decisions even if those challenges allege that the state court action was unconstitutional.review of those decisions may be had only in the united states supreme court.dist.of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.
this doctrine is inapposite in the present case,however,because does not apply to bar a suit in federal court brought by a party that was not a party in the preceding action in state court.united s
