background 
relevant plan provisions 
this action arose from metlife denial of jones claim for pai benefits under a plan provided by gm and insured by metlife.the parties agree as to which provisions of the plan are relevant to this appeal.first,the parties agree that,through the following provision,gm has expressly reserved and delegated to metlife discretionary authority to interpret the plan and to evaluate claims under the plan 
b administration and amendment 
the corporation,as the program administrator,shall be responsible for the administration of the program.the corporation reserves the right to amend,modify,suspend or terminate the program in whole or in part,at any time by action of its board of directors or other committee or individual expressly authorized by the board to take such action the program administrator expressly reserves the right to construe,interpret and apply the terms of this program.in carrying out its responsibilities under the program,the carrier also shall have discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the program and to determine eligibility for and entitlement to program benefits in accordance with the terms of the program.any interpretation or determination made by the program administrator or the carrier,pursuant to such discretionary authority,shall be given full force and effect,unless it can be shown that the interpretation or determination was arbitrary and capricious.the determination of the corporation or,in the event of an appeal,of the carrier,shall be final and binding on the corporation,the insurance company and the employee or the employee designated beneficiary.
joint appendix at gm plan.the parties also agree that the provision requires that courts give some deference to metlife interpretation of the plan and evaluation of claims under the plan,and therefore,that this court should evaluate metlife denial of benefits under some permutation of the standard.the parties disagree,however,over whether the denial of benefits should be evaluated under a less deferential,standard because metlife was operating under a conflict of interest,as it was both the insurer and an administrator of the plan.
second,the parties agree that jones claim for pai benefits must be determined under the following provision 
i payment of benefits 
if,while insured for personal accident insurance,an employee,spouse or dependent child sustains accidental bodily injuries,and within one year thereafter shall have suffered loss of life or any other loss set forth in subsection e,as a direct result of such bodily injuries independently of all other causes,the carrier shall pay the benefit specified for all such losses 
only one amount,the largest to which the beneficiary is entitled,will be paid for all losses suffered by one covered individual resulting from one accident.
at gm plan.the summary plan description provides 
if you become totally and permanently disabled as a result of an accidental injury while you are an active employee you will be paid the full benefit amount of any personal accident insurance pai you elected in monthly installments of of that amount less any amount paid for losses previously sustained,provided you submit evidence satisfactory to the insurance company.total and permanent disability under pai means the total and permanent inability,as caused by an accidental injury,to engage in regular employment or occupation for remuneration or profit,as based on medical evidence satisfactory to the insurance company.
at gm summ.plan description.the parties agree that jones claim for pai benefits turns upon the definition of the term accident,and that the term accident is not defined in the plan or the summary plan description.the parties disagree,however,over whether the definition proffered by metlife in the course of denying jones claim is arbitrary and capricious.
factual background 
jones worked as an industrial nurse for gm.on february,jones injured her knee at work.on september,jones submitted to metlife a claim form requesting pai benefits.on that form,jones described the circumstances leading to her knee injury as follows bending down and squatting to give first aid to sharp pain in my right knee immediately after i stood from squatting position.at claim form.also on that form,jones indicated that she became disabled on june,and was certified unable to work on may,
on december,metlife wrote to jones informing her that her claim for pai benefits had been denied because jones description of her knee injury does not constitute an accident for purposes of the payment of total and permanent disability benefits under jones personal accident insurance and because jones physician has not indicated that jones is totally and permanently disabled due to her injury.at metlife letter.in its december,letter,metlife stated that it would gladly consider any additional information you wish to submit supporting your claim the additional information will be and metropolitan life will advise you of its findings.at metlife letter.on december and,jones sent to metlife additional documentation supporting her claim,including a doctor receipts that indicate her diagnosis was tear knee medial meniscus,her social security award letter for disability insurance,a claim form for pai benefits that her treating physician,salamon,had completed in more detail,and a statement from jones physician.at jones letter.
on february,metlife wrote to jones again informing her that her claim for pai benefits had been denied because bending down and squatting,is not sudden,unexpected and unforeseen.therefore,it does not constitute an accident for purposes of the payment of total and permanent disability benefits under you r personal accident insurance.at metlife letter.in its february,letter,metlife informed jones that she could appeal this decision and could include in that appeal any additional information that she wish ed to be considered.at metlife letter.
on april,jones wrote to metlife appealing the december,and february,denials of her claim for pai benefits.in her april,letter,jones explained that while in the course of my employment,and in an emergency first aid situation,that while i bent down to a squatting position in order to administer first aid that i hypo extended my knee causing a rip and tear to the medial meniscus and stated that taber cyclopedic medical dictionary defines accident injury as o ccurring suddenly,unexpectedly,inadvertently under unforeseen circumstances.at jones letter emphasis added.jones further stated in her april,letter that she felt that an unexpected tear in the medial meniscus received during the course of performing her job clearly constitutes an accident and that miosha deems her injury an accident.at.in her april,letter,jones also requested that metlife send her a copy of the pai policy and inform her of metlife definitions of the terms accident and total and permanent disability in order to enable jones to provide metlife with appropriate documentation of her injury.
on may,metlife wrote to jones denying her appeal.in its may,letter,metlife stated 
the pai plan itself does not define the word accident or accidental,but applicable federal law does.under applicable federal law,accident means an unforeseen undesigned sudden or unexpected event of an unfortunate character.however,injuries resulting from natural and ordinary activities are not accidental when there are no external forces or events to trigger the injuries.for example,a knee injury from bending squatting does not constitute an accident.
in your case,there was no outside occurrence that caused your injury.in the course of your employment as a registered nurse,you bent down and squatted to give first aid to an employee.consequently,your knee injury was natural and not accidental.while miosha may have deemed your injury to be an accident,a determination by miosha is not binding on the plan.
since we have determined that your injury was not accidental,there was no need to closely examine your medical evidence.
at metlife letter.
procedural background 
on february,jones filed a complaint in the district court seeking judicial review of metlife denial of her claim for pai benefits.the parties each filed motions for judgment.the district court granted metlife motion for judgment on the administrative record and denied jones dispositive motion.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a b and e,as jones sought to recover benefits allegedly due under the terms of an erisa plan.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to,as jones filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the parties agree that when there is no evidence of a conflict of interest,both the district court and this court review de novo an administrator denial of benefits pursuant to an erisa plan,unless the plan clearly grants to the administrator discretion to construe the terms of the plan or to make benefit determinations.wilkins baptist healthcare,cir citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d.the parties also agree that if a plan expressly grants to the administrator such discretion,and there is no evidence of a conflict of interest,both the district court and this court must review the administrator denial of benefits under the highly deferential standard of review.moos square d,cir.moreover,the parties agree that when reviewing an administrator denial of benefits pursuant to an erisa plan,both the district court and this court may typically review only evidence contained in the administrative record.wilkins,at.
jones first asserts on appeal that the district court erred by reviewing under the standard the denial of her claim for pai benefits,arguing that metlife had a conflict of interest due to its status as both the insurer and an administrator of the plan.in response,metlife argues that jones has not preserved her argument that the district court should have modified the standard,as jones conceded in the district court that the standard applies and failed to raise in the district court metlife alleged conflict of interest.
we conclude that jones failed to preserve her argument that the district court should have reviewed under a standard metlife denial her claim for pai benefits jones conceded below that the denial of her claim for pai benefits should be evaluated under the standard and did not assert below that this standard should be modified due to metlife alleged conflict of interest.in her dispositive motion below,jones stated,jones concedes that the case at bar should be reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard when it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome,that outcome is not arbitrary and capricious in other words,if the decision is rational in light of the plan provisions it should be upheld.at pl dispositive mot.internal citations omitted.additionally,in her response to metlife motion for judgment on the administrative record,jones stated,jones admits that under the gm plan,discretionary authority has been retained by metlife and that the standard of review is pursuant to an arbitrary and capricious standard.at pl resp.therefore,we will evaluate under the deferential standard of review metlife denial of jones claim for pai benefits.
it is true that,r eview under the arbitrary and capricious standard is extremely deferential and has been described as the least demanding form of judicial review.mcdonald life ins,cir.under this deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,we will uphold a benefit determination if it is rational in light of the plan provisions.hosps.of cleveland emerson,cir quoting yeager reliance standard life ins,cir.the standard,however,does not require us merely to rubber stamp the administrator decision.mcdonald,at.under the standard,both the district court and this court must exercise review powers.id.
definition of accident 
jones next argues on appeal that the district court erred by concluding that metlife definition of the term accident is not arbitrary or capricious.jones asserts that the district court should have applied the definition of accident promulgated by the first circuit in wickman,which merely requires the claimant to demonstrate that the injury was neither subjectively expected nor objectively foreseeable.in response,metlife argues that the district court properly held that metlife definition of the term accident is not arbitrary or capricious.metlife asserts that wickman is distinguishable,in that there the insured injuries resulted from an occurrence outside the usual course of events.appellee br.at.metlife argues that several federal cases decided under the standard have upheld administrators interpretation of accident as requiring unusual activity or an external force or event.
at the outset,we note that because the plan expressly granted to metlife authority to interpret the plan,we must give deference to metlife interpretation of ambiguous and general terms of the plan.see admin.comm.of the sea ray employees stock ownership profit sharing plan robinson,cir,cert.denied,d moos,at.discretion to interpret a plan,however,does not include the authority to add eligibility requirements to the plan.see.hosps.of cleveland,at we conclude that metlife acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it interpreted the term accident in a manner that adds requirements not found in the plan documents or supported by federal common law.
the plan documents do not define the term accident.specifically,the plan documents do not require that an insured be engaged in unusual activity or meet with an external force or event in order for her injury to be considered an accident.metlife could have expressly included such a requirement.indeed,many of the insurance policies discussed in the cases cited by the parties did contain such a requirement.because the policy at issue in this case did not include an unusual activity or external force or event requirement,metlife attempts to rely upon federal common law to supply this requirement.
as evidenced by the cases cited in the parties briefs,the definition of the term accident has been heavily litigated throughout history.the cases cited by jones are of two varieties those in which the insured had engaged in risky behavior and the question being reviewed was whether the resulting injury was accidental and those in which an event had triggered an injury and the question being reviewed was whether a preexisting condition prevented the injury from being considered accidental in the cases cited by metlife,the proximate cause of the injury was not obvious and the requirement that the insured have been engaged in unusual activity or that there have been some external force is intended to ensure that the injury resulted from an accident,rathe
