the old line life insurance company of america appeals from an order granting the petition to establish the fact of death of its insured,barry starr,filed by respondents linda michelson starr,starr former wife,and his sons,adam and jeffrey,and appointing respondents personal representatives for starr estate.probate code section hereafter provides that a person who has not been seen or heard from for a continuous period of five years by those who are likely to have seen or heard from that person,and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained,after diligent search or inquiry,is presumed to be dead.the person death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence to establish that death occurred earlier.the court applied this presumption of death in starr case,and found that he died on june,five years after he disappeared.the court erred in applying the presumption because there was a satisfactory explanation for starr absence other than his death.we therefore reverse.
background 
starr was an engineer,educated at the massachusetts institute of technology and the university of california,who manufactured methamphetamine in the garage of the orinda home where he lived with respondents.starr and his wife,respondent michelson,were arrested in may,and criminal charges were pending against them when starr disappeared in june.according to the federal complaint for forfeiture of the residence,the drug operation conducted by starr and his partner edward null grossed approximately from to.starr faced federal charges that carried minimum sentences of to years in prison.
in march,starr was arraigned in federal court and released pending trial,subject to electronic monitoring at the orinda home.a hearing was set for june,for starr to post security for bail in the federal case.one week before this hearing,on the morning of june,starr broke free of his monitoring bracelet and left the house.michelson and jeffrey,who was six years old at the time,were asleep when starr left.adam,then age ten,recalled waking up early for school,seeing the family car drive away,and finding a note from starr,which he gave to michelson.the letter read,dear linda,i am very depressed about the way our cases are going.i need some time to be alone to think things through.please take adam to school this morning.love,barry.starr car was found at the oakland airport,and no one in his family ever saw or heard from him again.
on the day he left,starr sent letters to respondents and to his parents.in his letter to michelson,starr wrote 
i have not only ruined my life,but i have ruined your life and the children lives as well.i can never forgive myself for the harm i have done to you and the children.for all the pain i have caused you i deserve to die.in dishonoring you i have dishonored myself,and the only honorable solution is to kill myself.
not only do i suffer from the pain of what i have done to you,i suffer from the pain of what they are going to do to imprisonment.
i have been trying so hard to live with this pain since we were arrested,but now that we are getting close to sentencing i just ca bear it any longer.i want to end this pain right now,and i can punish myself for what i have done to you at the same time,by killing myself.it all very neat except that i do want to cause the children more pain by their experiencing my death.that is why i can not kill myself at home or even anywhere where they might find out about it.
that is why i am going away to find a place to die,i do even know where.tell the children i escaped and i am living happily ever after.i think they would like that.tell them i love them.do show them this letter 
the letter concluded with directions to a will starr had left in his nightstand,and to the car at the airport.
starr wrote jeffrey 
my lawyer stan tells me that they will put me in prison for a very very long time,and he can not stop them.they will put me in prison so long that you jeffrey will be a man before i get out.
that is why i have chosen to flee.i will escape from the police before they come to get me,just as moses fled from egypt to escape from pharoah sic.but i can never return home again.
he wrote adam 
i have chosen to flee into exile,just as moses did to escape the pharoah sic even as the jews fled nazi germany to escape the concentration camps.i want to take you with me,but it would be fair to you.i must make this journey alone.
i ca tell you where i am going because i do even know myself.i will try to find a way to be safe from the fbi and the police.the worst part is that i can never never return home again.
in his letter to his parents,starr indicated that his case was going badly,that he would not be eligible for parole for to years even if he pled guilty,and that he considered that prospect unacceptable.he continued 
that is why i have decided to flee.this means i can never visit your home or my home or bob or helaine his brother and sister home again.but if i stay and submit to prison,well,who knows who will be well or alive in to years.
this was not an easy decision for me.abandoning my wife and children is the very last thing i would willingly do.but if i do go now the government will make me abandon them in about three months anyway.
the good news is that the money you put up for bail is safe.for the past two months i have been wearing an electronic monitor in lieu of bail.since the state charges were dropped in march,strasser has been holding the collateral in preparation for a new federal bail bond,which was never put in place.it was to be posted next week,which is why i am leaving now.i suggest you call him now and get your money back.thank you for helping bail me out of jail.i had a wonderful months with my family.
michelson testified that when starr disappeared he left behind the inhalers and medications he used to control his severe asthma.she said that he always carried pills and an inhaler for the condition,and had feared having an asthma attack during his time in jail after his arrest when he did not have his medication.starr did not take a suitcase when he left,or any clothing other than what he wore.he took his wallet and keys,but did not take his watch or any family photos.michelson did not know how much money starr had with him when he left,but all of the money in the home had been seized when they were arrested,and he did not write checks or withdraw money from their bank accounts after he left.he left some credit cards behind,and did not charge anything on their cards after he left.his passport had been confiscated when he was arrested,and had not been returned before he left.
michelson testified that starr was despondent over his criminal case,was seeing a therapist for anxiety and depression,and had talked about committing suicide before he disappeared.she described him as fairly confused,but overall depressed,anxious and very sad and remorseful,and said that he began talking more frequently about suicide as the june federal court hearing approached.he was frightened of prison,and worried about the children.he was not eating well and was losing weight.when he once proposed that the family flee together,michelson dismissed the suggestion,in part because one of their two young boys,jeffrey,had cerebral palsy.starr never talked about fleeing alone.
starr and michelson had been married for almost years before he disappeared.she said that they had a close and loving relationship,and were caring and supportive parents.adam and jeffrey testified that they had been close to their father.adam recalled times when starr asthma had interfered with their activities.michelson and adam testified to their belief that starr was dead.michelson thought that if starr were alive he would have attempted to contact her,his parents,or his children to see how they were doing.michelson did not think that starr had spoken of suicide to discourage people from looking for him.adam conceded that starr could not contact him without risking imprisonment.
michelson testified that marshals had been to her home several times in the years after starr disappeared,and had visited the homes of starr paren
