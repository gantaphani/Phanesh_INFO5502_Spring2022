after it was sued for breach of contract and negligence by the regents of the university of california regents,stop loss insurance brokers,stop loss filed a for comparative indemnity against brown toland medical group btmg.following two rounds of amendments,the trial court sustained a demurrer to the without leave to amend.we affirm the judgment.
background 
as operator of the university of california at san francisco medical center ucsf medical center,the regents participated in a capitated health care program,through which they contracted with various health care plans to provide services for patients in exchange for fixed,or capitated,payments.such payments were made to the regents through btmg,and ucsf medical center was a designated hospital provider for btmg plan members.hospitals participating in this capitated health care program were required to carry insurance coverage for charges exceeding a fixed amount.in march,the regents sought bids from insurance brokers to obtain the necessary insurance coverage.shortly thereafter,the regents retained stop loss and instructed it to procure a million insurance policy.
under the policy stop loss procured,the regents were required to notify the insurer of any potential and actual claims exceeding percent of the policy deductible.btmg and stop loss worked together to provide this information to the insurer on a monthly basis.every month,btmg analyzed the regents claims to identify the ones that required notice to the insurer.btmg sent this information to stop loss,and stop loss prepared the necessary claims forms.stop loss then sent the forms to btmg for approval,and,once approved,btmg forwarded the forms to the insurer for payment.
in,a new insurance policy stop loss had procured expressly precluded coverage for any preexisting claim not disclosed by the regents.the regents signed a binder that purported to disclose all reportable claims,but unbeknownst to them the binder did not include a disclosure of the claim made by a btmg plan member who had been repeatedly hospitalized for renal failure.when this patient claim was submitted to the insurer for payment later in,it was denied.
on october,the regents filed a complaint against stop loss for breach of contract and negligence.the regents alleged btmg had submitted timely information to stop loss about the patient renal failure claim but stop loss failed to prepare the form for reporting it in a timely fashion.as a result,the complaint claimed stop loss breached its contractual agreement with the regents and also breached its professional duty of care as the regents insurance broker,causing the regents to suffer a loss of over million in unreimbursed expenses for the claim.
stop loss answered the complaint and filed a against btmg.after the trial court sustained a demurrer to this pleading,stop loss filed a second amended against btmg for comparative equitable indemnity and declaratory relief.in it,stop loss described the procedure it had established with btmg to report claims to the regents insurer,though it noted this system was not established pursuant to a contract.because btmg knew its failure to analyze claims properly and submit information to stop loss in a timely fashion could result in the denial of insurance coverage for such claims,the alleged btmg owed a duty to the regents to analyze claims properly,provide claims information to stop loss timely,and submit claim forms to the reinsurer timely.stop loss alleged btmg breached this duty to the regents because it did not make stop loss aware of the subject claim until well after the regents had signed the disclosure form for the new insurance policy.as a result,the claimed btmg was obligated to partially or fully indemnify stop loss for any damages it might be compelled to pay to the regents.the trial court sustained a demurrer to stop loss second amended without leave to amend,noting the fail ed to state sufficient facts to give rise to a duty owed by btmg to the regents sounding in tort.this appeal followed.
discussion 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.
it is in california that equitable indemnity is only available among tortfeasors who are jointly and severally liable for the plaintiff injury.leko cornerstone.inspection service th,d munoz davis d.with limited exception,there must be some basis for tort liability against the proposed indemnitor.munoz davis,supra,d at.generally,it is based on a duty owed to the underlying plaintiff citations,although vicarious liability citation and strict liability citation also may sustain application of equitable indemnity.in addition,implied contractual indemnity between the indemnitor and the indemnitee can provide a basis for equitable indemnity.citation.bfgc architects planners,construction,th,d.
the here does not allege vicarious or strict liability,nor an implied contractual obligation for btmg to indemnify stop loss.rather,after describing the process by which btmg and stop loss analyzed claims and gave notice to the insurer,and alleging btmg understood the consequences that could result from the failure to disclose a qualifying claim to the insurer,the simply asserts btmg owed a duty to plaintiff the regents to analyze claims properly,provide claims information to stop loss timely,and submit claims forms to the reinsurer timely.asserting this legal conclusion does not make it so,however.the question is whether,with respect to the claims analysis,btmg owed the regents a duty of care sounding in tort.while the alleges that btmg assumed and understood its duties under the parties system for disclosing claims,this obligation could only have arisen out of the business relationship between btmg and the regents.the law imposes no duty on strangers to promptly process another data that is comparable to the duty imposed on all persons to exercise due care to avoid injuring others.see,quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,with rare exceptions,a business entity has no duty to prevent financial loss to others with whom it deals directly.at most,if btmg assumed a duty to process claims in a timely fashion,and the regents relied on btmg to do so,btmg performance was undertaken pursuant to an implied contract.
a person may not ordinarily recover in tort for the breach of duties that merely restate contractual obligations.instead,c ourts will generally enforce the breach of a contractual promise through contract law,except when the actions that constitute the breach violate a social policy that merits the imposition of tort remedies.citation.aas superior court cal th,d,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in rosen state farm general ins.cal th,d.despite the use of negligence terminology,the alleged misconduct by btmg describes,at most,a breach of contract,not a breach of a legal duty of care.in short,this is an improper attempt to recast a breach of contract cause of action as a tort claim.nor is there any social policy that would demand resort to tort remedies.without any action sounding in tort,there is no basis for a finding of potential joint and several liability on the part of cross defendant btmg,thereby precluding a claim for equitable indemnity.bfgc architects planners,construction,supra,th at,d.
nevertheless,stop loss argues a duty of care on the part of btmg can be inferred from the factors outlined in biakanja irving cal d,biakanja,and applied in gregory cal d.these cases are distinguishable,however,and they do not support extending a tort duty to business parties dealings.in biakanja,the defendant was a notary who owed a professional and a contractual duty to the client for whom he drafted a will see biakanja,supra,cal d at,in,the defendant was a general contractor who owed a contractual duty to the owner of premises it was working to improve.see,supra,cal d at.in both cases,the question was whether the defendant duty of care could be extended to a third party who was not in,the intended beneficiary of a will biakanja,supra,cal d at,or the lessee of premises that were being improved,supra,cal d at.the supreme court held that whether a defendant owes a duty of care to third parties in such a situation depends upon a balancing of six factors the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct and the policy of preventing future harm.citation,supra,cal d at,see biakanja,supra,cal d at.
contrary to stop loss assumption,courts have not applied the biakanja factors to create broad tort duties in business dealings whenever it is convenient to resort to the law of negligence.biakanja and address the specific situation that arises when the defendant was acting pursuant to a contract,and the defendant negligent performance of the contract injures a third party.neither of these prerequisites is met in this case.first,the alleges btmg handling of the regents claims was not undertaken pursuant to a contract.second,and more importantly,even if one concludes btmg was acting pursuant to an implied contract with the regents,the does not allege btmg injured any third party.rather,stop loss claims btmg negligent claims handling injured the regents by causing it to lose insurance coverage as noted,the regents may not recover in tort for btmg breach of a contractual obligation.see aas superior court,supra,cal th at,d.invoking the biakanja factors to create a tort duty in the absence of injury to a third party would circumvent this rule and blur the law distinction between contract and tort remedies.stop loss has cited no case holding a business entity owes a tort duty of care to prevent another business from suffering purely financial losses,and we decline to announce such a duty here.
likewise,very little precedent supports our concurring colleague theory that equitable indemnity may be had based upon breach of an implied tort duty arising from negligent performance of an implied contract.conc,post,at,in north american chemical superior court th,d,the court of appeal described the common law duty contracting parties have to perform with reasonable care,skill,expedience and faithfulness,and stated that the same wrongful act may constitute both a breach of contract and an invasion of an interest protected by the law of torts.citation.after quoting this statement from north american chemical,the supreme court in erlich menezes qualified it by noting that conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law.citation.an omission to perform a contract obligation is never a tort,unless that omission is also an omission of a legal duty.citation.erlich menezes cal th,d,italics added.the high court proceeded to the central question,is the mere negligent breach of a contract sufficient and responded with an unequivocal no.id.at,d.the court explained that the remedy for a breach of contract is generally limited to contract law,and recovery in tort is not permitted unless t he breach is accompanied by a traditional common law tort,such as fraud or conversion the means used to breach the contract are tortious,involving deceit or undue coercion or one party intentionally breaches the contract intending or knowing that such a breach will cause severe,unmitigable harm in the form of mental anguish,personal hardship,or substantial consequential damages.citation.id.at,d.
even though no implied contract was pleaded in the,nor the breach of any duty of care arising from such an implied contract,and even though the supreme court has expressly held that the negligent breach of such a duty does not give rise to tort damages,the concurring opinion argues breach of the common law duty discussed in north american chemical can support a claim for equitable indemnity.the concurrence cites no authority for this position,but merely asserts that the policy reasons courts have resisted expanded tort liability do not apply in the context of equitable indemnity.while that may be true,it is hard to see why a tortfeasor should receive the windfall of an equitable when the law precludes the injured party from recovering tort damages for the same wrongful conduct.why should the law favor the wrongdoer with a more advantageous measure of damages we decline to apply an inconsistent a breach of contract into a tort for some purposes but not authority for doing so.if every negligent breach of a contract gives rise to tort damages the limitation would be meaningless,as would the statutory distinction between tort and contract remedies.erlich menezes,supra,cal th at,d.because negligent performance of a contract gives rise to contract damages only id.at,d,such alleged negligence will not support a claim for equitable indemnity.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.respondent shall recover its costs on appeal.
although i concur in the judgment for the limited reason explained in section ii,post,i believe that the issues presented by the pleadings in this case present an opportunity for reconsideration of some basic principles concerning the law of equitable indemnity.if two parties breach separate contracts with a third party,jointly causing indivisible damage to the third party,and the injured party seeks recovery from only one of the two defaulting parties,is there any good reason for which that party should not be entitled to equitable indemnity from the second defaulting party if two parties jointly cause harm to a third party,one by an act of negligence and the other by negligently breaching a contractual obligation,and the injured party seeks recovery from only the former,is there any good reason for which that party should not be entitled to equitable indemnity from the latter although the decision of the trial court and the majority precluding indemnity in such situations rests on what appears to be law,i believe that closer analysis of the underlying principles calls for a different conclusion.
factual and procedural history 
in october,the regents of the university of california the regents,as operator of the university of california at san francisco medical center ucsf medical center filed a complaint against stop loss insurance brokers,stop loss alleging causes of action for breach of contract and negligence.the complaint alleges in relevant part that in,the regents participated in a capitated health care program.the regents contracted with various health care plans to provide services to plan enrollees in exchange for fixed or capitated payments.at all relevant times,such capitated payments to the regents were made through brown toland medical group btmg and,as such,the ucsf medical center was deemed the hospital provider facility for btmg plan members.btmg managed premium payments and recoveries for the regents.as a condition of participating in a capitated health care program,the regents were required to carry insurance covering charges in excess of a fixed amount that the hospitals would be responsible for under the capitated program.the regents retained stop loss as its broker to procure the necessary insurance.stop loss represented that it would be responsible for securing insurance for the regents,which included gathering the information necessary for the insurance application and processing the insurance application.stop loss also would gather all claims information for hospital patients from btmg and submit the information directly to the regents reinsurer.emphasis in original.
i n,the complaint continues,stop loss assumed all responsibility for claims submissions.stop loss did so by first meeting with btmg and the regents officials and advocating a new program that allowed stop loss to take over all steps involved in the claim submission process from data analysis to appeal.the regents agreed and in,btmg provided stop loss with monthly electronic data of those claims that might require notice to the reinsurer.stop loss would review the electronic data,revise the information and decide what claims needed to be sent to the reinsurer.stop loss would then complete a hospital excess managed care claim form,send it to btmg for pro forma approval,btmg would send the form back to stop loss and then stop loss would forward the form to the reinsurer for payment.the reinsurance policy required the regents to notify the insurer of any potential or actual claims exceeding percent of the regents deductible.the regents complaint alleges that btmg timely submitted information regarding the claim in question to stop loss through its monthly electronic data information and that the regents suffered damages in excess of million when its insurer denied a claim because stop loss failed to submit the claim to the insurer in a timely manner 
stop loss filed an answer denying the allegations and also a against btmg for comparative equitable indemnity and declaratory relief.the was amended twice in response to demurrers filed by btmg.as amended,stop loss cause of action for comparative indemnity alleges that any damage sustained by the regents as a result of the failure to timely notify the insurer of the potential claim was caused entirely or partially by btmg and that,as a result,btmg is obligated to partially or fully indemnify stop loss for any sums that stop loss may be compelled to pay the regents as damages.the alleges that i n order to provide the requisite notice of such claims to the reinsurer,the regents,btmg,and stop loss established a system under which information was exchanged among them the system.although the system was not established pursuant to a contract,the regents,btmg and stop loss each assumed and understood its duties under the system.within the system,the regents provided claims information to btmg.btmg used that information to determine whether a claim required notice to the reinsurer.btmg then notified stop loss of its determinations and provided claims information to stop loss.the regents relied on btmg to properly analyze the patients claims and to report timely claims of which notice to the reinsurer was required.after it received the information from btmg,stop loss input the information into certain forms.after it prepared the forms,stop loss sent the forms to btmg for approval.once btmg approved the forms prepared by stop loss,btmg sent the forms to the reinsurer.receipt of the forms by the reinsurer constituted notice to the reinsurer of potential or actual patient claims reflected in the forms which exceed or might exceed of the regents deductible btmg knew that if it did not analyze claims properly,provide claims information to stop loss timely,and submit claims forms to the reinsurer timely,a required claim might not be disclosed to the reinsurer within the time permitted btmg owed a duty to the regents to analyze claims properly,provide claims information to stop loss timely and submit claims forms to the reinsurer timely.
according to stop loss pleading,btmg did not notify it of the claim in question until august,well after the claim was required to be disclosed.btmg failure to report the claim in question constituted a breach of its duty to the regents.stop loss further alleged,on information and belief,that if the regents suffered any damage as a result of the failure to timely submit a claim to the reinsurer,such a failure is the result of btmg acts or failures to act,and not of any act or failure to act of stop loss.btmg owed a duty of care to the regents to analyze its patients claims properly,to report claims information to stop loss timely,and to submit claims forms to the reinsurer timely.btmg breached this duty.therefore,if it is determined that the regents sustained damage and is entitled to recover from stop loss,btmg should be required to indemnify stop loss.
btmg demurrered to the on the ground that it failed to allege that btmg owed a duty of care to the regents with regard to the manner in which it analyzed claim information.the trial court found that the second amended fails to state sufficient facts to give rise to a duty owed by btmg to the regents sounding in tort and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.a judgment dismissing the was entered thereafter.stop loss timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
since we are reviewing the sufficiency of stop loss,we must assume the truth of all facts in that pleading.jones american president lines d.to the extent that the regents complaint contains contrary allegations,we must,for purposes of evaluating the demurrer,accept stop loss version of the facts.ibid.the sufficiency of the presents a pure question of law,which this court must review de novo.filet menu,cheng th,d.
stop loss sufficiently alleges a cause of action for equitable indemnity.
a.the issues defined 
the trial court ruling that the fails to state a cause of action for comparative equitable indemnity,upheld in the majority opinion,rests on two premises first,that equitable indemnity is available only as between joint tortfeasors,and may not be obtained from a party whose liability is based solely on breach of contract and secondly,that the failure to perform a contractual obligation that causes only monetary damages may not be the basis for tort liability.both of these broad propositions require more careful consideration.
the alleges that btmg was wholly or partially responsible for the regents financial loss,but the sufficiency of this pleading is significant only if partial responsibility is assumed.if the evidence proves that btmg was wholly responsible for the regents loss,then stop loss bears no liability and the sufficiency of its is academic.the issues are framed only by assuming to be true,as we must,that the actions or failures to act of both stop loss and btmg jointly gave rise to a single economic loss to the regents,namely,the loss of million of insurance coverage.
the regents complaint against stop loss alleges both breach of the loss contract,and negligent breach of stop loss professional duties as an insurance broker the alleges that btmg liability arises from its failure to perform under the system established by the three parties for the processing of information.although the system was not established pursuant to a contract,the reads,the regents,btmg,and stop loss each assumed and understood its duties under the system.this allegation is essentially,undoubtedly made in an attempt to avoid the rule that equitable indemnity may not be obtained from one who contributed to a loss only by breaching a contractual obligation.as the majority opinion points out,ante,at,the law imposes no duty on strangers to promptly process another commercial data comparable to the duty imposed on all persons to exercise due care to avoid injuring others.if,as stop loss alleges,btmg assumed and understood an obligation to the regents to timely process and forward insurance data,that obligation necessarily was based on an implied agreement arising out of the business relationship between those two parties the regents complaint confirms the existence of a business relationship between the regents and btmg.while the precise terms of the arrangement are not specified,the regents allege that btmg managed premium payments and recoveries for the regents.the duties that btmg assumed pursuant to that arrangement are necessarily the source of any obligations that btmg owed to the regents.
thus,consistent with the allegations of the,it must be assumed that btmg did not timely transmit to stop loss the information necessary for the submission of the reinsurance claim as it had undertaken to do,that once received,stop loss did not diligently process and forward the information,and that as the combined result of both delays the reinsurer did not receive timely notification and the regents was unable to recover on the reinsurance claim.under these assumptions,stop loss is liable to the regents for the full amount of the loss.the issue is whether,under these assumptions required by the pleadings,there is any good reason why stop loss should not be entitled to recover from btmg a portion of the liability corresponding to its proportionate share of the fault in jointly causing the loss.
b.the limitation of equitable indemnity to joint tortfeasors 
the first premise on which the decision of the trial court and the majority rests undoubtedly correctly reflects the current state of california law.indemnity has been defined as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.citation.in this state the obligation may arise from either of two general sources first,it may arise by virtue of express contractual language establishing a duty in one party to save another harmless upon the occurrence of specified circumstances.second,it may find its source in equitable considerations brought into play either by contractual language not specifically dealing with indemnification or by the equities of the particular case.kramer cedu foundation,d,quoting white,city of huntington beach cal d.
with respect to the latter,with which we are here exclusively concerned,the equitable indemnity doctrine originated in the common sense proposition that when two individuals are responsible for a loss,but one of the two is more culpable than the other,it is only fair that the more culpable party should bear a greater share of the loss.of course,at the time the doctrine developed,common law precepts precluded any attempt to ascertain comparative fault as a consequence,equitable indemnity,like the contributory negligence doctrine,developed as an proposition.american motorcycle superior court cal d.however,in american motorcycle the supreme court concluded that the rationale that prompted abandonment of the rule precluding recovery by a contributorily negligent plaintiff in favor of a doctrine of comparative fault applies equally to the allocation of responsibility between two or more negligent defendants and requires a modification of this state traditional common law equitable indemnity doctrine.id.at,citing li yellow cab cal d.the court concur red with dean prosser observation in a related context that t here is obvious lack of sense and justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of a loss,for which two defendants were unintentionally responsible,to be shouldered onto one alone,while the latter goes scot free.american motorcycle superior court,supra,at,quoting prosser,law of torts ed,see also,bay development,superior court cal d,fn.
originally applied to defendants whose negligence caused the plaintiff loss see,american motorcycle superior court,supra,cal d,the supreme court later expanded the doctrine of comparative equitable indemnity to allow apportionment of loss between a negligent plaintiff and a strictly liable defendant citation,and between a defendant liable in strict liability and negligence and a defendant strictly liable.gem developers hallcraft homes of san diego,d.comparative indemnity has been made available to apportion liability between two parties who are strictly liable.gentry construction superior court d.yet,for largely historical reasons,equitable indemnity has been limited to cases in which the indemnitor liability is based on tort principles.although the body of law defining and applying principles of equitable indemnity has not fully gelled but is still evolving,one thing is clear the doctrine applies only among defendants who are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff.citation.as plaintiff maintains,joint and several liability in the context of equitable indemnity is fairly expansive.we agree it is not limited to the old common term joint tortfeasor it can apply to acts that are concurrent or successive,joint or several,as long as they create a detriment caused by several actions.citation.one factor is necessary,however.with limited exception,there must be some basis for tort liability against the proposed indemnitor.citation.generally,it is based on a duty owed to the underlying plaintiff bfgc architects planners,construction,th,d bfgc see also,leko cornerstone.inspection service th,d gem developers hallcraft homes of san diego,supra,at.cicone urs d.the concept of joint tortfeasors for the purpose of indemnity is explained in the restatement as two or more persons who are liable to the same person for the same harm.it is not necessary that they act in concert or in pursuance of a common design,nor is it necessary that they be joined as defendants.the rule stated applies to all torts italics omitted.
the historical limitation excluding contract liability from the scope of equitable indemnity is consistent with the manner in which damages are awarded in a simple breach of contract action.in order to recover for breach of contract,the party must prove that it has substantially performed the conditions of the breaching party performance or that performance was excused.if it fails to do so,it obtains no recovery.if it does establish this predicate,it is entitled to recover all damages foreseeably caused by the other party breach.bruckman parliament escrow d.see rest d contracts,com.b w hen performance is due,anything short of full performance is a breach,even if the party who does not fully perform was not at fault and even if the defect in his performance was not substantial iii farnsworth on contracts ed,contract law is,in its essential design,a law of strict liability.thus,contract damages normally are awarded on an basis.while the breaching party is liable only for damages foreseeably caused by its breach,there is no apportionment of that amount even if less than perfect performance of the conditions by the nonbreaching party contributed in some measure to the loss.bruckman parliament escrow,supra,at.see corbin on contracts ed.
the wisdom of this approach has not gone unquestioned.see phillips,out with the old abandoning the traditional measurement of contract damages for a system of comparative fault.the author of this article argues that measuring damages for breach of contract by apportioning liability based on the percentage of fault in causing a breach would be more efficient and more equitable than the current system that is based on the expectations of the nonbreaching party.he argues,the objective of expectation damages is to give the party the benefit of his bargain.essentially,this system of damages is one of strict liability that operates without regard to fault.in other words,the breaching party bears the full brunt of damage assessment regardless of the party contributions to the breach.commentators justify this strict liability system by urging that it prevents the courts from becoming entangled in an individual freedom to contract.still others note that this system avoids costly and efforts of determining fault.however,damage systems that assess fault on the basis of strict liability are generally unfair and inequitable.the application of strict liability for contract damages leads to inefficiencies in the market system because the breaching party does not face the proper incentives to avoid breach.id.at,fns.omitted.in his opinion,adapting the tort concept of comparative fault to contract damages is a workable alternative to the doctrine of expectation.a damages system in contract based on comparative fault will encourage contracting parties to carry out their respective obligations and,as a result,create a more efficient and equitable doctrine of liabilities for breach.id.at.the proposed system of comparative fault for contract damages is actually an exercise in apportionment.should courts adopt and apply this system consistently,they would compare the parties respective fault in causing breach and apportion the cost of that breach accordingly.id.at.
california courts have made a small step in this direction.rejecting the prior rule,courts have applied apportionment principles to allocate contractual liquidated damages where delays in construction projects have been caused both by the owner and by the contractor.jasper construction,foothill junior college dist.d.see also nomellini constr.state of california ex rel.of wat.resources d.categorical statements that where delays are caused on both sides there is no way to apportion damages are an absurdity unruh worden,liquidated damages for delay in completion of commercial construction projects are they recoverable by the owner when the owner contributes to the delay santa clara.
some courts in other jurisdictions have applied this reasoning to permit indemnity from a party whose liability is based solely on breach of contract.in northern petrochemical thorsen thorshov,and later in lesmeister dilly,the minnesota supreme court recognized a rule of damage apportionment applicable where two persons independently and unintentionally breach separate contracts to the same person.the lesmeister court explained,where a and b owe contract duties to c under separate contracts,and each breaches independently,and it is not reasonably possible to make a division of the damage caused by the separate breaches closely related in point of time,the breaching parties,even though they acted independently,are jointly and severally liable.see also groves sons warner cir,fn.upholding apportionment of contract damages where both parties were responsible for particular loss,despite questionable propriety of allocat ing damages in situations where specific amounts can not be attributable to separate causes gateway western ry.morrison metalweld process cir,upholding instruction allowing contract damages to be apportioned under comparative fault principles because strict application of contract damage principles would have been overly harsh and inequitable.
in in re consol.vista hills litigation,amrep,the supreme court of new mexico permitted an indemnity claim by a building contractor against a materials supplier even though the two were not joint tortfeasors and the sole loss in question was economic.this situation is created,as here,when the plaintiff chooses to sue only one defendant and sues that defendant on a contract theory.here the homeowners have sued under theories of breach of contract and breach of warranty.regardless of whether new mexico contribution statute is available for proportional contribution,in order to establish an equitable system in which all parties are held liable for damages in proportion to their respective fault,we must modify the right to indemnification when an indemnitee has been adjudged liable for full damages on a claim that was not susceptible under law to proration of fault among concurrent tortfeasors.such proportional indemnification applies only when contribution or some other form of proration of fault among tortfeasors is not available,at,fn.omitted.under amrep,a defendant found jointly and severally liable in contract with a right of proportional indemnity is similarly situated to a defendant jointly and severally liable in tort with a right of comparative contribution.like a defendant jointly and severally liable in tort,a defendant liable on a contract theory continues to be responsible for of the plaintiff awarded damages.after amrep,however,a defendant liable in contract may seek proportional indemnity based on principles of comparative fault in the same way a defendant jointly and severally liable in tort can seek comparative contribution.mock,trends in new mexico law tort mexico adopts proportional indemnity and clouds the distinction between contract and tort amrep southwest,shollenbarger wood treating.as a result of amrep,a defendant can bring into a lawsuit virtually any other party which,within the bounds of good faith,may be potentially responsible for the plaintiff potential liability.id.at,fn.omitted.
the advisability of apportioning damages in contract actions,however,has not been universally accepted.according to the new york court of appeals,t he policy considerations that underlay the need to liberalize the inequitable and harsh rules that once governed contribution among joint are not pertinent to contract matters.parties to a contract have the power to specifically delineate the scope of their liability at the time the contract is formed.thus,there is nothing unfair in defining a contracting party liability by the scope of its promise as reflected by the agreement of the parties.indeed,this is required by the very nature of contract law,where potential liability is determined in advance by the parties.bd.of educ.sargent,webster,et,see bussel,liability for concurrent breach of contract,bussel the reasons that justify the joint and several liability regime in tort in general do not apply in contract.but the disadvantages of overdeterrence and strategic behavior that give rise to criticism on the tort regime arise in contract as well.importing the tort notions would create perverse economic incentives on prebreach behavior.and,finally,such notions appear to be inconsistent with the,and apparently contract doctrines governing remedies.
while this reasoning may apply to the apportionment of damages as between contracting parties,it has little application to the fairness of denying apportionment as between parties who have contributed to causing another loss but who have no contractual relationship between themselves.nonetheless,there are conceptual problems in imposing equitable indemnity on a party whose liability is based on breach of contract that do not exist in applying equitable indemnity between two tortfeasors.the measure of damages in most tort cases is all loss proximately caused by the wrongdoing,whether anticipated or not.however,the measure of contract damages remains very much the same as articulated in hadley baxendale ex.damages that the parties could reasonably have anticipated when they entered the contract.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d.thus,apportionment between parties who have breached different contracts entered at different times would in theory require the use of different measures of damages,as would apportionment as between a party liable in tort and a party liable for breach of contract.see bussel,supra,at.this would,at a minimum,complicate the apportionment formula.
particularly in view of these complications,i would be reluctant to adopt a rule departing fundamentally from california law on this issue.the preceding discussion suggests that the refusal to apportion damages simply because the liability of one party arises from breach of contract may warrant reconsideration.there are circumstances in which the refusal to apportion contract damages,or damages caused jointly by one party breach of a duty imposed by law and another breach of a contractual duty,may produce the same inequitable results that prompted our supreme court to abandon the approach to tort damages.yet,although there may be good reason to do so,any such fundamental change should come from our supreme court,or from the legislature.absent such a change,i agree with the majority that we must adhere to the rule that equitable indemnity may be obtained only from one who is jointly and severally liable to the injured party based on the commission of a tort,based on the breach of a duty imposed by law.
btmg alleged failure to timely perform constitutes the breach of a duty imposed by law for the purpose of granting equitable indemnity 
proceeding on the premise that stop loss can state a claim for indemnity against btmg only if it can allege facts establishing a tort liability of btmg,two alternatives suggest themselves.stop loss may be entitled to equitable indemnity if btmg breached a duty to the regents imposed by law that contributed to the regents loss for which stop loss may be held responsible.stop loss also may be entitled to recover from btmg if btmg breached a duty imposed by law that is owed to stop loss.
as indicated in part ii.above,btmg could have acquired a duty to the regents to timely process claims information only by having agreed explicitly or implicitly to do so.although its failure to perform such a duty may have constituted the breach of a contractually based obligation,the failure may in addition have breached a duty imposed by law.in north american chemical superior court th,d,the court explained that for over years california has also recognized the fundamental principle that a ccompanying every contract is a duty to perform with care,skill,reasonable expedience,and faithfulness the thing agreed to be done,and a negligent failure to observe any of these conditions is a tort,as well as a breach of the contract.the rule which imposes this duty is of universal application as to all persons who by contract undertake professional or other business engagements requiring the exercise of care,skill and knowledge the obligation is implied by law and need not be stated in the agreement citation.citations.a contract to perform services gives rise to a duty of care which requires that such services be performed in a competent and reasonable manner.a negligent failure to do so may be both a breach of contract and a tort.citation.in such a hybrid circumstance,the plaintiff is entitled to pursue both legal theories until an occasion for an election of remedies arises,fn.omitted see also eads marks cal d,even where there is a contractual relationship between the parties,a cause of action in tort may sometimes arise out of the negligent manner in which the contractual duty is performed.
btmg argues that the decision of the supreme court in aas superior court cal th,d,aas,superseded by statute on another ground as set out in rosen state farm general ins.cal th,d,precludes the recognition of a broad general duty of care that would support tort liability here.in holding that homeowners can not recover for construction defects that have not caused personal injury or property damage,the court in aas stated that a person may not ordinarily recover in tort for the breach of duties that merely restate contractual obligations.instead,c ourts will generally enforce the breach of contractual promise through contract law,except when the actions that constitute the breach violate a social policy that merits the imposition of tort remedies.aas,supra,at,d,erlich menezes cal th,d,erlich.relying on aas,the court in bfgc,supra,th at page,d,rejected an architect claim for equitable indemnity against the contractors on the job in question,reasoning that t he only allegations of the contractors misconduct are based on their alleged breach of contract,despite the architect gloss that in doing so they breached their duties.this is an improper attempt to recast a breach of contract cause of action as a tort claim.the majority opinion here echoes this reasoning.
the line of cases exemplified by aas and erlich,however,does not preclude a claim for equitable indemnity under the present circumstances.in aas,the supreme court held that the economic loss rule precludes recovery under tort theories for losses that are solely economic,and that recovery for such losses normally can be obtained only to the extent available for breach of contract or warranty.aas,supra,cal th at,d.the aas court reaffirmed its rejection in erlich of the argument that the negligent performance of a construction contract,without more,justifies an award of tort damages.id.at,d.and,after analyzing the factors identified in biakanja irving cal d,and reaffirmed in gregory cal d,the court did not find they justify a broad rule permitting recovery of repair costs unaccompanied by property damage or personal injury.aas,supra,cal th at,d.
the economic loss rule applied in aas requires a purchaser to recover in contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations,unless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise.robinson helicopter,dana cal th,d,robinson helicopter see also aas,supra,cal th at,d,seely white motor cal d.the rationale for this rule was repeated in robinson helicopter the distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the luck of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury.the distinction rests,rather,on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products.citation.we concluded the nature of this responsibility meant that a manufacturer could appropriately be held liable for physical injuries including both personal injury and damage to property other than the product itself,regardless of the terms of any warranty.citation.but the manufacturer could not be held liable for the level of performance of his products in the consumer business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer demands.cal th at,d.
the recovery of tort damages for a breach of contract is seldom permitted.generally,outside the insurance context,a tortious breach of contract may be found when the breach is accompanied by a traditional common law tort,such as fraud or conversion the means used to breach the contract are tortious,involving deceit or undue coercion or one party intentionally breaches the contract intending or knowing that such a breach will cause severe,unmitigable harm in the form of mental anguish,personal hardship,or substantial consequential damages.erlich,supra,cal th at,d,see witkin,summary of california law ed.contracts.our supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that c ontract and tort are different branches of the law,and that c ontract damages are generally limited to those within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into or at least reasonably foreseeable by them at that time consequential damages beyond the expectations of the parties are not recoverable.citations.this limitation on available damages serves to encourage contractual relations and commercial activity by enabling parties to estimate in advance the financial risks of their enterprise.in contrast,tort damages are awarded to compensate the victim for injury suffered.applied equipment litton saudi arabia,supra,cal th at,d,foley interactive data cal d,see freeman mills,belcher oil cal th,d,overruling seaman direct buying service,standard oil cal d,which had recognized cause of action in tort for bad faith denial of the existence of a contract.
in erlich,the supreme court confirmed that the same wrongful act may constitute both a breach of contract and an invasion of an interest protected by the law of torts.erlich,supra,cal th at,d.but the court adhered to the rule that tort damages can not be recovered if the act is wrongful only because it breaches a contractual obligation,holding that emotional distress damages can not be recovered for the breach of a contract to construct a house.the court reaffirmed that damages for mental suffering and emotional distress are generally not recoverable in an action for breach of an ordinary commercial contract in california id.at,d,summarizing the reasons for denying tort recovery in contract breach cases as follows the different objectives underlying tort and contract breach the importance of predictability in assuring commercial stability in contractual dealings the potential for converting every contract breach into a tort,with accompanying punitive damage recovery,and the preference for legislative action in affording appropriate remedies.citations.restrictions on contract remedies serve to protect the freedom to bargain over special risks and to promote contract formation by limiting liability to the value of the promise.id.at,d.
as appears,the issue with which all of these cases grapple is the type of damages that may be recovered under contract and tort principles.despite the fact that a negligent failure to perform contractual obligations constitutes a tort,the injured party may recover only contractual damages unless the duty that gives rise to tort liability is either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is both intentional and intended to harm.erlich,supra,cal th at,d,applied equipment litton saudi arabia,supra,cal th at,d.stated differently,unless the actions that constitute the breach violate a social policy that merits the imposition of tort remedies.erlich,supra,at,d.the restriction is grounded in the recognition that the consequences of a negligent act must be limited to avoid an intolerable burden on society.ibid.
these reasons for adhering to the distinction between damages recoverable in contract and in tort have no bearing on the present claim for equitable indemnity.stop loss is not attempting to recover expanded tort damages or any element of damages not customarily available for breach of contract.the regents claim against stop loss seeks only economic remedy available for a breach of the loss stop loss seeks only to compel btmg to pay for its proportionate contribution to the regents that would also be available for breach of agreement between the regents and btmg.by recognizing that btmg alleged breach of a commitment to the regents may also violate a duty imposed by law and thus support a claim for equitable indemnity,btmg is not exposed to liability beyond that which was foreseeable when it made a commitment to the regents.requiring btmg to pay for the share of the regents loss for which it is responsible will not interfere with the reasonable expectations of btmg,expand the scope of damages for breach of contract,or expose btmg to unlimited liability in simply reiterating the principle that a party may not ordinarily recover in tort for the breach of contractual duties,ante,the majority opinion ignores the context in which this principle has invariably been applied,the reasoning behind the prevent the recovery of damages not within the reasonable expectations of the parties in entering the the fact that recognizing a claim for indemnity in the present context would not sanction the recovery of any damages that are not contract damages 
nor will permitting equitable indemnity in this situation violate the economic loss rule.the indemnitor can not be liable for negligent breach of contract unless it has in fact breached the contract.holding the indemnitor responsible for its proportionate share of the injured party financial loss does not impose any liability beyond that which it has contractually assumed.
moreover,in aas,the supreme court reaffirmed that in some circumstances economic damages may be recoverable for the negligent performance of a contractual obligation damaging the economic interests of a third party.liability to one not in privity may be imposed if a balancing of the factors identified in biakanja irving,supra,cal d at page,and reaffirmed in,supra,cal d at page,warrant the imposition of a duty to protect those interests.aas,supra,cal th at,d.in,the court held that w here a special relationship exists between the parties,a plaintiff may recover for loss of expected economic advantage through the negligent performance of a contract although the parties were not in contractual privity,supra,cal d at.in determining the existence of a special relationship giving rise to a duty of care,the following factors should be weighed the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct and the policy of preventing future harm.id.at.
here,the allegations of stop loss satisfy most of the factors.the understanding allegedly reached between the regents,btmg and stop loss was intended to affect the regents ability to obtain insurance coverage and stop loss ability to perform its responsibilities under that arrangement.the harm allegedly caused by btmg failure to timely process the claim data was entirely foreseeable.btmg alleged failure to perform is closely connected to the denial of the insurance coverage and the harm suffered by the regents,and in turn to the loss sustained by stop loss in incurring liability for the loss of that coverage.while there is not necessarily any moral blame attached to btmg conduct,recognizing a duty owed to stop loss for this purpose may well decrease the likelihood of similar harm in the future.the preponderance of the factors thus supports finding a special relationship in this case which justifies the recognition of a duty on the part of btmg owed to stop loss to perform its commitments to the regents.see aas,supra,cal th at,d,test for identifying such a duty involves balancing the factors set forth in.
treating the negligent breach of a contractual obligation as sufficient to support a claim for equitable indemnity does not render nugatory the conclusion that such indemnity is available only between joint tortfeasors.every breach of contract will not support a claim for indemnity but only those that result from a failure to perform with care,skill,reasonable expedience,and faithfulness.north american chemical superior court,supra,th at,d.this differs from the strict liability that is imposed for any unexcused failure to perform the terms of a contract.bruckman parliament escrow,supra,d at.
i thus reach the same conclusion as did the supreme court of new mexico in amrep,supra,at page although a person can not be held liable for damages in tort because of the rule,when that person is held liable for damages in contract,and that person liability is attributable to the fault of another,it would be unjust not to allow indemnification.we therefore hold that the rule does not bar a claim for indemnification.if a party is held liable for damages that are the fault of another,the former may seek indemnification from the latter regardless of the basis for the former liability.this does not abrogate the rule because parties are still bound by their contractual agreements including indemnification agreements and because allowing indemnification in this context would in no way blur the line between contract and tort.
reversal is not required because of subsequent developments in this case.
despite my conclusion that stop loss sufficiently alleged a cause of action for equitable indemnity,so that the demurrer to the should not have been sustained,for reasons arising subsequent to the trial court ruling it is not necessary to reverse the dismissal of the.btmg states in its brief,any alleged negligence on the part of btmg may be imputed to the regents.at oral argument counsel for btmg reiterated that btmg was at all times acting as an agent,middleman or manager for the regents and thus that any conduct on btmg part that contributed to the regent loss would be attributed to the regents.the pleadings out of which this appeal arises provide no basis to assume that the regents would agree or would be compelled to accept responsibility for deficiencies in the performance of btmg.nonetheless,the regents claim against stop loss has already been tried and,as btmg has represented,stop loss was held liable only for that portion of the regents loss which the jury attributed directly to stop loss.
while this appeal was pending,the regent action against stop loss was tried before a jury the jury rejected the regents breach of contract claim,finding that the regents did not do all,or substantially all,of the significant things that the contract required them to do.however,the jury did find stop loss liable for professional negligence in connection with the placement of provide excess insurance.the jury was instructed to apportion fault between the regents and stop loss if it determined that any negligence on the part of the regents contributed to the regents harm,and the jury awarded the regents only in damages,significantly less than the amount of the insurance recovery the regents claimed was lost as a result of the late claim submission.since there has been no suggestion that there was any fault on the part of the regents other than that for which btmg was responsible,it app
