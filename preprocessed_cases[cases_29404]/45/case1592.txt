background 
in april,joshi,an anesthesiologist who practiced from to at luke,brought a qui tam action under the fca against luke and bashiti,alleging violations of a and a.in his complaint,joshi asserts he is an original source who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his allegations are based.in count i,joshi alleges luke requested and received medicare reimbursement from the government for anesthesia services performed by bashiti at the reimbursement rate for medical direction of anesthesia services,when luke was entitled only to the lower reimbursement rate for medical supervision or no reimbursement at all.joshi alleges bashiti failed both to perform evaluations and prescribe anesthesia plans,and bashiti falsely certified he supervised or directed the work of several certified registered nurse anesthetists crnas.joshi further alleges in count i luke sought reimbursement for supervised crna work,when in fact such work was unsupervised,in violation of missouri state law.
in count ii,joshi alleges luke knowingly submitted false claims to the government for services that were not performed and for supplies that were not provided.the complaint alleges luke would bill medicaid and medicare for an entire box of supplies or an entire prescription,while using only a small portion of said on the patient for whom said supplies and prescriptions were billed.
both counts allege the existence of a conspiracy between luke and bashiti,each of them their employees and agents for the purpose of defrauding the united states in violation of a with an intent to increase their pecuniary gain.however,joshi complaint does not identify specifically the date,amount,or content of,or the persons involved in making,any false claims submitted by luke.nor does the complaint specify the dates on which supplies or prescriptions were used or billed,the patients who received the supplies or prescriptions,or the type of supplies or prescriptions involved in the alleged fraudulent scheme.rather,joshi alleges luke had all the work done by the crnas and bashiti assigned to itself,and t he medical bills to the government sufficiently identify the time,place,and content of the fraudulent representations.
luke and bashiti filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to plead fraud with particularity under rule b.joshi opposed the motion,and,alternatively,sought leave to amend the complaint by adding specific allegations of fraud.joshi proposed to amend count i by adding a table summarizing anesthesia services performed on four days in november by crnas and bashiti at luke.the table and accompanying allegations indicate the time,surgeon,patient initials,and crna who performed anesthesia services.joshi alleges this proposed amendment establishes the anesthesia services performed by crnas were unsupervised by bashiti because bashiti performed anesthesia services at the same time on other patients,and bashiti falsely certified he either directed or supervised the crna work.with regard to count ii,joshi,based on information and belief,proposed to add a table summarizing medications issued to seven patients identified by their initials during six days in november.the table and accompanying allegations indicate the patients were administered a particular quantity of medicine and luke billed the government for a quantity greater than the amount actually administered.
the district court granted luke and bashiti motion to dismiss,concluding the complaint failed to satisfy rule b particularity requirement and failed to give luke and bashiti notice of the alleged misconduct to allow them to defend properly against the charge.the court reasoned,without any allegations about who specifically participated in these claims and how and when the claims were submitted,luke and bashiti are unable to marshal a defense.the court also denied joshi request for leave to amend the complaint,finding joshi claims with new november data were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and did not cure the deficiencies of joshi original complaint.
joshi appeals,arguing the district court erred in dismissing his complaint,because joshi satisfied rule b particularity requirement by alleging each and every invoice for crna work was fraudulent denying joshi leave to amend the complaint,because the proposed amendments are timely and would not have been futile and refusing to allow joshi to conduct discovery necessary to satisfy rule b,because the facts of luke and bashiti fraudulent conduct are uniquely within the control of luke and bashiti.

after taking the allegations contained in joshi complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,we agree with the district court,joshi failed to allege with any specificity the particular circumstances constituting luke and bashiti alleged fraudulent conduct.absent from the complaint are any mention of the particular crnas who allegedly performed patient care and administered anesthesia services unsupervised,when bashiti falsely claimed to have supervised or directed crnas,who was involved in the fraudulent billing aspect of the conspiracy,what services were provided and to which patients the services were provided,what the content was of the fraudulent claims,what supplies or prescriptions were fraudulently billed and to which patients the supplies or prescriptions were provided,what dates the defendants a
