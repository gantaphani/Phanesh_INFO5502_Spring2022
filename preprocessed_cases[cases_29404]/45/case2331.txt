this appeal arises out of an application mercury casualty mercury filed in to increase its homeowners insurance rates.in denying the increase mercury requested,the california insurance commissioner the commissioner made two decisions that are at issue on appeal.first,the commissioner determined that under subdivision f of section of title of the california code of regulations,which disallows,for ratemaking purposes,all i nstitutional advertising expenses,mercury entire advertising budget had to be excluded from the calculation of the maximum permitted earned premium because mercury aims its entire advertising budget at promoting the mercury group as whole rather than seek ing to obtain business for a specific insurer and also provid ing customers with pertinent information about that specific insurer second,the commissioner determined that mercury did not qualify for a variance from the maximum permitted earned premium under subdivision f of section because mercury failed to demonstrate the rate decrease that resulted from application of the regulatory formula results in deep financial hardship.
mercury and certain insurance trade organizations referred to collectively as the trades unsuccessfully sought to challenge the commissioner decision in the superior court.on appeal from the superior court judgment against them,mercury and the trades raise three main issues.first,mercury and the trades contend the commissioner and the superior court erred in interpreting and applying section f with regard to what constitutes institutional advertising expenses.second,the trades contend section f violates the first amendment to the united states constitution because the regulation imposes a financial penalty on speech.third,mercury and the trades contend the commissioner and the superior court erred in determining that mercury did not qualify for the constitutional variance because the commissioner and the court wrongfully applied a deep financial hardship standard instead of a fair return standard.
finding no merit in these arguments,or any of the other arguments offered to overturn the judgment,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
we begin with some brief background on the area of the law involved here.at the november,general election,the voters approved an initiative statute that was designated on the ballot as proposition.the measure made numerous fundamental changes in the regulation of automobile and other forms of insurance in california.formerly,the open competition system of regulation had obtained,under which rates were set by insurers without prior or subsequent approval by the insurance commissioner citation.under that system,california ha d less regulation of insurance than any other state,and in california automobile liability insurance was less regulated than most other forms of insurance.citation.the initiative contained,among others,provisions relating to the rollback of rates for insurance within its coverage for the period extending from november,through november.for purposes here,a rate is the price or premium that an insurer charges its insureds for insurance.century ins.garamendi cal th,century.for the period extending from november,through november,hereafter sometimes the rollback year or simply,as a temporary regulatory regime of rate reduction and freeze evidently designed to allow the setting up of a permanent regulatory regime to follow,proposition itself sets a maximum rate for covered insurance at percent of the rate for the same insurance in effect on november,hereafter sometimes the rate.for the period extending from november,into the future,proposition institutes a permanent regulatory regime comprising the prior approval system,under which,in the words of insurance code section,subdivision a,the insurance commissioner must approve a rate applied for by an insurer before its use,looking to whether the rate in question is excessive,inadequate,unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of specified law considering the investment income of the individual insurer and not considering the degree of competition in the insurance industry generally.century,at.
in calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d,hereafter sometimes calfarm,the supreme court upheld,inter alia,proposition provision requiring rate rollbacks.century,supra,cal th at.the court reviewed proposition against challenges under the united states and california constitutions,including a claim that the rate rollback requirement provision was on its face invalid as confiscatory and arbitrary,discriminatory,or demonstrably irrelevant to legitimate policy in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment and article i,section and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and article i,sections and.in the course of the court analysis,the court rejected the point.century,at,fn.omitted.
five years after calfarm,in century,the supreme court review ed the implementation of proposition rate rollback requirement provision by the insurance commissioner.century,supra,cal th at.the court ultimately upheld the commissioner actions.id.at.
with that background in mind,we turn to the facts of the present case.in may,mercury filed an application with the department of insurance to increase its rates on its homeowner line of insurance,which consists of policy form residential homeowners insurance,policy form renters and tenants insurance,and policy form insurance for condominium owners.originally,mercury sought an overall rate increase of percent.as the administrative proceeding regarding mercury application continued,however,mercury filed updated applications,so that mercury ultimately sought an overall rate increase of either percent or percent.the reason for the difference is not material here.
in june,consumer watchdog submitted a petition to intervene in the proceeding,combined with a petition for a hearing on mercury application.the commissioner granted the petition to intervene in july but deferred ruling on the petition for a hearing until two years later,when,in may,the commissioner issued a notice of hearing on his own motion and on consumer watchdog petition.
in october,mercury submitted the prefiled direct testimony of various witnesses,including robert hamada and david appel.as a financial economist,hamada was asked to provide an economic application of th e variance in section f,and to determine whether the maximum permitted return is quantitatively confiscatory to the providers of mercury capital.hamada asserted that t o do this,it is necessary to lay out an economic interpretation of fair return to use as a benchmark to quantify whether a return is confiscatory.for his part,appel was also asked to opine among other things whether it was appropriate for mercury to seek a variance under section f.
the commissioner and consumer watchdog filed motions to strike some of mercury prefiled direct testimony,including the testimony of hamada and some of the testimony of appel.in ruling on those motions,the administrative law judge alj explained that to qualify for the variance under section f,mercury had to demonstrate that the maximum earned premium under the ratemaking formula results in an inability to operate successfully.put differently mercury is permitted to show the maximum rate will cause deep financial hardship to mercury enterprise as whole.finding that neither hamada nor appel provide d evidence that the regulatory rate,as applied to mercury,prevents mercury from operating successfully,the alj struck hamada statements pertaining to confiscation and those portions of appel testimony contending that the regulatory rate of return is confiscatory.the alj later made similar rulings as mercury tried several more times to offer testimony from hamada and appel concerning fair return.
in its posthearing brief,consumer watchdog argued that all of mercury advertising expenses should be excluded from the rate calculation as institutional advertising expenses because the evidence showed that none of mercury advertising in california was aimed at obtaining business for a particular insurer instead,mercury ads and campaigns promote a fictional entity called mercury insurance group.
for its part,mercury argued that under the language of section f,advertising is not institutional advertising if it is aimed at obtaining business for an insurer or it provides consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy the insurer product.mercury further argued that mercury advertisements are all aimed at obtaining business for mercury or its affiliate insurance companies and providing information to consumers on why they should buy a mercury product.
in its posthearing brief,the department of insurance argued that under century,c onfiscation occurs when proposed regulatory action would impose deep financial hardship on the regulated entity.the department further argued that its rate proposal,far from convincingly demonstrating deep financial hardship and an inability to operate successfully,would allow mercury to successfully operate in california because a ccording to mercury own calculations,the department proposal would result in of expected operating profit a total return of less than and such a return would not constitute deep financial hardship.
for its part,mercury argued that under century,in deciding whether rates produced by the formula are confiscatory,courts are required to determine if they would deny an insurer the opportunity to earn a just,reasonable and fair return.
in january,the alj submitted her proposed decision,which the commissioner adopted in full in february.as relevant here,the commissioner found that mercury general corporation is the parent company for mercury casualty and other entities.mercury general provides no services to customers and receives all its operating resources directly from its insurance affiliates,most notably mercury casualty.in,and mercury general corporation advertising expenses totaled million,million,and million respectively.mercury general and all its affiliates advertise under the name mercury insurance group,and mercury does not allocate advertising expenditures to specific insurance affiliates nor does the advertising department distinguish between insurance entities when generating advertising campaigns.based on these findings,the commissioner determined that under section f,mercury entire advertising budget must be excluded from the rate application because mercury aims its entire advertising budget at promoting the mercury group as whole rather than seek ing to obtain business for a specific insurer and also provid ing customers with pertinent information about that specific insurer.the commissioner also determined that mercury did not qualify for the constitutional variance under section f because mercury failed to demonstrate the rate decrease results in deep financial hardship.based on these and other determinations,the commissioner denied mercury application for an overall rate increase of percent and instead approved an percent rate decrease for policy form,a percent rate increase for policy form,and a percent rate increase for policy form.
in march,mercury filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief in the superior court seeking review of the commissioner decision.consumer watchdog and the trades successfully petitioned for leave to intervene.
in june,the superior court issued its ruling denying mercury writ petition.as relevant here,the court rejected mercury argument that the commissioner applied the wrong standard to assess whether mercury could show confiscation to entitle mercury to a variance.disagreeing with mercury that the commissioner should have assessed whether mercury could earn a fair rate of return under the rate order,the court instead agreed with the commissioner that the test for confiscation is deep financial hardship and mercury did not demonstrate deep financial hardship to support its request for a confiscation variance.the court also rejected mercury argument that the commissioner misinterpreted the regulation defining institutional advertising.
in august,mercury appealed from the superior court june ruling denying its writ petition,even though judgment had not yet been entered.in january,the court issued a formal order denying mercury writ petition and dismissing mercury complaint for declaratory relief.the court also denied or dismissed all of the causes of action in the trades complaint in intervention.in doing so,the court addressed and rejected the trades argument that section f violates the first amendment.
in february,the court entered judgment against mercury and the trades.mercury and the trades timely appealed from that judgment.
discussion 
isection f institutional advertising 
section f provides that i nstitutional advertising expenses shall not be allowed for ratemaking purposes and that i nstitutional advertising means advertising not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer and not providing consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy the insurer product.
in disallowing all of mercury advertising expenses as institutional advertising expenses,the commissioner explained that institutional advertising is image advertising which strives to enhance a company reputation or improve corporate name recognition.such advertising does not promote a specific product or service but instead attempts to obtain favorable attention to the company as whole.fns.omitted.the commissioner then made the following findings regarding mercury advertising mercury general and all its affiliates advertise under the name mercury insurance group.the mercury insurance group is not a legal entity in any state and not a licensed insurer in california.mercury general advertising department supports all of mercury affiliates and mercury guides all its prospective customers to one telephone number.mercury does not allocate advertising expenditures to specific insurance affiliates nor does the advertising department distinguish between insurance entities when generating advertising campaigns.all mercury companies share a common website which identifies the company as mercury insurance group.fns.omitted.
the commissioner concluded that section f permits in the context of ratemaking only expenses for advertising that seeks to obtain business for a specific insurer and also provides customers with pertinent information.as mercury aims its entire advertising budget at promoting the mercury group as a whole,mercury entire advertising expenditures must be removed from the ratemaking formula.
the superior court concluded that the commissioner interpretation of section f was reasonable and consistent with proposition goals of consumer protection.thus,if mercury wished to include its advertising expenses in the ratemaking calculation,it was required to show that its advertising was aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer and provided consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy the insurer product.the court further concluded that the commissioner properly concluded that mercury advertising was not directed at a specific insurer and for that reason the commissioner correctly excluded all of mercury advertising expenses from the rate calculation.
mercury arguments on appeal 
on appeal,mercury contends the commissioner erred in disallowing all of mercury advertising expenses because the commissioner erroneously held that advertising qualifies as institutional advertising if either of the two criteria in section f is met,when the regulation requires that both criteria be met.according to mercury,t he c ommissioner improperly substituted the word or for the word and in the regulation.
we find no merit in this argument because section f does not set forth two criteria that are to be separately analyzed and applied.instead,the regulation sets forth a singular,unified definition of what constitutes i nstitutional advertising.specifically,advertising is institutional if it is not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer and does not provide consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy that insurer product.
here,the commissioner concluded that all of mercury advertising qualified as institutional advertising within the meaning of section f because mercury aims its entire advertising budget at promoting the mercury insurance group as a whole and the mercury insurance group is not a specific insurer.if the commissioner was correct in his characterization of mercury insurance group which we address below,then the commissioner was also correct in his conclusion that all of mercury advertising qualifies as institutional advertising within the meaning of section f because advertising that is aimed entirely at promoting an entity that is not a specific insurer is advertising that is not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer and does not provide consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy that insurer product.
that brings us to mercury argument that the commissioner erred in concluding that mercury advertising was not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer because all of mercury advertising was conducted under the name trade name mercury rather than the technical corporate name mercury casualty company.mercury contends the commissioner was wrong in this regard for several reasons.before addressing those reasons,however,we pause to more fully set forth the commissioner exact ruling on this subject.
contrary to mercury argument,the commissioner did not conclude that mercury advertising was not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer because all of that advertising was conducted under the trade name mercury rather than the technical corporate name mercury casualty company.instead,the commissioner ruling was far more comprehensive and nuanced than mercury argument acknowledges.first,the commissioner found,by a preponderance of the evidence,the following facts with regard to mercury advertising expenditures and methods 
mercury general and all its affiliates advertise under the name mercury insurance group.the mercury insurance group is not a legal entity in any state and not a licensed insurer in california.mercury general advertising department supports all of mercury affiliates and mercury guides all its prospective customers to one telephone number.mercury does not allocate advertising expenditures to specific insurance affiliates nor does the advertising department distinguish between insurance entities when generating advertising campaigns.all mercury companies share a common website which identifies the company as mercury insurance group.
in,and,mercury general corporation advertising expenses totaled million,million and million respectively.mercury allocates its advertising budget among a variety of media,including television,radio,direct mail and sports sponsorship.mercury annual report states the company believes that its advertising program is important to create brand awareness and to remain competitive in the current insurance climate.fns.omitted.
based on these findings,the commissioner reached the following conclusions 
mercury defines institutional advertising as advertising that is not designed to generate business or provide customers with information.this definition of institutional advertising is both narrow and impracticable,and would render all advertising expenses chargeable to the ratepayer a fact mercury concedes.instead,the regulation permits only advertising that seeks to obtain business for a specific insurer and also provides customers with pertinent information.as mercury aims its entire advertising budget at promoting the mercury group as a whole,the commissioner concludes that mercury entire advertising expenditures must be removed from the ratemaking formula.
mercury admits its advertising does not seek to obtain business for a specific insurer.in fact,thompson acknowledges that all of mercury advertising is designed for the insurance group and not for a specific affiliate or company within mercury.this fact is further confirmed when analyzing mercury advertisements.both print and radio advertisements urge consumers to contact the mercury insurance group through a common website and telephone number.consumers do not contact the specific insurance affiliates directly,nor do any of mercury specific insurers engage in their own advertising.while thompson argues the advertising is insurance specific,the regulation requires the promotion be aimed at generating business for a specific insurer,not a specific industry 
nor can mercury argue that the mercury insurance group is a specific insurer.the mercury insurance group is not a legal entity,nor is there any consensus as to the makeup of the mercury insurance group.thompson testified the mercury insurance group is comprised of mercury casualty,mercury insurance company,and california automobile.but yeager testified the mercury insurance group includes all legal entities that make up the consolidated mercury general corporation.what is certain is that mercury general does not advertise for its specific insurers and instead engages in advertising on behalf of the organization as a whole.
mercury urges the commissioner to interpret specific insurer to mean a specific group of affiliated insurers.yet such an interpretation is contrary to the clear regulatory intent and inconsistent with the purpose of the provision.
the rules governing statutory interpretation also apply to the commissioner regulations.the first rule in statutory construction requires the interpreter to examine the regulation language.if the regulation words,given their usual and ordinary meaning and read in context,are clear and unambiguous,the conclusion must be that the adopting authority meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the regulation applies.
regulation,subdivision f contains clear and unambiguous language.the regulation defines institutional advertising as advertising not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer.had the commissioner intended to charge consumers for affiliate or group advertising,he could have eliminated the reference to a specific insurer.but the commissioner decision to include the specific insurer requirement renders the regulation meaning unmistakable.advertising which generates business for a group of insurance companies,regardless of affiliation,is not advertising for a specific insurer.
mercury also argues the regulation is arbitrary.mercury contends there is no logical reason to penalize an insurer for advertising under a group insurance name.but such an argument is defeated when one considers the regulation intent.consumers are obligated to pay only expenses necessary in the offering of an insurance product or that in some way provide them benefit.mercury may not charge consumers for advertising that promotes corporate identity,enhances public opinion,or increases name and brand awareness.mercury chose to direct its advertising budget towards its entire group of affiliates.in so doing,mercury does not distinguish between those expenses chargeable to mercury casualty customers and those chargeable to affiliated ratepayers.as such,mercury can not require its mercury casualty policyholders to fund its advertising for other mercury companies.in addition,mercury does not explain why mercury casualty policyholders,as opposed to shareholders,should shoulder the expense of advertising for mercury general since that does not benefit them in any fairly discernible and direct way.this failure means mercury entire advertising budget must be excluded from the rate application.fns.omitted.
with this more complete understanding of the commissioner ruling,we turn back to mercury arguments.eschewing even any pretense of arguing about the meaning of the term specific insurer in light of the various rules of statutory construction,mercury offers four ad hoc reasons why the commissioner determination that the term specific insurer does not embrace a specific group of affiliated insurers should be deemed wrong.first,mercury contends the commissioner ruling unreasonably forces insurers to advertise under their technical corporate names because it would generate confusion as consumers shop for coverage among insurers known to them by trade names such as farmers,state farm,and allstate and not by obscure technical corporate names.second,mercury contends the commissioner interpretation does not allow an insurance company,such as mercury,to take into account its allocated share of expenses incurred for advertising that solicits business for affiliated insurers operating as part of a single insurance holding company system,and s uch a result would be absurd and contrary to the regulations,which in numerous places including the consideration of excluded expenses such as institutional advertising require the assessment of data at the group level.third,mercury contends the technical corporate name only interpretation will lead to results that are contrary to one of the primary goals of the prior approval laws to ensure that rates are not excessive.citation.to achieve this goal the prior approval laws should be construed to encourage,not penalize,business practices such as trade name advertising.fourth,mercury contends that recognizing the cost of trade name advertising in the formula would be consistent with those provisions of proposition that require the consideration of insurer groups as a single insurer for marketing,underwriting,and rating purposes.
in our view,none of mercury arguments on this point is cognizable with respect to how the term specific insurer should be interpreted under the various canons of statutory interpretation.instead,mercury arguments are really directed at why the regulation never should have included the term specific insurer in the first place.in other words,these are policy arguments that should have been and,indeed,may have been directed at the commissioner when he promulgated section f in the first place.but we are not a legislative or body,and it is not within our power to decide what terms the regulation should have included.we can only interpret what is already there,and inasmuch as mercury arguments on this point are not addressed to any interpretation that reasonably could be affixed to the existing term,specific insurer,we have no cause to consider those arguments further.
finally,mercury contends that b ecause the c ommissioner erroneously construed section f in the disjunctive and then found that mercury trade name advertising did not meet the specific insurer requirement,the commissioner did not consider or weigh the evidence to determine if mercury ads met the pertinent information requirement of the second criterion in the regulation.this argument need not detain us long.we have concluded already that section f does not set forth two criteria that are to be separately analyzed and applied.instead,the regulation sets forth a singular,unified definition of what qualifies as i nstitutional advertising.having found that mercury aims its entire advertising budget at promoting the mercury insurance group as a whole and having concluded that the mercury insurance group is not a specific insurer within the meaning of section f,the commissioner properly excluded all of mercury advertising expenses from the rate calculation pursuant to the regulation because mercury advertising was not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer and did not provide consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy that insurer product.accordingly,all of mercury challenges to the commissioner rulings with respect to mercury advertising expenses are without merit.
the trades arguments on appeal 
for their part,the trades contend the commissioner interpretation of section f,endorsed by the trial court is inconsistent with the language of the regulation,and is incorrect.the trades also contend that the exclusion of institutional advertising expenses from the rate formula violates the first amendment by imposing a penalty on speech.we address these arguments in turn.
interpretation of section f 
to fully understand the trades argument that the commissioner and the superior court erred in interpreting section f,further explanation of the regulatory scheme,and the superior court decision,is required.
expenses that are excluded from the rate calculation,including institutional advertising expenses,are entered on pages and of the rate application.these pages provide for calculation of a average e xcluded e xpense f actor,which is a percentage determined by dividing total excluded expenses by direct earned premiums.for example,mercury updated application showed a percent excluded expense factor for,which resulted from dividing total excluded expenses of by direct earned premiums of.
section the regulation governing excluded expenses provides that the excluded expense factor is the ratio of the insurer national excluded expenses to its national direct earned premium,italics added.consistent with this,the application calls for the use of c ountrywide direct earned premium and c ountrywide institutional advertising expenses in calculating the excluded expense factor.
in framing the issue regarding the commissioner interpretation of section f,the superior court stated that t he dispute is whether the term specific insurer means only the rate applicant in this case,mercury casualty company or whether it encompasses advertising on behalf of a group of affiliated entities,which are not rate applicants.the court then concluded as follows the commissioner interpretation of the regulation term specific insurer was reasonable.the advertising did not relate specifically to mercury casualty company,the rate applicant.rather it related a large group of affiliates,that were not applying for a rate reduction,and that may or may not do business in the state.accordingly,the commissioner interpretation protects consumers from underwriting advertising expenses of other entities that may not operate in california,and were not applying for the rate adjustment.
construing the superior court conclusion to be that the term specific insurer in section f means the applicant,the trades argue that t his construction of the regulation is not acceptable because it does not match what is calculated as the excluded expense factor.noting that the regulation calls for nationwide,or groupwide,data to calculate the excluded expense factor,the trades argue that i f all advertising for other group affiliates is counted as an excluded expense in the numerator,the numerator and denominator do not contain like data.in other words,the trades posit that under the superior court construction of the regulation,the denominator will consist of the national direct earned premium from all insurers within the group but the numerator will consist of all advertising expenses except those relating to the applicant,including advertising expenses related to specific insurers other than the applicant.the trades contend that the result of such a mismatch is not a proper allocation to a california line of insurance of its proper share of countrywide group expense.
the commissioner responds that advertising for specific affiliates other than the applicant is not excluded under section f.advertising for a specific affiliate any affiliate is not considered institutional and therefore any such expenses are not excluded.so long as the advertising is targeted to a specific insurer,it does not matter what affiliate it is for.moreover,the commissioner points out that there wa s no evidence that any advertising expenses for any specific insurer were excluded here.
this last point is dispositive of the trades argument.the commissioner specifically found that mercury aims its entire advertising budget at promoting the mercury group as a whole and that mercury general does not advertise for its specific insurers and instead engages in advertising on behalf of the organization as a whole.the trades point to no evidence to the contrary.accordingly,it is apparent that here the numerator in the calculation of the excluded expense factor contained no expenses for advertising that related to any specific insurer,whether the applicant mercury casualty company or any other affiliate within the insurance group.thus,the trades argument that the numerator and denominator did not contain like data is without merit.
the trades next argue that the commissioner interpretation of section f is inconsistent with the reality of consumer perception because i f an advertisement makes a point about homeowner insurance,and says mercury,it is an advertisement aimed at obtaining business for the specific insurer writing mercury homeowner insurance.even if this were true,however,the trades point to no evidence that mercury excluded advertising expenses included expenses for any such advertisement.accordingly,the trades have failed to fully develop this argument,and we need not consider it further.
the trades also argue that an advertisement may be aimed at obtaining business for more than one affiliated specific insurer.this argument goes nowhere because the commissioner found that mercury advertising was not aimed at obtaining business for any specific insurer,and the trades point to no evidence to the contrary.
in summary,none of the trades attacks on the commissioner interpretation and application of section f has any merit.
first amendment challenge to section f 
the trades contend that because expenses for advertising that is deemed institutional are excluded from the rate formula,thereby reducing the permitted earned premium,and because the determination of whether advertising qualifies as institutional is based on the content of the advertisements,the institutional advertising regulation amounts to a constitutionally impermissible penalty on speech.we are not persuaded.
at the outset,we reject the argument by the commissioner and consumer watchdog that section f does not implicate the first amendment.for his part,the commissioner asserts that the regulation does not in any way ban speech or compel specific content.this may be so,but that does not mean the regulation is immune from scrutiny under the first amendment.the united states supreme court has recognized that the government burdens on speech must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its bans.sorrell ims health,d.imposing a financial burden on a speaker based on the content of the speaker expression is a restriction of expression and must be analyzed as such.pitt news pappert cir.thus,if section f imposes a burden on mercury speech,it does not matter that the regulation does not ban speech or compel specific content it is nonetheless subject to first amendment scrutiny.
for its part,consumer watchdog contends section f does not place any financial burden on speech,but we disagree.here,the regulation burdened mercury financially because its effect was to exclude all of mercury advertising expenses from the rate formula,which necessarily resulted in a lesser maximum premium rate than mercury would have been allowed if its advertising expenses had been included in the formula.as mercury points out,i f advertising expense is excluded from the dollars permitted in the rate,there is no revenue source from which it can be paid.the insurer can either pay for such advertising out of profit,or stop the advertising.thus,assuming two otherwise identically situated insurers,one of which engaged solely in institutional advertising and the other of which engaged solely in noninstitutional advertising,the advertiser that engaged only in noninstitutional advertising would reap a greater profit because of section f than the advertiser that engaged only in institutional advertising.for this reason,as the trades contend,the regulation burdens speech based on the content of that speech and thus implicates the first amendment.
the next question is whether section f encompasses only commercial speech or whether,as the trades argue,it encompasses both commercial and noncommercial speech.this matters because different levels of scrutiny are implicated depending on whether commercial or noncommercial speech is involved.t he federal constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.citation.for noncommercial speech entitled to full first amendment protection,a regulation is valid under the first amendment only if it can withstand strict scrutiny,which requires that the regulation be narrowly tailored that is,the least restrictive means to promote a compelling government interest.by contrast,regulation of commercial speech based on content is less problematic.citation.to determine the validity of a regulation of commercial speech,the united states supreme court has articulated an test.kasky nike,cal th.
we reject the argument by the commissioner and consumer watchdog that the speech to which section f applies qualifies as commercial speech simply because the regulation pertains to advertising.in bolger youngs drug products d,the united states supreme court held that even though certain pamphlets were conceded to be advertisements,that fact alone did not make them commercial speech because paid advertisements are sometimes used to convey political or other messages unconnected to a product or service or commercial transaction.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,citing bolger,at d at.the bolger court identified three factors advertising format,product references,and commercial motivation that in combination supported a characterization of commercial speech in that case,but the court also rejected the notion that any of these factors is sufficient by itself to support such a characterization and also declined to hold that all of these factors in combination,or any one of them individually,is necessary to support a commercial speech characterization.kasky,at.
here,as the trades argue,section f primarily singles out advertising that may qualify as noncommercial speech for the excluded expense penalty.as we have explained,under the regulation an insurer can not pass on to the consumer the cost of advertising that is not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer that does not provide consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy that specific insurer product.thus,the less commercial the speech is,the more likely it is to fall within the exclusion of section f.it is at least possible that an insurer might engage in advertising that would,at least in some part,be deemed noncommercial speech for first amendment purposes.thus,as the trades contend,section f may sweep within its ambit both commercial and noncommercial speech.for this reason,the regulation is subject to strict scrutiny.see dex media west,city of seattle cir,holding that an ordinance that imposed substantial conditions and costs on the distribution of yellow pages phone directories was subject to strict scrutiny because,a lthough portions of the directories are obviously commercial in nature,the books contain more than that.
we conclude that section f survives that scrutiny.under strict scrutiny,the regulation must be narrowly tailored that is,the least restrictive means to promote a compelling government interest.kasky nike,supra,cal th at.in arguing that the regulation would not survive even the intermediate scrutiny that applies to commercial speech,the trades admit that the regulation serves a legitimate governmental purpose.we have no problem going further and concluding that the regulation promotes a compelling governmental interest.as consumer watchdog characterizes it,it is the interest in prohibiting excessive insurance rates by making sure that only the reasonable costs of providing insurance are included in the rates.more precisely,the regulation promotes the compelling government interest in ensuring that insurers like mercury pass on to consumers through their insurance premiums only expenses for advertising that directly benefits consumers by providing them with information pertinent to the consumers decision whether to buy a specific insurer product.we further conclude that section f is narrowly tailored to serve that purpose.the regulation does not ban insurers like mercury from engaging in advertising that does not directly benefit consumers that is,advertising that is not aimed at obtaining business for a specific insurer and does not provide consumers with information pertinent to the decision whether to buy the specific insurer product.instead,the regulation simply prohibits the insurer from passing the cost of such advertisements on to the consumer.that is,in fact,the least restrictive means available to promote the specific interest at issue.thus,the regulation is narrowly tailored to promote the compelling government interest the regulation serves.
for the foregoing reasons,the trades constitutional challenge to section f is without merit.
section f the constitutional variance 
section f provides that one valid basis for requesting a variance from the maximum rate obtained by applying the regulatory formula is t hat the maximum permitted earned premium would be confiscatory as applied.this is the constitutionally mandated variance articulated in century garamendi cal th which is an end result test applied to the enterprise as a whole.the commissioner determined that mercury did not qualify for the constitutional variance under section f because mercury failed to demonstrate the rate decrease results in deep financial hardship.the superior court agreed with the commissioner that the test for confiscation is deep financial hardship and mercury did not demonstrate deep financial hardship to support its request for a confiscation variance.
on appeal,mercury and the trades assert various errors in this aspect of the commissioner and superior court rulings.first,mercury asserts that the commissioner and superior court erred in holding that rates are constitutionally confiscatory only if they result in financial distress,rather than simply in the inability to earn a fair return.the trades make a similar argument.second,mercury asserts that the commissioner and the superior court erred in determining that the relevant enterprise in assessing confiscation was not mercury homeowners insurance line,but mercury as a whole.again,the trades make a similar argument.mercury and the trades also make some other arguments we will identify more fully below.and the trades argue that the superior court applied the wrong standard of review in addressing the constitutional variance.
the last argument by the trades can be disposed of briefly.inasmuch as section f expressly incorporates principles of constitutional law,and because where the action of an administrative agency infringes constitutionally granted rights,independent judicial review must be invoked kerrigan fair employment practice com.d,it does not matter for our purposes whether,as the trades argue,the superior court improperly deferred to the commissioner in construing and applying section f.engaging in our own independent judicial review,as we must,we will not defer to either the commissioner or the superior court.thus,any error the superior court might have made in this regard was necessarily harmless.
with that out of the way,we turn to the remaining arguments presented on the constitutional variance in section f.
deep financial hardship versus fair return 
because section f expressly refers to century,it is appropriate to begin there.as we have noted,in century the california supreme court review ed the implementation of proposition rate rollback requirement provisions by the insurance commissioner.century,supra,cal th at.as relevant here,the superior court had determined that the rate regulations as to rollbacks we re invalid on their face with respect to the ratemaking formula id.at because,among other things,the ratemaking formula the commissioner adopted preclude d a return covering the insurer cost of service plus percent of its capital base,and through such preclusion,the formula wa s confiscatory id.at.in support of this latter conclusion,the superior court also determined that confiscation does not require deep financial hardship within the meaning of jersey central power light cir.century,at 
the supreme court concluded that i n this regard,the superior court conclusion is substantially erroneous.century,supra,cal th at.in determining the ratemaking formula wa s not confiscatory,the high court began by noting that it would do well to rehearse,and elaborate on,the principles set out in calfarm.century ins,at.the court then explained as follows 
the crucial question under the takings clause is whether the rate set is just and reasonable.citation.if it is not just and reasonable,it is confiscatory.citation.if it is confiscatory,it is invalid.citation.i t is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.citations.the method may of course be traditional,and may involve ratemaking using data reflecting the condition and performance of the regulated firm as an individual entity.but it may also be novel citation,and may implicate formulaic ratemaking citation using data reflecting the condition and performance of a group of regulated firms citations.it is not subject to piecemeal examination the economic judgments required in rate proceedings are often hopelessly complex and do not admit of a single correct result.the constitution is not designed to arbitrate these economic niceties.citation.and,of course,courts are not equipped to carry out such a task.citations.s o long as rates as a whole afford the regulated firm just compensation for its services to the public,they are not confiscatory.citation.that a particular rate may not cover the cost of a particular good or service does not work confiscation in and of itself.citation.in other words,confiscation is judged with an eye toward the regulated firm as an enterprise.
the answer to the question whether the rate set is just and reasonable depends on a balancing of the interests of the producers of the goods or services under regulation and the interests of the consumers of such goods or services.
t he consumer has a legitimate interest in freedom from exploitation.
f or its part,the producer has a legitimate concern with its own financial integrity.from the investor or company point of view it is important that there be enough revenue not only for operating expenses but also for the capital costs of the business.these include service on the debt and dividends on the stock.citation.by that standard the return to the equity owner should be commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks.that return,moreover,should be sufficient to assure confidence in the financial integrity of the enterprise,so as to maintain its credit and to attract capital.citation.
it must be emphasized that the foregoing describes an interest that the producer may pursue and not a right that it can demand.that interest is only one of the variables in the constitutional calculus of reasonableness.citation.a regulated firm has no constitutional right to a profit citations.indeed,such a firm has no constitutional right even against a loss.citation.
in balancing the relevant producer and consumer interests for a just and reasonable rate,one is concerned with a broad zone of reasonableness and not with any particular point therein.citation.so long as the rate set is within that zone,there can be no constitutional objection citation.
in attempting to balance producer and consumer interests,one may of course arrive at a rate that disappoints one or even both parties.but a striking of the balance to the producer detriment does not necessarily work confiscation.indeed,it can threaten confiscation only when it prevents the producer from operating successfully as that phrase is impliedly defined in prior opinions and is expressly used in this,operating successfully during the period of the rate and subject to market conditions.
thus,a producer may complain of confiscation only if the rate in question does not allow it to operate successfully.in a word,the inability to operate successfully is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of confiscation.
in jersey central,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit,sitting in bank,and speaking through judge bork,explained t he only circumstances under which there is a possibility of a taking of investors property by virtue of rate regulation is when a regulated firm is in the sort of financial difficulty described as deep financial hardship.citation.the firm may experience such hardship when it does not earn enough revenue for both operating expenses and the capital costs of the business,including service
