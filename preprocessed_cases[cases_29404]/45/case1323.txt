this is an insurance coverage dispute involving spoiled peanut butter.the peanut butter in question was contained in sealed packets supplied by plaintiff sokol and company sokol to its customer continental mills continental for inclusion in boxes of continental cookie mix.when continental discovered that the peanut butter had gone bad,it retrieved the cookie mix,substituted fresh peanut butter packets,and sought reimbursement from sokol for the costs associated with the replacement.sokol filed notice of continental claim with atlantic mutual insurance company atlantic,its comprehensive general liability cgl insurer.atlantic denied coverage,citing a number of the policy business risk exclusions.sokol then paid continental claim itself and sought indemnification from atlantic under the policy.atlantic again denied coverage and this litigation ensued.
the district court granted summary judgment for atlantic,holding that the insurer had no duty to defend under the policy and this automatically meant there was no duty to indemnify.for this mode of analysis the court relied on language in crum forster managers resolution trust,suggesting a general rule that where there is no duty to defend under an insurance policy,there can never be a duty to indemnify.we think this was an overreading of the illinois supreme court decision.the language in question,though broad on its face,must be read in context,and this case arises in a different one.we affirm on other grounds,however.the claim at issue here does not involve property damage within the meaning of the policy,and even if it did,coverage is excluded under certain of the policy business risk exclusions.summary judgment in favor of the insurer was therefore appropriate.
background 
sokol is an illinois food products manufacturer that supplied sealed packets of peanut butter paste to continental for inclusion in boxes of continental cookie mix.in late august sokol sent a shipment of peanut butter paste to continental.in october,after the paste packets were incorporated into the cookie mix boxes and shipped to before,it seems,any cookie mix was sold to the consuming discovered that the peanut butter was rancid.sokol denied the peanut butter was rancid,asserting it was simply off taste,but this disagreement is irrelevant to the present appeal.continental retrieved all of the affected boxes,removed the packets of spoiled peanut butter,and substituted new paste that it acquired from a different vendor.in november continental demanded payment from sokol for these costs.sokol notified atlantic,its cgl insurer,of continental claim,requesting a defense and indemnification.sokol sent atlantic a preliminary claim summary indicating that continental loss was but that additional expenses would likely accrue.indeed,continental eventually sought payment from sokol in the amount of.
in letters to sokol dated april,and june,atlantic took the position that while continental claim amounted to property damage caused by an occurrence under the policy main insuring agreement,coverage was excluded by certain of the business risk exclusions in the policy.atlantic reserved its right to rely on other policy provisions or exclusions and expressly stated it was not waiving its rights or obligations under the policy.sokol then paid continental demand in full and filed a claim for indemnification with atlantic.atlantic again declined coverage.
sokol then sued atlantic in cook county circuit court.atlantic,a new york corporation,removed the case to district court shortly thereafter the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for atlantic,concluding that because continental had not filed an action in court against suit in the terminology of the policy insuring duty to defend was not triggered.the court then summarily concluded atlantic had no duty to indemnify,relying on the illinois supreme court statement in crum forster that where there is no duty to defend,there will be no duty to indemnify.crum forster,at.sokol appealed.
ii.discussion 
under illinois law,the construction of an insurance policy is a question of law,and the court goal is to determine the intent of the contracting parties.outboard marine liberty mut.ins.we look to the policy as a whole with due regard to the risk undertaken,the subject matter that is insured,and the purposes of the entire contract.id.unambiguous policy language is given its plain,ordinary,and popular meaning.id.our review is de novo.
duty to to indemnify 
the cgl basic coverage grant is contained in section a of the insuring agreement,which states in relevant part 
we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance does not apply.
by this policy language,atlantic assumed a duty to defend sokol against any suit seeking damages for sums that sokol became legally obligated to pay as a result of bodily injury or property damage.the policy defines suit as a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury,or advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged.atlantic argues,and the district court held,that atlantic had no duty to defend sokol against continental claim because continental had not filed a suit for damages within the meaning of the policy coverage grant rather,sokol payment was a voluntary payment in response to continental demand.see steel prot.mut.ins,construing an all risks insurance policy providing a duty to defend against suits but leaving the term undefined,court holds that suits unambiguously refer to proceedings in a court of law.
the present dispute,however,is not about the insurer duty to defend.this is a claim for indemnification coverage,and the coverage grant pertaining to indemnification does not contain the same limiting language requiring the existence of a suit.the district court,however,viewed the absence of a duty to defend because there was no suit as automatically precluding indemnification coverage.for this proposition the court cited a passage from the illinois supreme court decision in crum forster,which appears to state a general rule that where there is no duty to defend,there will be no duty to indemnify.crum forster,at.invoking this language,the court summarily held that atlantic had no duty to indemnify sokol for its payment to continental.
the district court reliance on crum forster was misplaced.in crum forster,the insurers filed an action seeking a determination of their duty to defend and indemnify a group of insureds in an underlying lawsuit.id.at.the illinois supreme court first noted that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.the former arises even if the facts alleged in the underlying complaint fall potentially within the policy coverage,whereas the latter only arises if the facts alleged actually fall within coverage.id.at emphasis added.the court concluded that since the facts of the complaint filed against the insureds did not potentially fall within the coverages of the policies at issue,no duty to defend arose under the terms of those policies.
having determined that the insurers had no duty to defend their insureds in the underlying action,the illinois supreme court went on to explain that in cases such as the instant case where no duty to defend exists and the facts alleged do not even fall potentially within the insurance coverage,such facts alleged could obviously never actually fall within the scope of coverage.id.in the next line the language at issue here appears c learly,where there is no duty to defend,there will be no duty to indemnify.id.
in the circumstances of this case,the district court reliance on this statement in crum forster was a mistake.both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify were at issue in crum forster there was an underlying suit,and the existence of both
