kenny werdehausen had neck surgery and submitted a benefits claim under his employer group health plan reflected in an insurance policy issued by benicorp insurance company.in reviewing the claim,benicorp discovered that werdehausen had failed to disclose the need for neck surgery in his policy enrollment application.benicorp determined that this was a material misrepresentation because disclosure would have increased the employer group health policy premium by per month the estimated cost of the surgery spread over two years.benicorp retroactively rescinded werdehausen enrollment and denied all pending claims for plan benefits submitted by werdehausen and his wife.the werdehausens sued.
after benicorp removed their state court action,the werdehausens filed an amended complaint seeking to recover plan benefits under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et and alleging that benicorp violated the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa,stat,by engaging in health status discrimination,and violated the missouri health care utilization review act mhcura,by denying insurance coverage for preauthorized medical treatment.the district court granted benicorp summary judgment on the erisa claims,dismissed the hipaa claim,and held the mhcura claim preempted by erisa.the werdehausens appeal.we reverse.
background 
werdehausen became a participant in the group health plan in.his employer changed insurers to benicorp at the end of.to remain participants,werdehausen and other employees had to complete benicorp enrollment application form.the form required disclosure of werdehausen medical history,including any condition that he knew might require benicorp underwriters then used in setting the group health policy premium,of which was paid by the employer.the form stated that werdehausen answers must be true and complete and warned that misstatements or omissions of information may be basis for denying payment of a claim or voiding coverage entirely.werdehausen november,application disclosed that he had undergone lower back surgery in april but did not disclose that a doctor told him on october,that he would eventually need surgery for a herniated disc in his neck.werdehausen claims the nondisclosure was innocent he expected benicorp to obtain his full medical records from the doctor listed in the application.
when werdehausen submitted a claim to recover the costs of his neck surgery,benicorp obtained and thoroughly reviewed his prior medical records from various medical providers.these records revealed that werdehausen was first treated for neck pain in september,was advised in march that he needed neck surgery but elected to have back surgery first,and was again advised in october that he would eventually need neck surgery.
benicorp lengthy group policy included the following general provisions 
if an insured employee or insured person misstatement of facts affects amount or type of insurance,the truth shall be used in deciding the coverage in force,if any.premiums benefits may be adjusted to reflect premium coverage for the age or medical condition of the insured person.
termination for material misstatements 
we reserve the right to terminate the coverage of an insured person who has made a material misstatement in their group enrollment form.
the certificate book provided to werdehausen also contained these provisions.on august,benicorp sent werdehausen a letter reviewing his medical history in detail and concluding 
had your actual medical history been revealed in the application for insurance the coverage for your employer group would have been issued at a higher premium rate.therefore your coverage has been rescinded pursuant to our rights as set forth in the application for insurance,the policy and the certificate booklet the result of this action is to void your coverage back to the effective date,as though it was never in effect.consequently,no benefits are payable for any expenses incurred by your family.
werdehausen timely appealed this decision.benicorp claim review committee affirmed and advised werdehausen of its adverse decision in a lengthy letter dated september.
ii.the erisa standard of review dispute 
the group health policy granted benicorp discretionary authority to interpret the policy and determine eligibility for benefits.such a plan provision normally triggers judicial review of a benefits denial under a deferential standard.however,if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d quotation omitted.to obtain the advantage of less deferential review,the claimant must show a palpable financial conflict of interest that has a connection to the substantive decision reached and raises serious doubts as to whether the result reached was the product of an arbitrary decision or the plan administrator whim.sahulka lucent,cir quotations omitted.
in the district court,the werdehausens argued that benicorp operated under such a conflict of interest.the district court properly allowed discovery on this issue.the werdehausens deposed brad meyers,benicorp claim review manager who signed the two letters advising of the adverse claim decision.meyers testified 
q so the insurance policy says that you can,in the case of a misstatement,amend or revise the premium retroactively is that correct 
a the werdehausen policy says that premiums may be adjusted to reflect the age or medical condition of the insured person.so we do have the option to adjust the premium 
q however,the company practice and policy is that you never adjust the premium is that correct 
a the current company policy is that we do not,yes.
q and was that the policy that was in effect at the time the werdehausen case was handled 
q so in the process of handling the werdehausen case,neither you nor anybody else with benicorp ever considered adjustment of premium 
a no.we followed company policy and performed the rescission.
the district court concluded that benicorp had a financial conflict of interest but was nonetheless entitled to deferential review because the werdehausens failed to prove that the conflict of interest caused a breach of fiduciary duty.consistent with review,the court then limited its review of the merits of benicorp decision to the administrative record before the claims administrators.
iii.the erisa claims 
the parties raise many complex issues on appeal.but in our view the problem boils down to a relatively focused issue of erisa law that in turn reveals a genuine issue of disputed fact precluding the grant of summary judgment on this record.
in shipley arkansas blue cross blue shield,cir,an employee enrolled in his employer benefit plan and failed to disclose repeated prior treatments for symptoms of emphysema.some months later,when the employee was diagnosed with cancer and emphysema,the insurer rescinded the policy and the employee sued.we joined other circuits in concluding that federal common law allows for the equitable rescission of an insurance policy that is procured through the material misstatements or omissions of the insured.at.applying the standard of review,we upheld the insurer decision to rescind the policy because the application form clearly limited coverage for preexisting conditions and therefore the were material in determining the extent of coverage and premium amounts.at.
in this case,the benicorp policy expressly authorized rescission for material misstatements in the enrollment application.in granting summary judgment dismissing the werdehausens erisa claims,the district court noted that shipley permits rescission for knowing material misstatements,even if not made with fraudulent intent.applying the standard of review,the court concluded that werdehausen were material because,had benicorp known of his cervical problems,it would have issued coverage at a significantly higher premium rate.we agree with the court analysis of these issues,which the werdehausens virtually concede on appeal.
however,shipley permits
