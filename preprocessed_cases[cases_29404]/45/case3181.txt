background 
citizens,and its subsidiary cica are colorado corporations with their principal places of business in austin,texas.riley and oliver are officers and directors of citizens.citizens sells life insurance policies cica policies through foreign insurance agents exclusively to persons outside of the united states.the purchasers reside in over countries including the united states.the cica policies allow policyholders to assign policy dividends and other benefits to offshore trusts.the trusts use the assigned dividends and other benefits to purchase common stock in citizens.each year since there have been approximately cica policies in effect,with each policyholder paying an average annual premium of around.id.at.at least percent of these policyholders have assigned their policy dividends and other benefits to the offshore trusts.id.
the cica policies are not registered with the texas state securities board,texas department of insurance,nor any other regulatory body in the united states,although the common stock purchased with policy dividends is listed on the american stock exchange.similarly,neither citizens nor its salespersons have registered with any regulatory body in texas or elsewhere in the united states.citizens also asserts that the cica policies are not subject to regulation in the countries in which the policyholders reside.
on august,delia bolanos andrade and luis martin tapia alberti,both residents and citizens of colombia,south america,filed a class action against citizens in texas state court.the original petition alleged several causes of action related to the cica policies,including violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act,breach of contract,fraud,fraud in the inducement,negligent misrepresentation,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,violations of the texas insurance code,equitable reformation of the policies,conspiracy to plan and implement this scheme,and unjust enrichment and the imposition of a constructive trust.on december,the class plaintiffs filed a second amended original petition to add a cause of action under the texas securities act for selling securities in this state without first being registered.see.arts,by this time seven new plaintiffs had been added to the lawsuit,including daccach.
on june,daccach filed a motion for class certification in which he sought designation as the class representative and alleged against citizens only one class claim selling or offering securities from texas in the form of the cica policies without registering with the texas securities board.see.stat.arts,d.daccach expressly disclaimed any intention to pursue the other causes of action in the class suit.in the sixth amended petition,filed the same day as the first amended motion for class certification,the other plaintiffs pled the original claims against citizens as individuals,not as class representatives.the trial court has not ruled on daccach motion to sever the class claims.
challenging daccach motion for class certification,citizens argued that texas law should not apply to this worldwide class action and that daccach abandonment of claims defeats certification prerequisites.in response,daccach presented alternate choice of law analyses all of which directed the application of texas law,but none of his theories analyzed the laws of other jurisdictions.
after conducting a hearing,the trial court granted daccach motion in a class certification order.the order trial plan identified four issues to be resolved at trial whether a cica policy is a security pursuant to the securities act including the question of whether the cica policies fall within an insurance exception to the securities act whether citizens sold or offered for sale the cica policies from texas the calculation of the statutory remedy pursuant to the securities act and attorney fees.the order defined the class as follows 
the class consists of all persons,who,during the class period august,through the date the class is certified purchased a cica policy and executed an assignment to a trust for the purchase of citizens,stock,or paid any money that,pursuant to a cica policy and assignment to a trust,was for the purchase of citizens,stock,or were entitled to any cash benefits from a cica policy that,pursuant to a cica policy and assignment to a trust,were for the purchase of citizens,stock.specifically excluded from the class are all persons who,within the time period established by the judgment,do not surrender their cica policies and take the other actions required to obtain the relief awarded by the court.
citizens brought an interlocutory appeal challenging the trial court certification order.see.civ.prac.a.citizens argued that the trial court abused its discretion in granting daccach motion for class certification.first,citizens challenged the adequacy of the trial court class definition.second,it argued that the trial court failed to conduct a proper choice of law analysis to determine whether common issues predominate over individual issues.third,citizens argued that the trial court failed to adequately establish the class certification prerequisites.the court of appeals rejected all three points,holding that the class definition,after a modification,precisely ascertains the class members the trial court was not required to engage in a most significant relationship choice of law analysis and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the class certification requirements had been met.at.
citizens then petitioned this court for review.specifically,citizens contends that the court of appeals erred in affirming the certification of an improper class,whose members are not presently ascertainable,and eviscerating material defenses not applying the most significant relationship test to resolve issues determining that common legal and factual issues predominate despite that calculating attorney fees will be an overwhelming task requiring the discovery and resolution of circumstances surrounding life insurance sales in over fifty foreign jurisdictions affirming that a class action is superior to individual claims despite the fact that certification requires dismissal of ten of the eleven original claims and that this is not a negative value suit agreeing,without explanation,that the trial court will be able to implement the statutory remedy of rescission even though the beneficial interests of the policies are held in offshore trusts not parties to this case affirming that texas rule of civil procedure a typicality requirement was met despite the presence of a statute of limitations defense against the class plaintiff and the class plaintiff dismissal of ten of the eleven originally alleged claims and holding that previously asserted,and now abandoned,individual claims of class members would not be barred by res judicata,thereby reading rule as an exception to the court transactional approach to claim preclusion.we granted citizens petition for review.
ii.jurisdiction 
section a of the texas civil practice and remedies code allows the interlocutory appeal of class certification orders.although interlocutory appeals are generally final in the courts of appeals,this court has jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal if th
