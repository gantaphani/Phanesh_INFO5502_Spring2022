suopys seeks flood insurance coverage for damage to his forked river,new jersey summer home sustained on or about june,due to tropical storm allison.suopys timely notified omaha of the property damage.by early july,omaha claims adjuster inspected the property and observed damage including moisture in the house,water around the doors and carpet edges and upheaval of the concrete slab on which the house was situated.the adjuster indicated that the claim for the amount after depreciation and deductibles should be paid by omaha within two months of its receipt.having not received payment by september,suopys inquired of the adjuster as to the status of his claim and was informed by the adjuster that payment would be forthcoming.
omaha notified suopys by letter dated september,that his claim remained open beyond the period for submitting a proof of loss and indicated that it could either close the claims file without payment,or close it with a possible payment if a proof of loss was received by october.omaha requested that suopys contact the adjuster to determine his response given that omaha did not have authority under the sfip to act on any request for an extension of time to file a proof of loss.omaha letter also contained a reservation of all rights under the policy.
on october,suopys provided the adjuster with a signed and notarized proof of loss and the national flood insurance program final report adjuster report.omaha received the proof of loss and adjuster report on october.shortly thereafter,omaha determined that there was no sfip coverage for the claimed damage as it was not caused by tropical storm allison or by a flood.rather,as the adjuster revised report reflected,although there was a general and temporary condition of flooding as a result of tropical storm allison,the concrete slab upheaval resulted from possible subterrain flooding or ground movement over time by letter dated december,omaha denied suopys claim on the ground that there was no general condition of flooding at the property on the reported date of loss,which is required to trigger sfip coverage 
suopys filed a complaint in the district court asserting that omaha breached its contract with suopys in denying flood insurance coverage and sought benefits under the sfip omaha sought summary judgment on the ground that suopys claim was barred for failure to submit a sworn proof of loss within days of the date of the alleged flood loss.suopys countered that he complied with the terms of the sfip regarding proof of loss in light of the representations made by omaha in its september,correspondence indicating that it would accept the proof of loss if filed by october,despite the fact that more than days had passed.he argued that omaha representation constituted a waiver of his obligation to submit proof of loss within days of the date of the claimed flood loss or,alternatively,that omaha waived the proof of loss requirement by accepting the adjuster report in lieu of the proof of loss.
the district court concluded that suopys claim was barred for failure to submit a proof of loss within days of the date of the loss and that there was no waiver of that filing requirement.although the failure to timely file the proof of loss standing alone warranted entry of summary judgment in favor of omaha,the district court further held that omaha would be entitled to summary judgment because the claimed property damage was not covered under the flood insurance policy as it was caused by earth movement rather than by land subsidence.
our jurisdiction over this appeal is premised on.we apply plenary review to the grant of summary judgment in favor of omaha.van holt,at cir.
federal common law governs the interpretation of the sfip.linder,at.the sfip is construed in accordance with its plain,unambiguous meaning,in order to fashion uniform interpretation throughout the country and avoid state to state coverage variances.id.while we apply standard insurance principles to construe the sfip,general doctrines of waiver and estoppel do not apply when the insurer is an agent of the united states.gowland aetna,cir quoting office of personnel management richmond,d any exercise of a power granted by the constitution to one of the other branches of government is limited by a valid reservation of congressional control over funds in the treasury.
because any claim paid by a wyo company is a direct charge to the united states treasury,strict adherence to the conditions precedent to payment is required.federal crop ins.merrill.holding that insured must strictly comply with all terms and conditions of federal insurance policy and recognizing duty of courts to observe conditions defined by congress for charging the public treasury van holt,at flick liberty mutual,cir,cert.denied,d strict compliance applied to policies written by wyo companies under the nfip because flood loss claims are paid from united states treasury.
mindful of these principles,we address the merits of suopys waiver argument omaha waived the period for providing proof of loss when in its september,correspondence to suopys,it represented it would accept a proof of loss if submitted by october,and omaha waived the proof of loss requirements in accepting a signed and notarized adjuster report on october.
as to whether omaha waived the period for providing proof of loss when in its september,correspondence to suopys,it represented it would accept a proof of loss if submitted by october,the sfip provides
