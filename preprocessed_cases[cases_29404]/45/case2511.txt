civil code section section authorizes the award of an enhanced to three times greater than the amount of a fine,civil penalty or any other remedy the purpose or effect of which is to punish or deter that would otherwise be actions by or on behalf of senior citizens or disabled persons seeking to redress unfair or deceptive acts or practices or unfair methods of competition.is this enhanced remedy available in a private action by senior citizens seeking restitution under california unfair competition law bus,et 
the unambiguous language of section encompasses actions under the unfair competition law brought by or on behalf of senior citizens,even those initiated by private plaintiffs seeking only restitution.although section is limited to actions involving remedies intended to punish or deter,deterrence of illegal acts is both an important aim and a recognized effect of a restitution remedy under the unfair competition law.see,korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,korea supply bank of the west superior court cal th,d.
nonetheless,as both real party in interest and the amici curiae forcefully argue,because the enhanced remedy authorized by section is similar in many respects to an award of punitive damages,permitting a treble restitution recovery appears to contradict the rule that private plaintiffs in actions under the unfair competition law may not receive damages,much less treble damages communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.the legislative history of section is unhelpful on this point,neither indicating a clear intent to modify this accepted principle of unfair competition jurisprudence nor reflecting an understanding that the sweeping language in section of senate bill reg.sess,which enacted section,was to be given a restrictive interpretation.accordingly,we are left with the language of section itself,which on its face applies to senior citizens or disabled persons seeking restitution under the unfair competition law.
because the trial court concluded section is inapplicable to private actions seeking restitution under the unfair competition law,we grant the petition for writ of mandate filed by james clark,orville camien,mary and carmen armstrong on behalf of themselves and as representatives of a certified class of certain senior citizens and direct respondent los angeles superior court to vacate its order of november,granting national western life insurance company national western motion for judgment on the pleadings and enter a new and different order denying that motion.
factual and procedural background 
the certified class action 
this action,originally filed in september by clark,a senior citizen,alleges national western utilized deceptive business practices to induce the purchase of annuity contracts with large surrender penalties in violation of,among other things,the unfair competition law.in december a third amended complaint was filed naming the petitioners as plaintiffs and including class action allegations.the third amended complaint alleged violations of the unfair competition law,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and fraud and sought,in part,restitution of the improper surrender penalties and enhanced remedies for each cause of action under section.
in february the trial court granted,in part,petitioner motion for class certification,certifying a class consisting of a ll california residents who purchased national western life insurance company deferred annuities when they were age or older under specified certificate forms.however,the court permitted the class to proceed only on the unfair competition claim the court also certified a subclass of approximately class individuals who purchased annuities sold by ezra chapman and ruled the subclass could proceed against chapman and national western on both the fraud claim and the unfair competition claim 
national western motions for judgment on the pleadings and summary adjudication 
on july,national western filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,asserting section enhanced,treble damages remedy was inapplicable to a private action under the unfair competition law.on the same date,national western filed a motion for summary adjudication presenting the identical argument.in addition,the summary adjudication motion argued punitive damages were not available for the subclass fraud claim because plaintiffs could not establish that national western had ratified chapman conduct or had engaged in any behavior warranting the imposition of punitive damages.
on november,the court granted national western motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend,concluding section is inapplicable to a private action seeking restitution under the unfair competition law because restitution,the only available remedy,does not have the purpose or effect of punishment or deterrence.the court denied national western motion for summary adjudication,finding triable issues of material fact existed as to whether the subclass common law fraud claim warranted punitive damages.
the instant petition 
on december,plaintiffs petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings and to enter a new order denying the motion.after requesting and receiving an informal opposition to the petition,on december,this court issued an order to show cause as to why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted.on january,national western filed its return,and on february,plaintiffs filed their reply.

overview of the consumer protection legislation providing additional penalties and enhanced remedies for unfair or deceptive practices perpetrated against senior citizens or disabled persons 
since the unfair competition law has prohibited unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practices or unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising bus,and subjected violators in actions prosecuted by public prosecutors to civil penalties not exceeding for each violation bus,as well as to injunctions and restitution orders bus.private plaintiffs may also prosecute actions under the unfair competition law,but their remedies are limited to orders for injunctions and restitution.bus.damages and penalties,whether compensatory or punitive,are prohibited.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,only monetary relief available to private plaintiffs under unfair competition law is restitution compensatory and punitive damages are not authorized kasky nike,cal th,d,i n a suit under unfair competition law,a public prosecutor may collect civil penalties,but a private plaintiff remedies are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution,supra,cal th at,d,under unfair competition law p laintiffs may not receive damages,much less treble damages,or attorney fees.
in,citing statistics from the california department of justice and the international association of chiefs of police indicating senior citizens were the most frequent victims of consumer fraud and deceptive business practices,often with tragic consequences,the state department of consumer affairs urged the legislature to strengthen the consumer protection laws to protect senior citizens from consumer fraud senate bill reg.sess,passed by the legislature in september and signed by the governor and enacted into law later that month see stats,ch,was the culmination of that effort.
a.the evolution of senate bill 
as originally sponsored by the department of consumer affairs and introduced by senator ed davis on march,senate bill simply added a new section to the business and professions code,providing civil penalties for violation of business and professions code section would be not less than or more than for each violation if the victim of the violation is years old or older the enhanced civil penalty was to be collected in an enforcement action initiated by the attorney general or a designated local prosecutor pursuant to business and professions code section.
the attorney general opposed the legislation.in an april,letter to senator davis,attorney general van de kamp explained existing law,which under business and professions code section provided for a civil penalty up to per violation of the unfair competition law,gave the courts broad discretion to tailor civil penalties to the specific features of each case and cautioned the mandatory penalty scheme envisioned by senate bill would create administrative nightmares at best,and may well be unconstitutional,letter to senator ed davis re bill reg.sess.
amendments to senate bill in may eliminated the mandatory minimum civil penalty of for each violation of business and professions code section,specifying instead a civil penalty of not more than for each violation.the attorney general office acknowledged the amendments eliminated the major problems it had identified in the original bill but still opposed it because the bill accomplishes no demonstrable purpose and creates ambiguities,constitutional questions,difficult law enforcement problems and uncertainties where none now exist.senior assist.herschel elkins,mem.to assist.jeff fuller,re bill reg.sess.may.in a may,analysis of the legislation provided to the department of consumer affairs,senior assistant attorney general herschel elkins observed,of course,the author is seeking greater protection for senior citizens.perhaps greater personal remedies in the actions brought by those consumers might be helpful.of greatest help,of course,would be additional personnel to allow agencies to bring actions in areas in which victims are more likely to be senior citizens.ibid.
the staff of the department of consumer affairs attempted to resolve some of the attorney general concerns about the enforcement of proposed new business and professions code section with additional amendments.it also sought to implement the suggestion of creating greater personal remedies for senior citizens by proposing in the same bill new language in the consumers legal remedies act,et clra authorizing the recovery of three times actual damages,as well as reasonable attorney fees,when the victim of a violation of the crla is a senior citizen.the attorney general office responded to this series of proposals by preparing draft language for a new section of the civil code,which would have authorized the court,when it was otherwise authorized by statute to impose a fine,penalty or any other remedy for the purpose of punishment or deterrence,to consider in setting the amount to impose various factors relating to the impact of the defendant conduct on senior citizens.see consumer affairs,letter to senior assist.herschel elkins,june.
following further refinements to these draft proposals by the department of consumer affairs and senator davis staff,senate bill was amended on july,to provide for addition of section to the business and professions code,authorizing imposition of a civil penalty not to exceed in addition to the civil penalty that may be assessed and recovered in a civil action under business and professions code section amendment of civil code section to permit recovery by senior citizens of three times actual damages in private actions under the clra and e addition of section authorizing the trier of fact,whenever it finds one or more of the factors listed in subdivision b of the new section relating to the effect of the defendant conduct on senior citizens,to impose a fine,penalty or other remedy that is greater than it would impose in the absence of that factor.
the scheduled hearing on senate bill reg.sess.as amended july,was cancelled at the request of senator davis.no further action was taken on the bill until april,when it was to committee following additional amendments by senator davis.these april amendments extended the bill coverage to disabled persons,as well as to senior citizens,and narrowed the focus from senior citizens and disabled persons generally to those who are more vulnerable to harm than the average consumer,have been specifically targeted as the victims of consumer fraud or have suffered significant harm that relates to their status as senior citizens or disabled persons.the proposed clra amendments eliminated the trebling of actual damages in senior citizen cases and provided instead,in addition to other remedies that may otherwise be available,an award of up to when the trier of fact finds the senior citizen or disabled person suffered substantial physical,emotional or economic damage from the defendant conduct and makes an affirmative finding in regard to one or more of the enumerated factors involving senior citizens or disabled persons as victims of consumer fraud now set forth in the bill proposed section.see bill reg.sess.as amended.
the reach of proposed section was expressly limited by the april amendments,so that it no longer applied in any action brought by or on behalf of senior citizens or disabled persons,but only in actions to redress unfair or deceptive acts or practices or unfair methods of competition.see bill reg.sess.as amended.in addition to simply considering the factors relating to the impact of the defendant conduct on senior citizens and disabled persons in fixing the amount of an otherwise authorized fine,penalty or other remedy for the purpose of punishment or deterrence,however,as amended proposed section permitted the trier of fact to impose additional amounts up to three times the remedy otherwise available.moreover,just as the enhanced clra remedy the factors identified in the enhanced remedy specified in proposed section,the amended section adopted the definitions of senior citizen and disabled person that would be included in the clra.ibid.
after some final,technical amendments to conform the legislation to another bill passed in the same session,senate bill reg.sess.as amended june,was passed by the legislature in august and signed by the governor on september.see stats,ch.
b.the final version of the senior citizen and disabled person legislation 
as the review of the development and final adoption of senate bill makes plain,the legislation was the product of the department of consumer affairs effort to strengthen the role of the attorney general and other public prosecutors in protecting senior citizens and disabled persons from unfair business practices and the fully complementary,but nonetheless distinct,preference of the attorney general office to create greater private remedies for senior citizens who have been targeted as victims of consumer fraud.as finally enacted the legislation effected three major changes to california consumer protection laws relating to senior citizens and disabled persons.first,it amended the unfair competition law by adding business and professions code section which authorizes the attorney general and prosecutors in civil enforcement proceedings to recover an added civil penalty up to in addition to the civil penalty available under business and professions code section when the unfair practice is perpetrated against a senior citizen or disabled person.see bus,stats,ch.
second,it amended the clra to authorize private litigants to recover,in addition to other remedies available under the act,including compensatory and punitive damages,an additional monetary to the unfair practice prohibited by the act is perpetrated against a senior citizen or disabled person,subd.b a c stats,ch.
third,it added section to the civil code,authorizing an enhanced remedy in actions brought by or on behalf of senior citizens seeking redress for unfair or deceptive acts or practices or unfair methods of competition,subd.a.section,subdivision a,limits the new provision to actions brought by,or on behalf of,or for the benefit of senior citizens or disabled persons,as those terms are defined in subdivisions f and g of civil code section to redress unfair or deceptive acts or practices or unfair methods of competition.section,subdivision b,provides the enhanced remedy whenever a trier of fact is authorized by a statute to impose either a fine,or a civil penalty or other penalty,or any other remedy the purpose or effect of which is to punish or deter,and the amount of the fine,penalty,or other remedy is subject to the trier of fact discretion,the trier of fact shall consider all of the following factors,in addition to other appropriate factors,in determining the amount of fine,civil penalty or other penalty,or other remedy to impose.whenever the trier of fact makes an affirmative finding in regard to one or more of the following factors,it may impose a fine,civil penalty or other penalty,or other remedy in an amount up to three times greater than authorized by the statute,or,where the statute does not authorize a specific amount,up to three times greater than the amount the trier of fact would impose in the absence of that affirmative finding.
section may be used to enhance a restitution award 
the trial court granted national western motion for judgment on the pleadings because,in its view,restitution,the only monetary relief available to private litigants under the unfair competition law,does not have the purpose or effect of punishment or deterrence,a prerequisite to application of section enhanced,treble recovery.echoing that conclusion,national western asserts restitution under the unfair competition law is intended to restore money or property acquired by the defendant,not to deter unlawful conduct.that interpretation of the nature of a restitution remedy,potentially applicable not only in private actions under the unfair competition law but also in lawsuits alleging violation of a variety of other consumer protection statutes,is unduly cramped 
in determining whether section applies when an action has been brought by senior citizens seeking restitution for fraud or deceptive business practices,we are,of course,guided by principles of statutory construction.our fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature intent and thereby effectuate the purpose of the statute.olson automobile club of southern california cal th,d,smith superior court cal th,d.we begin with the statutory language because it is generally the most reliable indication of legislative intent.miklosy regents of university of california cal th,d.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.day city of fontana cal th,d,see also smith,at,d.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.day,at,d.we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.people pieters cal d,see also stone street capital,llc california state lottery,supra,th at,d w e presume that the legislature,when enacting a statute,was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.
under the plain language of section two prerequisites must be satisfied before its enhanced remedy may apply the action must be brought by or on behalf of senior citizens or disabled persons seeking redress for unfair or deceptive acts or practices or unfair methods of competition plainly satisfied here and the action must be one in which the trier of fact is authorized by a statute to impose a fine,civil penalty or any other penalty the purpose or effect of which is to punish or deter.
deterrence of or deceptive business practices is a purpose or effect of the unfair competition law restitution remedy 
contrary to the trial court conclusion,california courts have long recognized that restitution awarded under the unfair competition law has a deterrent purpose and effect.see bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,purpose of restitution order under bus,is to deter future violations of the unfair trade practice statute and to foreclose retention by the violator of its gains korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,deterrence of unfair practices is important goal of unfair competition law,though not sole objective fletcher security pacific national bank cal d,unfair competition law vests trial court with broad authority to fashion remedies that effectively prevent unfair trade practices and deter the defendant,and similar entities,from engaging in such practices in the future colgan leatherman tool group,th,d u nder the false advertising and unfair competition laws,the remedy of restitution serves two to the plaintiff monies in which he or she has an interest and deterring the offender from future violations people ex rel.kennedy beaumont investment,th,d,statutory restitution under unfair competition law is not solely intended to benefit the victims by the return of money,but instead is designed to penalize a defendant for past unlawful conduct and thereby deter future violations.the deterrent effect of a restitution remedy under the unfair competition law was most recently articulated in in re tobacco ii cases may,cal th,cal.rptr d,wl cal.lexis,in which the supreme court noted in the context of interpreting proposition impact on class actions that its holdings in prior nonrestitutionary disgorgement cases did not overrule any part of fletcher security pacific national bank,supra,cal d,under which restitution may be ordered without individualized proof of deception,reliance,and injury if necessary to prevent the use or employment of an unfair practice.in re tobacco ii cases,at,fn,d at,at.
although acknowledging that deterrence may be an effect of a restitution remedy,national western emphasizes t he object of restitution is to restore the status quo by returning to the plaintiff funds in which he or she has an ownership interest korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,and argues applying section in a private action seeking restitution under the unfair competition law would transform the remedy and,in effect,allow an award of damages under the guise of restitution,something the supreme court has specifically held is prohibited.see,korea supply,at,d,disgorgement of profits in which plaintiff has no ownership interest is not permitted under the unfair competition law even though it would have a deterrent effect a court can not,under the equitable powers of bus,award whatever form of monetary relief it believes might deter unfair practices see also day v.at t th,d the intent of bus,restitution remedy is to make whole,equitably,the victim of an unfair practice.while it may be that an order of restitution will also serve to deter future improper conduct,in the absence of a measurable loss the section does not allow the imposition of a monetary sanction merely to achieve this deterrent effect.nor is the section intended as a punitive provision,though it may fortuitously have that sting when properly applied to restore a victim to wholeness.
national western argument misapprehends korea supply,supra,cal th,d,as well as,supra,cal th,d.both cases hold the court equitable powers to fashion a remedy under the unfair competition law,while broad,are not unlimited and can not serve as justification for awarding plaintiff damages,even when such an award is consistent with the unfair competition law purpose of deterrence.neither case suggests enhanced remedies may not be available to private litigants under a different,express legislative mandate authorizing them.
unlike korea supply and,in this case the plaintiffs do not seek to justify monetary relief other than restitution under the unfair competition law the enhanced remedy is sought under section,a separate statute,which specifically authorizes such an enhanced remedy in unfair competition actions brought by senior citizens.we simply must presume the legislature meant what it said when it provided section applied in unfair competition actions involving a fine,civil penalty or any other remedy the purpose of which is to punish or deter.see people toney cal th,d,i f the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs accord,genlyte group,llc workers comp.appeals bd.th,d see also hood hartford life accident insurance d,t he text of the statute clearly indicates that section applies to the uca unfair competition law and the clra,as both acts prohibit unfair practices.
national western insists section separate authorization for an enhanced remedy in unfair competition cases is immaterial.other statutes,it notes,also authorize the recovery of treble or punitive damages see,code civ,authorizing punitive damages in action for professional negligence against health care provider under certain circumstances,subd.e authorizing punitive damages in actions involving destruction or alteration of fine art but those provisions have never been used to justify a treble damage award under the unfair competition law.in fact,it argues,the supreme court has repeatedly held punitive damages,authorized under civil code section for acts involving oppression,fraud or malice,are not permitted under the unfair competition law.see korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,supra,cal th at,d,treble damages not permitted under unfair competition law.
national western statutory analogies miss the mark.code of civil procedure section is applicable to professional negligence actions,not unfair competition actions.civil code section,authorizing a separate action for the destruction of fine art,provides a separate cause of action and includes within that action possible remedies of compensatory damages,punitive damages and attorney fees,not an enhanced remedy in an unfair competition action.
moreover,although national western likens civil code section general authorization of punitive damages to section trebling authorization,the two statutes are quite different.civil code section is a general punitive damages statute.section,in contrast,is a specific mandate of an enhanced remedy in actions by senior citizens or disabled persons asserting unfair competition.to suggest it does not apply in an action by senior citizens seeking redress for unfair competition under the unfair competition law when the only statutory prerequisites have been satisfied is to ignore the statute express language.see reno baird cal th,d,c ourts should give meaning to every word of a statute if possible,and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage accord,donovan poway unified school dist.th,d.
section does not require the remedy be discretionary 
relying on language from section,subdivision b,concerning the proper application of the statute when the amount of the fine,penalty or other remedy is subject to the trier of fact discretion,national western also contends the section enhancement only applies if the amount of the fine,penalty or other remedy is discretionary.insisting restitution awarded under the unfair competition law is not discretionary see cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d,a restitutionary order under bus,encompasses quantifiable sums one person owes to another,national western argues restitution can not be subject to a section enhancement.
national western argument is based on a fundamentally flawed reading of the statutory language.the first sentence of section,subdivision b,provides,when the amount of the fine,penalty or other remedy is subject to the trier of fact discretion,the trier of fact shall consider various enumerated factors,including whether the defendant knew or should have known that his or her conduct was directed to one or more senior citizens or disabled persons,in determining the amount of fine,civil penalty or other penalty,or other remedy to impose.the second sentence of subdivision b instructs the trier of fact,once the amount of the penalty or other remedy is because it is set by statute or determined by the trier of consider those same factors in deciding whether to treble the award 
a careful reading of the statute permits no other conclusion.section specifically authorizes trebling either the amount authorized by statute,or,where the statute does not authorize a specific amount,the amount the trier of fact imposed in its discretion,subd.b.if,as national western asserts,section applied only to actions in which the fine,penalty or other remedy was subject to the trier of fact discretion,it would not apply to any action in which the fine or civil penalty was fixed by statute.such a conclusion is directly contrary to the statutory language as well as its purpose.see reno baird,supra,cal th at,d,statute must be read to avoid interpretation that would render any of its provisions a nullity.
equally flawed is national western assertion the trial court has no discretion under the unfair competition law in determining the amount of restitution to be awarded.restitution is an equitable remedy.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d.a court can not properly exercise an equitable power without consideration of the equities on both sides of the dispute.see also olson cohen th,d.if equity demands a lesser amount than that needed to fully restore the plaintiff to the status quo,the trial court may award a lesser amount.see,olson,at,d unfair competition action is equitable in nature and court may consider equitable factors in deciding amount of restitution to award.
section applies to actions to enforce the unfair competition law 
far more troubling than national western arguments parsing incorrectly the meaning of particular words and phrases in section is the position of amici curiae,the association of california life and health insurance companies,north american company for life and health insurance and midland national life insurance company,that the three enhanced remedy provisions included in senate bill addition of business and professions code section to the unfair competition law the amendment of the clra to provide a civil penalty in actions under the act by senior citizens and disabled persons and the adoption of section properly viewed as independent enactments,each with its own,provisions dealing with enhanced protection for senior citizens and disabled persons 
the amici properly observe it is generally presumed legislation is enacted with an awareness of existing law see,shirk vista unified school dist.cal th,d,t he legislature is deemed to be aware of existing statutes,and we assume that it amends a statute in light of those preexisting statutes people licas cal th,d,the legislature is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial decisions in effect at the time legislation is enacted and to have enacted and amended statutes in light of such decisions as to have a direct bearing upon them,and an intention to overturn principles of law is not inferred in the absence of a clear expression in either the statutory language or legislative history.van horn watson cal th,d,w e do not presume that the legislature intends,when it enacts a statute,to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied torres automobile club of california cal th,d,courts should not presume the legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow principles of law unless that intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.
the principles of law at issue here are,as discussed above,that restitution is the only monetary relief available to a private litigant under the unfair competition law and that only the attorney general and designated public prosecutors are empowered to recover civil penalties in actions under the unfair com
