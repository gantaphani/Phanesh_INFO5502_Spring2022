plaintiffs frank and carole julian home was damaged when heavy rainfall caused slope failure above and behind their property.the julians submitted to their homeowners insurer,hartford underwriters insurance company,a claim for benefits to cover the loss.hartford denied their claim,determining their policy excluded each of the possible causes of the loss landslide,weather conditions and negligence.the julians sued hartford for breach of contract and various related torts.
under statutory and decisional law,an insurer owes policy benefits to an insured if the efficient proximate cause of the insured loss is a covered peril,even when other excluded perils contribute to the loss,see,sabella wisler cal d,insurer required to pay for loss when efficient proximate cause of the loss was a covered peril negligent installation of sewer line even though an excluded peril land subsidence was a contributory cause of the loss.the efficient proximate cause of a loss is the predominating cause of a loss.garvey state farm fire casualty cal d,see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group explaining efficient proximate cause as the predominating cause,that is,the most important cause of the loss.if more than one peril contributes to a loss,the question which is the efficient proximate cause generally is a factual matter for the jury to resolve.garvey,at.but,when all of the perils contributing to the loss,in other words,all of the possible efficient proximate causes,are excluded under the insured policy,judgment for the insurer can be entered as a matter of law.see brodkin state farm fire casualty d.
the trial court granted summary judgment for hartford.we affirm because the julians policy contained an exclusion for each of the possible efficient proximate causes of their loss.regardless of which cause might be determined to be the efficient proximate cause,hartford does not owe policy benefits to the julians as a matter of law.
factual and procedural background 
the julians policy coverage provisions and exclusions.
the julians own a home on malden avenue in west hills,california.they purchased from hartford an homeowners insurance policy,which took effect on august,and was renewed in subsequent years.
their policy covered the dwelling section,coverage a and other structures section,coverage b on the residence premises.the policy stated we insure against risks of direct physical loss to property described in coverage a and b unless the loss is.excluded under section or.caused by a number of perils not at issue here.
in section,the policy provided.we do not insure against loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following earth movement,including landslide the same exclusions section also stated.we do not insure against loss to property described in coverages a and b caused by any of the following weather conditions.however,this exclusion only applies if weather conditions contribute in any way with a cause or event excluded in paragraph.above including earth movement to produce the loss 
the policy contained an amendatory endorsement entitled specifically excepted perils,which was identified on both the declarations page and cover sheet.it defined peril as a cause of direct physical loss to the property covered and listed additional perils that were excluded from coverage under the policy,including negligence and collapse due to flood.
the damage to the julians home and hartford denial of their claim.
according to the julians,on february,their home was partially destroyed and collapsed as a result of a slope failure above and behind their property.they submitted a claim for policy benefits to hartford,which investigated the loss.the engineers retained by hartford found the cause of the loss was a landslide triggered by heavy rainfall in the el nino storms.they also concluded substandard work of a developer might have contributed to the slope failure.because hartford determined that the policy excluded the perils of landslide,weather conditions and negligence,it denied the julians claim.
the julians complaint and hartford motion for summary judgment.
the julians sued hartford for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,intentional infliction of emotional distress and declaratory relief they alleged that the efficient proximate cause of the damage to their home was either negligence by neighbors occupying the house above and behind theirs and by contractors who worked on that property,resulting in a leak in the water system and illegal and improper construction and maintenance of the slope weather conditions alone or collapse not due to flood they asserted that each of those perils was covered under their policy.
hartford moved for summary judgment,arguing the julians were not entitled to benefits because their policy excluded the perils of landslide,weather conditions and negligence and the julians had presented no evidence to show the collapse of their home caused the loss.the trial court agreed,granting summary judgment and entering judgment in hartford favor.
the julians filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions 
the julians contend they are entitled to policy benefits because the efficient proximate cause of their loss was weather conditions alone,which they assert was a covered peril.in addition,the julians maintain benefits are due to them because the cause of their loss was negligence,which they also assert was covered by their policy 
discussion 
standard of review.
the standard of review on appeal after an order granting summary judgment is well settled.a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.artiglio corning cal th,d.in the trial court,once a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action code civ,subd.o see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
moreover,t he interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law when the underlying facts are undisputed.citation.we recognize that an appellate court is not bound by the trial court interpretation of the policy and that it must independently review the policy,aware that when an insurer seeks summary judgment on the ground the claim is excluded,the burden is on the insurer to prove that the claim falls within an exclusion.citation.brodkin state farm fire casualty,supra,d at.
the doctrine of efficient proximate cause.
under an all risk homeowners insurance policy,all risks are covered except those specifically excluded by the policy.state farm fire casualty von der lieth cal d,d.the insurer owes policy benefits to the insured if the efficient proximate cause of the loss is a covered peril,even when other specifically excluded perils contribute to the loss but the insurer does not owe benefits when an excluded peril is the efficient proximate cause of the loss.id.at,d,scope of coverage under an homeowner policy includes all risks except those specifically excluded by the policy.when a loss is caused by a combination of a covered and specifically excluded risks,the loss is covered if the covered risk was the efficient proximate cause of the loss.citation.t he loss is not covered if the covered risk was only a remote cause of the loss,or the excluded risk was the efficient proximate,or predominate cause.citation.see an insurer is liable for a loss of which a peril insured against was the proximate cause,although a peril not contemplated by the contract may have been a remote cause of the loss but he is not liable for a loss of which the peril insured against was only a remote cause howell state farm fire casualty d.insurer required to cover loss where the efficient proximate cause was fire a covered peril,even though heavy rains and landslide both excluded perils also contributed to the loss.
generally,the cause of the loss is a factual question.state farm fire casualty von der lieth,supra,cal d at,d.however,even where the parties may disagree over the factual question of proximate cause,summary judgment is still proper if all of the alleged causes of the loss are excluded under the policy.brodkin state farm fire casualty,supra,d at.
summary judgment for hartford was proper because each of the possible efficient proximate causes of the julians loss was excluded under their policy.
it is undisputed that one of the causes contributing to the julians loss was landslide.it also is undisputed that the julians policy contained an exclusion for earth movement,including landslide.thus,if a landslide is determined to be the efficient proximate cause of the julians loss,they are not entitled to policy benefits as a matter of law.
weather conditions 
it is undisputed that another of the causes contributing to the julians loss was weather conditions in the form of heavy rainfall.it also is undisputed that the julians policy contained a provision in the exclusions section stating we do not insure against loss to property described in coverages a and b caused by any of the following.
weather conditions.however,this exclusion only applies if weather conditions contribute in any way with a cause or event excluded in paragraph.above including earth movement to produce the loss.
the julians contend this provision is a coverage provision.according to the julians,because weather conditions are covered under their policy,hartford owes them policy benefits if weather conditions are determined to be the efficient proximate cause of their loss,regardless of the contribution of other causes excluded by the policy.the julians argue any other interpretation of the provision would violate the efficient proximate cause doctrine and section.division five of our district agreed with this analysis in palub hartford underwriters ins,supra,th,d palub.
hartford asserts the weather conditions provision is an exclusion that restores coverage to the insured under certain circumstances and argues the efficient proximate cause doctrine does not mandate coverage because both contributing and weather excluded under the policy.according to hartford,it is free to exclude a category of peril from its policy and then restore coverage in certain circumstances without transforming an exclusion into a coverage provision.we agree with hartford.
a property insurer may exclude a category of peril from coverage under its policy.in the property insurance context,the insurer and the insured can tailor the policy according to the selection of insured and excluded risks and,in the process,determine the corresponding premium to meet the economic needs of the insured.garvey state farm fire casualty,supra,cal d at.for example,in butki united services automobile association d,an insured suffered a loss due to corrosive soils the insurer denied the claim for benefits based on the policy exclusion for deterioration and wear and tear.the insured argued the exclusion was contrary to law and public policy.the court rejected that argument,finding an insurer may exclude loss caused by certain perils from coverage,and nothing in the nature of an all risk policy,supreme court precedents,or insurance code section suggests an insurer is precluded from excluding losses caused by deterioration and wear and tear.id.at.
moreover,an insurer can exclude a specific category of peril and then restore a certain amount of coverage through an exception to the exclusion.see,aydin first state ins.cal th,d,sudden and accidental exception to pollution exclusion.in such circumstances the exclusion does not operate as a grant of coverage.the exception to the exclusion merely serves to reinstate coverage where it would not otherwise exist.see paul fire marine ins.coss d.an exclusion can not act as an additional grant or extension of coverage.the exception to exclusion a in the insured policy merely removes breach of implied warranty of fitness,quality,or workmanship from the specific exclusion relating to contractual liability.
based on these principles,the weather conditions provision in the julians policy is properly characterized as an exclusion,not as a coverage provision.hartford was free to deem weather conditions a category of peril excluded by the policy.it made its decision to do so clear and unambiguous by listing weather conditions as an excluded peril in the exclusions section of its policy.indeed,the julians do not suggest hartford is precluded from writing its insurance policy to exclude weather conditions under all circumstances.hartford also was free to restore a certain amount of coverage to the insured when the circumstances under the exception to the weather conditions exclusion were satisfied.the fact that the exclusion contained an exception did not transform it into a coverage provision.as an exclusion,the weather conditions provision can not serve as a grant of coverage permitting the julians to recover on their claim under the efficient proximate cause doctrine.see waldsmith state farm fire casualty d.unnecessary to reach issue whether policy violated efficient proximate cause doctrine when both the stipulated efficient proximate cause negligent maintenance by the city of the water main and the ultimate cause of the loss landslide were excluded perils.
the washington supreme court,in findlay united pacific ins,findlay,interpreted a weather conditions provision virtually identical to the one in the julians policy to deny coverage when weather combined with an excluded peril to cause the insureds loss.in findlay rain and wind caused a landslide,which resulted in structural damage to the insureds summer cabin.their policy excluded both earth movement and weather conditions.the weather conditions provision contained an exception to the exclusion.the insureds argued,as do the julians here,that the insurer attempt to exclude weather conditions,when accompanied by another excluded peril such as earth movement,violated the efficient proximate cause doctrine.the court disagreed,finding the clause concerning losses caused by weather conditions is contained in the exclusions section of the policy.the language and the structure of the policy communicate an intent to exclude coverage when weather combined with earth movement to cause a loss.id.at.the court concluded if the efficient proximate cause,the cause that triggers other causes to result in a loss,is a specifically named,unambiguous excluded peril in the policy,we will not mandate coverage.we will not,under the guise of public policy,rewrite a clear contract between the parties.id.at.
division five in palub,interpreting the same weather conditions provision at issue here,held the weather conditions clause was a coverage provision as we read the clause,the policy covers loss caused by weather conditions and restricts coverage only where an excluded cause contributes to the loss.the fact that the insurer which drafted the clause chose to couch it as an exclusion does not make it one.palub,th at,d id.at,d on a careful reading of the weather conditions clause,it is apparent that despite the title of the section,weather conditions are not an excluded cause of loss.as a result,it concluded hartford has attempted to exclude coverage for losses for which the efficient proximate cause is a covered peril,weather conditions and declined to enforce the weather conditions provision.id.at,d 
we believe palub gives insufficient weight to the rule that a provision in the exclusions section of a policy does not create coverage,and an exception to an exclusion merely restores coverage where it would otherwise not exist.see aydin,first state ins,supra,cal th at,d,paul fire marine ins.coss,supra,d at.moreover,characterizing the weather conditions provision as an exclusion does not provide an insurer the means to deny a claim because some excluded peril contributed to a loss in a small way,the problem the efficient proximate cause doctrine is designed to forestall.see palub,th at,d.as the findlay court found this is not a case where the efficient proximate cause rule is being circumvented by disallowing coverage any time an excluded event occurs in the chain of causation,even when the triggering cause of the loss is a covered risk.in this case,the proximate cause of the loss was a named,excluded peril.weather conditions are specifically excluded whenever they combine with earth movement to produce a loss.the policy is unambiguous as to what was covered and what was excluded from coverage.findlay,at.indeed,palub runs the risk of the opposite problem i f the insurer is expected to cover claims that are outside the scope of the first party property loss policy,an all risk policy would become an all loss policy.citation.in most instances,the insured can point to some arguably covered contributing factor.garvey state farm fire casualty,supra,cal d at.
palub also produces an anomalous result.its effect is that insurers will now write their policies with an absolute exclusion for weather conditions,thereby affording less coverage to insureds.the policy exclusion of losses caused by weather conditions and then restoration of coverage for losses caused by weather which do not occur in concert with one of the policy other stated exclusions provides greater protection for a policyholder than would be enjoyed under an absolute weather exclusion.if an exclusion for weather conditions does not violate any public policy as the parties agreed,then an exclusion for only some instances of weather loss can not violate public policy.findlay,at.we decline to reach a result in this case that well motivates an insurer to write a exclusion to exclude a specific kind of loss 
in sum,the weather conditions provision in the julians policy was an exclusion that merely restored coverage under certain circumstances.it did not mandate coverage under either the efficient proximate cause doctrine or section.because weather conditions were an excluded peril,the julians as a matter of law are not entitled to benefits for their loss caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and earth movement 
negligence 
the julians also argue summary judgment was improper because there is a triable issue of fact whether negligence could have been the efficient proximate cause of their loss.as with both landslide and weather conditions,however,whether negligence might be determined to be the efficient proximate cause of the julians loss is immaterial because negligence also was excluded by their policy 
the julians attempt to avoid the effect of the negligence exclusion by arguing an exception to the exclusion is ambiguous.that exception provided,in the case of an policy such as the julians,the negligence exclusion would not apply to a loss caused directly by any peril not otherwise or sic excepted or excluded from this policy.as division five found in palub,this language simply set forth hartford recognition of the efficient proximate cause rule and section if negligence combined with another peril that was the efficient proximate cause of an insured loss,and that other peril was not excepted or excluded under the policy,the loss would be covered,regardless of the negligence exclusion.palub,th at,d.
the julians also argue the amendatory endorsement use of the words otherwise excepted or excluded means that negligence can not be excluded unless it is mentioned as an exclusion in another part of the policy.the julians stretch the language in the exclusion to make this argument.an insurer need not exclude a peril twice within a policy to successfully limit coverage.see palub,th at,d we can not see that the policy requires yet another exclusionary provision to exclude loss caused by third party negligence.
in the trial court the julians argued the negligence exclusion should not be enforced because the amendatory endorsement was not conspicuous,plain or clear.in their opening brief the julians make that statement but do not present any argument on the point.then,in their reply brief,they explain for the first time why they contend the amendatory endorsement is not sufficiently conspicuous to be readily apparent to the insured.the issue has not been properly raised.schaeffer land trust san jose city council d,fn.a point which is merely suggested by a party counsel,with no supporting argument or authority,is deemed to be without foundation and requires no discussion.citation.neighbours buzz oates enterprises d,fn.points raised in the reply brief for the first time will not be considered,unless good reason is shown for failure to present them before.
in any event,we agree with division five in palub that the amendatory endorsement is sufficiently conspicuous,plain,and clear,in that it is positioned and printed in a form which adequately attracts the reader attention to the limitation,and that the language is sufficiently precise and understandable.citation.this endorsement sets forth a number of excepted perils and provides in bold print that we do not cover or insure against loss caused by,resulting from,contributing to or aggravated by the listed perils,which are described in sufficient detail.it is true that the endorsement is not found in the main body of the policy.however,the cover sheet to the policy admonishes policy holders to read your policy carefully,and specifies that amendatory endorsements may be attached to your policy to modify these provisions or provide you with additional coverage s.the exclusion itself is found on a sheet which is headed amendatory endorsement,with the subheading,in somewhat smaller type but all capital letters,specifically excepted perils.the entire endorsement is only a page long,is in type of a reasonable size,and includes bold,subheadings.palub,th at,d.
as a matter of law,therefore,hartford did not breach the insurance policy by denying benefits to the julians under the negligence exclusion.
because hartford did not breach the insurance policy,summary judgment was proper on the cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
because we hold hartford did not breach the insurance policy,the bad faith cause of action necessarily fails as well.see waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,absent th e contractual right to policy benefits,the implied covenant has nothing upon which to act as a supplement,and should not be endowed with an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings citation.love fire ins.exchange d.where benefits are withheld for proper cause,there is no breach of the implied covenant brodkin state farm fire casualty,supra,d at.even if there was evidence the claim was improperly handled,there could be no cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith since the insurer correctly denied the claim.
disposition 
the judgment in hartford favor on all causes of action is affirmed.the parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.i agree with the principle evidently underlying division five dictum in palub hartford underwriters ins.interpreting the very same clause in the very same insurance company all risks principle an insurance company should not be allowed to write its way around the statutory efficient proximate cause rule.otherwise clever draftsmanship can thwart the legislative policy behind insurance code section.
just as a reminder,section provides,a n insurer is liable for loss of which a covered peril insured against was the proximate cause.where there is a concurrence of different causes,the efficient one that sets others in the cause to which the loss is to be attributed,though the other causes may follow it,and operate more immediately in producing the disaster.in the case before this court,the violent el nino the efficient proximate cause with the ensuing landslide but one in a chain of events culminating in the collapse of the julians home.the hartford policy insures losses caused
