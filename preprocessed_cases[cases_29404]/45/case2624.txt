in,the california legislature enacted legislation that paved the way for the proliferation of a new kind of health care service plan,the preferred provider organization ppo.that year,the legislature amended insurance code section to allow private health insurers to contract with hospitals and providers of medical services for alternative rates of payment for those services,thus permitting insurers to create panels of preferred providers for the insurers subscribers.that amendment was followed a few years later by legislation that enables providers to form groups or combinations to more efficiently negotiate with insurers to become preferred providers.in doing so,the legislature immunized certain conduct from antitrust liability.in this case,we are asked to determine whether the conduct of one such group of providers which imposed territorial restrictions on its members and one insurer which made the members of that group the virtually exclusive preferred providers for physical therapy services comes within the scope of this immunity.we hold that it does.
there are two named defendants in this lawsuit.the first is ptpn,a corporation that was founded by independently owned and licensed physical therapy practices to negotiate with health insurers to become a preferred provider group.the second is blue cross of california,one of the insurers with whom ptpn negotiated alternative rates of payment.ptpn,which is alleged to be the largest group of physical therapy providers in california,limits its membership based in part upon geographic considerations it does not allow new members whose practice is located within a certain radius of an existing member practice.for the most part,the members of ptpn are the exclusive preferred providers of physical therapy services for blue cross,which is alleged to be the largest provider of ppo coverage in california ptpn also has contracted with many other insurers,including most managed care organizations in the country,to make ptpn members the preferred providers of physical therapy services for those insurers.
under the blue cross ppo plan,a member of ptpn who provides physical therapy services to a blue cross subscriber will receive the negotiated rate of payment as a preferred provider directly from blue cross.if a blue cross subscriber receives treatment from a physical therapist who is not a preferred provider,the subscriber must pay for the treatment and may receive a small portion of that payment as reimbursement from blue cross.
plaintiffs lori rubinstein therapy,and one on one pt are providers of physical therapy services.they are not,however,members of ptpn,and are not preferred providers for blue cross ppo plan.they filed the instant action on behalf of themselves and all other physical therapist providers in california they estimate there are tens of thousands of such providers.plaintiffs allege that ptpn and blue cross violate california antitrust and unfair competition laws bus,et by engaging in an improper market allocation through ptpn geographic restrictions and a group boycott through blue cross exclusive contract with ptpn.they assert that blue cross exclusive arrangement with ptpn and ptpn restrictions on membership unlawfully restrain competition for blue cross insured patients and have foreclosed actual and potential competitors of ptpn members from competing on the merits for patients with private health insurance.they assert this restraint on competition has resulted in higher prices to patients,less innovation,less variety in service offerings,and lower quality in physical therapy services they seek an injunction prohibiting ptpn and blue cross from imposing any geographic restrictions on members of ptpn,from imposing a group boycott against members,and from making ptpn the exclusive physical therapy providers for any insurer.
ptpn and blue cross moved for judgment on the pleadings the trial court granted their motions,finding that the conduct at issue was authorized by statute and that plaintiffs failed to allege an antitrust violation under the cartwright act bus,et or under business and professions code section.plaintiffs appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
a.the legislative scheme facilitating ppo plans 
antitrust laws rest on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources,the lowest prices,the highest quality and the greatest material progress,while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.citation.marin county bd.of realtors,palsson cal d.as one treatise explains,antitrust laws place primary reliance on market forces to discipline economic behavior.if a monopoly or a cartel is created,the antitrust laws may be invoked to restore a situation of diffused power,but once that competitive balance is restored,there should be no need for continuing government oversight.the invisible hand of the market provides the discipline,so no regulators or bureaucrats are required once the proper competitive balance is restored.sullivan grimes,the law of antitrust an integrated handbook,fn.omitted.thus,ordinarily,antitrust laws are invoked to condemn restraints on competition such as market allocations and group boycotts because it is understood that market forces unhampered by these restraints will restore a proper competitive balance and produce the most efficient allocation of resources.
but,as many commentators acknowledge,unique aspects of the health care market serve to distort the market forces and make it less likely that market forces alone will produce efficient allocation,high quality,and lower prices.see,greaney,chicago procrustean bed applying antitrust law in health care antitrust,sage hammer,competing on quality of care the need to develop a competition policy for health care markets.reform,sullivan grimes,the law of antitrust an integrated handbook,supra.indeed,as a result of these distortions,health care costs soared in the absence of government intervention and regulation.woo,antitrust and california new preferred provider organization legislation a new alternative in health care cost containment pepp,fn.hereafter woo.
in,the california legislature sought to contain those rising costs by enacting legislation designed to encourage the development of ppo plans.stats,ch.in a ppo plan,there is a designated panel of preferred providers with whom a payor has contracted to provide medical services to insureds at discounted rates.the providers agree to discount their rates in part because they are guaranteed a defined pool of patients who have an economic incentive to use a preferred provider.although the insureds typically are not precluded from using providers who are not preferred providers,they have to pay significantly more for services from providers.woo,supra,pepp,at.
to facilitate the development of ppo plans,the legislature amended insurance code section to allow an insurer to negotiate and enter into contracts for alternative rates of payment with institutional and,after july,with professional providers,and offer the benefit of these alternative rates to insureds who select those providers,subds.b,e.alternatively,the legislature permitted insurers to limit payments under a policy to services secured by insureds from institutional and professional providers,charging alternative rates pursuant to contract with the insurer,subd.c.
the legislature subsequently found in,however,that individual providers have not proven to be bargaining units for these contracts and that groups or combinations of providers would be more contracting units for ppo plans.bus,subd.d,health.but because the formation of these groups required an agreement among competitors,the legislature recognized that antitrust laws were serving as a disincentive to the formation of such groups due to providers concerns that they would be found guilty of committing per se antitrust violations.bus,subd.e.to alleviate this problem,the legislature enacted three virtually identical statutes stating its intent that the formation of groups and combinations of providers and purchasing groups for the purpose of creating contracting units be recognized as the creation of a new product within the health care marketplace,and be subject,therefore,only to those antitrust prohibitions applicable to the conduct of other presumptively legitimate enterprises.bus,subd.g,health.for ease of reference,we refer to these statutes collectively as the immunity statute.
in addition to this portion of the statutory scheme designed to facilitate the development of ppo plans,the legislature enacted statutes to provide regulatory oversight of the plans and to promote the delivery and the quality of health and medical care to the people who enroll in,or subscribe for the services rendered by,a health care service plan.health.to that end,the legislature created the department of managed health care,which has charge of the execution of the laws of this state relating to health care service plans and the health care service plan business including,but not limited to,those laws directing the department to ensure that health care service plans provide enrollees with access to quality health care services and protect and promote the interests of enrollees.health,subd.a.the legislature also directed the commissioner of insurance,in consultation with the department of managed health care,to promulgate regulations designed to assure accessibility of provider services in a timely manner to ppo plan subscribers in a cost efficient manner,subd.b.the legislature further directed the governor to convene a task force on health care service plans to research,among other things,how the changes in health care delivery have affected the health care economy and whether the goals of managed care such as controlling costs and improving quality and access to care are being satisfied.health.finally,the legislature enacted health and safety code section,which requires insurers offering ppo plans to give reasonable consideration to proposals by providers wishing to contract to become preferred providers,unless the providers propose to serve a geographic area that is adequately served by the ppo plans existing preferred providers 
it is against the backdrop of all these statutes and regulations that we must analyze plaintiffs claims.
plaintiffs claims evaluated under the legislative scheme 
plaintiffs contend that ptpn geographic restrictions on membership,coupled with blue cross designation of ptpn members as the exclusive preferred providers of physical therapy services,foreclose physical therapists from competing to provide services to blue cross subscribers.they argue that although the immunity statute authorizes the formation of provider networks,it does not allow those networks to violate the antitrust prohibit group boycotts and territorial market doing so.they also assert that even if the immunity statute immunized all activity in connection with the formation of provider networks,the conduct at issue is not conduct related to the formation of ptpn,but rather it is conduct related to the operation of the ptpn network and ptpn contractual relationship with blue cross.
in examining whether the conduct alleged constitutes an unlawful restraint on competition that is not exempt from antitrust enforcement under the immunity statute,it is important to distinguish between the two markets in which plaintiffs compete with ptpn its members.the first market involves competition to provide physical therapy services to patients,including blue cross ppo plan market in which plaintiffs compete with ptpn members.the second market involves the competition to become blue cross preferred market in which plaintiffs compete with ptpn itself rather than its individual members.we examine each area of competition to determine if the complaint alleges a cognizable unlawful restraint.
competition to provide services to blue cross subscribers 
the complaint alleges that,due to the exclusive contract between blue cross and ptpn,plaintiffs and other physical therapists can not reasonably compete to provide physical therapy services to blue cross ppo plan subscribers.the reason the subscribers are required to pay far more to receive services from a physical therapist who is not a preferred provider.
there is no doubt that the contractual relationship between blue cross and ptpn inhibits plaintiffs ability to compete,at least on a price basis,because of the low costs to patients who utilize the services of ptpn members but that competitive disadvantage is expressly authorized by statute.insurance code section allows an insurer to contract for alternative rates with any provider and offer the benefit of those alternative rates to their insureds.the antitrust laws can not be applied to forbid that which another statute expressly allows.stafford.retirement board cal d,statutes must be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which they are a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.
moreover,by choosing to subscribe to a ppo plan,the subscribers themselves impair the providers ability to compete for their business.to the extent that the subscribers choice to limit competition among providers might result in higher costs decreased quality,the subscribers are protected by the statutory and regulatory scheme designed to ensure that ppo plan subscribers have adequate access to high quality and cost effective health care.bus,health,tit,et.
competition to become preferred providers 
the complaint does not allege that blue cross or ptpn have engaged in conduct that directly restrains plaintiffs from negotiating with blue cross to become preferred providers.instead,the complaint alleges that plaintiffs are foreclosed from becoming preferred providers because blue cross and ptpn have agreed to make ptpn members the exclusive or virtually exclusive preferred providers for blue cross ppo plan.but once again,that conduct is authorized by statute.insurance code section allows an insurer to contract with any provider to become a preferred provider,and health and safety code section requires the insurer to consider proposals by other providers wishing to become preferred providers only if the existing preferred providers do not adequately serve the geographic area proposed to be served by the other providers.and once again,the consumers interests are protected by the extensive regulatory oversight to ensure that each plan has sufficient preferred providers in the areas in which it operates to adequately serve those subscribers.see,tit.thus,the simple allegation that an insurer has entered into an exclusive contract with a provider group does not describe conduct that violates the antitrust laws.
this is not to say there can never be an antitrust violation if one or more providers or provider groups use coercion,threats,or intimidation to convince an insurer to refuse to negotiate with other providers or provider groups.mts,d.but as the trial court found in this case,plaintiffs make no such allegation.in fact,it appears from the exhibit attached to the complaint that blue cross intended to negotiate with members who served areas in which ptpn did not have an adequate number of members,which prompted ptpn to modify its geographic restrictions to ensure adequate coverage.
plaintiffs contend,however,that the exclusive contract between blue cross and ptpn unlawfully restrains competition because ptpn places geographic restrictions on its members.thus,plaintiffs contend that ptpn and blue cross engage in a territorial market allocation that violates the cartwright act.plaintiffs contention fails because ptpn imposition of geographic restrictions is expressly immunized by the immunity statute.
the immunity statute proclaims that combinations or groups of providers formed as contracting units are a new product within the health care marketplace and are subject only to those antitrust prohibitions applicable to the conduct of other presumptively legitimate enterprises.bus,subd.g,health.in other words,the groups conduct in forming contracting units is exempt from the antitrust laws,although their conduct in negotiating alternative rates of payment is subject to antitrust e
