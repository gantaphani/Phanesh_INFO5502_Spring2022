in com.insurance superior court cal d,the california supreme court held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to toll the statutory suit provision in contracts of insurance.under this doctrine,the provision is tolled from the time the insured files a notice of claim to the time the insurer denies the claim.id.at.
in this case,we consider whether an insurer reopening and reconsideration of an earthquake claim tolls the revived period to bring earthquake claims set forth in code of civil procedure section section we conclude that it does,and therefore reverse the judgment of dismissal in favor of the insurer.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff raymonda ashou home was damaged in the northridge earthquake.she was,at the time,employed by her insurer,liberty mutual fire insurance company liberty mutual.liberty mutual settled ashou claim for in.ashou alleges both that she relied on liberty mutual representation that this was a sufficient amount to repair her home and that she feared liberty mutual would retaliate against her financially and professionally if she contested any settlement offer it made.
the amount proved inadequate,as ashou knew in when she was forced to sell her home at a loss because the damage was unrepaired.by this time,ashou was no longer employed by liberty mutual.nonetheless,she did not request that her claim be reopened or bring suit against liberty mutual,as she believed her claim to be.
in,the california legislature enacted section,which revived otherwise insurance claims arising out of the northridge earthquake,as long as certain requirements were met.specifically,the insured must have contacted the insurer prior to the claim could not have been litigated to finality prior to and the claim could not be the subject of a written settlement agreement between the insured and the insurer where the insured was represented by california counsel who signed the agreement.most importantly,section did not revive the claims indefinitely any action under section must be commenced prior to,or within one year from,the effective date of this section.code civ,subd.b.the statute became effective on january.
ashou became aware of this law in,she hired thomas bemiller,a public adjuster,to handle her claim.on july,bemiller submitted ashou claim for reopening to liberty mutual.the record is unclear as to when,exactly,liberty mutual agreed to reopen ashou claim.nonetheless,it is undisputed that liberty mutual,at some point,reopened and reinvestigated ashou claim.
in december,bemiller was concerned that the renewed section filing period was about to lapse.he therefore wrote liberty mutual requesting a waiver of its right to rely on the period.bemiller letter was copied to ashou.it stated,i want to make it absolutely clear that my client does not want to file a lawsuit against liberty mutual but may be forced to do so if we do not get some type of extension to facilitate the adjustment process most insurance carriers have granted such extensions please advise me immediately,so i may advise the insured.
on december,liberty mutual responded as follows liberty mutual has reopened your client original claim which was originally reported to us on january.as previously discussed,liberty mutual has agreed to investigate our insured claims for damages not discovered during our initial claims investigation in.please be advised,however,that liberty mutual retains the right to state any additional applicable exceptions or exclusions in the policy should they come to light under any additional information that you wish to provide us.liberty mutual does not intend by this letter to waive any policy provisions or defenses,and specifically reserves all its rights to assert any policy provisions or defenses at any time.
ashou did not immediately file suit.liberty mutual continued to adjust ashou claim,until april,when it denied her claim.
ashou filed the instant action against liberty mutual for breach of contract and bad faith on august.
there followed a series of demurrers and amended complaints.liberty mutual argued ashou complaint was obviously barred,having been filed twenty months after the time period set forth in section had lapsed.ashou argued that the period had been equitably tolled by liberty mutual reconsideration of her claim or,alternatively,that liberty mutual should be equitably estopped from relying on the statute by its continued reconsideration of her claim after the december exchange of letters.the trial court concluded that neither equitable tolling nor equitable estoppel applied,and sustained liberty mutual demurrer to ashou third amended complaint without leave to amend.an order of dismissal was entered,and ashou filed a timely notice of appeal.
issues on appeal 
we first consider whether the reopening of an earthquake claim can equitably toll the period of section.we conclude that it can.however,it is unclear from the record whether ashou complaint was timely filed,even considering equitable tolling.we also consider whether ashou has sufficiently pleaded equitable estoppel.we conclude ashou has not,and can not,plead that defense.we therefore reverse and remand for further consideration of whether the doctrine of equitable tolling saves ashou complaint.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.blank kirwan cal d.
equitable tolling 
insurance code section sets forth the california standard form fire insurance policy.that form includes a clause providing,no suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless commenced within months next after inception of the loss.this provision or a similar one is written into each fire insurance policy issued in california and is part of the homeowner policy issued to ashou in this case.although the clause is technically a contractual provision limiting the time in which a suit can be brought,it is statutory in origin and considered to be akin to a statute of limitations.
in com.insurance superior court cal d,our supreme court considered whether this period is tolled while the insurer is investigating a claim.the court concluded the legislature intent to provide insureds with a full year excluding the tolled period in which to commence suit can be inferred from the fact that the period provided by insurance code section is considerably shorter than the usual four years for ordinary contracts citation and ten years for an action against developers for property damage caused by latent defects.citations.id.at.the court further held that adoption of the doctrine was consistent with the trend in other states toward equitable tolling of the suit provision in the limited circumstances in which the insurer or other party against whom the claim has been made has received timely notice of the loss and thus is able to investigate the claim without suffering prejudice.ibid.
recognizing that the purpose of a shortened limitation period was to obtain the advantage of an early trial of the matters in dispute and to make more certain and convenient the production of evidence on which the rights of the parties depended,and not to achieve a technical forfeiture of the insured rights by enforcing the limitation provision when the insured has given timely notice of a claim to his insurer,the court did not believe that an equitable tolling of the limitation period would frustrate the purpose of insurance code section,or work a hardship on the insurer,whose investigation would necessarily have preceded the denial of coverage,supra,cal d at.
the court then enumerated five policy considerations which supported adoption of the doctrine of equitable tolling.first,it allows the claims process to function effectively,instead of requiring the insured to file suit before the claim has been investigated and determined by the insurer.next,it protects the reasonable expectations of the insured by requiring the insurer to investigate the claim without later invoking a technical rule that often results in an unfair forfeiture of policy benefits third,a doctrine of equitable tolling will further our policy of encouraging settlement between insurers and insureds,and will discourage unnecessary bad faith suits that are often the only recourse for indemnity if the insurer denies coverage after the limitation period has expired,supra,cal d at.fourth,e quitable tolling is also consistent with the policies underlying the claim and limitation,the insurer is entitled to receive prompt notice of a claim and the insured is penalized for waiting too long after discovery to make a claim.for example,if an insured waits months after discovering the loss to make his claim,he will have only month to file his action after the claim is denied before it is under insurance code section.ibid.finally,a literal application of the suit provision could create the anomalous situation where an insured suit would have been untimely before the insurer denied coverage.id.at.
the court concluded that the suit provision begins to run from the date of inception of the loss,but is tolled from the time an insured gives notice of the damage to his insurer,pursuant to applicable policy notice provisions,until coverage is denied,supra,cal d at.
while other cases had reached a similar result through the doctrines of waiver and estoppel,the court here relied on equitable tolling.a waiver exists whenever an insurer intentionally relinquishes its right to rely on the limitations provision,supra,cal d at.an estoppel arises when the insurer induces the policyholder to forbear from filing suit.singh allstate ins.th,d singh.equitable tolling is distinct from both of these doctrines.its application does not depend on the insurer express waiver or inducement of reliance it is a legal doctrine which comes into play,as a matter of law,by the simple fact of the insured timely notice of claim to the insurer

in this case,it is clear that the original period in which to bring suit was tolled while liberty mutual investigated ashou claim,prior to settling it.that period of tolling ended at the date of settlement in.marselis allstate ins.th,d.the issue presented by this case is whether,seven years later,liberty mutual reconsideration of ashou claim operated to toll the new period to bring suit provided by section.the trial court concluded it did not,relying on singh,supra,th,d,for the proposition that there can be no second period of equitable tolling.
singh considered the following factual scenario.on april,the insured made a claim for fire damage,for a fire that had occurred that day.the insurer denied the claim on november,for breach of policy conditions,relating to the insureds failure to secure the property following previous losses.singh,supra,th at,d.on february,the insureds requested reconsideration of their claim,within thirty days,representing that they did not wish to litigate this matter.id.at,d.on march,the insurer responded that it would provide a response within days.on march,the insurer sent a letter stating,a fter reconsideration of your claim,the insurer respectfully informs you that the position taken in the november,correspondence to you remains unchanged and no policy benefits can be afforded.id.at,d.the insureds filed suit,alleging bad faith,on december.ibid.
as the insureds had immediately notified the insurer of the fire,the period was tolled until november,leaving the insureds one year from that date within which to file suit.the insureds sued on december,missing the date by less than one month.singh,supra,th at,d.the insureds argued,however,that the period had been again tolled,from their request for reconsideration through the insurer denial of reconsideration,rendering their suit timely.ibid.
the court first considered whether the policy reasons which led the supreme court to adopt equitable tolling in applied equally to a claim for a second period of tolling.the singh court concluded they did not.once a claim has been made,the carrier has pursued its investigation,and the claim has been denied,the policies behind allowing equitable tolling have been fulfilled.the carrier right to notice,and its ability to investigate and marshal any evidence it may need to defend,have been preserved.the insured has been provided at least some grounds,upon the denial,before being required to sue the carrier.thereafter,however,the enforcement of the limit works no injustice to either party.singh,supra,th at,d.the reconsideration period was not required to enable the insurer to receive notice of the claim and to investigate the claim so as to preserve its rights to defend,if it ultimately denied the claim.the reconsideration period did not come before plaintiffs had reason to know of their right to sue,or the expiration of the limitation in which to do so.plaintiffs were aware of the right to sue,and of potential grounds,before any request for reconsideration.the justifications for equitable tolling are absent,once the carrier has initially denied the claim.the policies supporting the shortened limitation period are then fully applicable,and no reason for further tolling exists.ibid.
moreover,the court found further reasons to refuse a second period of equitable tolling.i f the carrier conduct after denying coverage expressly waives the limit,or induces the policyholder to forbear from filing suit,the doctrines of waiver and estoppel will avoid injustice on that score.singh,supra,th at,d.finally,beginning a new period of equitable tolling based merely on a request for reconsideration would be anomalous.by this simple expedient of making many requests for reconsideration,claimants could extend the statute at will with successive periods of tolling.ibid.moreover,if responding favorably to a request for reconsideration could open a second period of tolling,insurers might be reluctant to grant policyholders reconsideration.id.at,d.in short,once an unequivocal denial has been made,the insured later requests for reconsideration do not serve the purposes of and do not extend the period of equitable tolling.id.at,d.
to determine whether the policies behind equitable tolling support applying the doctrine to the renewed period of section,it is first necessary to understand the legislative history of that section.the legislative history was set forth at length in cordova century ins.th,d.we quote from that opinion 
it is undisputed the january northridge earthquake resulted in billions of dollars in property damage thereby exposing insurance companies to significant liability.
many of the claims for earthquake damage were settled to the policyholder satisfaction but many were not.claims which were not satisfactorily settled generally fell into two categories.in some cases the insurance companies adjusters misrepresented to the insureds their damage did not exceed their policy deductible.in other cases the insurance companies adjusters found the damage exceeded the policy deductibles but misrepresented the true extent of the damage caused by the quake.
policyholders whose claims were denied or often did not learn the true extent of their damage until more than a year after the earthquake.when they attempted to have their insurance company reopen their claims or sued for breach of their insurance contracts the insurers threw up the bar of the limitations period in insurance code section.the policyholders responded with various arguments as to why their claims were not barred by the statute of limitations including the argument the insurers were equitably estopped from asserting the limitations period because it was their own factual representations which had led the policyholders not to further pursue their claims within the period.the policyholders equitable estoppel arguments met with mixed results.
in,the california legislature took steps to bring needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake by enacting section.the legislative record shows section was enacted in response to reports of rampant mishandling of insurance claims by insurers.the author of the legislation claimed following the devastation caused by the northridge quake many victims were devastated a second time when their insurance companies denied or their claims for compensation.and when homeowners complained to the department of insurance to obtain relief,the department afforded no help.the legislature received reports insurers engaged in a systematic program of misleading consumers about the nature and extent of damage to their homes and,when the deceived homeowners learned the true extent of their damage,the insurers simply refused to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become.the legislation author was quoted as stating the statute of limitations that is current law under insurance code section has barred victims from being fairly compensated for their losses because they were misled about the extent of damage done as a result of the earthquake.a senate analysis of the legislation cited new accounts stating m any victims have received only partial settlements for their earthquake claims,and others have received no compensation at all,having been improperly told that the damage they suffered was below policy deductibles.in subsequent years,when the victims tried to present newly discovered evidence of damage to their insurers,insurers stonewalled claims,leaving homes,condominiums,and apartment building s in shambles and homeowners without any recourse.undisputedly,the intent of section was to provide such recourse.
in reviewing the legislative record of section we found its proponents and opponents were in agreement the effect of the legislation would be to grant certain insureds a new period in which the file claims or law suits for damage they believed was caused by the northridge quake.cordova century ins.th,d,fns.omitted.
it is important to recognize that section only reopens the filing window it does not impose any further duties on insurers.century ins.superior court th,d.section does not work an impermissible impairment of contract because it merely affects the remedy for the violation of the contract,not the obligations contained within it.ibid.
equitable tolling applies to the period of section after a grant of reconsideration 
in determining whether to extend equitable tolling to the period of section,we consider the policy decisions that motivated the supreme court in to adopt equitable tolling of the original suit provision of insurance code section.where applicable,we consider whether the policy considerations are fulfilled by the application of equitable tolling from the time the insured seeks reconsideration of a denied claim,or whether they are fulfilled by equitable tolling from the time the insurer grants the insured request for reconsideration.
first,the court determined the legislative intent of insurance code section was to provide insureds a full period,excluding the tolled period,within which to bring suit.a similar intent can be found in section.believing the response of insurers,and the department of insurance,to the northridge earthquake to have been completely inadequate,the legislature enacted section,granting insureds a second bite at the apple.we should construe and apply this period in the same way as the initial period of insurance code section.in other words,the period of section should grant insureds one full year absent tolling to file suit.moreover,equitable tolling would not frustrate the purposes of section,but would,in fact,promote them.while insurance code section shortened limitation period was intended to obtain the advantage of an early trial and to make more certain and convenient the production of evidence,section had a different purpose.the legislature understood that it was allowing suits on claims that were seven years old,but the legislature concluded the initial response of the insurance industry,as a whole,to the earthquake was so insufficient that these claims should be allowed to proceed to suit,even after the substantial passage of time.equitable tolling would lengthen that time a bit more,in order to allow the insurers to conduct the full investigations which they had failed to do when the claims were first made.equitable tolling is fully supported by the legislative intent behind section.
however,while an insurer is contractually obligated to conduct a timely investigation of an initial claim,an insurer has no such obligation with respect to a request for reconsideration of a denied claim.section does not change the duties imposed by the insurance contract.therefore,it does not require an insurer to reopen a previously denied claim,or even respond to a request for reconsideration.as one of the purposes of equitable tolling is to allow the insurers time to conduct full investigations into claims made,equitable tolling should only the context of a previously denied the insurer has agreed to reopen and reinvestigate the claim.application of equitable tolling from the time of a request to reopen the claim would require insurers to respond to all such requests or risk being subject to suit on those claims indefinitely.this impairment of the contractual relationship between insured and insurer is not contemplated by section,which is exclusively concerned with remedy.
we now consider each of the five policy considerations that supported equitable tolling in.first,we consider whether equitable tolling of section would allow the claims process to function effectively,instead of requiring the insured to file suit before the claim has been fully investigated by the insurer.when limited to claims which the insurer has agreed to reopen,this policy is advanced by equitable tolling,as it would allow the insurer to reconsider a perhaps hastily closed claim before the insured brings suit under section.however,the policy would not be advanced by applying equitable tolling from the time the insured seeks reconsideration,as,unless the insurer agrees to reconsider the claim,there is no claims process which needs the time to function.
second,we consider whether equitable tolling protects the reasonable expectations of the insured by enabling the insurer to investigate the claim without later invoking a technical rule to bar suit.again,this policy is advanced by applying equitable tolling to claims that have already been reopened,as the insurer has a reasonable expectation that a reopened claim will be investigated to completion.however,an insured does not have a reasonable expectation that a request for reconsideration will cause a full investigation therefore,the policy is not advanced by applying equitable tolling from a request for reconsideration.
third,we consider whether the doctrine of equitable tolling will further the policy of encouraging settlement between insurers and insureds.when an insurer has granted reconsideration,settlement without litigation is a legitimate possibility and equitable tolling allows such settlement to occur.however,when an insured has sought reconsideration but the request has not been acted upon or has been expressly denied,the status of the claim remains denied,and there is no extant settlement possibility that would be encouraged by delaying suit.
fourth,the court stated,e quitable tolling is also consistent with the policies underlying the claim and limitation,the insurer is entitled to receive prompt notice of a claim and the insured is penalized for waiting too long after discovery to make a claim.for example,if an insured waits months after discovering the loss to make his claim,he will have only month to fi
