may an insured bring separate actions against its insurer for breaching its obligation to defend a claim against the insured and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the handling of the claim we hold that it may not,because the two claims involve breach of the same primary right,precluding the insured from splitting the cause of action.hence,we affirm the ruling of the trial court sustaining a demurrer to the insured complaint in the second of the two actions.
