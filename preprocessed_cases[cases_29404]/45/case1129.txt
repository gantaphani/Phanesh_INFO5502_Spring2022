at issue in this dispute is the scope of a ports liability policy the policy that the county port authority purchased from a group of insurance companies in.the policy covers,among other things,public officials liability,which is defined as any actual or alleged act,error,omission breach of duty by an officer employee of the port authority in the discharge of duties and claimed against solely by reason of capacity as such with the port authority.this appeal presents two questions about the scope of the provision whether the public officials liability portion of the policy covers the port authority as well as port authority officials and employees,and if so,whether a formal claim or demand must be made against an individual official or employee in order for the port authority to invoke the coverage.the better reading of the policy,in our view,is that it covers the port authority as well as port authority officers and employees and that a formal demand or claim against an individual official is not a condition of coverage.because the district court held otherwise and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant insurance companies on this basis,we reverse the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

in view of the policy million limit,the port authority purchased additional insurance.the first excess policy was issued by a group of insurance companies the navigators group composed of navigators insurance company,the reinsurance company of new york,christiana general insurance corporation of new york,colonia insurance company,employers mutual casualty company and farmers mutual hail insurance company of iowa.the second excess policy was issued by coregis insurance company.
between and,several lawsuits were filed against the port authority concerning the operation of the toledo express specifically,concerning the noise created by burlington air express flights in and out of the airport.the first of these lawsuits was filed in june by joseph and winifred kagy and several other citizens of fulton county,ohio.the kagy plaintiffs claimed nuisance,inverse condemnation and violations of equal protection by the port authority,but did not allege any specific wrongful acts by port authority employees and did not name any port authority employees as defendants.
on july,richard and jane mcquade filed a second lawsuit,which did name individual port authority employees as well as the port authority itself as defendants.the complaint alleged that the named employees and other unnamed employees of the port authority committed fraud and other wrongful acts in enticing burlington air express to establish a hub at the toledo express airport.the complaint further alleged that the port authority employees acted at all times as agents of the port authority,that the port authority acted by and through its employees,and that the port authority was liable for the intentional,reckless negligent acts of its employees.
within days of the filing of the mcquade lawsuit,the port authority notified the london companies of the suit and asked the london companies to determine whether the suit was covered by the policy,including its provision for public officials liability coverage.the london companies withheld coverage,asserting that the policy did not cover liability arising from airport activities.all parties now agree that the stated reason for withholding coverage was incorrect and that public officials liability coverage under the policy does include airport activities.
numerous other lawsuits followed,all containing similar allegations against the port authority and many of its individual employees.after mcquade,even the kagy plaintiffs amended their complaint to include allegations and claims against individual port authority employees as well as the port authority itself.
by february,however,all of the claims against the individual port authority employees had been dismissed for failure to state a claim,leaving only the claims against the port authority.in september,faced with an imminent jury trial on the issue of damages to the property owners,the port authority settled the remaining claims for million.
while this settlement ended the litigation again
