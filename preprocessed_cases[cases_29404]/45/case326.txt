background 
i.the fire 
in march,donald and cecile swallow swallows or homeowners hired wodraska to apply a new epdm membrane roof to their house in pelham manor,new york on june,a wodraska employee was using a torch on the swallows roof when a nearby opened a can of roofing adhesive.the adhesive fumes ignited and lit the roof on fire.the pelham manor fire department extinguished the fire,and subsequently investigated its cause.the fire department chief reported e mployees of the roofing contractor on the premis e s were using a portable,small propane torch to dry the roof in close proximity to highly flammable roofing cement which ignited and spread fire quickly to the upper roof and attic area.
ii.the liability insurance policies 
continental insured the swallows house,and acknowledges that their policy covered the fire.atlantic insured wodraska,but argues that wodraska can not recover under its policy for three reasons.first,the policy required wodraska to provide notice of an occurrence and potential claim as soon as practicable.second,the policy contained an exclusionary provision,the roofing limitation endorsement rle,which provided w e do not cover claims,loss,costs or expense arising out of property damage as a result of any operations involving any hot tar,wand,torch or heat applications or membrane roofing.finally,wodraska failed to comply with its obligation under the policy to c ooperate with atlantic in the investigation of continental claim against wodraska.
iii.notice to atlantic and atlantic disclaimers 
a week after the fire,continental paid the swallows approximately for the damage.at that time,continental did not know the identity of wodraska insurer,its efforts to find that information having failed.on november,five months after the fire,wodraska sent atlantic its notice of claim.the next day,continental first learned that atlantic insured wodraska when atlantic representative called continental counsel.continental sent atlantic its notice of claim the following day.
atlantic denied both claims.by a letter dated november,atlantic denied wodraska claim,because wodraska had failed to report the fire as soon as practicable,and because the rle barred coverage for costs associated with damage to the building or contents arising out of operations involving any hot tar,wand,torch or heat application or membrane roofing.by a separate letter of the same date,atlantic notified continental that it had declined wodraska claim due to an exclusionary endorsement in the policy.
iv.prior proceedings 
continental suit against wodraska 
on january,continental,as subrogee of the swallows,sued wodraska to recover the it had paid,alleging that wodraska had negligently started the fire.wodraska received the complaint,but failed to answer.in may,continental notified atlantic that a default judgment would enter if wodraska did not respond to the complaint by june.the following week,atlantic representative sent another letter to wodraska and a copy to continental denying coverage and any duty to defend wodraska.wodraska never entered an appearance,and on july the district court entered a default judgment for amount continental had paid the swallows,plus interest and costs.
on july,continental sent atlantic notice of the default judgment.atlantic maintained that it owed wodraska no duty to indemnify or defend,but it provided wodraska a courtesy interim defense counsel who unsuccessfully moved to reopen the default.wodraska never satisfied the default judgment.
continental suit against atlantic 
on may,continental,as a judgment creditor,sued atlantic for a declaratory judgment that atlantic was obligated to indemnify wodraska and,therefore,to satisfy continental default judgment.continental sued under section a,which allows an injured party,in its capacity as a judgment creditor,to sue the insurer of the defaulted party in some circumstances.
after discovery,continental and atlantic for summary judgment.in a june,memorandum decision,the district court awarded summary judgment to atlantic because 
continental action is barred by wodraska failure to timely notify atlantic of the claim.continental,the injured party,relied on wodraska,the insured,to provide notice to atlantic,the insurer.because wodraska was the only party to notify atlantic of the claim continental rights are derivative of wodraska.wodraska notice was untimely under the policy as a matter of law,and continental therefore can not recover in this action.
continental ins.atlantic cas.ins,civ.dc,wl,june.
the district court acknowledged that section a authorizes an injured party who has obtained a judgment against the party responsible for the injury to institute a direct action against the insurer of the party against whom the judgment was obtained.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court also agreed that in some circumstances the injured party may have greater rights than the insured.for example,even where the insured fails to give notice to the insurer of a claim as required by a policy,courts may still permit the injured party to recover.id.at.however,
w here the insured is the first to give notice of a claim to the insurer,then the injured party rights are considered to be derivative of the insured the insurer.in such a scenario,where the insured notice is untimely and the insurer disclaims coverage based on untimely notice,an injured party will be unable to recover under section against the insurer because of the insured untimely notice.thus it is critical,in assessing a claim brought under section,to determine which injured party or the notified the insurer of the claim.
id.citations and footnote omitted.the court noted,it is an anomaly of the section caselaw,then,that an injured party is better off if the insured gives no notice than late notice.id.at.
on june,continental moved for reconsideration,arguing that the summary judgment decision overlooked the fact that continental had provided independent notice of its claim to atlantic on november.in an august memorandum decision,the court conceded that error,but did not change its previous decision.it said that its previous decision 
was based entirely on the fact that wodraska,the insured,was the first to provide notice of the claim to atlantic b ecause wodraska was the first to provide notice,any notice continental provided after wodraska provided notice was superfluous it is,therefore,wholly irrelevant that continental provided notice to atlantic after wodraska.

discussion 
continental argues on appeal that section a permitted it to give atlantic independent notice of its claim,despite the fact that wodraska had already given atlantic untimely notice of its own claim.we agree.but we affirm the district court judgment on the separate ground that the rle barred coverage of the fire.
new york insurance law section a 
section a requires all new york insurance contracts to contain in substance the following provisions or provisions that are equally or more favorable to the insured and to judgment creditors so far as such provisions relate to judgment creditors 
a provision that in case judgment against the insured in an action brought to recover damages for injury sustained or loss or damage occasioned during the life of the policy or contract shall remain unsatisfied at the expiration of thirty days from the serving of notice of entry of judgment upon the attorney for the insured,or upon the insured,and upon the insurer,then an action may be maintained against the insurer under the terms of the policy or contract for the amount of such judgment not exceeding the amount of the applicable limit of coverage under such policy or contract.
a provision that notice given by or on behalf of the insured,or written notice by or on behalf of the injured person or any other claimant,to any licensed agent of the insurer in this state,with particulars sufficient to identify the insured,shall be deemed notice to the insurer.
a provision that failure to give any notice required to be given by such policy within the time prescribed therein shall not invalidate any claim made by the insured,an injured person or any other claimant if it shall be shown not to have been reasonably possible to give such notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as was reasonably possible thereafter.
in short,subsection a allows an injured party with an unsatisfied judgment against an insured party to sue the insurer for satisfaction of the judgment in some circumstances.see,mccormick,empire ins.group,cir discussing section a becker colonial.ins.div d dep t same.subsection a permits the injured party to give notice to the insurer to protect that right of direct action,see,axa marine aviation ins.uk seajet indus,cir discussing section a becker,at same,and subsection a sets the standard for reasonableness of that notice.see,state of n.blank,cir citing section a.
before the new york legislature enacted the precursors to section under the common law an injured party possessed no cause of action against the insurer of the.jackson citizens cas.if an injured party obtained a judgment against an insured party and the insured party failed to satisfy the judgment,the plaintiff could not sue the insurance company directly because there was no privity of contract between plaintiff and the insurance carrier.lang.hanover ins,discussing section a.so the injured party bore the loss.id.
the legislature recognized that an injured party had a genuine interest in the liability insurance policy and should be enabled to invoke its protection.lauritano am.fid.fire ins.div.dep t.so the legislature remedied th e common law inequity by creating a limited statutory cause of action on behalf of injured parties directly against insurers,which is presently codified at section.lang,at see also lauritano,at section and its precursors profoundly altered what was once commonly the liability policy existed solely for the protection of the insured.
when an insured tortfeasor gives the insurer late notice first and the injured party provides subsequent notice under section a,new york courts do not dismiss the injured party notice simply because it came second.courts have instead held that 
w here the insured fails to give proper notice,the injured party can give notice herself,thereby preserving her right to proceed directly against the insurer.having been statutorily granted an independent right to give notice and recover directly from the insurer,the injured party or other claimant is not to be charged vicariously with the insured delay.
appel allstate ins.div.dep t internal quotation marks omitted insured notified insurer of dog bite after default judgment entered,then injured party sent subsequent notice when the insured gives late notice first and the injured party gives subsequent notice,courts determine whether the injured party notice has effectively protected the injured party right to sue not by looking at the order in which the insurer received that notice,but by examining whether the injured party pursued his rights to notify the insurer pursuant to section a with as much diligence as was reasonably possible under the circumstances.malik,at internal quotation marks omitted.this separate standard,used to determine the reasonableness of the injured party notice,is more lenient than the standard for the insured party notice 
allowing an injured party to provide notice after an insured party provides untimely notice makes sense.first,it serves section a aforementioned purpose of allowing an injured party to sue an insurance company for satisfaction of an unpaid default judgment against an insured party.since,by statute,the injured party has an independent right to recovery against the tortfeasor liability insurer,it makes little sense to cut off that right,when the injured party has attempted with due diligence to identify and notify the insurer,because of a dereliction not by the injured party,but by the insured tortfeasor.
second,allowing an injured party to provide notice after an insured party provides untimely notice avoids the anomaly to which the district court alludes.atlantic does not dispute,as it can not under the new york caselaw that if it had never received any notice from wodraska,continental notice to it would be effective,if that notice was reasonably timely in light of the circumstances facing continental.it would be irrational if the injured party could provide effective notice to the insurer when the insured party entirely fails to do so,but the injured party could not notify the insurer and protect its right to sue after the insured provides notice albeit untimely,in light of the circumstances of the insured and the terms of the policy to the insurer.if the insurer may not escape liability when it receives no notice from the insured but it is notified by the injured party,there is no reason why the insurer should escape liability when it receives notice from the insured party before receiving notice from the injured party and is,therefore,better informed than it would be if it had received no notice from the insured.
finally,it makes sense to judge each party notice by different standards.each party stands in a different position relative to the insurer.the insured knows who its insurer is,and has entered into a contractual relationship that typically prescribes how quickly the insured must notify the insurer of any claims,often requiring something akin to the requirement here.if the insured does not notify the insurer within the prescribed time,then it has failed to meet a condition of its contract and it,therefore,can not make a successful claim on its policy.by contrast,the injured party is a stranger.it may not know who the insurer is and it may,despite its best efforts,struggle to discover the insurer identity,as continental claims happened here.that a delay in providing notice on the part of an insured who has contracted for indemnity on the condition that it provide notice of a covered occurrence to its own insurer as soon as practicable constitutes an unreasonable delay does not mean that it is similarly unreasonable for the injured party to provide notice at about the same time despite due diligence,the injured party may,as asserted in this case,have only identified the insurer after the period,and immediately provided notice on learning the insurer identity.the fact that the insured party prior notice is untimely to protect its contractual right to sue the insurer does not necessarily imply that the injured party notice is untimely to protect its independent statutory right to sue the insurer.
atlantic attempts to distinguish the cases that allow injured parties to provide notice after the insured party provides untimely notice,arguing that those cases involve bodily injury claims rather than property damage claims.atlantic says that section d and cases construing that provision treat bodily injury claimants different ly than property injury claimants because bodily injury claimants require special protections,and argues continental improperly seeks to avail itself of those special protections in a mere claim for property damage.but this argument misses the mark.section d does indeed provide special rules governing personal injury claims but continental does not invoke section d,and the cases on which continental relies do not,either.they invoke section a,which is not limited to bodily injury or wrongful death claimants.neither section a nor any of the cited cases suggest that the rules established by those cases would not apply in a property damage case.
atlantic also argues that the legislative intent behind insurance law does not apply and its benefits are simply not available to claims by insurers,such as continental.atlantic relies on bovis lend lease lmb,royal surplus lines ins.div.dep t,which addressed whether section d requirement that an insurer promptly issue any disclaimer to a bodily injury or death claimant also applies to.at.in dicta,bovis called section a an example of a provision of section that does not protect,but instead emphasi zes protecting the insured and those who have claims against the insured.id.at.bovis does not help atlantic.first,its comment regarding section a is dicta,and its discussion of d is inapposite.second,its suggestion that section a does not protect is immaterial,because continental is not a.continental stands in the shoes of the swallows,an injured party with an unsatisfied judgment against the the sort of litigant bovis says section a protects.
the district court erred when it held that wodraska notice extinguished continental ability to provide subsequent notice in order to protect its right to sue atlantic to reach this conclusion,the district court relied on inapposite precedent that addresses an insurer obligations when issuing its notice of,when the insurer receives the insured notice of claim before receiving the injured party notice,and the insurer denies the insured claim for lack of timely notice,must the insurer notice of disclaimer to the insured party mention the injured party notice courts have held that in such scenarios an insurer disclaimer to the insured only needs to address the insured notice and not the injured party subsequent notice.because the insurer disclaimer to the insured need not address the injured party subsequent notice,courts have called an injured party subsequent notice superfluous in this context as continental notes,this rule makes sense because the insurer might receive the insured notice and send a disclaimer to the insured before the insurer receives any notice from an injured party or has any reason to know that an injured party will be providing independent notice.
the precedent that the insurer may treat an injured party subsequent notice as superfluous,however,only speaks to the scope of the insurer obligation to the injured party after the injured party has triggered that obligation by providing notice.webster mount vernon fire ins,cir.that precedent does not speak to the question of whether or not an injured party subsequent notice protects its right to sue an insurer.nor should we draw on that precedent to answer this question.as discussed above,if the injured party may provide notice to protect its right to sue the insurer when the insured party never gives notice,then it would make no sense to say that the injured party notice becomes superfluous for the purpose of protecting its right to sue simply because the insured party gave the insurer prior notice.the district court erred,therefore,when it relied on that precedent from a different context to hold that any notice continental provided after wodraska provided notice was superfluous for the purpose of protecting continental right to sue atlantic.continental,wl,at.
here,the insured,wodraska,gave its insurer,atlantic,notice five months after the fire.the injured party,continental,gave atlantic notice a few days later,as soon as it discovered the insurer identity,in order to protect its own right to bring a direct action against atlantic under section a.continental was entitled to give atlantic its independent notice.that notice was not ineffective simply because it came after wodraska.to determine whether continental notice effectively preserved continental right to sue atlantic,we would have to examine whether that notice was reasonable under the standard for injured party notice,in light of continental claim that it was unable,despite due diligence,to identify earlier atlantic as the relevant insurer.but we need not reach that question,since atlantic is entitled to summary judgment on a separate ground.
ii.roofing limitation endorsement 
if we were to find continental notice adequate and allow continental to proceed with its suit,continental would do so in its capacity as a judgment creditor.under section,the creditor rights are no greater or less than those of the insured debtor,and recovery can not exceed the policy limits.mccormick,at.t he injured party steps into the shoes of the tortfeasor and can assert any right of the against the insurance company.lang,n.at.therefore,we must determine whether wodraska could recover against atlantic under its policy.it could not,because the casualty that occurred was specifically excluded from coverage under that policy.
the parties disagree about whether the rle barred coverage of the fire.the rle provides w e do not cover claims,loss,costs or expense arising out of property damage as a result of any operations involving any hot tar,wand,torch or heat applications or membrane roofing.atlantic argues that while it would suffice to exclude coverage to have any operations involving a torch or membrane roof,here the operations involved both,so the rle plainly applies to bar coverage of the fire.continental argues that the rle does not bar coverage for two reasons.first,the act of opening the act that continental claims caused the not constitute a roofing operation that the rle excluded.second,the rle bars only claims arising from hot applications of membrane roofs,and wodraska was using a cold application procedure.
new york law treats an insurance policy as a contract and construes it in accordance with general contract principles.see union fire ins.of pittsburgh,stroh,cir.t he initial question for the court on a motion for summary judgment with respect to a contract claim is whether the contract is unambiguous with respect to the question disputed by the parties.law debenture trust of new york maverick tube,cir internal quotation marks omitted.whether the contract is unambiguous is a question of law for the court.id.ambiguity exists if the contract terms could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.id.internal quotation marks omitted.when interpreting a contract,the intention of the parties should control,and the best evidence of intent is the contract itself if an agreement is complete,clear and unambiguous on its face,it must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.hatalmud.spellings,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the rle is not ambiguous on the question of whether it excludes coverage of the fire.the rle use of the disjunctive any operations involving any hot tar,wand,torch or heat applications or membrane roofing indicates that it excludes coverage of losses arising out of any operations involving any torch or any operations involving membrane roofing.the operations at issue here involved both a torch and membrane roofing.wodraska was hired to apply a new epdm membrane roof,and when its employees were applying that roof,they started the fire,in part,by using a torch.the fire resulting from the operations therefore falls squarely
