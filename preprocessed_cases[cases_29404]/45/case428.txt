on december,during the course of the renovation work,a person entered the united house building,shot several people with a firearm,and started a fire before taking his own life.as a result,seven people died and several others were injured.on april,william blakely,united house attorney,sent a letter to belize explaining that two lawsuits had been filed against united house and warning that it was likely that belize would be sued individually or joined as a party in pending lawsuits.immediately after receiving blakely letter,usher notified mount vernon of the december,incident and the possibility that claims might be asserted against belize.as blakely had predicted,an action was commenced on june,in the supreme court of the state of new york,bronx county,against belize and others,on behalf of an individual who died as a result of injuries she sustained in the december,fire the jimenez lawsuit.the verified complaint includes allegations,inter alia,that the sprinkler system in the building was unlawfully shut off and that lma bricked over,eliminated made inoperable,one or more means of ingress and egress to the premises.belize was charged generally with negligence,carelessness and recklessness.in addition to the jimenez lawsuit,other lawsuits involving both direct and claims have been asserted against belize,all relating to the events that occurred at the united house building on december.these state lawsuits were commenced by the parties named as here other than belize and the church.
