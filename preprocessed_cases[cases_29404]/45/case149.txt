this appeal arises out of a dispute over the propriety of an order issued by the insurance commissioner of puerto rico declaring andrés guillemard ginorio,his wife,maría noble fernández,and their insurance agency,lone star insurance producers collectively,plaintiffs,untrustworthy and incompetent revoking plaintiffs insurance licenses for five years barring plaintiffs from applying for other insurance licenses for five years and imposing a fine.
plaintiffs allege,inter alia,that in issuing this order without a hearing and in retaliation for their political beliefs,fermín contreras gómez,former insurance commissioner,and dorelisse juarbe,the current insurance commissioner collectively defendants,violated plaintiffs rights under the first amendment and the due process clause.plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their due process claim and defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment and denied defendants motion.defendants now appeal.in addition,defendants also take this opportunity to appeal the district court denial of their motion to vacate the court judgment under.b based on newly discovered evidence.after careful consideration,we affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity and dismiss any appeal taken from the court grant of partial summary judgment or its denial of the motion to vacate.
factual and procedural background 
guillemard and noble founded lone star insurance producers in.both are members of the new progressive party npp.
early in,contreras became the insurance commissioner for puerto rico.on november,the office of the insurance commissioner oic assigned angela rivera to investigate urrutia vallés,uvi,an insurance brokerage company,for its conduct in connection with the performance of a contract with the government of puerto rico.for several years,lone star and uvi had worked together in obtaining and servicing property,casualty,and other types of insurance for several government agencies.pursuant to the investigation,rivera found that uvi paid commissions to lone star from the sale of the government insurance policies.
on november,an article in el nuevo día,a puerto rico newspaper,reported that the oic investigation into uvi would also include guillemard.that same day,aurea lópez,the head of the oic audit division,instructed rivera to look for checks from uvi to lone star.
on november,the oic issued a notification and examination order calling for an audit of lone star operations and transactions from january,through september.the notice did not allege any wrongdoing.david castro anaya,an oic auditor,was assigned to perform the lone star audit.according to castro,the sole purpose of his investigation was to determine whether improper payments had been made to third parties.guillemard made available to castro two certified public accountants to cooperate with the audit and provide all relevant documents.
by december,all of the documents pertaining to insurance issued to government agencies had been examined and the audit had concluded.castro informed guillemard and miguel carbonell,lone star cpa,that he found no irregularities or improprieties.castro also told guillemard and carbonell that he would prepare a draft of his final report within the next few months and send them a copy.
at some point after november,but before march,melvin rosario,the director of the unit at the oic and castro supervisor,met privately with contreras to tell him that he did not wish to investigate lone star for commission sharing.he explained that the sharing of commissions,as in the case of lone star and uvi,was common,normal,in the way that business was conducted.and that his opinion in that regard was that he had not seen,in all honesty,anything in the insurance code indicating that this could not be done that way.in response,contreras told rosario that he would have to carry out the investigations against this member anyway.rosario asked to be relieved from the assignment,and contreras agreed that castro would report to lópez instead.
early in,guillemard learned that the oic had issued subpoenas to several puerto rico banks demanding account information for all transactions involving guillemard,noble,or lone star.
on july,castro submitted the final investigation findings report the report relating to the lone star audit to his supervisor.he did not send a copy to guillemard.the report found no improper payments to third parties,but it raised other issues.in particular,the report noted that lone star had entered into a arrangement with uvi.the report concluded that the sharing of commissions is a violation of section of the puerto rico insurance code.
at the end of,plaintiffs were still being investigated by the oic.on december,plaintiffs filed a federal action against contreras and the oic,alleging that the investigation was motivated by political animus in violation of their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.at that time,the oic had not issued any reports or orders in connection with the lone star investigation since the submission of castro july report.
contreras found out about plaintiffs lawsuit by the following day on december,contreras issued an order declaring plaintiffs incompetent and untrustworthy,revoking their insurance licenses for a period of five years denying them any license in any capacity for a period of five years and imposing a fine of the order.the order stated that it would become effective on january,but provided that plaintiffs could request an administrative hearing to contest it.the order also stated that a request for an administrative hearing would stay the imposition of the fine,the declaration that plaintiffs were incompetent and untrustworthy,and the denial of any license in any capacity.however,pursuant to the order,the revocation of plaintiffs licenses would remain in effect pending a final administrative decision.
following receipt of the order,plaintiffs promptly requested an administrative hearing.they also amended their complaint to allege claims of retaliation under the first amendment and violation of the due process and equal protection clauses,as well as state law provisions.in addition,plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the revocation from taking effect,and moved for a preliminary injunction.the district court granted the temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction.after a hearing,at which only plaintiffs chose to present evidence,the district court entered an injunction restraining contreras and the oic from revoking plaintiffs license pending completion of a full and fair hearing on plaintiffs challenge to the revocation order.in its order,the district court also concluded that contreras was not entitled to qualified immunity.contreras filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the preliminary injunction.
shortly thereafter,contreras moved to dismiss the federal lawsuit on qualified immunity grounds.the court denied the motion,reaffirming its prior conclusions.contreras then filed a second interlocutory appeal challenging this decision.the two interlocutory appeals were consolidated and in a per curiam decision,this court affirmed the district court conclusion that contreras was not entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim.cir 
the oic held an administrative hearing on march.thereafter,the new insurance commissioner,dorelisse juarbe,issued a resolution finding that plaintiffs had violated the insurance code,but revising the sanctions as follows the fine of over was reduced to the license suspension was reduced to three months the prohibition of filing for a license within five years was eliminated and the references within contreras order as to guillemard untrustworthiness and incompetence were omitted.
back in the district court,plaintiffs again amended their complaint to add juarbe as a defendant.the parties subsequently filed.plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that contreras violated their due process rights.defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that plaintiffs had failed to establish violations of the first amendment,the due process clause,or the equal protection clause,and that contreras and juarbe were entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim.
the district court referred both motions to a magistrate judge.in a report and recommendation the r r,the magistrate judge recommended that plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment be denied,and defendants motion for summary judgment be granted as to the equal protection claim and denied as to the remaining issues.all parties objected to the r r.in particular,defendants argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity on all claims.
the district court adopted the r r in part and rejected it in part it granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment on the due process claim and denied defendants motion for summary judgment on all claims.with respect to defendants claim qualified immunity on the due process claim,the district court held that defendants were not entitled to summary judgment because a material issue of fact remained as to the third prong of the qualified immunity analysis,whether a reasonable official in contreras position would have been justified in revoking plaintiffs license without a prior hearing.with respect to their assertion of qualified immunity on the other claims,however,the district court held that b ecause the defendants did not properly raise these arguments before the,the court will consider their assertion of qualified immunity in relation only to the due process claim.
defendants later filed a motion to vacate the district court judgment pursuant to.b based on the newly discovered evidence of a puerto rico appellate court decision holding that an interpretation that the insurance code prohibits commission sharing was reasonable.on april,the district court denied the motion to vacate,finding that the puerto rico appellate court decision was irrelevant to its ruling.
on august,this court ruled that defendants were entitled to appeal the district court decision with respect to qualified immunity on the due process claim,noting that defendants had conceded for purposes of appeal the factual issues the district court had found to be in dispute.on september,we modified the earlier order and ruled that appellate jurisdiction also extends to the issue of whether the district court erred in finding that defendants had failed to adequately assert qualified immunity with respect to the first amendment claims.
ii.discussion 
qualified immunity on the first amendment claims 
we review for abuse of discretion the district court conclusion that defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on the first amendment claims of political discrimination and retaliation because they had failed to adequately assert the argument before the magistrate judge 
defendants argue that the district court erred in refusing to entertain their arguments on qualified immunity with respect to the first amendment claims.specifically,they object to the holding that the defendants did not properly raise these arguments before the.defendants claim that they raised this defense in their motion for summary judgment when they argued broadly that they were entitled to qualified immunity.defendants point to three sentences in their motion for summary judgment which purportedly preserved their argument d efendants herein did not engage in any type of conduct that was violative of any of plaintiffs constitutional rights hence it is not plausible to conclude that defendants actions were unlawful.thus,this entitles defendants to qualified immunity,defs.mot.for summ.emphasis added moreover,the application as a matter of law of both the healthy and privileged qualified immunity defenses warrants summary disposition of all claims at this stage of the proceedings,id.at emphasis added and defendants in their personal capacity can not be held liable in this case because they are cloaked by qualified immunity,id.at.
defendants further argue that the specific reference to healthy city board of education doyle,d holding that adverse action against a government employee can not be taken if it is in response to the employee exercise of constitutionally protected first amendment freedoms,in their motion discussion of qualified immunity shows that defendants asserted a qualified immunity defense to the first amendment claims because healthy is only relevant to the first amendment.
had defendants raised a qualified immunity defense to the first amendment claims before the magistrate judge,they would have been entitled to the district court clearly erroneous or contrary to law review of the argument.see b a.but issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.de araujo gonzáles,cir quoting united states zannino,cir.by defendants own admission,their arguments on this point were broad in scope,which means they can just as easily be characterized as vague the qualified immunity section of their summary judgment motion never even mentioned the words first amendment,political discrimination,or retaliation.we can not say that defendants three sentences speaking to qualified immunity broadly and their single reference to healthy satisfied their duty to spell out their arguments squarely and distinctly.mun.wholesale,cir.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that defendants waived their qualified immunity defense to the first amendment claims.see id.at.b does not permit a litigant to present new initiatives to the district judge.we hold categorically that an unsuccessful party is not entitled as of right to de novo review by the judge of an argument never seasonably raised before the magistrate.borden sec y of health human,cir appellant was entitled to a de novo review by the district court of the magistrate judge recommendations to which he objected,however he was not entitled to a de novo review of an argument never raised.internal citations omitted.
qualified immunity on the due process claim 
qualified immunity provides a safe harbor for public officials acting under the color of state law who would otherwise be liable under for infringing the constitutional rights of private parties.borges colón,cir quoting whitfield,cir.we apply a test to determine whether a public official is entitled to qualified immunity,asking whether plaintiff allegations,if true,establish a constitutional violation whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation and whether a similarly situated reasonable official would have understood that the challenged action violated the constitutional right at issue.mihos swift,cir.if all three questions are answered in the affirmative,we deny qualified immunity.id.at.defendants argue that,even assuming the first two prongs are satisfied,they are entitled to qualified immunity under the third prong of the test because a similarly situated reasonable official would not have believed that the deprivation violated plaintiffs rights to procedural due process.
we review a district court denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds de novo,considering only purely legal questions.suboh dist.attorney office,cir.
with respect to contreras,defendants argue that he is entitled to qualified immunity because he was acting pursuant to a presumptively constitutional statute.defendants point out that the puerto rico insurance code authorizes the insurance commissioner to suspend,revoke or refuse to renew a license by issuing an order to licensee not less than fifteen days prior to the effective date thereof,subject to the right of the licensee to have a hearing,and provides that pending such hearing,the license shall be suspended.laws ann.tit,a.defendants further point out that,as with all state statutes,this statutory provision is presumed to be constitutional,see ex rel blumenthal crotty,cir,and that no court had,during the relevant time period,found the statute unconstitutional.accordingly,defendants argue that even if section a is now deemed unconstitutional,contreras is entitled to qualified immunity for his good faith reliance on the presumptively valid provisions of the insurance code.see freeman blair,cir holding that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity where any defects in the regulatory scheme were not sufficiently obvious to make the defendants reliance on the scheme objectively unreasonable.
with respect to juarbe,defendants argue that she is entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim because she did not draft or sign the order,she was not contreras supervisor at the time of the issuance of the order,and she was not present during the conversation in which contreras allegedly told rosario that he would have to carry out the investigations against this member.thus,defendants argue that there is no connection between juarbe conduct and the alleged constitutional violation of revoking plaintiffs licenses without a hearing.we do not think this argument goes to qualified immunity so much as to the ultimate question of liability under,a question not properly before us.see cartagena,cir section imposes liability upon those who subject or cause to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws quoting emphasis added other alterations in original.in any event,defendants acknowledge that juarbe participated in meetings in which the order was being drafted and that she enforced the order after it was issued.we think any reasonable official in contreras or juarbe situation would have known that the summary revocation provision in the insurance code is unconstitutional therefore,qualified immunity is available to neither defendant.
first,to the extent contreras or juarbe acted in reliance on section a,enacted in,we find such reliance unreasonable because that statute is no longer in effect,having been superseded by the puerto rico uniform administrative procedure act,laws ann.tit,et the puerto rico apa.in chalkboard,brandt,cir,the ninth circuit examined a factual scenario very similar to this case.there,an agency summarily suspended a day care center license under a statute that allowed for such suspension in emergency situations.id.at.however,a statutory provision required that the agency notify the attorney general of any emergency circumstances,after which the attorney general could seek a restraining order.id.at.the chalkboard court denied qualified immunity,holding that the summary closure procedures used by defendants in th at case could not reasonably have been believed to meet constitutional requirements.id.at.in so holding,the ninth circuit specifically noted that it could not 
accept the contention that a general purpose provision enacted years earlier remains at the disposal of the dhs officials when the state has adopted a more recent and specific statutory scheme which provides for both routine and expedited methods of suspending the license and which does not permit summary action by agency officials.
neither party disputes that the puerto rico apa provides for hearings at all agency levels.see laws ann.tit,a see also magriz empresas nativas.enacted in,it requires all agencies adjudicating a controversy to safeguard a t he right to timely notice of the charges or complaints or claims against one of the parties b t he right to introduce evidence c t he right to an impartial adjudication and d t he right to have the decision based on the record of the case.laws ann.tit,a.the supreme court of puerto rico has held that the puerto rico apa expressly supersedes any conflicting statutes.see hernández golden tower dev,i t is the express intent of the lawmaker,in adopting a uniform judicial review procedure for rulings or orders of administrative agencies or departments,that the puerto rico apa prevail over any other legal to any agency in may be repugnant to the provisions of said act.asociación de dueños de casas de la parguera,junta de planificación de.given the puerto rico apa hearing requirement,any claimed reliance on section provision is unreasonable as a matter of law 
we also find reliance on section a unreasonable because the statute is patently unconstitutional.although state officials are ordinarily entitled to rely on presumptively valid state statutes,courts have held such reliance unreasonable where the relevant law is so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws.michigan defillippo,d see,lawrence reed,cir denying qualified immunity to an official who relied on an ordinance allowing for the destruction of derelict automobiles without a hearing because the official could not reasonably have concluded that his actions were consistent with due process carey.gaming control,cir denying qualified immunity to an official who relied on statutes requiring individuals stopped pursuant to terry to identify themselves because a reasonable officer in the defendant position would have known that the plaintiff had a clearly established fourth amendment right not to identify himself.
section a is patently unconstitutional because it specifically provides for the suspension of a professional license before a hearing is provided,without limitation.laws ann.tit,a.it has long been established that a state may not suspend a professional license without a hearing see beauchamp de abadia,cir beauchamp unquestionably had a protected interest in his license to practice medicine.a clearer example of new property is not easily imagined.the district court holding that he had a right to a hearing before his license could be revoked was correct.internal citations omitted see also mard town of amherst,cir in general,the state must provide some kind of hearing before depriving an individual of a protected property interest.internal quotation marks omitted thus,we find that defendants are not entitled to rely on section a s allowance for deprivations because a reasonable official in their position would have known that it violates the due process clause.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of defendants motion for summary judgment.
iii.motion to vacate 
defendants also argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to vacate the summary judgment order.they claim that newly discovered evidence a puerto rico appellate court decision finding that an interpretation that the insurance code prohibits commission sharing was that defendants would have punished plaintiffs conduct regardless of their political affiliation.this argument is a defense against plaintiffs first amendment political discrimination claim it has no effect on the due process claim,which is based solely on the alleged deprivation.
we reiterate that this court may only hear appeals taken from final judgments,see supra note.accordingly,we do not have jurisdiction to review a motion to vacate the district court denial of summary judgment on the political discrimination claim.see pierluisi,cir w e do not have jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment motions where a genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute.moreover,as stated above,defendants waived a qualified immunity defense to the first amendment claims,see supra section,so we have no occasion to opine on that argument.as such,we take no view of the district court denial of defendants motion to vacate.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court denial of defendants qualified immunity claims on summary judgment.
by this time,contreras had submitted his resignation as insurance commissioner,effective at the end of december.
we explicitly noted that contreras only challenge d the due process portion of plaintiffs complaint.at.
in our september,order,we extended appellate jurisdiction to this issue,noting that case management orders precluding the assertion of the defense of qualified immunity are reviewable,and the circumstances here seem analogous.we review case management orders for abuse of discretion.gonzáles,cir.although defendants conceded in their initial brief that the district court ruling was a case management order,they objected to that characterization in their repl
