a homeowner with an homeowners insurance policy returned home from vacation to find that a toilet had overflowed,causing significant water damage to his home.as a result of the water damage,the house became contaminated by mold.the homeowner made a claim under the policy for all of the damage,including the mold damage.although the policy covered losses resulting from a sudden and accidental discharge of water from plumbing or household appliances,the insurer denied the claim for the mold damage based upon terms in the policy that provide that any loss resulting from mold is always excluded,however caused.
the question raised in this original proceeding in mandate is whether the insurer may rely upon the absolute mold exclusion to deny coverage for mold damage resulting from the covered discharge of water,in light of insurance code section which incorporates into california law the efficient proximate cause doctrine.under that doctrine,w hen a loss is caused by a combination of a covered and specifically excluded risks,the loss is covered if the covered risk was the efficient proximate cause of the loss,but the loss is not covered if the covered risk was only a remote cause of the loss,or the excluded risk was the efficient proximate,or predominate,cause.julian hartford underwriters ins.cal th,d,julian,quoting state farm fire casualty von der lieth cal d,d,von der lieth see also garvey state farm fire casualty cal d,garvey.the supreme court has instructed,however,that the doctrine does not preclude an insurer from providing coverage for some,but not all,manifestations of a peril,as long as the policy makes clear which perils are and are not covered.julian,supra,cal th at,d.because the policy at issue in this case plainly and precisely communicate d id.that mold damage is not covered even when it results from a covered sudden and accidental discharge of water,we hold the insurer denial of coverage does not violate section or the efficient proximate cause doctrine.
background 
this case comes to us on a petition for writ of mandate after the trial court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer to one of the causes of action alleged by petitioner rudolf andre de bruyn.the complaint alleges that de bruyn purchased a homeowner insurance policy from respondents farmers group,fire insurance exchange,and farmers insurance exchange collectively,farmers in august.the policy was written on an basis for the dwelling coverage a,and on a basis for personal property coverage c among other things,the policy covered losses to the dwelling and personal property caused by a sudden and accidental discharge of water from any plumbing or household appliance.the policy also included an exclusion for mold.we discuss the language of the policy in greater detail in the discussion section,post.
in april,de bruyn and his family returned from a vacation to find that a toilet in an upstairs bathroom had overflowed and damaged his home.a few days later,he discovered that his dishwasher also had leaked and that there was mold on the wall behind it.he made claims to farmers for the damages caused by the overflowed toilet and the leaking dishwasher.after some investigation and disputes related to the amount of damage suffered,farmers paid de bruyn for the water damage but denied payment for damage to the dwelling related to mold.
de bruyn filed a complaint against farmers,alleging three causes of action based upon farmers denial of coverage for damage resulting from the toilet overflow and dishwasher leak,and farmers alleged inadequate investigation and failure to make a timely or reasonable offer to settle his claims.farmers demurred to the third cause of action,which alleged that farmers committed acts of unfair competition under business and professions code section et by,among other things,relying on an absolute mold exclusion alleged to be illegal because it violates section.farmers argued that section did not apply under the facts of the case,but even if it did apply,it permitted farmers to exclude coverage for mold damage,however caused.
the trial court sustained farmer demurrer without leave to amend and certified the matter for appellate review under code of civil procedure section.we issued an order to show cause in response to de bruyn petition for writ of mandate,and set the matter for hearing.we have received farmers return to the order to show cause and de bruyn reply to the return.
discussion 
section and the efficient proximate cause doctrine 
as the supreme court noted in julian,supra,cal th at page,d,section incorporated the efficient proximate cause doctrine into california law as the preferred method for resolving first party insurance disputes involving losses caused by multiple risks or perils,at least one of which is covered by insurance and one of which is not.the court explained that,under the doctrine,coverage would not exist if the covered risk was simply a remote cause of the loss,or if an excluded risk was the efficient proximate meaning predominant cause of the loss.on the other hand,the fact that an excluded risk contributed to the loss would not preclude coverage if such a risk was a remote cause of the loss.by focusing the causal inquiry on the predominant,or most important cause of a loss,the efficient proximate cause doctrine creates a workable rule of coverage that provides a fair result within the reasonable expectations of both the insured and the insurer.id.at,d.
thus,in sabella wisler cal d,the supreme court applied the efficient proximate cause doctrine to reverse a judgment in favor of the insurer in a case involving negligent construction of a house that caused a sewer line to break a covered risk because not specifically excluded,which caused the house to settle unevenly an excluded risk,which resulted in a loss to the insured.although the supreme court found that the exclusion clause in the policy at issue would convey to the ordinary person that the type of subsidence loss that occurred in that case was excluded from coverage,it nevertheless found the insurer liable because the rupture of the sewer line attributable to the negligence of a third party,rather than settling,was the efficient proximate cause of the loss.id.at,see also von der lieth,supra,cal d,d,efficient proximate cause doctrine applies where insureds presented evidence that third party negligence in developing property and negligence by other homeowners in maintaining septic tank systems covered peril caused increase in groundwater level excluded peril,which caused earth movement excluded peril,resulting in loss jury found negligence was efficient proximate cause of loss garvey,supra,cal d,jury must determine whether negligent construction covered peril or earth movement excluded peril was efficient proximate cause of loss when addition to insured house pulled away from the house.
california courts have held that the efficient proximate cause doctrine must be applied to determine coverage even in circumstances in which the exclusions appear to be drafted to circumvent the doctrine for example,in howell state farm fire casualty d.howell,the policy at issue provided that it did not insure for loss that would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events.we do not insure for such loss regardless of a the cause of the excluded event or b other causes of the loss or c whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss.id.at.the excluded events included earth movement and water damage.id.at.the insured property,which was located on a slope,suffered damage when a major landslide occurred after unusually heavy rains.the insured produced evidence that the landslide probably would not have occurred if not for a previous fire that had destroyed much of the vegetation on the slope.fire was not an excluded peril under the policy.relying in part on garvey,supra,cal d,in which the supreme court held that the efficient proximate cause doctrine applied despite policy language that purported to exclude coverage if the excluded event played any part in the loss id.at,the appellate court held
