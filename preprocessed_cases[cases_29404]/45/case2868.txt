this case addresses application of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a in the context of a request to vacate a verdict against a health care facility.the parties appear to assume that their request unquestionably will be granted and that we will give our judicial blessing to what is,for all practical purposes,a stipulated reversal.this assumption is based upon the parties apparent belief that the judgment belongs solely to them to use in a manner that is in their best interests.what they fail to recognize is that under section,subdivision a,their assumption is no longer legally correct.this judgment now belongs to the the the public indisputably has an interest in its continuing existence.
a brief review of the circumstances is warranted.plaintiffs and respondents john muccianti and dorothy beard,individually and as successors in interest of margaret muccianti,deceased plaintiffs,filed a wrongful death action against defendants and appellants willow creek care center,summit corporation and fountain view corporation collectively,fountain view.plaintiffs mother died shortly after she was discharged from willow creek care center,a,health care facility.a jury returned a verdict in excess of million in favor of plaintiffs.after filing a notice of appeal,fountain view reached a settlement with plaintiffs under which plaintiffs consented to vacation of the judgment.fountain view then moved to vacate the judgment.later,plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal.
we conclude that the requirements of section,subdivision a,have not been met since vacation of this judgment will likely affect the rights of nonparties,prospective patients and insurance carriers and erode the public trust.further,based on the clarity of the parties settlement agreement,we see no choice but to dismiss the appeal as moot.
