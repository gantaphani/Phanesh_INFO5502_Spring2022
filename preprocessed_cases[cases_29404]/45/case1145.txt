on september,paula rosvanis backed her car out of an alley,failed to yield,and hit jack showalter on his motorcycle.on september,showalter died of injuries sustained in the accident.showalter was survived by his wife debbra now debbra lepley and two daughters.after showalter death,lepley sued rosvanis.rosvanis and her insurer settled with lepley for.the probate court of marion county,ohio,approved the settlement on august.

on appeal lepley argues that the district court erred in finding that the notice and subrogation provisions apply even though coverage was imposed as a matter of law,and lepley is not entitled to coverage because she failed to comply with the notice and subrogation provisions.f or the purpose of determining the scope of coverage of an underinsured motorist claim,the statutory law in effect at the time of entering into a contract for automobile liability insurance controls the rights and duties of the contracting parties.ross farmers ins.group of,ohio.ohio revised code was amended by,which took effect september.because the relevant policy periods were december,through december,the former ohio revised code applies.this version of provides that an insurer must offer coverage in an amount equivalent to the automobile liability coverage whenever an automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy is offered if coverage is not offered,it becomes part of the policy by operation of law.see davidson motorists mut.ins,ohio.it is undisputed that the policies at issue fall within the meaning of automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies under ohio law.see selander erie ins.group,ohio,noting that w here motor vehicle coverage is provided,even in limited form,coverage must be provided.
lepley first argues that the district court erred in finding that she was bound by the conditions contained in the hartford and paul policies because the coverage under those policies is imposed as a matter of law specifically,lepley contends that all conditions including the notice and subrogation provisions contained in the hartford and paul policies do not apply to motorist coverage that arises through operation of law.relying in part on liberty mut.fire ins,ohio,lepley claims that the intent of the parties expressed in the more limited coverage provided in the policy can not be extrapolated to coverage imposed by operation of law.in,the ohio supreme court addressed whether an exclusion could be applied to limit underinsured motorist coverage that arose by operation of law.citing demetry kim,ohio app d,the court concluded that the exclusion,which was intended to apply solely to liability coverage,did not apply to the implied underinsured motorist coverage,at.
unlike,which dealt with a liability exclusion,the issue in the instant case is whether a condition precedent is applicable to coverage implied by law.as explained by the district court and in an ohio court of appeals decision,this is an important distinction.see luckenbill midwestern indem,ohio app d.logically,parties to an insurance policy can never negotiate exclusions to underinsured motorist coverage that they never envisioned would exist.however,the parties to an insurance policy can negotiate conditions precedent that would apply to any and all coverages provided under the policy.heiney v.the hartford,wl,at ohio.july.therefore,such general conditions apply to coverage despite the fact that such coverage arises as a matter of law.id.
lepley argues that the distinction between exclusions and conditions precedent is a distinction without a difference.as the district court noted,however,the ohio supreme court decision in duriak globe american casualty insurance,ohio,rev on other grounds,miller progressive casualty insurance,ohio,supports the validity of this distinction.in duriak,the ohio supreme court found that while the excess policy included uninsured motorist coverage imposed as a matter of law,the insured was required to comply with a condition precedent to such coverage t he proviso in the policy predicating recovery upon compliance with the primary insurance coverage is effective to preclude recovery from the excess policy even if we insert uninsured motorist coverage into the policy as a matter of law.id.at.
lepley claims that reliance on duriak is misplaced because the basis for duriak holding has been destroyed by later ohio supreme court opinions.however,in heiney an ohio appeals court disagreed as is evident by its recent reliance on duriak in finding that conditions precedent apply to coverage imposed by operation of law.the heiney court discussed the issue of conditions precedent in relation to the ohio supreme court opinion in duriak.according to the heiney court 
the broad application of conditions precedent to all coverages provided under an insurance policy,including coverages implied by law,is demonstrated by duriak globe american cas,ohio,overruled on other grounds by miller progressive cas.ins,ohio.in duriak,the plaintiff was covered under two insurance primary policy,which included uninsured motorist coverage,and an excess policy,which did not include u
