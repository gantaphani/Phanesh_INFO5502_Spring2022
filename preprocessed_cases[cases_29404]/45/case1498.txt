danny fitzgerald appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of his former employer,action,on his claims of age discrimination and interference with employment benefits.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to fitzgerald,dush appleton,cir summary judgment standard,show the following.he began working for action as a shop hand on november.at the time,he was fifty years old,and worked for action until he was terminated on may.throughout this period,raymond easley was fitzgerald supervisor and shop foreman.
on february,while fitzgerald was working,harold yandell caused fitzgerald to fall,a back and shoulder injury,causing him to miss about a week of work.he attempted to file an accident report but action informed him the incident would be taken care of informally.in late february and early march,he received treatment for his back.on may,he saw greg jones regarding his shoulder.following the consultation with the doctor,it became apparent fitzgerald would need surgery.the record reveals jones told fitzgerald he would likely need rotator cuff surgery,and,prior to his termination,fitzgerald informed action he intended to have surgery.
action asserts no shoulder surgery had been recommended or scheduled prior to fitzgerald termination and,therefore,it was unaware he was planning on having shoulder surgery.the record,however,shows jones spoke with fitzgerald about treatment options and informed him at least an acromioplasty shoulder surgery for the hooked acromion and ac decompression would be appropriate.app.at.according to fitzgerald,he immediately notified easley and others at action he was going to be having shoulder surgery and needed time off.easley and pete garner,action shop manager,approved his request for time off.id.
additionally,jones notes from a followup appointment on may,support fitzgerald testimony.
fitzgerald gives me an interesting story regarding recent dismissal from work.i am not sure what to make of that.he is concerned that it has something to do with his upcoming right shoulder surgery or perhaps an injury that he sustained in an incident at work for which he had been seen shortly after by cole regarding the work related nature.the bottom line is that i do not know how to advise him except to make sure his insurance issues are under control at least until the time that he gets the shoulder taken care of,so as to protect himself on that respect.
on may,easley informed fitzgerald he was being laid off.easley told him the decision had come from upstairs management and that they did not need a reason.appellant br.at.upon fitzgerald pressing easley,easley stated fitzgerald was being terminated due to lack of work.id.
later,in an affidavit,easley indicated he terminated fitzgerald employment because of the accumulation of his employee misconduct and specifically over his abuse of restroom privileges and break time.app.at.easley stated fitzgerald use of the restroom for long periods of time,usually before break time or time to go home was an abuse of restroom privileges and break time and a violation of action employee conduct.id.according to easley,he spoke with garner regarding fitzgerald abuse of bathroom privileges on may,and garner made the decision to terminate fitzgerald.
in response to an equal employment opportunity commission eeoc request for information,action submitted a written position statement stating 
fitzgerald was not laid off because of lack of work.he was terminated for cause as a result of accumulated misconduct.multiple written statements issued to the charging party referring to the employee action forms are attached hereto as exhibit.his attendance record is reflected in additional exhibit.
the record reveals from february,to may,fitzgerald was written up for employee misconduct on seven occasions five of which are relevant on appeal.he states he was aware written warnings were part of action disciplinary process and easley required employees to sign the written warnings.however,while he had received verbal warnings about wearing a seatbelt on the forklift and smoking in the doorway to the shop,he had not been the subject of any written disciplinary action and easley never required him to sign a written warning.
fitzgerald contends he was terminated because of his age,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,and because of his need for employee benefits coverage for his shoulder surgery,in violation of of the employee retirement income security act erisa.he argues the district court erred in granting action motion for summary judgment on both claims because material issues of fact existed.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.fischer andersen,cir citing woodland joseph ryerson son,cir.when the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,presents no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,summary judgment is appropriate.id.citing.c matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
fitzgerald first argues action terminated him to prevent him from receiving his healthcare insurance benefits in violation of of erisa.appellant br.at.specifically,he contends he notified easley and others he was preparing to have surgery on his shoulder to repair damage from an old industrial accident and action terminated him to avoid paying the substantial costs and potential future costs of this claim.id.
section of erisa makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge a participant in an employee benefit plan for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan.to establish a claim for a violation of,fitzgerald must show action had a specific intent to interfere with his insurance benefits,but that may be shown by circumstantial evidence.register honeywell fed,llc,cir citing regel,cir.in the absence of direct evidence of an employer deliberate interference with future benefits,we analyze interference claims using the mcdonnell douglas analysis common to title vii and adea cases.see texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d libel adventure lands of america,cir holding because libel erisa claim is based on alleged circumstantial evidence we analyze it under the mcdonnell douglas framework.
initially,fitzgerald must make a prima facie showing action terminated him with the specific intent of interfering with his insurance benefits.then the burden shifts to action to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the termination.if the employer does so,the burden shifts back to the employee to prove the proffered reason was pretextual.register,at.
the district court assumed fitzgerald established a prima facie case but granted summary judgment,concluding action had provided legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for fitzgerald termination and these nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating fitzgerald prevent a fact finder from concluding that the reasons for terminating him were pretextual.id.on appeal,neither party challenges the district court assumption or its conclusion action articulated a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the termination decision,fitzgerald accumulated misconduct.instead,the parties dispute whether fitzgerald has produced sufficient evidence to show the employer reason was pretextual and whether it acted with a specific intent to interfere with the employee rights.
if the employer rebuts the inference of discrimination arising from the employee prima facie case,the employee can prove the employer articulated justification is merely pretextual either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.gavalik continental can,cir quoting burdine,at.in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate we consider the strength of the plaintiff prima facie case,the probative value of the proof that the employer explanation is false,and any other evidence that supports the em
