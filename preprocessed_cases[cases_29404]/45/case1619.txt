appellants appeal from the decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of emcasco and denying summary judgment for appellants on their for summary judgment.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court.
background 
factual background 
edith and wayne diedrich the diedrichs live in south dakota,and,at all times relevant,edith operated a day care business out of her home.plaintiff appellee emcasco insurance company emcasco issued a homeowner insurance policy to the diedrichs homeowner policy that provided coverage for the period from november,to november.the diedrichs homeowner policy included a home day care endorsement that provided coverage for the operation of a day care business out of the diedrichs home.
in,edith diedrich began providing day care to a minor named between march and august,the diedrichs teenage son john was present at the day care.it is undisputed that john sexually molested,who was four years old at the time,more than forty times in those months.john was prosecuted in the south dakota juvenile court system for the offenses.
in february,natural mother filed suit against edith diedrich in south dakota state court on behalf of herself and as guardian ad litem for.the suit charges edith diedrich with negligent supervision of her son john and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.in may,emcasco brought a diversity action in federal district court,seeking a declaratory judgment that the diedrichs policy did not cover the acts alleged by in state court and that,therefore,emcasco had no duty to defend or indemnify edith diedrich or any other insured from the claims made by 
on for summary judgment,the district court,analyzing south dakota law and the homeowner policy and home day care endorsement at issue,determined that emcasco had no duty to defend or indemnify the diedrichs.the district court found that the language of the policy was not ambiguous,the intentional acts exclusion in the homeowner policy precludes coverage for bodily injury that was intended by one of the insureds,that john diedrich was an insured for purposes of the policy as a whole,and that john intentional acts of criminal sexual molestation were excluded from coverage under the policy.
relevant policy provisions 
the homeowner policy lists wayne and edith diedrich as insureds.it is undisputed that their minor son john also qualifies as an insured within the basic definition contained in the policy.the section titled coverage e of the policy provides coverage for an insured personal liability.this coverage entitles insureds to both the payment of damages and a defense to the claim by counsel.
the section ii exclusions section of the homeowner policy states,in pertinent part as follows 
coverage e personal liability do es not apply to bodily injury or property damage 
which is expected or intended by one or more insureds 
arising out of sexual molestation,corporal punishment or physical or mental abuse 
at.any injury or damage resulting from the home day care business conducted by edith diedrich would also have been excluded from coverage under the basic homeowner policy.however,the diedrichs had purchased a home day care coverage endorsement,which provides in pertinent part as follows 
coverage e personal liability appl ies to bodily injury and property damage arising out of home day care services regularly provided by an insured and for which an insured receives monetary or other compensation.section ii exclusion.of the original policy,excluding injury or damage arising out of a business engaged in by an insured does not apply to the coverage provided under this endorsement.
however,the bodily injury and property damage coverage provided under this endorsement does not apply 
to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the maintenance,use,loading or unloading,or entrustment by the insured to any person,of animals,aircraft,motor vehicles or watercraft owned by the insured or 
to bodily injury to any employee 
with respect to the coverage provided by this endorsement,section ii conditions items.limit of liability and.severability of insurance are deleted and replaced 
severability of insurance.
this insurance applies separately to each insured except with respect to the limit of liability 
all other provisions of this policy apply.
at.appellants argue that the state court action is for negligent supervision by edith diedrich,not the intentional acts of her son,and that,therefore,the exclusions do not apply.second,appellants claim that since the exclusions stated in the home day care endorsement exclusions did not include the intentional acts and sexual molestation exclusions stated in the basic homeowner policy,the exclusions of the basic policy were superceded and are no longer in effect.third,appellants claim that,pursuant to the policy severability clause,edith diedrich was the only insured under the home day care endorsement and,therefore,her son john was not an insured,and his acts would not trigger any exclusions from the day care coverage.finally,appellants claim that the policy language is ambiguous when construing the homeowner policy in conjunction with the home day care endorsement.such ambiguity,they argue,should therefore be construed in favor of the insured to include coverage.
emcasco argues that the policy and endorsement are not ambiguous,that they must be read together as a whole,that the severability clause simply means that the policy provisions apply separately to each insured,and that the exclusion from coverage for the intentional acts of one or more insureds precludes coverage in this case.emcasco also argues that coverage is precluded because of the sexual molestation exclusion and case law holding that sexual molestation is not an occurrence,within a similar policy definition.
ii.analysis 
standard of review and south dakota insurance law 
summary judgment should be granted when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.we review de novo the district court interpretation of state law,its interpretation of insurance contracts,and its ultimate decision to grant summary judgment.transcon.ins.samuels,cir.
neither party challenges the assertion that south dakota law applies to this diversity action.under south dakota law,an insurance company duty to defend its insured is much broader than its duty to pay a judgment against its insured.state farm mut.auto.ins.wertz,quoting hawkeye security ins.clifford.the insurer must prove that it has no duty to defend its insured by proving that the claim clearly falls outside of policy coverage.wertz,at quoting north star mut.ins.kneen,emphasis in original further quotations and citations omitted.if there is ambiguity in the policy,a court should construe such ambiguities in favor of the insured and require the insurer to defend.lakes byron store,auto owners ins,wertz,at quoting city of fort pierre united fire cas,further citations omitted.however,a court should evaluate the plain language in the policy as a whole and not attempt to seek a strained or unusual meaning of the language.overfield am.underwriters life ins,quoting chord reynolds,further quotations and citations omitted.
policy exclusions 
neither party contests that the insurance policy would not cover and emcasco would not be required to defend suits against one of the insureds alleging intentional conduct by that insured,including claims of sexual molestation.however,appellants argue that because the insured edith diedrich was sued in negligence,and not vicariously for the intentional tort of her son,that the son acts should be considered separate occurrences under the insurance policy.because the negligence of edith in supervising her son is independent from john intentional acts,appellants argue,the intentional acts and sexual molestation exclusions on the policy do not apply.in other words,emcasco has a duty to defend the diedrichs because the occurrence being alleged in the state court suit is the failure of the diedrichs to supervise john,resulting in the unexpected or unanticipated occurrence of john m
