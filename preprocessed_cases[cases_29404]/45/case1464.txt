overview of ltc insurance 
ltc insurance provides payment towards the cost of services like nursing home care,assisted living care,and home care.to receive benefits,the policyholder must meet a benefit trigger,such as requiring assistance in two activities of daily living,bathing,eating,dressing.ltc insurance policies are usually purchased long before the policyholder will require services,when the policyholder is younger and the insurance premiums are lower.
ltc insurance is a relatively new product.it has been available since the and experienced substantial growth in the.in,the kaiser foundation published the report,regulation of private care insurance implementation experience and key issues.the report described the pricing of ltc policies as subject to considerable uncertainty,and it listed a number of lapse affect the reliability of premium calculations.appellants appendix app.as a result of the variables,two insurers pricing the same policy can come up with very different rates.one using very optimistic assumptions might charge half as much as a more conservative insurer,with the risk of needing rate increases later on.id.
states regulate ltc insurance,and most states do not allow insurers to raise a policyholder premium on an individual basis.state regulators might approve a rate increase applicable to an entire class of policyholders,however,if an insurer is able to show that more revenue is needed to cover current or future costs.when ltc insurance was first introduced,state regulators tended to treat it like health insurance and focused on the affordability of the premiums.according to the kaiser report,t here was no examination to assure that premiums were not too low on the contrary,insurers were discouraged from including any margin for error.id.the report further remarked that s ome less scrupulous insurers deliberately set unrealistically low initial premiums to gain market share,knowing that they might have to raise rates later on.id.rakes and hollander argue that life investors falls into this less scrupulous category.

there was no plan for it because the plan was based on the claims cost that we priced in there.we expected our claims cost to be adequate.
now then if they were not adequate then there different ways of looking at it.and if there would have been a rate increase the rate increase going forward would take care of it.but there was no plan at all for ever having a rate increase throughout the.
the policies at issue were priced in the with the actuarial assumption that the projected lapse rate would be a certain percentage in the first policy year and a different,lower percentage thereafter.the actual lapse rate,however,was lower than expected.soppe explained that in the early nineties,mid nineties,there was no discussion in the industry about the concern about lapse rates getting too low and that lapse rates did not become an issue until the late or early.ross bagshaw,the president of the ltc division,joined life investors in.he analyzed data and reports related to the insurance products at issue,determining that the lapse assumptions in the pricing and in the reserving were too high.app.under bagshaw direction,the company instituted rate hikes and informed its policyholders that further premium increases were likely.

procedural background 
rakes and hollander filed this class action lawsuit against life investors in july,alleging that life investors had used inflated lapse rates to purposefully underprice ltc insurance products with the intent to raise premiums in the future.although the policies and marketing material disclosed that the insureds rates could increase,rakes and hollander alleged that life investors had planned to increase premiums from the outset,yet failed to disclose the plan at the time the insureds bought their policies or upon renewal.the policies guaranteed renewable language was thus untrue and misleading because the rate hikes caused the policies to become unaffordable.the complaint asserted that b y selling the ltc policies as guaranteed renewable policies,life investors affirmatively represented that the ltc policies would also be affordable for life.compl.
rakes and hollander identified a number of fraudulent omissions,centering on the defective nature of the policies and life investors plan to pass the risk of loss to its insureds by instituting rate hikes.the plaintiffs pleaded that life investors further misled them in the documents accompanying the premium increase notification,using false reasons to justify the rate increases.specifically,they identified the following allegedly false statements from the materials accompanying the notification of the rate hike 
we make every effort to provide quality coverage at reasonable and affordable premium rates.
however,sometimes claims significantly exceed anticipated levels.
the company has the right to adjust your premiums in accordance with the terms of the policy.

the complaint alleged four counts actual fraud,constructive fraud,tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing bad faith,and punitive damages.rakes and hollander sought to represent all individuals who bought certain ltc insurance policies from life investors and whose premiums on those policies were increased at any time after.compl.
life investors moved to dismiss,and the district court granted the motion as to the punitive damages count.the district court tentatively determined that iowa had the most significant relationship to the case because the fraudulent scheme likely originated from or was ratified in iowa,where life investors is incorporated and maintains its home office,rather than in missouri or virginia,where rakes and hollander purchased their policies.accordingly,it applied iowa law to the motion to dismiss,noting that it would revisit the choice of law question at class certification and after the parties completed discovery related to choice of law.
the parties submitted a proposed scheduling order and discovery plan,which bifurcated discovery.the first phase encompassed class certification and fact discovery as to the named plaintiffs merits discovery was allowed to the extent the discovery sought pertained to both class certification and the underlying claims.the second phase was scheduled to begin following the court ruling on class certification and included any remaining discovery.the magistrate adopted the parties proposed scheduling order 
the parties engaged in extensive discovery during phase one,and the magistrate judge carefully considered each discovery dispute.document production was voluminous,and rakes and hollander requested,among other things,data relied upon by the actuaries in pricing the policies and information regarding the policies anticipated and actual lapse rates.after rakes and hollander moved to compel the production of those documents,life investors stated that it had produced all documents regarding the pricing of the plaintiffs policies.the magistrate judge ordered life investors to produce the requested information,to the extent it had not already done so,and to identify documents pertaining to the original expected termination lapse rates and expected loss ratios for the policies at issue.rakes life investors ins.of,no,wl,at,unpublished.in response to an interrogatory,life investors stated that it also had produced information related to initial rate filings,rate increase filings,and related correspondence with state regulators for each of its ltc insurance policies in virginia,missouri,and iowa.rakes and hollander deposed a number of people,including the actuaries who priced their policies,the executives and actuaries who pursued the policy rate increases,and life investors federal rule of civil procedure b corporate designee.
before the motion for class certification was due,life investors moved for summary judgment,arguing that the law from the plaintiffs home states should apply,that the fraud claims were barred because life investors disclosed potential rate increases,and that the complaint failed to state a claim for the tort of bad faith.rakes and hollander moved for a continuance and asked that the summary judgment motion be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,which allows the district court to grant appropriate relief to a party that can not present facts essential to justify its opposition to a summary judgment motion.rakes and hollander also substantively opposed life investors motion.
the district court denied the plaintiffs rule f motion,concluding that further discovery into life investors disclosures was unnecessary,and granted the motion for summary judgment,ruling that life investors numerous disclosures of its right to raise premiums negates any alleged misrepresentation or plaintiffs reasonable reliance on a belief their rates would not increase.rakes life investors ins.of,d.because iowa,missouri,and virginia law require that a plaintiff reliance on the alleged fraudulent representations or omissions be reasonable,the district court found no conflict of law and determined that summary judgment was appropriate under the law of each of the three states.the district court also dismissed the plaintiffs claim of tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing bad faith for failure to plead the tor
