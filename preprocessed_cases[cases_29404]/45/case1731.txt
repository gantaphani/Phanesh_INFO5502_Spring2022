discussion 
district court hearing 
during a status hearing,both parties agreed to submit the case to the court on the basis of the briefs and affidavits.however,after reviewing the same,the court chose to order a hearing and to allow deborah gander to testify as a witness on the issue of intent with regard to both the and.the district court allowed this evidence because it determined that the settlement agreement was ambiguous.
livoti and mcmahen contend that the district court erred in holding an evidentiary hearing once the parties agreed to submit the case on the basis of briefs and affidavits.they argue that fairness dictates that the court enforce the agreement of the parties to so submit the case.christian and melissa gander argue that the court has discretionary authority pursuant to.a to order the hearing.
the law is clear that stipulations of law are not binding on the court.sanford estate comm of irs.harbor ins.essman,cir minneapolis brewing merritt.however,stipulations by the parties regarding questions of fact are conclusive.burstein united states,cir.trial courts are bound by the facts established by the stipulation.id.valid stipulations are controlling and conclusive,and courts must enforce them,stipulations.courts can not make contrary findings.hackfield united states.it appears that the parties agreed that they would submit affidavits and briefs to the court.however,nothing is set forth in the record before us that would indicate that a stipulation of facts exists.there might have been some tacit agreement at the status conference,but there is no record of what the parties stipulated to in terms of the facts of this case.consequently,we find that there exists no stipulation that would be binding on the district court so as to preclude the taking of additional evidence.
extrinsic evidence 
livoti and mcmahen argue that the settlement agreement and modification were unambiguous,so no extrinsic evidence was needed.parole evidence,they argue,was inappropriate in this case.they contend that the modification did not require harold to name melissa and christian as beneficiaries under the policy.instead,they argue,the settlement agreement required that the policy be maintained for the benefit of the,deborah,not the children.melissa and christian gander argue that deborah gander testimony on intent was permissible,as the contract was clearly ambiguous.paglin saztec international.
the district court concluded that the language of the settlement agreement and the decree of modification were ambiguous on the issue of whether the documents require harold gander to maintain the life insurance policy with his children as the beneficiaries.like the district court,we conclude that an ambiguity exists.the settlement agreement clearly stated that deborah gander was to be the beneficiary.however,the decree of modification lists deborah gander as beneficiary,but requires that deborah gander use the proceeds for the benefit of the children.she is required to account for all monies spent to harold gander brother,bruce gander.we agree that under these circumstances extrinsic evidence is permissible.john morrell local union,cir extrinsic evidence can not be used to contradict intentions of the parties,but it can be used to demonstrate the ambiguity.
the district court ordered a hearing and allowed deborah gander to testify as to the parties intentions in these agreements.she testified that under the decree of modification,it was the intention of harold gander to make the children the beneficiaries of the life insurance proceeds.harold brother was to oversee the accounting and assure that both children were treated equally.deborah gander was no longer a beneficiary under the policy,which is further substantiated by the elimination of the maintenance payments to her as set forth in the modification.we agree with the district court that the language of the modification of decree and the testimony of deborah gander support an interpretation that the beneficiaries under this modification were intended to be christian and melissa gander.
specific policy of insurance 
the appellants next argue that there exists no evidence identifying a specific policy of insurance that harold gander was required to maintain on his two children.melissa and christian gander argue that deborah gander specifically testified that the policy was for their benefit,and the only policy harold gander maintained was the one through his work at barnes jewish christian center.
livoti and mcmahen argue that the requirement of a general policy of insurance is not sufficient to establish a vested right in the policy on melissa and christian.prudential insurance gibson.because we have concluded that extrinsic evidence was permissible in this case,it was also permissible for the district co
