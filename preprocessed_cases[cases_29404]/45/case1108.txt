plaintiff nationwide mutual insurance company nationwide appeals a district court order denying its application for vacatur of a final arbitration award issued in this reinsurance dispute with defendant home insurance company home.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court confirming the award.
this dispute originated in,when nationwide filed suit against home for breach of a reinsurance contract that the parties had originally entered into in.the district court referred the parties to arbitration pursuant to the terms of an arbitration clause in the reinsurance agreement.numerous interim decisions of the arbitration panel were thereafter challenged in the district court,and,in fact,this is the fourth time this matter has come before the sixth circuit for review.the extensive procedural history and involvement of this court is found at nationwide mut.ins.home ins,cir nationwide i nationwide mut.ins.home ins,cir nationwide ii and nationwide mut.ins.home ins,cir nationwide iii.the facts are succinctly set forth in detail in these prior opinions and will not be reiterated here except to the extent necessary to dispose of the issues presented on this appeal.
after this court decision in nationwide iii,the parties proceeded to the third phase of arbitration,culminating in a merits hearing.on july,the arbitration panel rendered its unanimous final decision which,in pertinent part,awarded home the sum of in costs and interest 
nationwide filed suit in district court to vacate the final award and two interim rulings rendered by the arbitration panel.in the alternative,nationwide sought vacation of the interim rulings and paragraphs and of the final decision granting home request for recovery of its fronting share administrative costs fsac and part of its costs in the arbitration.home opposed the vacatur application and sought confirmation of the final order.
on september,the district court issued an opinion and order denying nationwide vacatur application,granting home for confirmation of the arbitration award,and entering a final judgment in favor of defendant home insurance.
nationwide now appeals the district court denial of its vacatur application,primarily on the ground of evident partiality based on an arbitrator alleged nondisclosure of certain business and social relationships with home.
the federal arbitration act faa expresses a presumption that arbitration awards will be confirmed.andersons,horton farms,cir.when courts are called on to review an arbitrator decision,the review is very narrow one of the narrowest standards of judicial review in all of american jurisprudence.nationwide ii,at quoting united steelworkers,cir.a s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.united paperworkers int l union misco,d.thus,a federal court may vacate an arbitration award only in very limited circumstances.nationwide iii,at.those circumstances include where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,a,and where the arbitrators act with manifest disregard for the law.id.quoting dawahare spencer,cir.in addition,an arbitration award may be vacated upon application of any party to the arbitration where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them.a.when reviewing a district court denial of a motion to vacate an arbitration decision,we accept the court findings of fact,unless clearly erroneous,and consider questions of law de novo.nationwide ii,at dawahare,at.
in the district court,nationwide sought to vacate the final award of the second arbitration panel on the ground that the arbitrator,ronald jacks,displayed evident partiality contrary to subsection a of the faa,a.nationwide also alleged that jacks engaged in improper ex parte contacts with one of home attorneys and with employees of holdings,and cigna corporation specifically,nationwide alleged that during the course of arbitration jacks failed to disclose certain business and social relationships with home and its counsel relying on apperson fleet carrier,cir,cert.denied,d,which held that evident partiality will be found only where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration,the district court concluded that nationwide claims of evident partiality were unfounded.
nationwide now contends that,in assessing the effects of jacks alleged nondisclosures,the district court applied the wrong standard.nationwide urges this court to limit application of the apperson standard to actual bias cases,where the evident partiality claim is based on facts known or disclosed and objected to by the challenging party prior to or during the arbitration.citing commonwealth coatings continental casualty,d nationwide maintains that the fact of the nondisclosure alone mandates vacatur under either a reasonable impression of bias or appearance of bias standard.we disagree.
in apperson,this court,addressing allegations of evident partiality in the context of the arbitration of a labor contract dispute adopted the objective test utilized by the court of appeals for the second circuit in morelite construction new york city dist.council carpenters benefit funds,cir,in which the second circuit held that evident partiality will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.id.at quoted in apperson,at.we also accepted morelite rejection,as dicta,of the appearance of bias standard espoused in the plurality opinion in commonwealth coatings.apperson,at.

the arbitration agreement in this case requires that the arbitrators come from within the insurance industry and further provides for a tripartite panel consisting of two arbitrators and one neutral umpire.see nationwide mut.home ins,d.thus,as the district court noted,the parties clearly agreed to submit their claims to panel members who are involved in the business of insurance the most arbitrators are those who are prominent and experienced members of the specific business community in which the dispute to be arbitrated arose.since they are chosen precisely because of their involvement in that community,some degree of overlapping representation and interest inevitably results.int l produce,rosshavet,cir.
home arbitrator,ronald jacks,who is the focus of the present case,has extensive experience serving as an international reinsurance arbitrator,a fact noted by the seventh circuit in sphere drake,at,when it addressed a claim of evident partiality against jacks in another unrelated reinsurance arbitration.the seventh circuit overturned the district court finding of evident partiality based on jacks alleged failure to fully disclose that he had acted as counsel for a subsidiary of a party to the arbitration in an unrelated matter four years earlier.in so holding,the court held that jacks status as a arbitrator on a tripartite panel was of particular significance 
industry arbitration,the modern law merchant,often uses panels composed of industry insiders,the better to understand the trade norms of doing business and the consequences of proposed lines of decision.see lisa bernstein,private commercial law in the cotton industry creating cooperation through rules,norms,and institutions.the more experience the panel has,and the smaller the number of repeat players,the more likely it is that the panel will contain some actual or potential friends,counselors,or business rivals of the parties.yet all participants may think the tradeoff worthwhile the arbitration act does not fasten on every industry the model of the disinterested generalist judge.
id.at emphasis added.
the sphere drake court,acknowledging these industry practices and the fact that only evident partiality,not appearances or risks,spoils an award,id.at,concluded that jacks prior engagement did not demonstrate evident partiality within the meaning of a 
let us suppose that the district judge inferences are jacks spent two months of equivalent service as counsel for sphere drake in an international insurance arbitration,four years before the unrelated arbitration with all american.even if jacks had been the umpire,this would not have implied evident partiality.indeed,jacks could have served as a federal judge in this case without challenge on grounds of partiality,and the scope of disqualification under a is considerably more confined than the rule applicable to judges.
the sphere drake court further held that,even assuming arguendo that jacks had not adequately disclosed the extent of his involvement in the prior,unrelated proceedings,this nondisclosure alone did not demonstrate evident partiality 
commonwealth coatings did not hold that disclosure is compulsory for its own sake,and its absence fatal even if the arbitrator meets judicial standards of impartiality nor did commonwealth coatings so much as hint that arbitrators are governed by the norms under which neutrals operate.the point of commonwealth coatings is that the sort of financial entanglements that would disqualify a judge will cause problems for a neutral under a unless disclosure is made and the parties consent obtained.
the seventh circuit decision in sphere drake reinforces our conclusion that we should continue to adhere to the apperson standard in this case,where evident partiality based on the alleged nondisclosure of material relationships by a arbitrator is claimed.in formulating the objective standard now used by the sixth circuit,the morelite court,like the seventh circuit in sphere drake,was cognizant of the practices and norms peculiar to industry arbitration and incorporated these considerations in its analysis.at t o disqualify any arbitrator who had professional dealings with one of the parties to say nothing of a social acquaintanceship would make it impossible,in some circumstances,to find a qualified arbitrator at all.the rationale of sphere drake,which places an onerous burden of proof on the party alleging evident partiality of a arbitrator,is entirely consistent with the apperson standard,which likewise requires proof of circumstances powerfully suggestive of bias.apperson,at quoting merit ins,at.
given the arbitration format voluntarily chosen by the parties in this case,to permit vacatur based upon the mere appearance of bias of a arbitrator would be to render this efficient means of dispute resolution ineffective in many commercial settings.morelite,at we thus proceed to review nationwide allegations of evident partiality pertaining to arbitrator jacks to determine whether a reasonable person would have to conclude that the arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.
during an october organization meeting with the arbitration panel,the panel members disclosed their contracts and connections with each other,the parties,and the parties attorneys.arbitrator jacks,a retired lawyer,disclosed that he had no prior involvement with nationwide,but stated that he had served as home arbitrator on six matters over twenty years,and as opposing arbitrator twice.jacks further stated that he had served on a number of occasions in the last years as a party arbitrator to cigna,and with regard to ace,i represented ace when i was actively practicing law.at the time of the arbitration,jacks law firm was outside general counsel for ace,but i have no continuing involvement in that representation.he disclosed that he had been a party arbitrator for his firm clients in eighteen arbitrations over a period of more than twenty years he was opposing party arbitrator in three or four cases he served as an umpire in two cases and he was currently serving as an expert for one of their clients.jacks opined at that time that he would accept future engagements with if he thought it was appropriate.
over the next two years,no additional disclosures were made by the arbitrators.in november,nationwide attorney wrote the arbitrators requesting that each update their disclosures.jacks promptly replied,noting his appointment as an arbitrator for ace in an unrelated matter.nationwide did not object to jacks service at the time of the disclosure.further details of his involvement were sent by jacks in january upon nationwide request.specifically,jacks disclosed that he served approximately twenty times over a year period as an arbitrator appointed by ace or cigna.
nationwide took no further action regarding jacks supplemental disclosures until after the united states district court for the northern district of illinois issued its decision in sphere drake,finding evident partiality on the part of jacks in an unrelated arbitration.sphere drake ins.all am.life ins,wl.may,nationwide readily acknowledges that it was prompted by the district court decision in sphere drake to make further inquiries in the present case concerning jacks.in july,nationwide attorney sent jacks more detailed questions about his relationship with and the compensation he had received from them over a period.jacks prompt response noted that from to date he had participated in over arbitrations between insurers and reinsurers he had acted as a arbitrator for in twenty cases,three of them still pending since,he had served as a party arbitrator for and against home in six matters and,while actively practicing law,he was not a billing partner at his firm for any legal work he did for.jacks declined to disclose the amount of total compensation he received from his prior participation in matters involving home and.at a september organizational meeting,nationwide agreed to continue with the arbitration under a reservation of rights.nationwide subsequently raised the issue of arbitral bias in the district court proceedings below,and also alleged that there were improper ex parte social contacts on the part of jacks with home counsel and employees.
these facts would not,in our opinion,lead a reasonable person to conclude that jacks was partial to one side of the arbitration.as the district court noted,this is not even a case of nondisclosure,as nationwide argues rather,jacks made full and timely disclosures regarding his business relationship with home and.these disclosures were not deficient,and nationwide otherwise has failed to show with specificity how the substance of these disclosures pertaining to jacks continued service in the reinsurance industry,and his prior and ongoing contacts with home and in numerous unrelated matters,manifest evident partiality pursuant to a and are powerfully suggestive of bias in the present matter.
we likewise agree with the district court that jacks social engagements did not constitute improper or prohibited ex parte contacts.these events did not involve any communication regarding the arbitration.certainly,arbitrators and attorneys frequently participate in activities that result in communication unrelated to the subject matter of litigation before the arbitrator,morelite,at,and it would be unreasonable to suggest such contacts in unrelated matters are prohibited.
we therefore conclude,on the basis of the above record,that the district court did not clearly err in denying nationwide application for vacatur based on the allegations of evident partiality on the part of arbitrator
