on march,a fire destroyed the millersport,ohio,lakeside residence of don mcauliffe,a sitting judge of the fairfield county municipal court,lancaster,ohio.at the time of the fire,defendant was vacationing in the virgin islands.defendant twice sent verified proof of loss claim forms to his insurer,grange mutual casualty company grange,via united states mail,representing in the forms that the cause and origin of the said loss were unknown to claimant.defendant eventually settled his claim for.he used the insurance proceeds to pay off the mortgage on the destroyed property and a car loan,and to make a down payment on another parcel of real estate.federal,state,and local authorities,however,became suspicious that the fire had been purposefully set by defendant and a business partner,darrell faller,as part of a scheme to defraud the insurance company.
on april,following an investigation into the matter,a federal grand jury in the southern district of ohio indicted defendant on charges of mail fraud,in violation of counts one and two using fire to commit mail fraud,in violation of h count three conspiring to use fire to commit mail fraud,contrary to m count four and,in violation of counts five and six.the indictment sought forfeiture of the insurance proceeds,as well as the real and personal property acquired with those proceeds.
following a nearly jury trial,defendant was convicted as charged on all counts.the district court originally sentenced defendant to months of imprisonment specifically,months on counts one and two months on counts four,five,and six,to run concurrently to each other and to the sentences on counts one and two and months on count three,to be served consecutively.defendant filed a timely notice of appeal and,while the appeal was pending,this court remanded for in light of the newly issued decision in united states booker,d.defendant was to a total of months of imprisonment concurrent sentences of months on counts one,two,four,five,and six,and a consecutive sentence of months on count three.a final order of forfeiture was entered by the court.the amended judgment of conviction and sentence was entered on december,the same date on which defendant filed the present appeal 
in his appeal,defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and alleges,inter alia,that defects in the indictment and improper constructive amendments to it mandate reversal of his convictions.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
defendant first alleges numerous deficiencies in the indictment and maintains that the indictment was constructively amended through the jury instructions given by the district court.defendant concedes that he did not raise these challenges below thus,review is for plain error.fed.crim.b united states cotton,d.
we review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo.an indictment is generally sufficient if it fully,directly,and expressly set s forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.united states douglas,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.in particular,the indictment must set out all of the elements of the charge d offense and must give notice to the defendant of the charges he faces,and be sufficiently specific to enable the defendant to plead double jeopardy in a subsequent proceeding,if charged with the same crime based on the same facts.id.at internal citation omitted.an indictment will usually be sufficient if it states the offense using the words of the statute itself,as long as the statute fully and unambiguously states all the elements of the offense.united states superior growers supply,cir.however,the recitation of statutory language must be accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense,coming under the general description with which he is charged.id.quoting hamling united states,d.
the indictment must be read as a whole,accepting the factual allegations as true,and construing those allegations in a practical sense with all the necessary implications.united states reed,cir en banc.an indictment is to be construed liberally in favor of its sufficiency.united states davis,cir.
here,defendant contends that counts one and two of the indictment,which allege violations of the mail fraud statute,do not adequately set forth two of the requisite elements of that offense that defendant acted willfully with an intent to defraud,and that a material misrepresentation was made.
the mail fraud statute prohibits the use of the mails by any person having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.mail fraud consists of a scheme or artifice to defraud use of mails in furtherance of the scheme and intent to deprive the victim of money or property.united states turner,cir.materiality of falsehood is a requisite element of mail fraud.neder united states,d.the misrepresentation must have the purpose of inducing the victim of the fraud to part with the property or undertake some action that he would not otherwise do absent the misrepresentation or omission.united states daniel,cir.a misrepresentation is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the decision of the body to which it was addressed.neder,at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the requisite intent to defraud requires an intent to deceive or cheat for the purpose of either causing a financial loss to another or bringing about a financial gain to oneself.sixth circuit pattern jury instruction e see also united states frost,cir.with regard to both elements at issue,an indictment is not fatally insufficient for its failure to allege these elements in haec verba,if the facts alleged in the indictment warrant the inference of such elements,materiality and intent to defraud.united states mcgough,cir materiality united states hoag,cir intent to defraud.
in this case,the indictment more than adequately alleges the elements of materiality and intent to defraud.paragraph of the indictment includes in the allegations the statutory language of.paragraph of the indictment alleges that defendant falsely represented to grange insurance company that the fire damage to the dwelling at issue and its contents was not caused by design or procurement on his part,though he then well knew otherwise.paragraphs and similarly allege that defendant submitted two sworn proof of loss statements which falsely represented that the march,fire damage to the residence had not been designed or procured by him though he then well knew that his acts in planning and causing the fire damage eliminated his right to payment under the insurance policy.certainly these allegations,that defendant representation that the cause of the fire damage was unknown to him,related to a matter that had a tendency to influence grange decision to settle his claim.the indictment alleges that defendant made these misrepresentations well knowing that his role in the scheme barred his right to recover the insurance proceeds.
in addressing a similar claim involving the analogous bank fraud statute,the second circuit court of appeals,in united states klein,cir,recently held 
it is true that a bank fraud conviction requires a showing that the fraudulent conduct was material,neder united states,d,although the bank fraud statute does not contain that actual word.in neder,the supreme court held that materiality was an element of bank fraud because the word fraud incorporated fraud meaning at common law a misrepresentation or concealment of material fact.id.at.appellant claims,therefore,that the indictment is insufficient because it does not explicitly use the word material.appellant did not raise this issue in the district court,and thus we review only for plain error.united states acosta,cir per curiam.
there was no error.if materiality can be inferred to be an element of criminal fraud because of the meaning of fraud as a legal term,an allegation of materiality can be inferred from use of the word fraud in the indictment.moreover,as commonly understood among both lawyers and laypersons,fraud refers to conduct or speech intended to mislead the putative victim into parting with money or property.see united states,d agreeing with the government that the indictment at bar implicitly alleged that respondent engaged in the necessary overt act simply by alleging that he attempted to enter the united states,because n ot only does the word attempt as used in common parlance connote action rather than mere intent,but more importantly,as used in the law for centuries,it encompasses both the overt act and intent elements of the crime of attempted illegal reentry internal quotation marks omitted.the materiality of the misleading conduct or speech is therefore at the heart of the word fraud.conduct or speech that is a putative victim can not be fraud.finally,each of the counts on which appellant was convicted contained an allegation that he obtained money or credit by means of false or fraudulent representations.again,one can not fraudulently induce a victim to part with money or credit by means of immaterial representations.
contrary to defendant argument,a reading of the indictment as a whole supports the government position that counts one and two adequately aver the requisite elements of the offense of mail fraud.moreover,defendant has not shown that the alleged deficiencies affected his substantial rights or the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of these proceedings,as required by a plain error analysis.cotton,at.
defendant next alleges that the indictment misidentified grange insurance company as the victim of his scheme,rather than the properly titled grange mutual casualty company.this argument is without,the identity of the victim of a fraudulent scheme is not an essential element that the government is required to prove,united states otto,cir united states trapilo,cir,and,in any event,defendant has shown neither that he was prejudiced as a result of the error in the description nor that he lacked notice as a result of the claimed mistake.indeed,in his written communications with his insurer,he referred to the company as either grange or grange insurance.
defendant further claims that count three,which alleges a violation of h,does not charge him with an offense cognizable under federal law.defendant complains that certain language in count three,stating that defendant damaged or destroyed his home by means of fire,contains terminology that also appears in i,the arson statute which was not the basis for the indictment.defendant in essence argues that the indictment blurs the requisite elements of the crime with which he was charged and b eing convicted for committing and conspiring to commit a hybrid law a bit of h and a bit of i not created by congress is a plain error that seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation.
mcauliffe argument is indeed without merit,as the government argues.section h makes it a crime to use fire or an explosive to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the united states.count three of the indictment alleges that on or about march,defendant knowingly used fire to commit mail fraud,as more fully set forth in counts one and two,incorporated herein by reference,in violation of,a felony prosecutable in a court of the united states.in violation of h and.these allegations mirror the statutory text and are sufficiently accompanied by such facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense,coming under the general description with which he is charged.the mere fact that some of the operative terms of i appear in the indictment does not diminish the fact that count three sufficiently alleges a violation of h.
defendant also maintains that the jury instructions constructively amended the indictment and therefore require reversal of his convictions.specifically,he complains that,although counts one and two of the indictment correctly charged him with devis ing a scheme and artifice to defraud,and for obtaining money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,representations and promises,emphasis added,the jury instructions improperly substituted the disjunctive or for the italicized and.defendant contends that this had the effect of broadening the bases for conviction beyond what the grand jury had alleged,in violation of his fifth amendment rights.
a constructive amendment to the indictment occurs when the terms of the indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of an offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.united states manning,cir quoting united states hathaway,cir.a defendant bears the burden of proof on this issue.united states rashid,cir.a constructive amendment to the indictment constitutes a per se violation of the fifth amendment grand jury clause.united states syme,cir internal quotation omitted.
title,however,uses the disjunctive or,not and whoever,having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.it is settled law that an offense may be charged conjunctively in an indictment where a statute denounces the offense disjunctively.upon the trial,the government may prove and the trial judge may instruct in the disjunctive form used in the statute.united states murph,cir internal citation omitted.a constructive amendment claim has thus been rejected in the present context.see united states stone,cir involving similar language in bank fraud statute.thus,defendant contention in this regard is without merit,as are his remaining claims pertaining to alleged constructive amendments to the indictment.
defendant next challenges his convictions and sentences stemming from counts three and four of the indictment.h provides that w hoever uses fire or an explosive to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the united states shall in addition to the punishment provided for such felony,be sentenced to imprisonment for years.subsection m covers conspiracy to commit an offense under subsection h.as previously noted,the indictment charged defendant with the underlying offense of using fire to commit mail fraud in violation of.defendant contends that,pursuant to h and m,the requirement that fire be used to commit mail fraud was not met because if he committed mail fraud,he did so by using the mails,not by using fire.
mcauliffe interpretation of the statute,however,has been considered and rejected by several courts.in united states ruiz,cir,the first circuit court of appeals rejected this construction of the statute urged by the present defendant and by the defendants therein.construing the word use in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning,the court noted that use generally means t o convert to one service,to employ,to avail oneself of,and to carry out a purpose or action by means of.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the ruiz court opined 
we think it plain that the defendants used fire to commit mail fraud within the meaning of h.the defendants set fire to brothers fashions to carry out their scheme to deceive the insurance company into making payment for claimed losses.specifically,the fire constituted the means by which the defendants attempted to create the appearance of a legitimate loss of insured items.while the defendants also used the mails in furtherance of the scheme to defraud,that does not diminish the fact that,additionally,they employed or availed themselves of fire to effect their scheme.finally,the defendants make no argument that the placement and purpose of the word use in its statutory context undermine the applicability of h here.see bailey united states,d at considering disputed language in the context of overall statutory scheme.no basis for such an argument is apparent.
at internal citation and footnotes omitted.see also united states zendeli,cir as the first circuit held in ruiz,a defendant uses fire to commit mail fraud under h when he initiates a fire as part of a scheme to deceive an insurance company into making payments for claimed losses.under such circumstances,fire constitutes the means by which the individual attempts to create the appearance of legitimate loss of an insured item.internal citation omitted.
the eighth circuit court of appeals recently endorsed this position as well,favorably citing ruiz in a decision upholding a h conviction arising from a insurance fraud scheme involving the mails.see united states ihmoud,cir.
we agree with our sister circuits reasonable interpretation of the statute and add that such a construction of the statute is consistent with the legislative history of h,which indicates that fire was added to this statute originally,only an explosive was designated in,because it was recognized that fire is commonly and extensively used not only for extortion,but for insurance fraud as well.act of,stat.see,reprinted in,thus,h creates a federal offense with an enhanced penalty for persons who commit crimes that do not require but may involve the use of fire.united states patel,cir.defendant argument is without merit.
in an argument raised for the first time on appeal,defendant argues that because h and m do not bear a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce,these provisions are not a valid exercise of congress commerce clause power.consequently,he contends,they are unconstitutional in light of united states lopez,d,because these subsections have nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise and contain no jurisdictional element which would ensure that the alleged illegal act in question affects interstate commerce.lopez,at.
although this court has not addressed this specific issue,in united states creech,cir,the fifth circuit court of appeals expressly rejected the argument now made by defendant 
first,creech raises a commerce clause challenge to h,which provides an additional penalty for anyone who uses fire to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the united states.he essentially argues that because the statute does not require a jurisdictional nexus with interstate commerce to be proved in court,it does not come under congress authority to regulate interstate commerce.because creech did not raise this challenge below,we review for plain error.see johnson united states,d.
creech argument fails because h jurisdictional nexus is derived from the underlying felony,which must be one that may be prosecuted in a court of the united states.by definition,then,a violation of h must necessarily be based on an underlying crime that is properly within federal jurisdiction.united states pappadopoulos,cir finding that section h does not facially exceed congress commerce power because it requires that the underlying felony itself be one that can be prosecuted in a court of the united states.indeed,we have previously found a very similar statute,c,a valid exercise of congress commerce power,even though no specific nexus with interstate commerce is required for conviction.united states owens,cir.
here,the underlying felony crime was mail fraud in violation of.creech does not contend that is an invalid exercise of congress commerce clause power.consequently,we find that creech indictment and conviction under h was not unconstitutional.
at footnote omitted.
here,as in creech,mail fraud,the underlying offense,is not challenged by defendant as violative of the commerce clause.we thus adopt the sound rationale of the court in creech and,applying it to the present circumstances,conclude that defendant commerce clause challenge can not prevail.
in a related argument pertaining to the validity of his convictions under h and m,defendant notes that,pursuant to jones united states,d,the arson of an private residence not used for any commercial purpose is not subject to prosecution under the arson statute,i.defendant maintains that the government circumvented this proscription,which would apply to the present circumstances involving a private residence,by charging defendant under h but,in reality,trying the case as if it were an arson,not mail fraud,prosecution.defendant also cites the ihmoud court reference to h as a provision involving arson in furtherance of mail fraud,rather than the use of fire to commit mail fraud,ihmoud,at emphasis added,as reinforcement for his claim that he was effectively but improperly convicted of arson,not mail fraud.
defendant reliance upon the jones and ihmoud decisions is misplaced.unlike defendant,who could not be and was not in fact prosecuted for arson because his conduct in burning his own noncommercial residential home does not fall within the ambit of the arson statute,i,as interpreted in jones,the defendant in ihmoud actually was charged with and convicted on charges of arson,conspiracy to commit arson,and the use of fire to commit mail fraud for his actions in setting fire to several commercial establishments to which the arson statute applies.ihmoud,at.moreover,the ihmoud court reference to arson in furtherance of mail fraud was made in the context of addressing the defendants challenge to the district court jury instructions using such language and its alleged failure to specify in the instructions that the underlying felony necessary to support a h offense was mail fraud,not arson.the ihmoud court noted that t o the extent that there is ambiguity in the instructions,it is harmless.the evidence at trial overwhelmingly demonstrates that the purpose of the fire was to commit mail fraud by fraudulently collecting insurance payments.id.at.here,defendant effort to characterize his convictions pursuant to counts three and four as convictions for arson,rather than using fire to commit mail fraud,is unpersuasive,and plain error is not evident.
defendant next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure at the close of the government proofs,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that he and faller conspired to burn down his residence.the district court denied the motion and,upon defendant filing of a renewed motion for dismissal,the court issued an opinion and order,dated may,again denying the motion.
an order denying a motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo.united states kone,cir.this court reviews the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution,giving the prosecution the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the testimony.united states abboud,cir.the relevant question in assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
we agree with the district court that there was ample evidence on which to convict defendant.at trial,faller testified as a witness for the government that he and defendant conspired to burn down defendant house so that defendant could obtain the insurance proceeds and use the proceeds to demolish the house and rebuild it.they arranged for defendant to be out of town when faller started the fire.defendant former girlfriend,beth westminster,also testified as a government witness,corroborating that faller and defendant conspired to burn down the house with the ultimate purpose of rebuilding it.in their first attempt,defendant and faller tried to rupture a gas line in the house however,this attempt failed.faller testified that he and defendant then made a second attempt to burn down the residence by placing a halogen lamp against a wall that they believed would ignite.this attempt was successful and,during the early morning hours of march,the house caught fire.
an insurance adjuster investigated the fire damage and observed fire damage on the lower level,but also noticed more extensive fire damage on the upper level of the home.due to suspicions about the cause and origin of the fire,she then referred the matter to a consulting firm.richard marzola,an electrical engineer,took photos and collected debris from the site.he observed the burn patterns near the lamp,but also noticed a second set of burn patterns at
