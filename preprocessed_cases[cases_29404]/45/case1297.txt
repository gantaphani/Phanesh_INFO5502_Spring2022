state farm denied the clark children uim claims.merry clark then filed suit on behalf of the clark children against state farm in indiana state court.state farm successfully removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of indiana,invoking the district court diversity jurisdiction.the district court subsequently granted state farm motion for summary judgment.it found that indiana underinsured motor vehicle statute,indiana code b,requires the court to compare the relevant limits in the claimant uim policy to the actual amount available to the claimant under the other insurer policy.under the indiana statute,if the amount available to the claimant is less than the claimant insurance policy relevant uim liability limit,or,the other vehicle is deemed an underinsured motor vehicle and uim coverage is invoked.id.since more than one of the clarks were injured in the collision,the district court looked to the amount actually available to the clarks collectively under akers liability limit and compared that amount to the uim coverage in the days state farm policy.it concluded that the vehicle akers operated was not an underinsured motor vehicle because the liability limit contained in akers insurance policy the full amount of which was paid to the clark family was equal to the state farm policy uim coverage.the clark children appeal.
we first examine whether this court may exercise jurisdiction over this case.during oral argument,the panel questioned the parties regarding whether this case satisfied the amount in controversy requirement of.specifically,the panel questioned whether diversity jurisdiction was proper if neither of the clark children individual claims on appeal exceeds,by and by.it is well settled that while an individual plaintiff multiple claims against a single defendant may be aggregated to determine diversity jurisdiction,the separate claims of multiple plaintiffs against a single defendant can not be aggregated to meet the jurisdictional requirement.see sarnoff am.home prods,cir stating that when there is more than one plaintiff each one claim must exceed the statutory minimum and those claims can not be aggregated citing hixon,cir.the amount in controversy requirement,however,must be determined by the district court at the beginning of the suit,and is not dependent on subsequent dismissal of individual claims used to satisfy the jurisdictional threshold.johnson wattenbarger,cir whether supplies jurisdiction must be ascertained at the outset events after the suit begins do not affect the diversity jurisdiction.
in their supplemental briefs,the parties argued that the amount in controversy requirement was satisfied because the clark children original complaint included claims against state farm for bad faith seeking compensatory and punitive damages,in addition to their breach of contract claims currently before this court.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of state farm on both claims,but the clark children only elected to appeal their breach of contract claim.generally,we give plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt in these matters,but a complaint will be dismissed if it appears to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount.del vecchio conseco,cir internal quotations omitted we have no quarrel in principle with the idea that punitive damages may sometimes be taken into account in deciding whether the proper amount is in controversy.indiana law recognizes a cause of action against an insurer for breaching its duty to exercise good faith in evaluating claims,and it permits recovery of punitive damages.erie ins.hickman,stating that the recognition of an independent tort for the breach of the insurer obligation to exercise good faith provides the tort upon which punitive damages may be based.accordingly,we give both of the clark children the benefit of the doubt that their original contractual and bad faith claims sought total damages in excess of,and find that the district court properly exercised its diversity jurisdiction.
on appeal,the clark children argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of state farm.specifically,the clark children claim that state farm denial of their claims breached the terms of its policy uim coverage because,although the clark family collec
