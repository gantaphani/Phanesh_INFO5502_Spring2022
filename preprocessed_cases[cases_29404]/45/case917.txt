the bankruptcy court held that the title insurance policy issued to appellee first trust national association first trust insured first trust security interest in a casino boat being constructed at a location remote from the insured land where the boat would eventually be moored.the district court affirmed.finding that the policy does not provide coverage,we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural background 
this insurance coverage dispute has its roots in belle casinos,bci failed effort to build two gambling developments in mississippi.since,the state has permitted gambling on riverboat casinos located on the waters of the mississippi river and on vessels moored in the coastal waters south of the state three counties.see,ann,et.bci and its wholly owned subsidiary biloxi casino belle,bcbi planned to operate one casino along the mississippi river in tunica and the other casino along the waterfront in biloxi.the tunica casino boat was to be constructed,but the biloxi the biloxi belle ii was to be built some miles away in gulfport and then floated to biloxi,where improvements and structures would be built on the waterfront parcels that had been leased for this purpose.
to finance the casino projects,bci issued million in mortgage notes underwritten by bear stearns.the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture executed between bci as issuer and first trust as indenture trustee for holders of the mortgage notes.bci loaned the proceeds of the mortgage notes to bcbi,and in return bcbi gave bci a promissory note.to secure the loan,bcbi executed in bci favor a leasehold deed of trust,security agreement and fixture filing with assignment of rents leasehold deed of trust on the biloxi project,as well as various other security instruments.the leasehold deed of trust gave bci security interests in most of the realty including fixtures and personalty associated with the casino project,including ships and boats.bci assigned its interests in these instruments to first trust,the indenture trustee.
bcbi deposited the proceeds of the loan into two escrow accounts at first national bank of commerce first national bank under a disbursement and escrow agreement between bci as lender,bcbi as borrower,and first national bank as escrow agent.bci rights under this disbursement and escrow agreement were likewise assigned to first trust.
the deal documents contemplated several devices that would protect the interests of first trust and ultimately the interests of the holders of the mortgage notes for whom first trust acted as indenture trustee.the documents required contractors performance bonds,for instance,and provided that contractors would execute lien waivers.importantly,they also called for first trust to acquire title insurance from appellant first american title insurance company first american title to insure at least some of the interests securing the loan that was paying for the construction of the casino project.as noted earlier,the leasehold deed of trust and other security instruments gave first trust a security interest in almost all of the property,both real and personal,associated with the biloxi casino project.the key issue in this case is whether the title insurance policy covers only first trust security interests in the realty component of the project or instead whether the policies also protect first trust security interests in the biloxi belle ii while it was being constructed.
first trust was not directly involved in the negotiations leading to the issuance of the title insurance policies but instead left the matter to bear stearns,which in turn was represented by the law firm of gibson,dunn crutcher.first american title was represented by david wheeler,a attorney.wheeler gave first trust a binding commitment to issue title insurance on or around october,the closing date of the loan transactions described above.about a month after the closing,wheeler sent gibson dunn a copy of the policies.the title insurance policy at issue here is the version of the loan policy developed by the american land title association the policy insured first trust against,inter alia,losses that would occur if another lien including in some cases a mechanic lien took priority over first trust insured security interest.the policy also obligated the insurer to pay expenses associated with defending the title and the insured security interest.attached to the standard forms were several schedules and endorsements that set forth details.of particular note is item on schedule a,which identified the instruments creating the estate or the interest in real estate which is hereby insured.in the original version of the policy that wheeler sent to gibson dunn,item a rider that listed not only the leasehold deed of all sides agree was supposed to be also various financing statements mississippi form that described,using language generally the same as that used in the leasehold deed of trust,many broad categories of bcbi personalty and fixtures in which first trust held a security interest.like the leasehold deed of trust,the forms cover ships and boats.the attachments to the included descriptions of the real property associated with the casino project,and the forms were recorded in the county books.
in the months that followed gibson dunn receipt of the insurance policy,gibson dunn and wheeler corresponded regarding numerous corrections to the forms.in april,wheeler sent the revised pages of the policy to gibson dunn.in addition to making the changes requested by gibson dunn,wheeler noted that the revised copy eliminated the reference to the financing statements,leaving the leasehold deed of trust as the only document listed in schedule a,item.in the current litigation,the parties take sharply differing views of how to characterize these exchanges.according to first american title,the commitment documents negotiated by the parties concerned only land,and the inclusion of the financing statements in the initial version of the policy documents was simply a drafting mistake that wheeler corrected with gibson dunn approval.according to first trust,in contrast,the inclusion of the was not a mistake at all,since the title insurance policies were always intended to cover more than just the real estate associated with the biloxi project.or,says first trust,if their inclusion was initially a mistake,wheeler could not amend the policy without first trust consent,which the gibson dunn attorneys did not give him and were not authorized to give him.in any event,it seems that first trust only saw the later version of the policy and did not learn of the initial version until years later when,in connection with this case,first american title submitted it as an attachment to its complaint.
meanwhile,construction of the casino boats was running over budget.the contractor for the casino boats,charles white construction company white construction,continued to receive payments from the accounts at first national bank despite the overruns.first trust eventually put a stop to the payments and later sued first national bank for alleged incompetence in the latter role as disbursement and escrow agent white construction,which now claimed that it was still owed payments for work it had already performed,filed a mississippi statutory watercraft lien on the biloxi belle ii in june.the next month,white construction sued bci in mississippi state court to enforce its lien.bci and bcbi then filed chapter bankruptcy petitions in august.a number of lawsuits among bci,bcbi,first trust,white construction,and the principals of various of those parties ensued over the course of the next few years.
one paragraph of white construction complaint against bci listed first trust as a party that had a potentially competing interest in the biloxi belle ii.in october,first trust sent first american title a letter giving notice of the lawsuit.first american title acknowledged the letter the next month and expressed its understanding that first trust was not requesting a defense.some two years later,in december,first trust requested a defense in the white construction litigation,which had by now been removed to federal court and referred to the bankruptcy court.first american title agreed to provide a defense,but under a reservation of its rights to deny coverage.first trust rejected first american title tendered counsel,however,asserting that the reservation of rights created a conflict of interest.first trust wanted first american title to pay for counsel of the former choice.first american title therefore filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court in march,seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not responsible for any losses or expenses associated with white construction claims against first trust.first trust counterclaimed,seeking payment of its expenses in defending against white construction claims and indemnification for any losses that would occur if white construction lien primed first trust security interest in the biloxi belle ii.
most of the litigation stemming from the failed casino projects came to a close in july with the filing and the bankruptcy court approval of the amended joint liquidating plan the plan.under the plan,white construction received million for its claims.the insurance coverage dispute between first trust and first american title continued,however.in august,the bankruptcy court granted first american title motion for partial summary judgment,absolving first american title of any liability for litigation expenses incurred before first trust december request for a defense.in march,the parties filed for summary judgment regarding first american title liability for first trust defense expenses and the million paid to white construction,money that otherwise would have gone to first trust noteholders.the bankruptcy court denied first american title motion,granted first trust motion,and awarded first trust over million first american title appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment in all respects.first american title now appeals to this court 
ii.analysis 
the bankruptcy court granted first trust motion for summary judgment and denied first american title.we review the decision de novo.see williams int l of workers,local in re williams,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.applying rule to adversary bankruptcy proceedings.
first american title offers several different theories according to which we might reverse the judgments below.it argues that coverage is barred by exclusion a of the policy because first trust created white construction lien by mismanaging disbursements from the escrow accounts,and it additionally claims that first trust never gave proper notice of white construction claims.for its part,first trust denies those contentions.most of the parties energies,however,are devoted to the language of the title insurance policy,and we find that we can decide the case on that basis.
under mississippi law,which the parties agree applies to this contract,the plain terms of an insurance policy are enforced as written.see lewis allstate ins,so d.if,however,the terms are ambiguous,then doubts are resolved against the drafter and in favor of coverage.see j w foods state farm mut.auto.ins,so d,a policy is ambiguous if it can be interpreted to have two or more reasonable meanings.id.here,we believe that the title insurance policy is unambiguous on the question whether first trust interests in the casino vessel being constructed in gulfport are covered.
first trust asserted basis for coverage is the policy seventh insuring clause.that portion of the policy states that 
first american title insurance company insures against loss or damage incurred by reason of 
lack of priority of the lien of the insured mortgage over any statutory lien for services,labor or material arising from an improvement or work related to the land.
emphasis added.
one point of contention in this case is whether white construction lien arose from an improvement or work related to the land.according to the policy,the land means the land described or referred to in schedule a,and improvements affixed thereto which by law constitute real property but does not include property beyond the bounds of the area described in schedule first trust contends that construction of the casino boat,which was to be moored next to the land in biloxi indefinitely,is related to the land,while first american title,emphasizing that the unfinished boat never left gulfport and allegedly was not intended to be a fixture,argues that it is not related to the land.that is,the parties dispute whether white construction lien is the type of risk that is covered under insuring clause.but coverage would also be unavailable under the policy if the interest said to be,first trust security interest in the biloxi belle not within the term insured mortgage.we find this latter inquiry to be determinative of the case.
the insured mortgage for purposes of this particular policy is specified by reference to schedule a,the customized schedule that sets forth matters such as the amount of the policy,the effective date,and so forth.for present purposes,the crucial part of schedule a is item,which states 
the instruments creating the estate or the interest in real estate which is hereby insured are described as follows 
see attached rider 
when one turns to the attached rider,one finds first a reference to the leasehold deed of trust executed between bci and bcbi and later assigned to first trust.as described earlier,in the first version of this rider,but not in the later version,there are also references to several financing statements and other documents.the financing statements describe first trust security interest in various items of bcbi property,including the biloxi belle ii,and they also attach descriptions of the biloxi parcels.
the parties sharply disagree over whether the later version of the policy is the legally effective version or is instead a failed attempt to amend the earlier,legally binding policy.if the first version of the version that includes the references to the ucc financing the binding version of the insurance policy,then says first trust there can be no doubt but that first trust interest in the casino boat is insured under the policy.first trust also argues,however,that its security interest in the casino boat is covered even without the ucc financing statements in so arguing,first trust relies on the fact that the leasehold deed of trust gives it a security interest in the casino boat along with much other bcbi property as well as in the land.first american title argues that first trust security interest in the casino is not an interest in not covered under either version of the policy.
we hold that the title insurance policy does not cover first trust security interest in the casino boat being constructed in gulfport.even if wheeler did not successfully change the rider to remove the references to the ucc financing statements,first trust security interest in the boat and all of the other personalty described in the financing statements can not be the insured mortgage that the title insurance policy protects.tellingly,item on schedule a specifies the insured mortgage by referring to t he instruments creating the estate or the interest in real estate which is hereby insured.this language poses two serious problems for first trust attempt to use the to bring the boat within the policy.
first,the language refers to the estate or the interest in real estate.the biloxi belle ii,under construction on a barge in gulfport,was not real estate it is conceivable,we suppose,that the qualifier in real estate could be read to apply only to interest but not estate,so that item would insure instruments creating an interest in real estate but an estate in any type of property.but by far the more natural reading is that in real estate modifies both estate and interest.the language thus embraces fee estates,leasehold estates,security interests,and so on,as long as those property interests are in real estate.this reading is powerfully confirmed,moreover,when one considers other portions of the policy,which
