this case raises a question of state law that has yet to be addressed by the new york court of appeals and that has led to divergent opinions in the federal district courts.when an injured party begins its suit against an insured by serving process on the secretary of state,who,under new york corporate and limited liability company law,is the insured agent for such service,does this service suffice to trigger the provisions in the relevant insurance policy that require the insured to inform its insurer in a timely manner that a suit has been brought,where a the insurance policy does not expressly refer to notice that a suit has been brought being given to an insured representative rather than the insured itself,and b the insured plausibly argues to its failure to update its address with the secretary of had not received actual notice that the suit had been brought because we believe that the new york court of appeals should be given the opportunity to decide whether it wishes to address this technical but recurring question of new york state law,we certify the question to the new york court of appeals.
background 
briggs avenue llc briggs or appellant filed an action in new york state supreme court seeking a declaratory judgment that its insurer,insurance corporation of hannover ich or appellee,be required to defend and indemnify briggs in a personal injury lawsuit filed by one of briggs tenants against briggs.ich removed the suit,pursuant to,to federal district court in the southern district of new york 
at the district court,ich moved for judgment on the pleadings summary judgment on the ground that briggs failed to comply with various notice requirements contained in its insurance policy.briggs for summary judgment.the district court granted ich motion,denied briggs,and dismissed the case with prejudice.briggs ins.of hannover,civ,wl may.briggs appeals that decision.
a.the underlying tort lawsuit 
briggs owns and operates an apartment house at briggs avenue in the bronx.on or about may,shaban mehaj,the sole principal of briggs,was informed of an incident at this apartment house.a portion of the ceiling in one of the apartments had fallen.mehaj visited the apartment shortly thereafter,and asserts in his affidavit that he was not informed that anyone in the apartment had been injured in the incident and had no reason to suspect so.mehaj did not notify briggs insurer,ich,because,at this point,he assertedly had no knowledge or notice that anyone had been injured.
later,on or about july,nelson bonilla,an adult son of one of the tenants at briggs avenue,filed a personal injury action against briggs,alleging that on may,he was injured when a piece of the ceiling fell and struck him,and that the accident was caused by briggs negligence in maintaining the premises.the lawsuit sought million in damages.a week or so earlier,bonilla had served his personal injury complaint on the secretary of state of new york,who under new york law functions as briggs agent for service.liab.e.the secretary of state forwarded copies of the complaint to the address for briggs then on file at the secretary office.that address was,however,incorrect as briggs had failed to advise the secretary of state of its new mailing address.briggs asserts that,because of the wrong address,it did not receive word of bonilla suit.
in state court,bonilla moved for default judgment against briggs and,in late march or early april,directly served briggs at its correct address.briggs received the notice and within days informed its insurance broker of the lawsuit.shortly thereafter,ich received,through the insurance broker,an accord general liability notice of form,dated april.
b.the briggs insurance policy and affirmative defenses claimed by ich 
briggs insurance policy,issued by ich,provided coverage for the period of september,to september,and thus was in place at the time of the ceiling incident.the policy included a section entitled commercial general liability conditions which articulated notice requirements that the insured needed to comply with,in the event of an occurrence,offense,claim or suit.the policy stated 
duties in the event of occurrence,offense,claim or suit 
a.you must see to it that we are notified as soon as practicable of an occurrence or an offense which may result in a claim 
b.if a claim is made or suit is brought against any insured,you must 
immediately record the specifics of the claim or suit and the date received and 
notify us as soon as practicable.you must see to it that we receive written notice of the claim or suit as soon as practicable.
c.you and any other involved insured must 
immediately send us copies of any demands,notices,summonses or legal papers received in connection with the claim or suit 
ich,after receiving the notification of bonilla lawsuit,replied to briggs in a disclaimer letter dated april,claiming affirmative defenses and indemnity due to briggs failure to comply with the policy notification conditions.the relevant portion of the letter explains that despite the service on the secretary of state in july of,briggs ave llc first notified insurance corporation of hannover of the occurrence,claim or suit and first provided copies of the summons and legal papers by cover letter dated april.
in summary,ich argues that briggs is not entitled to insurance coverage because briggs failed to inform ich of the ceiling incident or the bonilla lawsuit until eleven months after the incident,and eight months after the filing of the lawsuit,thus violating the conditions in the insurance policy requiring notice to ich as soon as practicable of an occurrence or an offense which may result in a claim,notice to ich as soon as practicable of a lawsuit filed against briggs,and that briggs i mmediately send to ich any papers received in connection with a lawsuit.in response,briggs argues that ich has waived certain of these arguments by failing to mention them specifically in its april,letter disclaiming coverage,and further contends that none of the relevant conditions was violated by briggs.
the district court,in addressing the for summary judgment,found that there were outstanding issues of fact regarding whether or not briggs violated its duty to inform ich of the falling of the ceiling in may.it noted,however,that ich could nonetheless prevail on summary judgment if it were able to demonstrate that,as a matter of law,briggs violated its duty to notify ich as soon as practicable of the bonilla lawsuit.this ich did to the district court satisfaction,by citing a short one paragraph,but clear,decision of the new york appellate division for the first department.warren aetna cas.sur.other federal district courts,facing similar factual circumstances,have chosen to distinguish warren and have come out the opposite way.see,llc greenwich ins,d,nouveau elevator,cont l cas.ins,civ,wl,at.for the reasons that follow,we believe that the new york court of appeals should be given the it address the appellate division decision and the underlying issues of public policy that opinion raises.
