michelle wilson wilson appeals from a summary judgment entered on march,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york young,sitting by designation,in favor of northwestern mutual life insurance company northwestern on wilson claim that she is the beneficiary of two life insurance policies issued to her late husband,kenneth wilson kenneth,by northwestern.the district court determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to kenneth termination of one life insurance policy,the whole life policy,on february,and failure to pay any premiums after that date.the court further determined that kenneth also terminated the other life insurance policy,the term life policy,as of february,when,on may,several weeks before his death on june,he directed northwestern to refund his last payment and let the policy lapse.
background 
a.the insurance policies issuance,payments and terminations 
on may,northwestern issued two life insurance policies to kenneth a whole life policy whole life policy with a face amount of and a term life policy term life policy with a face amount of.at that time,kenneth was years old,a husband and father of two,and had been a bank officer at jp morgan for the past eleven years.
at kenneth request,northwestern set up an insurance service account isa whereby the premiums on the two policies would be paid on a monthly basis and funded through electronic fund transfers eft from kenneth bank account.each of the policies contained the following grace period provision 
grace period.a grace period of days will be allowed to pay a premium that is not paid on its due date.the policy will be in full force during this period.if the insured dies during the grace period,any overdue premium will be paid from the proceeds of the policy.
if the premium is not paid within the grace period,the policy will terminate as of the due date unless it continues as extended term or insurance under sections or.
each policy further provided for reinstatement more than days after the end of the grace period upon submission of evidence of insurability and payment with interest of unpaid premiums.the reinstatement option would be open to the policyholder for five and three years after termination of the whole life and term life policies,respectively.
kenneth did not always pay on time.on three different occasions between august and early,kenneth eft payments to the isa were rejected by the bank for insufficient funds,resulting in the closing of the isa each time.following each of the first two closings that took place on september,and january,kenneth made subsequent eft payments to reopen the isa and satisfy his premiums.following the third missed payment and the resulting isa closing on march,the isa was reopened once again on april,with an eft payment of.since that amount was insufficient to satisfy kenneth premium obligations beyond february,the isa was closed yet again on april.
on april,instead of paying the delinquent payments as he had done in the past,kenneth called northwestern and spoke with melissa nowak in the policyowner services department.kenneth asked to have his isa reopened for the term life policy only and to have the premium for that policy be paid through december.the premium for the whole life policy having been paid through february,and no premium payment having been made within the grace period,the whole life policy terminated on february.kenneth provided the necessary banking information so that a draft could be issued to cover the premiums for the term life policy.on april,the isa was reactivated for the term life policy only,and on april,kenneth made an eft payment of to his isa,which satisfied the premiums for march through december.as a result of this transaction,kenneth isa supposedly had a zero balance as of april.
on may,however,kenneth telephoned northwestern to inquire about a negative balance reported in his isa and spoke with diane knueppel knueppel,a senior customer service representative.from her,he learned that the negative balance resulted from a premium adjustment fee.according to knueppel,the fee could not be waived because kenneth term life policy was no longer a companion policy to the terminated whole life policy.knueppel notes from her conversation with kenneth,contemporaneously created that day in northwestern casetracker system,revealed that she s poke with client i nformed him that the is a policy fee that is no longer waived and that c lient is now asking to be refund ed his last payment and let the policy lapse.after knueppel consulted daniel stein,kenneth northwestern field representative,knueppel telephoned kenneth and stated that she was working on refunding the last draft that was done on the isa.the record does not reveal any response from kenneth.in her affidavit in support of northwestern motion for summary judgment,knueppel noted that t he last draft for the term life policy was received on april,and was in the amount of.
based on her conversation with kenneth,knueppel credited the premium payments for may through december.knueppel also closed the isa,effective may.northwestern then sent kenneth notice that his term policy was paid to may,and that the grace period would expire june.knueppel claims that,on may,she asked joyce barrack,northwestern senior analyst for authorization to credit the payments made by kenneth for the months of march,april,and may.authorization was given,and on may,northwestern sent two refund checks to kenneth for the months of june,july,august,september,october,november,and december,and for the months of march,april,and may.although the refunds purportedly resulted in the term life policy being paid only through february with a grace period days later,northwestern never rescinded the letter dated may,which,as noted above,stated that kenneth term life policy was paid to may,and that the grace period would expire on june.
kenneth died on june.after kenneth death,wilson,kenneth wife,received the first refund check for,dated may.wilson never received the second refund check.however,northwestern issuance of the second refund check in the amount of,payable to kenneth,is recorded in its check registry.northwestern records show that the check for was never deposited or returned.in june,wilson submitted a claim for payment on both the whole life and term life policies.on july,northwestern denied wilson claims on the ground that both policies were terminated as of february.
proceedings in the district court 
on march,wilson commenced an action in the new york state supreme court,claiming breach of contract,deceptive and misleading practices,negligence,and violation of general obligation and state insurance laws.wilson nw.mut.ins,d.wilson sought compensatory damages in the amount of plus interest,as well as costs and attorneys fees.id.on april,northwestern removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,pursuant to.id.
on january,northwestern moved for summary judgment,and on february,wilson for summary judgment.id.in a memorandum and order dated march,the district court granted northwestern motion for summary judgment,denied wilson for summary judgment,and dismissed wilson complaint.id.at.
the district court found that kenneth whole life policy terminated on february,in that kenneth instructed northwestern not to include the whole life policy when his isa reopened in april kenneth had only paid premiums for the policy through february,kenneth did not make any payments on the whole life policy after february,or during the grace period and northwestern was not required to notify kenneth of the cancellation of his whole life policy in writing,pursuant to insurance law.id.at.
the district court also found that kenneth term life policy terminated on february,because the oral agreement between kenneth and knueppel,cancelling the term life policy,was not required to be in writing under general obligations law,and insurance law because it was not a modification of the contract kenneth request for refund of the last premium payment could only be interpreted by a reasonable jury as a request for refund of the entire premium payment made on april,which included payments retroactive to february the new york dead man statute,did not preclude the testimony of knueppel the failure of kenneth or wilson to cash the second refund check for did not operate as a revocation of northwestern offer to terminate the term life policy as of february instead of may and northwestern notice that kenneth grace period for the term life policy would end on june,was an automated response and could not be construed as a new offer given kenneth request to refund his premium payments back to february.id.at.
the court also found that there was no evidence that northwestern misled or deceived kenneth.id.at.accordingly,the district court granted northwestern motion for summary judgment,denied wilson for summary judgment,and dismissed wilson complaint.id.at.judgment was entered on march,and wilson timely appealed to this court.
arguments on appeal 
on appeal,wilson argues that northwestern violated new york law when it failed to provide written notice for the cancellation of the policy and that the cancellation of the whole life policy therefore was not effective northwestern bad faith in cancelling the term life policy retroactively constituted a deceptive business practice under new york law and that kenneth cancellation of the term life policy was not effective because a northwestern demand for an additional constituted a modification of the term life policy,and therefore this increase required the retroactive cancellation of the modified policy to be in writing under new york law b any changes in the term life policy,including a cancellation,constitute a modification required to be in writing under new york law c there is a question of fact as to whether kenneth request for refund of his last payment and to let the policy lapse meant a refund of the payments back to february or whether kenneth intended only to cancel the premium payments going forward from may and d northwestern had a duty to correct the ambiguity caused by service of its may,notice advising kenneth that his grace period would end on june.wilson does not challenge the district court ruling as to the applicability of the dead man statute,and we do not consider it here.
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.trans sport,starter sportswear,cir.summary judgment may not be granted unless the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see adirondack transit lines,united transp.union,local,cir.the role of the court in deciding a motion for summary judgment is not to resolve disputed issues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual issues to be tried,while resolving ambiguities and drawing reasonable inferences against the moving party.knight fire ins,cir.although factual determinations are reviewed in the light most favorable to the party,the district court interpretation of law is reviewed de novo.see mathirampuzha potter,cir.because state law supplies the rules in cases,new york law applies in this case.see rosenfeld basquiat,cir.
ii.applicable law 
termination of term life.the modification argument 
wilson argues that the reversal of kenneth payments and the imposition of an additional fee constituted a prohibited oral change to the express terms of the term life policy that was required to be in writing to be effective.wilson cites to general obligations law rule against oral modifications where contract expressly forbids such modifications,oblig.laww mckinney,and insurance law a such life policy or contract can not be modified,nor can any rights or requirements be waived,except in a writing signed by a person specified by the insurer in such policy or contract,ins.law a mckinney,and to the policy provision that states that a change in the policy is valid only if it is approved in writing by an officer of the company,to support her claim that notice had to be in writing for any change to the terms of the policy 
wilson argument is without merit because there were no modifications,oral or otherwise,of the written terms of the term life policy.wilson does not refer to anything in northwestern handling of kenneth cancellation request that violated the express terms of the term life policy.the record in this matter established that kenneth telephoned northwestern mutual on may,to question why there was a shortage in his isa,the account through which the term life policy premiums were paid was informed that he was required to pay the charge because he no longer had multiple northwestern policies and requested that the last payment he made for the term life policy be reversed and that he be refunded his last premium payment.northwestern contends that kenneth was requesting a refund of the last ten months of payments,which would mean that the policy was only paid up through february.the grace period therefore would expire on march,and,in accordance with the terms of the policy,the term life policy would have lapsed as of february.thus,there appears to be no modifi cation or change that would implicate the term life policy under insurance law a.see loper,general obligations law section,in referring to oral changes in executory contracts,ha s been interpreted to relate to actual changes of terms as opposed to waivers of a condition that has the sole effect of keeping the contract viable to the mutual benefit of both parties.emphasis added citing jiffy sew paar,chem.bank wasserman,young bohling.
wilson further argues that,because general obligations law precluded any modification of the policy,the method of termination was itself invalid.general obligations law,however,addresses those contracts containing provisions that the contract can not be changed orally can not be terminated orally.oblig.laww mckinney.in this regard,kenneth term life policy contains only the following provision 
entire contract changes 
this policy with the attached application is the entire contract.statements in the application are representations and not warranties.a change in the policy is valid only if it is approved by an officer of the company.the company may require that the policy be sent to it for endorsement to show a change.no agent has the authority to change the policy or to waive any of its terms.
the policy does not contain a provision forbidding oral termination by either party,and wilson fails to identify any action by northwestern which would constitute a change in the policy.although wilson alleges that northwestern act of orally backdating dates and discontinuing insurance policies is both against public policy and a violation of the general obligations law,appellant br.at,there is no legal basis for this claim.she does not cite any public policy that has been violated,and there can be no violation of the general obligations law found in northwestern mutual action since the term life policy states that i f the premium is not paid within the grace period,the policy will terminate as of the due date.since there was no deviation from the written terms of the term life policy,there are no grounds for alleging violation of the general obligations law in regard to the method of termination.see loper,at.
the cases cited by wilson do not support her position.for example,the dispute in jaffe paramount communications,centered on a termination clause in an employment agreement.this provision expressly required that the employment agreement may only be terminated by written notice.id.at.the employee argued that he could waive that requirement.id.at.the first department dismissed this argument,relying upon general obligations law,which expressly provides that if a written agreement contains a provision for termination or discharge on written notice,this requirement can not be waived.id.in bank of kranis,the second department reaffirmed the principle that a continuing guarantee with a clause is not amenable to oral termination.id.at.these cases have no bearing on this matter,where there was no change or modification to any provision of the pol
