background 
factual history 
in,when kelly was three years old,she was placed in foster care with lester and nancy pope.one year later,lester began sexually molesting kelly.lester and nancy adopted kelly in,and the sexual abuse continued until,when kelly was thirteen years old.in,nancy discovered evidence of the abuse and questioned kelly.kelly told nancy that lester had been molesting her.nancy arranged a meeting with nancy psychologist,strnad,and his business partner,joel ray ray,to discuss the accusation.during this meeting,nancy disclosed to strnad her belief lester was sexually abusing kelly.nancy asked strnad not to report lester sexual abuse to anyone,and strnad agreed.strnad also agreed to begin counseling lester.
after the meeting,nancy confronted lester about the abuse.lester admitted he had sexually abused kelly and agreed to counseling with strnad.lester attended counseling with strnad and again confessed he had sexually abused kelly.lester quit therapy after four more sessions and the abuse of kelly continued.neither ray nor strnad notified officials about the abuse,even though both doctors were obligated by law to report suspected child abuse to the missouri division of family services.see.both doctors also failed to warn anyone in a position to protect kelly that lester had stopped attending therapy or that lester continued to threaten kelly safety.
during this time,ray and strnad were insured by american home under a professional liability insurance policy for psychologists.the insurance contract stated american home would pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of any wrongful act committed in the course of the doctors professional services,as well as the cost of defending a suit for such a wrongful act.the policy defined a w rongful act as any actual or alleged negligent act,error,or omission,or any actual or alleged defamation.the insurance contract also contained several exclusions from coverage.one exclusion denied coverage for liabilities resulting from any wrongful act committed with knowledge that it was a wrongful act.another exclusion denied coverage for criminal acts.
in april,nancy and lester divorced.nancy never disclosed lester sexual abuse of kelly during the divorce proceedings,and lester continued to sexually abuse kelly.during the summer of,kelly told nancy that lester had performed a sex act on her.nancy did not seek any help for the abuse until december.at that time,nancy took kelly to see lynn ogden ogden,a social worker employed in the same office as ray and strnad.nancy sought help with kelly emotional issues stemming from the abuse.when ogden learned of the abuse,she promptly reported the abuse to the missouri division of family services as required by missouri law.health officials determined kelly had been physically and psychologically traumatized as a result of lester molestation over a period of ten years.kelly was removed from the home,and lester was charged with three counts of sodomy and one count of attempted rape.lester pled guilty to one count of sodomy and served five years in prison.strnad avoided prosecution for failing to report the abuse by testifying at lester sentencing hearing in exchange for a grant of immunity.
procedural history 
in,norma bradley bradley filed a lawsuit in missouri state court on behalf of kelly,a minor child.the complaint alleged,among other claims,ray and strnad were negligent per se in violating the missouri mandatory reporting statute,and ray and strnad breached a common law duty to warn of lester continued danger to kelly safety.the missouri state trial court dismissed the claims.
the missouri court of appeals upheld the trial court dismissal of the negligence per se claim,but reversed the trial court dismissal of the common law failure to warn claim.see bradley ray.in so holding,the court of appeals recognized a common law duty to warn on the part of treating psychologists,in accord with the vast majority of other jurisdictions.see id.at.the missouri court explained,
when a psychologist or other health care professional knows or pursuant to the standards of his profession should have known that a patient presents a serious danger of further violence to a readily identifiable victim,the psychologist has a duty under missouri common law to warn the intended victim or communicate the existence of such danger to those likely to warn the victim including notifying appropriate enforcement authorities.
id.the missouri court of appeals then remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether ray and strnad breached their common law duty to warn.id.for reasons unexplained by the parties,bradley failed to pursue the case on kelly behalf,and the trial court dismissed the case without prejudice in.in,kelly the case on her own behalf,and included a failure to warn claim against ray and an unnamed defendant ad litem for strnad,who was then deceased.strnad widow,donna strnad,was eventually appointed defendant ad litem.
when the suit was initially filed,american home provided a defense for both ray and donna strnad as defendant ad litem.on april,american home sent ray and donna strnad a letter in which american home agreed to defend and indemnify ray,but refused to defend further or indemnify strnad estate.the following day,american home filed suit against kelly and donna strnad in the united states district court for the western district of missouri,seeking a judgment declaring american home had no duty to defend or indemnify strnad estate because,among other reasons,strnad conduct was subject to policy exclusions.american home argued,because strnad violated missouri mandatory reporting statute and engaged in knowingly wrongful conduct,the policy exclusions for claims arising out of criminal conduct and knowingly wrongful acts should apply.
one week after american home filed the declaratory judgment action,kelly reached an agreement with donna strnad.the relevant terms of the agreement provided kelly would no longer seek damages against strnad estate,but would only pursue recovery from american home buckley would replace donna strnad as defendant ad litem kelly and buckley would submit the dispute to binding arbitration before a panel of retired missouri judges buckley would not object to any evidence kelly presented to the panel and the panel would only need to determine whether strnad was negligent and would not be required to provide a further basis for its ruling.
the case then proceeded in three separate actions kelly state court action against ray,kelly state arbitration proceeding against buckley as defendant ad litem for strnad,and american home federal declaratory judgment action against kelly and buckley.kelly state court action against ray was tried in september of.the sole issue in kelly suit against ray was whether ray was vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of his partner,strnad.the jury found for kelly and awarded million in damages against ray.
a few months later,in early,the case against strnad was submitted to arbitration.american home refused to defend strnad and did not take part in the arbitration.the parties submitted,and stipulated to,the record from ray trial as the evidentiary record in the arbitration proceeding.the arbitrators found for kelly and awarded million in damages.kelly submitted the arbitration award to the state trial court.in a single order,the state court entered judgment upon the jury verdict against ray and the arbitration award against strnad,and assessed prejudgment interest for a total award of more than million.
ray appealed the judgment against him,and the missouri court of appeals affirmed on the basis of liability,but reversed and remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of damages because the jury received an exhibit related to insurance coverage without a proper limiting instruction.see pope pope,en banc.upon remand,the trial court did not hold a new trial,but rather entered judgment against ray in the amount of million,plus prejudgment interest,based on the strnad arbitration award.ray appealed this judgment,and on september,the missouri court of appeals reversed and remanded with instructions to carry out the appellate court original mandate,which was to have a new trial on the issue of damages.
meanwhile,in the federal declaratory judgment action,the district court granted american home motion for summary judgment,finding strnad failure to report lester abuse amounted to a criminal act because it violated missouri child abuse reporting statute.the court concluded strnad conduct fell within the policy exclusion denying coverage for criminal acts,and therefore,strnad estate was not entitled to insurance coverage under the policy.this decision effectively eliminated kelly ability to collect on the judgment against strnad because kelly previously had agreed not to seek judgment from the strnad estate.
in american home i,at,a panel of this court reversed.we explained kelly complaint contained two separate allegations against strnad.first,kelly alleged that strnad violated missouri law by failing to report knowledge of lester abuse to authorities.id.at.we then noted,to the extent that kelly asserted a private cause of action arising out of strnad violation of the criminal statute,missouri has prohibited such an action.id.at citing doe a special sch,t he missouri child abuse reporting statute creates a duty owed to the general public,not to specific individuals,and consequently the statute does not support a private cause of action in favor of individuals.see also bradley,at.
kelly conceded the criminal act exclusion exempted kelly from coverage under the insurance policy on kelly first claim,but maintained the district court failed to consider kelly second claim,that strnad negligently failed to fulfill his common law duty to warn kelly,or someone else in a position to protect her,such as law enforcement,that lester had stopped attending therapy and was likely to continue abusing kelly.american home i,at.we agreed and held the district court erred in concluding the criminal act exclusion applied to all of kelly claims against strnad,because the failure to warn some person or entity other than the missouri division of family services was not a criminal act,but could amount to breach of the common law duty to warn.see id.at.we explained,
american home has not cited any missouri statute or case law making criminal the failure to warn the victim of the possibility of future abuse.since american home has failed to show how strnad failure to report the future dangerousness for abuse to kelly or her mother should fall within the exclusion,the coverage of the policy applies.
id.citing union fire ins.structural,cir declaring,under missouri law,the insurer has the burden of proving the applicability of any exclusion upon which it relies.
on remand,the district court granted summary judgment to kelly and buckley.see am.home assurance pope,wl,at,rev cir.the district court cited our broad statement in american home i that the coverage of the policy applies,and concluded american home had a duty both to defend and to indemnify strnad estate for damages arising from strnad negligent failure to warn kelly,or someone else in a position to protect kelly,about lester continued danger.id.at.
american home appealed,and the case came before this court for a second time.see american home ii,at.in our decision,we began our analysis with a clarification of the matters we did and did not decide in american home id.at.in american home i,we held kelly allegation of common law negligence precluded a finding of summary judgment in favor of american home and required american home to provide a defense to strnad.id.at.we did not resolve the separate issue of whether the common law failure to warn claim was valid for the purpose of the duty to indemnify,however,because no body had ever considered the question of whether that claim or other claims were causally linked to kelly alleged damages.id.
as a result,we again remanded to the district court for a factual determination of whether,and to what extent,strnad failure to warn kelly,her mother,or some person or entity other than the missouri division of family services caused kelly injuries.id.at.we then explained,
on remand,american home may also seek to prove that the knowingly wrongful policy exclusion applies to the claim for indemnification.as noted earlier,american home duty to defend was the only issue before this court in american home i,and the knowingly wrongful exclusion did not apply in that context because kelly alleged only negligence and her allegations,on their face,were not subject to the exclusion.those allegations,however,are relevant only to the duty to defend determination of a duty to indemnify must await the facts.
id.quoting superior equip.cas.in concluding our opinion,we asked the district court to consider whether the knowingly wrongful act exclusion applied,and if not,whether strnad failure to warn gave rise to kelly damages.id.at.
on remand the district court granted summary judgment to american home.the district court found,strnad knew of his duty to report the sexual abuse to authorities and warn others of lester ongoing threat to kelly,yet strnad intentionally concealed the abuse.the district court held strnad conduct was knowingly wrongful within the language of the policy exclusion,and therefore,american home did not have a duty to indemnify strnad.kelly now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of american home.
ii.discussion 
knowingly wrongful act exclusion 
kelly contests the district court finding that strnad conduct was knowingly wrongful within the language of the insurance policy because the policy exclusion is ambiguous,we follow missouri law and reverse.
the interpretation of a contract,including determining whether it is ambiguous as written,is a question of law which we review de novo.united states brekke,cir citations omitted.in a diversity action,such as this,we use state substantive law to govern our analysis.see erie tompkins.thus,missouri law controls our decision.
where insurance policies are unambiguous,the rules of construction are inapplicable,and absent a public policy to the contrary,the policy will be enforced as written.krombach mayflower ins,en banc citations omitted.language is ambiguous when there is uncertainty in the meaning of words used in the contract,or when the contract terms are reasonably subject to different interpretations.id.missouri courts follow a construction favorable to the insured wherever the language of a policy is susceptible of two meanings,one favorable to the insured,the other to the insurer.meyer jewelry ge.ins.of,citations omitted.provisions restricting coverage are particularly construed most strongly against the insurer.see also krombach,at ambiguous provisions of a policy designed to cut down,restrict,or limit insurance coverage already granted,or introducing exceptions or exemptions must be strictly construed against the insurer.citations omitted.these rules of construction exist because insurance is designed to furnish protection to the insured,not defeat it,and as the drafter of the insurance policy,the insurance company is in the better position to remove ambiguity from the contract.krombach,at.
two contract provisions are at issue in this cas
