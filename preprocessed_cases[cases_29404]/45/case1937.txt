statute of limitations 
the district court held that subrogation is an equitable cause of action,and is therefore subject to a statute of limitations.see civ.providing that a statute of limitations applies to actions upon a contract,obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument in writing.because,as granite concedes,a direct action by cws against granite would have been subject to a statute of limitations,wausau contends that the district court ruling contravenes the established rule that a subrogation suit is purely derivative of the subrogor underlying cause of action.
the principle that the right of subrogation is derivative of the subrogor cause of action is firmly ensconced in california law.see,united states california,d the subrogee stands in the place of one whose claim he has paid.internal quotation and citation omitted brown rouse,cal,a subrogee is put in all respects in the place of the party to whose right he is subrogated.fireman fund ins.maryland cas,th,d the insurer stand s in the shoes of the insured quotation omitted.
because of the derivative nature of subrogation,a subrogee insurer is subject to the same statute of limitations that would have been applicable had the insured brought suit in his or her own behalf.great am,safeco,d.quoting windt,insurance claims and disputes,at.ed.see also redington cornwell,cal,auto.ins.union oil,d.in auto,the california court of appeal articulated the policy basis for applying the subrogee statute of limitations to the subrogor 
upon principles of reason as well as natural justice,it seems only fair,right,just,and equitable that one who is subrogated to the rights and remedies of another should be allowed the same time in which to enforce such rights as the law would have allowed to the person to whose rights and remedies he succeeds.
despite the established principle that a subrogation action is purely derivative of the subrogor underlying cause of action,the district court held that wausau was not entitled to the same statute of limitations that would have been applicable if cws had brought suit against granite on its own behalf.instead,the district court adopted granite theory that because the doctrine of subrogation has its roots in equity,rather than in contract,california code of civil procedure limits the statute of limitations to two years.see cal.code civ.pertaining to actions upon a contract,obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing.
in its decision adopting granite view,the district court relied heavily on the conclusion that century indem.superior,th,d holding applicable in an action between more accurately represents california law than does liberty mut.ins.colonial ins,d.holding inapplicable in an action between.this focus is misplaced.both liberty and century involve contribution between as opposed to a subrogation action involving a primary insurer and excess insurer.
there is a critical distinction between the right of contribution and that of subrogation.the right of equitable contribution belongs to each insurer individually.it is not based on any right of subrogation to the rights of the insured,and is not equivalent to standing in the shoes of the insured.fireman fund ins.maryland cas,th,d citation and quotation omitted emphasis added.unlike subrogation,the right of equitable contribution exists independently of the rights of the insured.id.
for these reasons,century is inapposite.instead,the instant case is governed by the line of cases holding that the statute of limitations in a subrogation action is that which would have been applicable had the insured brought suit on its own behalf.a direct action by cws against granite would have been subject to a statute of limitations.accordingly,wausau should be afforded a period in which to enforce cws rights against granite.because the parties do not dispute that wausau brought suit within four years of when the cause of action arose,we reverse the district court decision to dismiss wausau action as 
wausau policy limits 
granite the district court interpretation of the wausau insurance policy,which limited wausau total liability to million,thus exposing granite policy to its million annual limit.the district court held that the individual limits of wausau five policies could not be stacked to create coverage greater than one annual per occurrence limit.granite disputes this interpretation of the wausau policy,contending that because the occurrence giving rise to the cws settlement took place over a period,during which five separate policies with million annual limits were in effect,wausau policies provided a total of million in coverage.
wausau and granite do not dispute that the
