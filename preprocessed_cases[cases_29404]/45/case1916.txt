appellant wall associates wall appeals the district court grant of assurance company of america assurance motion for summary judgment and the denial of wall for summary judgment.in this contract interpretation case,the district court concluded that the policy language for collapse coverage required a sudden falling down,which,the court found,wall did not demonstrate.as there was no collapse and thus no coverage,the district court also deemed all of the collateral issues moot or irrelevant.
the district court erred in interpreting the term collapse in isolation the collapse provision contains additional language indicating an intent to extend broader coverage.we hold,therefore,that the collapse provision here provides coverage not only for actual collapse but also for imminent collapse.in light of our decision,the case must be remanded for the district court to consider the remaining issues raised in the parties motions for summary judgment.
background 
wall owns the percival plaza,which consists of two buildings built respectively in and.the buildings structures consist of steel columns and steel beams with joists.attached to the steel frames are wooden exterior wall framing studs covered by gypsum sheathing.the buildings exterior siding is a polystyrene foam wall system called external insulation finishing system eifs,which is attached to the gypsum sheathing,and a decorative brick facade is attached to the outer layer of the eifs by use of an adhesive.the use of eifs was a relatively new construction method at the time the percival plaza was built.
soon after construction was completed,wall began experiencing problems with leaking water in the building.the leaks primarily involved certain windows on the southwest side of the building in the first couple of years the worst leaking occurred on the second floor,and then leaks began surfacing on the third floor sometime in.wall took some steps to correct the problem,including at certain places in the early and applying elastomeric paint in.nick adams,wall property manager,testified at his deposition that by the leaks seemed restricted to one tenant space and that,after the application of the elastomeric paint in and a couple winters in and,w e thought we had beaten the problem.
leaks reappeared,however,in the spring of,and wall retained an architect and a construction repair specialist to investigate further the water leakage problems at the percival plaza.extensive testing revealed that the buildings had decayed and deteriorated as a result of the water intrusion.the gypsum sheathing had turned to mush,leaving only the paper facing intact,which provided the sole support for the eifs.the september,report also concluded that the state of the eifs created a serious risk to passersby as the eifs was in danger of completely falling off the building.the report recommended removing and replacing the eifs cladding and brick panel facades on the west and south sides of the building.the architect testified,however,that there was really no way to tell when,if ever,the eifs would fall.upon commencement of the repairs and scoring of the walls,wall discovered the extent of the damage to the buildings exterior.with the slightest touch,the brick facades simply fell off the building indeed,wall partner don carlson testified,you could just finger them off.
the assurance policy at issue began on march.wall submitted a notice of loss to assurance in june.several months after the remedial work was completed,wall submitted its first sworn statement in proof of loss to assurance.wall sought coverage for collapse loss and described the cause of the damage as deterioration of gypsum forming substrate of exterior wall system,creating high risk of failure of structural support for brick facing.wall claimed on this form that it discovered the damage on april,and stated the amount of its loss was.in march,wall submitted an amended claim in the amount of.assurance denied wall claim on the basis that there had been no covered collapse.
the assurance policy provided both property and liability coverage.the policy stated that it provided coverage for r isks of direct physical loss or damage unless the loss or damage is excluded or limited as described under the heading,exclusions,the policy said,we will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by j collapse.but,the policy immediately continued,
if collapse results in a covered cause of loss at the described premises,we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that covered cause of loss.
we will pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from risks of direct physical loss involving collapse of a building or any part of a building caused only by one or more of the following 
a the specified causes of loss 
b hidden decay 
the policy defined specified causes of loss to include water damage,meaning accidental discharge or leakage of water as the direct result of the breaking or cracking of any part of a system or appliance containing water the policy also specified that collapse does not include settling,cracking,shrinkage,bulging or expansion.
following the denial of wall claim,assurance filed the instant declaratory judgment action in the western district of washington,seeking clarification of a number of issues,including whether wall is entitled to coverage under the exception to the collapse exclusion,and if so,whether coverage is nonetheless precluded by the known loss doctrine whether the covered loss occurred during the coverage period whether wall filed its proof of loss within the specified limitations period and whether any other policy exclusions foreclose wall claim.after both parties filed motions for summary judgment,the district court granted assurance motion,holding that,in the context of the policy at issue,collapse was an unambiguous term which meant a sudden falling down and because t here was no sudden falling down of the wall or of the eifs of the percival plaza building,the court concluded,there was no coverage for collapse.given that conclusion,the court deemed the other issues moot or irrelevant.
