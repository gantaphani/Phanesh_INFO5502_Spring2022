appellants simon marketing,and simon worldwide,collectively simon brought this action against respondents federal insurance company federal and gulf insurance company gulf on insurance policies providing coverage for losses to property caused by theft or forgery committed by simon employees.gulf and federal moved for summary judgment on the ground that the policies did not cover the losses that simon claimed to have incurred.the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment.we affirm.
the underlying facts

the gulf and federal policies 
gulf issued a policy to simon that provided that gulf will pay for loss of,and loss from damage to,covered property resulting directly from the covered cause of loss,up to and with a deductible.covered property is defined under the policy as m oney,securities,and property other than money and securities.covered cause of loss is defined as employee dishonesty.in turn,employee dishonesty is defined as dishonest acts committed by an employee that c ause you to sustain loss and also obtain financial benefit other than salaries,commissions,fees,bonuses,promotions,awards,profit sharing,pensions,or employee benefits earned in the normal course of employment for a the employee or b any person or organization intended by the employee to receive that benefit.
the gulf policy specifically excludes the insured inability to realize income that you would have realized had there been no loss of,or loss from damage to,covered property,as well as p ayment of damages of any type for which you are legally liable.
federal issued a policy to simon that is substantially the same as that issued by gulf.the federal policy provides in relevant part that federal shall be liable for direct losses of money,securities or other property caused by theft or forgery by any employee of any insured.bolding in original.money and securities are defined along the same lines as in the gulf policy.theft is defined as the unlawful taking of money,securities or other property to the deprivation of the insured.
the federal policy contains a clause excluding loss of income that is the same as the corresponding clause in the gulf policy.in addition,the federal policy excludes fees,costs and expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending legal proceedings.the policy also excludes any loss the proof of which involves a profit and loss comparison.
litigation 
once jacobson machinations became known,litigation erupted that can be classified into four groups.
first,numerous consumer lawsuits were consolidated in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,which the parties refer to as the boland litigation,and into a single california action.mcdonald entered into a settlement of the boland litigation in april,the terms of which are not material to this appeal.also in april,mcdonald and simon two error and omissions insurers entered into an agreement to fund the settlement the two insurers agreed to fund the settlement as long as it did not exceed the million combined policy limits of the two policies.simon paid nothing to fund the settlement.
second,after mcdonald terminated its contract with simon,litigation ensued between simon and mcdonald that was settled in july.under the settlement,mcdonald paid million to simon and assigned to simon its rights to insurance proceeds.simon collected million from the assignment for a total of million paid under the settlement with mcdonald.
third,in august stone street capital,the identity of which is not disclosed by the record,filed an action against simon,mcdonald and a coconspirator of jacobson in maryland state court.simon settled this case for and paid the settlement.
fourth,simon claims that it incurred expenses in defending a class action suit in canada.
simon statement of its damages in its discovery responses,simon concessions and the trial court ruling 
simon described its losses,damages in responses to gulf and federal interrogatories.these two responses differ somewhat,and we summarize them below.in addition,simon contended that it was legally liable for the game pieces that jacobson stole and that,for this reason,the theft of these pieces was a covered loss under the policy.we deal with the contention predicated on the game pieces themselves in another part of this opinion.see discussion,part,post.
a simon responses to federal interrogatories 
simon took the position that it lost its business as a result of jacobson fraud.thus,simon stated that its damages were the complete loss of its business,a sum in excess of million expenses of million in winding down simon payment of to settle the stone street lawsuit defense costs in excess of in the canada class action and the stone street action and over million in insurance proceeds that were paid in settlement of the class action,but that should have gone to simon.
b simon responses to gulf interrogatories 
simon stated that its damages arose because simon professional liability insurers paid in excess of million for replacement game prizes used in replacement games and additional sums for attorney fees incurred due to the thefts by jacobson.simon did not receive million from its own insurer,but allowed that sum to be paid to mcdonald.simon also claimed paid to settle the stone street litigation,and expended in defense costs in the canadian class action.on top of all that,jacobson thefts directly precipitated the complete loss of simon business,worth an estimated million,for which simon has received little compensation.
c simon concessions 
in its response to federal statement of undisputed material facts,simon stated unequivocally that simon is not seeking reimbursement for the value of the pieces of paper which were the winning game pieces.in another discovery response,simon appears to have admitted that it is not seeking the value of the game pieces,as opposed to the value of the pieces of paper.this squares with the deposition testimony of the person designated by simon as most knowledgeable,terrence wallock,who testified that simon was not seeking compensation for the value of the prizes stolen by jacobson the reason for this is that,while it is true that jacobson stole game pieces,once the putative winner presented the piece of paper,it was mcdonald who paid,and not simon.this is a fact that simon admits is undisputed.
d the trial court ruling 
the trial court found that the policies provided coverage for direct losses caused by employee theft and did not cover the insured vicarious liability for the tortious acts of its employee.the trial court relied on vons companies,federal ins.cir,a decision that held that employee dishonesty policies insure against the risk of property loss through employee dishonesty,and that such policies are not liability policies that discharge the insured duty to a third party.citing the litigation costs associated with the various lawsuits,the court found that these losses were not direct losses but rather instances when simon was held vicariously liable for third party losses caused by the tortious acts of its employee.
the trial court rejected the argument that simon held the game pieces that jacobson stole and that this was therefore a covered loss on the ground that simon failed to demonstrate the existence of a bailee or trustee relationship with any of the third party litigants.
e simon theory on appeal 
on appeal,simon contends that the undisputed f
