westrec marina management,westrec,appeals a judgment denying relief on its complaint against its liability insurer,arrowood indemnity company arrowood,after a nonjury trial.arrowood refused to provide a defense in an action against westrec on the ground that westrec had failed to timely report the claim as required under the terms of the two successive policies issued by arrowood.westrec contends it timely reported the claim and the trial court conclusion to the contrary was error.we hold that the court correctly decided that a letter from the third party claimant attorney to westrec was a claim within the meaning of the policies,that the later action filed by the third party claimant constituted the same claim,and that westrec failure to timely report the claim after receiving the letter rendered its later notice of claim untimely.we therefore affirm the judgment.

bette clark filed a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh on april,alleging employment discrimination by westrec and requesting a notice.the dfeh notified westrec of the complaint and stated that the complaint was closed immediately on april,because the complainant had requested an immediate notice.the dfeh issued a notice on april.westrec did not notify arrowood of these events within days after the expiration of the first policy.
clark attorney,william adams,sent a letter to westrec by facsimile on june.the letter began by stating that adams represented clark and that clark was subjected to constant discriminatory and demeaning treatment by male supervisors based upon her sex.the letter described alleged incidents of discrimination and wrongful termination.it stated further 
as you are no doubt aware,bette has received right to sue letters from the dfeh.i am writing to you to see if westrec would prefer to attempt to resolve or mediate this matter,or if it will be necessary to file a lawsuit and have a jury decide the outcome.it is often in an employer best interests to resolve discrimination claims promptly in order to avoid paying statutory attorney fees which must be awarded by the court should the employee prevail.those fees alone can exceed by the time of trial.before any litigation becomes necessary,however,i believe the company should first be permitted to do the right thing to promptly rectify the harm caused to bette in a confidential and discreet manner.if this matter were to be resolved in this manner,there is a second advantage to the can almost be assured that a prompt resolution will be far less expensive and less time consuming for the company and its executives.the letter concluded,i look forward to hearing back from you or your legal counsel.westrec did not notify arrowood of the letter within days after the expiration of the first policy.
clark filed a complaint against westrec on december,alleging several counts arising from employment discrimination and wrongful termination.westrec notified arrowood of the action on january,tendered its defense,and requested indemnity.arrowood declined to defend or indemnify its insured in a letter dated february.the letter stated that either the complaint to the dfeh or the adams letter,or both,constituted a claim as defined in the policy and that westrec failed to provide timely notice of the claim.
trial court proceedings 
westrec filed a complaint against arrowood and others in august.the first amended complaint filed in november alleges counts against arrowood for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.westrec moved for summary adjudication,seeking to establish a duty to defend.the court denied the motion.westrec dismissed its count for breach of the implied covenant before trial pursuant to a partial settlement.
the court conducted a nonjury trial on the count for breach of contract,and orally announced its ruling at the conclusion of trial.the court stated that the complaint to the dfeh was not a claim within the meaning of the policies,but that the adams letter was a claim because it was a demand for a monetary settlement.the court ordered westrec to prepare a judgment consistent with its ruling.the court entered a defense judgment on september.westrec timely appealed the judgment.
contentions 
westrec contends its notice of claim was timely because neither the complaint to the dfeh nor the adams letter was a claim within the meaning of the policies,and even if either of those items was a claim,the clark lawsuit was a separate claim for which westrec provided timely notice.

the adams letter stated that clark had been subjected to employment discrimination and wrongful termination and that she had received a notice from the dfeh.it stated that westrec might prefer to resolve or mediate this matter and to promptly rectify the harm rather than suffer the expense of litigation.obtaining a notice is a necessary predicate to the filing of an action under the california fair employment and housing act.romano rockwell,cal th,d.the adams letter clearly expressed clark intent to sue westrec for employment discrimination if an appropriate settlement could not be reached.
