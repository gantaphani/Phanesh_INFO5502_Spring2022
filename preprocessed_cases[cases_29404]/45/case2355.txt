plaintiff and appellant hung van ong plaintiff appeals from a stipulated judgment entered in favor of defendant and respondent fire insurance exchange defendant after the trial court granted defendant motion for summary adjudication of plaintiff claim for breach of contract plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in concluding that a vacancy exclusion in his policy for a loss from vandalism or malicious mischief applied to fire damage caused by a warming fire started by a transient that spread to other parts of the property.we agree and reverse.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff bought the insured property at issue from his brother,eugene ong eugene,in.the last tenants moved out in february.gas and electric utilities were turned off.on december,eugene submitted a claim to defendant on plaintiff behalf for a fire at the property earlier on december.defendant retained an experienced fire investigator,guy childress.on december,childress went to the property to investigate and made a written report concluding,it appears the fire may have been initiated as the result of an uncontrolled warming fire started by an unauthorized inhabitant.signs of possible habitation were present and the relatively isolated location would permit this.this sic presence of firewood in the adjacent room and the mattress next to the large hole in the floor also supports this theory.it is possible the holes burned in the floor by the door were the result of the occupant attempting to throw burning wood outside when the warming fire got out of control.
a claims log indicated that a claims adjuster for defendant,debra kryklund,met with childress and others on december,and noted the following kitchen.multiple pts of origin.bed in kitchen.unintentional incendiary.likely transient in house and warming fire got out of hand.firewood found inside house.
on february,kryklund sent plaintiff a letter disclaiming coverage for his claim.kryklund letter stated,our investigation indicates that this loss was the result of vandalism.a trespasser entered the vacant dwelling and intentionally set a fire on the kitchen floor.specifically,plaintiff policy with defendant stated,we do not cover direct or indirect loss from.vandalism or malicious mischief,breakage of glass and safety glazing materials if the dwelling has been vacant for more than consecutive days just before the loss.a dwelling under construction is not considered vacant.vandalism is not defined in the policy.
on march,plaintiff filed his complaint for breach of contract and insurance bad faith.on november,defendant filed a motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that the vacancy exclusion barred coverage for the loss under the policy coverage a dwelling section as plaintiff was seeking coverage for an intentionally set fire that destroyed a vacant dwelling.after opposition by plaintiff,the trial court on october,granted defendant motion for summary adjudication,stating that t he unauthorized person or persons who intentionally set the fire on the kitchen floor certainly created an obvious hazard to the dwelling without justification,excuse or mitigating circumstances,apparently relying on the definition of malice in law established in criminal cases on arson that had been cited by defendant.the trial court also held that the dwelling was vacant as contemplated in the fire insurance policy.
on march,the trial court entered a stipulated judgment.plaintiff appeals.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiff contends that the trial court erred because the fire was negligently lit and since the definition of vandalism requires an intent to destroy property it was not vandalism under the ordinary and popular sense of the term.plaintiff also argues that the trial court erred because the dwelling was inhabited by a transient and therefore not vacant,because the application of the vandalism exclusion to fire losses was not conspicuous and frustrated an insured reasonable expectations,because defendant was estopped from making its argument because it listed vandalism separately from fire in other parts of the policy,because the exclusion contravened insurance code section,and because an endorsement to the policy provided for coverage for loss by fire from an excluded cause.
