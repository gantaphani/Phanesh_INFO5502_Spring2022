appellant century surety company century appeals from the trial court sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend as to century second amended against crosby insurance,and brent jetton hereafter,collectively referred to as crosby for fraud,negligence,and negligent misrepresentation.we conclude that the second amended states a cause of action for fraud and negligence,and the trial court therefore abused its discretion in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend as to those causes of action.the second amended,however,omits an essential element of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation,and century has not shown that it could amend its complaint to remedy the deficiency.we therefore affirm the judgment with respect to that cause of action.
facts and procedural background 
in the underlying action the charlebois action,baroco west,ralph roach,rick bausher,and highpoint development and construction hereafter referred to collectively as baroco were named as defendants in a complaint filed on july,seeking damages for construction defects against baroco as the general contractor of a residence.baroco tendered its defense to century,and century,as baroco liability insurer,initially undertook the defense of the charlebois action under a reservation of rights.
after century determined that information in baroco insurance application concerning its loss history was false,century withdrew its defense,and baroco sued century and others not parties to this appeal.baroco complaint alleged claims of breach of written contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and included a request for declaratory relief against century.the complaint also alleged claims of negligence by an insurance agent and breach of fiduciary duty against crosby.
century filed its answer to baroco complaint and also filed a for declaratory relief,reimbursement of defense costs,and rescission against baroco.crosby filed a motion for summary judgment as to baroco complaint.the motion was unopposed it was granted on june,and judgment was thereafter entered.
century filed a against crosby.century first amended against crosby alleged that crosby was an insurance broker brent jetton was crosby agent and was the retail insurance broker for the policy that century sold to baroco although crosby knew that baroco was doing work as a general contractor,crosby submitted an application for insurance to century stating that baroco worked only as a drywall contractor in reliance on this representation,century underwrote,issued,and priced a policy and century had expended funds in connection with the investigation and defense of the charlebois action,and baroco was demanding that century provide it with a defense and indemnity in that action.
crosby filed a demurrer to the first amended,arguing that the claims for broker negligence misrepresentation and equitable indemnity were barred by res judicata the claims for fraud were barred by collateral estoppel the causes of action for equitable contribution and declaratory relief were defective and the fraud claim was inadequately pleaded.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
on november,century filed its second amended hereafter,referred to as the,adding new facts to supports its causes of action.the following material allegations appear in century 
in,crosby,an insurance broker,had prepared and submitted to century an application for liability insurance for baroco.the application for insurance classified baroco as a drywall contractor with potential subcontractor work limited to drywall contracting.based upon that application,century issued a policy insuring baroco.baroco tendered its defense in the charlebois action to century,and century provided baroco a defense under reservation of rights.after investigating the claim and determining that there was no potential for coverage under the policy for the claims asserted,century withdrew its defense of baroco in the charlebois action.
century attached to the the application for insurance that crosby submitted to century on behalf of baroco.the application states that baroco was previously insured by farmers insurance.century also attached to the a letter purporting to be from dan plesetz,agent for the farmers insurance group of companies that refers to the insurance policy number identified in the application and states that there have been no known losses for the two year period we have had the above referenced policy insured.century alleged that it had determined through its investigation that plesetz denied having written or prepared the letter or having any knowledge of the referenced policy number.century further alleged that brent jetton,who was an acquaintance of plesetz,had had access to plesetz office with no other person present,had obtained unauthorized samples of plesetz letterhead,and had used that letterhead to forge the letter purporting to be from plesetz.
crosby filed a demurrer to the,arguing that it did not owe century a duty in negligence,and that century could not maintain an action in fraud against crosby,but that century exclusive remedy was against its insureds.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and judgment of dismissal of the was entered.
discussion 
standard of review 
when we review a judgment of dismissal following the trial court sustaining of a demurrer,w e treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.blank kirwan cal d.
ii.cause of action for fraud and deceit 
century has adequately pleaded a cause of action for fraud and deceit 
the following elements must be pleaded to state a cause of action for fraud a misrepresentation of a material fact knowledge of falsity intent to deceive and induce reliance justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation and resulting damages.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.here,century second amended alleged that the plaintiffs actual insurance application was attached to the the application included a false written statement regarding the plaintiffs loss history and crosby had made the false written statement.thus,the alleged a misrepresentation of a material fact.
the alleged that crosby made the false written statement intentionally and with knowledge of its falsity.thus,the alleged the element of scienter.
the alleged that crosby made the false written statement with the intent to cause century to issue a policy of insurance to the plaintiffs.thus,the alleged the element of intent to deceive and to induce reliance.
the alleged that century had no reason to suspect the falsity of the statement,did not know the statement was false,and relied on the statement in issuing a policy of insurance to the plaintiffs.the further alleged that the plaintiffs prior loss history was a material element in century decision to issue the policy.thus,the alleged the element of reasonable reliance.
finally,the alleged that as a result of the misrepresentation,it incurred costs of investigation and defense of the charlebois action as well as the loss of a higher premium that it would otherwise have charged.thus,the alleged the element of damages.the therefore alleged all of the requisite elements of a cause of action for fraud.
california case law does not preclude an insurer cause of action against a broker for fraud and deceit arising out of an application for insurance 
crosby contends,however,that as a matter of law an insurance company may not maintain an action against a broker based on fraud and deceit arising out of an application for insurance.rather,crosby argues,only the insured is responsible for any misrepresentation in the application made by the broker.
crosby relies on a line of cases in which california courts held that an insured was responsible for the acts of the agent,including misrepresentations in an insurance application,when the issue was the insurer liability to the insured.in solomon federal ins.cal,solomon,the plaintiff hired an insurance broker to obtain insurance for a used automobile he had purchased for.the agent filled out an application for insurance,stating that the automobile was a model purchased for.relying on the application,federal insurance company federal issued an insurance policy to the plaintiff.after the plaintiff car was destroyed by fire,the plaintiff sought to recover under the insurance policy,but federal disclaimed liability on the ground that the destroyed car did not match the car described in the application.the trial court found for the plaintiff,but the supreme court held that the misrepresentations in the application entitled federal to rescind the policy.in response to the plaintiff argument that the misrepresentations had been made by the broker,not by the plaintiff,the court stated it is well settled that where,in circumstances such as are presented here,an insurance agent requests insurance from a company which he does not represent,he is acting for the insured,who is responsible for misrepresentations in the application made out by the broker.solomon,supra,cal.at,see also purcell pacific automobile ins.d,stating,in reaching a similar conclusion on similar facts,ordinarily one who procures another to obtain insurance for him thereby makes such person his agent and assumes full responsibility for his acts.
the common element of these cases is that they address the insurer liability to the insured when an insurance policy was issued in reliance on misrepresentations in the application made by the broker or agent.these cases do not address the insurer potential recovery from the broker when the insurer has incurred costs in defending an insured whose policy was later shown to have been obtained in reliance on the broker misrepresentations.the broker was not named as a defendant in solomon or purcell,and no issue was raised in those cases as to any potential liability of the broker to the insurer for the broker misrepresentations.thus,solomon and purcell do not create any rule that exempts insurance brokers from the consequences of their own fraud.
indeed,it would be an unreasonable,if not perverse,result if the law allowed an insurer no remedy against a broker who has,as is alleged in the,actively forged documents to support an insurance application.see,one who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk,is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers,all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,are against the policy of the law.
we observe that courts in other jurisdictions have imposed liability on an insurance broker in an insurer action to recover for losses incurred as a result of the broker fraud.midland ins.markel serv.cir,applying texas law holding that substantial evidence supported the jury finding that an insurance broker misrepresented the facts to the insurer concerning the limits of the insureds primary liability coverage,that such misrepresentations were material,and that the insurers reliance on the misrepresentations resulted directly in the loss to the insurer putnam resources pateman cir applying new york law holding that an insurer was required to establish a claim of intentional misrepresentation against an insurance broker by clear and convincing evidence westfield ins.yaste,zent rye agency holding that questions of material fact precluded summary judgment on an insurers claim against a broker for actual fraud.one source has stated the principles as follows s ince a broker that is not the insurer agent owes no fiduciary duty to the insurer,the broker is not liable for an alleged failure to reveal known facts.however,a broker will be held liable in tort to an insurer that issued a policy based on fraudulent material misinformation or the withholding of facts,where the broker knew,or reasonably should have known,that disclosure of the truth would have resulted in the insurer rejecting the application.d supp insurance.we find these authorities persuasive.california case law does not provide any basis for exempting an insurance broker from the consequences of its own fraud.
c.the insurance code does not relieve an insurance broker of liability to an insurer for the broker fraud in an insurance application 
crosby next argues that the insurance code charges the insured,not the broker,with the duty to disclose material information and with the responsibility for misrepresentations made to the insurer.crosby role in the transaction was alleged to be that of an insurance broker,not an agent.an insurance broker is defined by statute as a person who,for compensation and on behalf of another person,transacts insurance other than life insurance with,but not on behalf of,an insurer.put quite simply,insurance brokers,with no binding authority,are not agents of insurance companies,but are rather independent contractors,marsh mclennan of cal.city of los angeles d.
crosby cites a number of cases in support of the proposition that the insurance broker only duty is toward the insured.for example,in kurtz,richards,wilson insurance communicators marketing th,d,the court held that when an insurance agent intentionally misrepresents facts on an application for insurance presented on behalf of a client who is unaware of those misrepresentations,the agent breaches the duty of reasonable care owed to the client.the court was not called upon,however,in kurtz or in the other cases crosby has cited,to determine the liability of a broker to the insurer when the broker intentionally misrepresents facts in an application for insurance.thus,those cases do not stand for the proposition that an insurer has no remedy against an insurance broker for intentional misrepresentations.again,we conclude that california case law does not provide any basis for exempting an insurance broker from the consequences of its own fraud.
d.the insurance code does not establish an exclusive remedy of rescission for a broker fraud in an insurance application 
crosby argues that the exclusive remedy available to century is that of rescission of the policy under insurance code sections and in addition,an intentional and fraudulent omission,on the part of one insured,to communicate information of matters proving or tending to prove the falsity of a warranty,entitles the insurer to rescind.
california courts have made clear that the right of rescission established in the insurance code is not an insurer exclusive remedy against an insured.de campos state comp.fund d,de campos see also williamson vollmer engineering,sequoia ins.d.stating that the remedy of rescission for fraud under the insurance code is not in derogation of other remedies recognized under other provisions of law.as the court stated in de campos,this specification in the insurance code of circumstances under which a party to an insurance contract may rescind does not mean that rescission in any such case is the exclusive remedy.these provisions in the insurance code are in the nature of special provisions pertaining to insurance contracts,which are superimposed upon those provisions of law which govern contracts generally it seems clear,therefore,that the rights of rescission which the insurance code recognizes and limits are not in derogation of other remedial rights which are recognized and implemented by other provisions of law,de campos,supra,d at.
moreover,the insurance code sections that crosby cites are silent with respect to any remedies available to an insurer against an insurance broker for intentional m
