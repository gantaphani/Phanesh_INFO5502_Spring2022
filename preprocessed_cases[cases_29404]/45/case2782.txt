purchasers of life insurance are sometimes provided interim coverage while the application for insurance is being considered by the insurer.the terms of the interim coverage are set forth in a conditional receipt,sometimes referred to as a binder.smith westland life ins.cal d.in the present matter,michael hodgson,father of plaintiffs kara and mikayla hodgson and husband of plaintiff carrie hodgson,completed an application for life insurance with defendant banner life insurance company banner and paid an initial premium the application included a conditional receipt.defendants poage center insurance services and its successor,bisys insurance services,poage served as general agent for banner.within days,banner returned the check for the initial premium and declared the conditional receipt ineffective,explaining that the company did not provide interim coverage for the policy amount sought by michael.the company continued to process michael application for permanent coverage.approximately two weeks later,michael suffered mortal injuries in a motor vehicle accident.banner considered the policy terminated prior to michael accident.
hodgson filed a complaint against banner alleging breach of contract,bad faith,conversion,and negligence,and requesting an accounting and imposition of a constructive trust.the complaint also alleged negligence against poage.all parties filed motions for summary judgment.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of banner and poage,finding that michael had no insurance coverage with banner and that poage satisfied all its obligations to michael.hodgson appeals,contending michael was covered by the banner policy at the time of his death.we shall reverse the judgment in favor of banner.we affirm the judgment in favor of poage.
factual and procedural background 
michael,a licensed life and disability insurance agent with banner,submitted a banner life insurance application requesting in insurance on his life.michael submitted an initial premium check in the amount of,payable to banner.
the banner application form submitted by michael contained the following language when insurance takes effect except as provided in the conditional receipt bearing the same number as this application,no insurance applied for will take effect until the full first premium is paid and such policy is delivered to the owner while all proposed insureds are living and their health remains as described in this application.if all of these take place,insurance will take effect on the policy date.
the banner application also contained a conditional receipt form.the conditional receipt provides temporary or interim insurance coverage while banner is underwriting the application.banner issued a conditional receipt after michael paid the initial premium.
banner sets certain limitations on interim insurance coverage.when michael applied for his policy,banner limited interim insurance to applicants who applied for face amounts of life insurance of or less.the company issued a memorandum to all of its general agents announcing the conditional receipt limits.poage,a general agent of banner,knew of the conditional receipt limitations.however,poage used an older application package for michael application,in which the conditional receipt form referred to a limit of.
banner application package also included an authorization to draw checks in payment of life insurance premiums pac form.the pac form authorized banner to draw directly from an insured bank account for payment of monthly premiums.the process would begin after michael policy was approved.banner never withdrew funds from michael account.
michael submitted the application and initial premium check to poage.poage forwarded the application and premium to bi us,bi us,who provided underwriting services for banner.after reviewing the application,bi prepared an audit sheet.the audit sheet contained the notation return ck and a line item stating do not accept money on polic i es in over.bi forwarded the audit sheet and application to banner home office.
banner assigned michael application a number and began the process of underwriting the application.several days later,banner returned the original premium check to michael.the accompanying correspondence stated we are returning your payment of received in connection with the above referenced application,since it is our practice not to accept a deposit on applications that exceed the limits under which a conditional receipt can be given.however,we will continue to underwrite this application please return the conditional receipt to us for our file,since any coverage that may have been provided under the conditional receipt is no longer effective.
after michael received the returned check,a poage employee spoke with him.the employee notes of the conversation state agent called to see why his premium check was returned.advised him because it was over the binding limit of for california.advised him that banner life insurance applications are incorrect as far as the conditional receipt information on them.
following the return of michael check,banner continued to underwrite his application.banner underwriter tentatively approved issuance of a standard life insurance policy subject to michael completion and submission of an alcohol questionnaire.banner received the questionnaire and final underwriting approval was given for a policy with a face amount of.banner notified poage of the approval and policy issuance on june.
however,five days prior to this notification,on may,michael suffered injuries in a motor vehicle collision that left him in a coma.he never recovered from his injuries and died in early.
poage received michael life insurance policy on june.under banner procedures and policy terms,michael coverage could not be effective unless the policy was delivered to him while he was in the same health as described in his application he paid the first monthly premium he signed an amendment reflecting a change in the policy as issued versus as applied for preferred and he signed a delivery receipt.
banner contended michael injuries and continuing coma were a material change in his health from the application and prevented him from completing the necessary requirements.under this rationale,the policy did not become effective and was not delivered by poage.banner advised poage to return the policy.banner terminated the policy.
hodgson filed suit against banner,alleging breach of contract,bad faith,conversion,and negligence.the complaint also requested an accounting and formation of a constructive trust,and included a claim for punitive and exemplary damages.against poage,hodgson alleged a cause of action for negligence.
banner,hodgson,and poage each filed a motion for summary judgment.the court granted banner motion for summary judgment,finding,based on the undisputed facts and relevant case law t emporary insurance was created in favor of michael hodgson,that temporary insurance was then rescinded by banner,and hodgson did not have insurance coverage or a policy with banner for at the time that he died.
the court also granted poage motion for summary judgment,concluding hodgson submitted an application for insurance using a form that banner no longer used,which was known to poage,although there is no evidence that it was known to hodgson.nevertheless,poage processed the application and sent it on to banner.on may,in response to hodgson phone call inquiring as to why his premium check had been returned,poage advised him of the change in banner premium and conditional receipt practices.the information conveyed to hodgson was true and correct.the actions taken by poage satisfied all the obligations it had to hodgson under the circumstances.poage did not have an obligation to tell hodgson his temporary insurance had been cancelled,since the letter from banner already stated that.it also did not have an obligation to inform hodgson of other options he might have.
hodgson filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment entered following the order granting summary judgment.
discussion 
summary judgment is properly granted if there is no question of fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c villa mcferren th,d.the moving party must demonstrate that under no hypothesis is there a material factual issue requiring a trial,whereupon the burden of proof shifts to the opposing party to show,by responsive statement and admissible evidence,that triable issues of fact exist.chevron,superior court th,d macelhenny,levy th,d.
however,f rom commencement to conclusion,the moving party bears the burden of persuasion that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fn.omitted.there is a genuine issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.on appeal,we exercise our independent judgment to determine whether there are no triable issues of material fact and the moving party thus is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.sanchez swinerton walberg th,d.
hodgson argues that under the law governing temporary life insurance,michael remained insured under the banner life insurance policy up until the date of the accident that eventually claimed his life.hodgson contends that since banner had no legal reason to attempt to return the premium check and cancel the conditional receipt,the attempted termination was legally ineffective.hodgson points to banner retention of the automatic check withdrawal authorization and continuation of the underwriting process as evidence michael remained covered under the policy.
banner and poage interpret the facts far differently.defendants contend the return of the check and notice to michael that the conditional receipt was no longer effective terminated the temporary insurance coverage.according to banner,hodgson interpretation of the statutes and case law is.
happily,the parties agree on the seminal cases construing temporary insurance.unhappily,each side derives different standards for terminating temporary insurance from these authorities.
the supreme court first considered issues involving temporary insurance in ransom penn mutual life ins.cal d,ransom.in ransom,the insured,in response to penn mutual solicitation,underwent a physical examination,submitted a written application for insurance on a penn mutual form,and paid the first premium.penn mutual requested another medical examination,but in the interim ransom died in an automobile accident.id.at.the supreme court considered whether an insurance agreement was in effect at the time of ransom death.id.at.
the penn mutual application contained a conditional receipt,which provided in part that if the company is not satisfied as to such acceptability acceptable under the company rules for insurance at the rate of premium and the amount applied for,no insurance shall be in force until both the first premium is paid in full and the policy is delivered while the health,habits,occupation and other facts relating to the proposed insured are the same as described in this application ransom,supra,cal d at.
the court framed the question thusly we must determine whether a contract of insurance arose immediately upon receipt by defendant of the completed application with the premium payment,subject to the right of defendant to terminate the agreement if it subsequently concluded that ransom was not acceptable,or whether,as defendant contends,its satisfaction as to ransom acceptability for insurance was a condition precedent to the existence of any contract.ransom,supra,cal d at.
the court ultimately held that a contract of insurance arose upon penn mutual receipt of the completed application and the first premium payment.the court reasoned that the language of the insurance application offered the applicant two pay the first premium upon signing the application,in which event the insurance shall be in force from the date of the application,or pay upon receipt of the policy,in which event no insurance shall be in force until the policy is delivered.ransom,supra,cal d at.this language created the reasonable belief that by paying the premium in advance,the applicant would secure the benefit of immediate coverage.as the court noted,t here is an obvious advantage to the company in obtaining payment of the premium when the application is made,and it would be unconscionable to permit the company,after using language to induce payment of the premium at that time,to escape the obligation which an ordinary applicant would reasonably believe had been undertaken by the insurer.ibid.the court also found temporary insurance remains in effect even if the agent fails to detach and use the receipt form.id.at.
the court acknowledged that some of the language of the application supported the insurance company position that payment of the first premium and acceptability of the applicant were both conditions precedent to coverage.however,such language only created an ambiguity that,under the usual rules of contract interpretation,had to be resolved against the insurer.ransom,supra,cal d at.
ransom thus articulates a reasonable expectations doctrine.ambiguous language in an application for insurance was interpreted to effectuate the reasonable expectations of the prospective policyholder to temporary coverage 
the court in ransom had no occasion to resolve the question of whether and how an insurer could terminate interim coverage created under a conditional receipt following payment of the first premium,though it noted that some courts had suggested coverage could be terminated only by rejection of the application and return of the premium payment.ransom,supra,cal d at.that question was considered in a subsequent series of cases,each delineating the circumstances under which temporary insurance issues.in metropolitan life insurance company grant cir,the language of the application was far more susceptible to a construction that coverage required acts of the company in addition to payment of the first premium.nonetheless,the court concluded that under california precedent,the acceptance of premiums,not the delivery of the policy,created a reasonable expectation on the part of the applicant of immediate coverage.id.at.in the court view,the policy language at issue did not counter the applicant reasonable expectation of coverage upon payment of the first premium.in metropolitan life insurance company wood cir,the court held that the insurer obligation arises when its agent accepts the application and a premium payment.the court rejected the insurer argument that temporary insurance comes into being only where the applicant is insurable when the application is submitted.id.at.
in koorstad washington nat.ins.d,the court reaffirmed the basic rule set down in ransom that temporary insurance protection arises when an insurance company receives and accepts an insurance premium with a policy application.id.at.the court in thompson occidental life ins.cal d,considered a situation in which after the applicant paid a premium,the insurer decided to require an additional medical examination.prior to being told of that decision,the applicant died.the insurer returned the premium check and denied coverage.id.at.the court found the insurance contract arose upon the applicant payment of the first premium following his completion of the application and the initial medical examination.the court noted the insurer could rescind the contract of temporary insurance while the applicant was alive by determining the applicant was uninsurable.however,the insurer right to rescind terminates upon the death or mortal injury of the applicant.id.at.
in a pair of cases,courts grappled with issues similar to those presented in this case.in slobojan western travelers life ins.cal d,slobojan,the applicant signed an application and paid the first month premium.the insurance company agent notified the applicant that the policy premium was higher than that quoted and requested the difference,approximately cents,for the first and second months be remitted in the second month premium payment.five days later the applicant died.the insurer argued no coverage existed.id.at.
the appellate court disagreed,noting the applicant is offered a choice of either paying his first premium when he signs the application,in which event the insurance will be in force from the date of the application,or of paying upon receipt of the policy,in which event no insurance shall be in force until the policy is delivered.slobojan,supra,cal d at.
the court also rejected the insurer argument that the first month premium was not paid in full since it was cents short.the appellate court noted the first premium check was for the full premium quoted by the insurer agent,and under the circumstances shown here the ordinary person would believe that he had secured coverage by paying it.slobojan,supra,cal d at.the insurer also claimed it rejected the applicant application,terminating coverage.the court found the defendant had accepted slobojan as a risk and had issued the policy as applied for,but at a cents per month premium increase for the accidental death increase which slobojan had not rejected.accordingly,no termination is shown of the insurance coverage which arose when slobojan paid the first month premium in advance.ibid.
in smith westland life ins.cal d,smith,the applicant paid the first premium and submitted an application.the insurer processed the application but issued a policy that eliminated some provisions and increased the premium.the applicant refused to execute the amended application or pay the increased premium.after several unsuccessful attempts to obtain acceptance of the modified policy,the insurer agent told the applicant his previously paid premium would be refunded.the applicant died the following day.id.at.
the insurer denied coverage.the trial court concluded temporary insurance had been created but had been terminated by rejection of the application and notice to the applicant.smith,supra,cal d at.the supreme court reversed.
the supreme court began by revisiting the formulation of temporary insurance by the ransom court,noting ransom recognized that an ordinary person who pays the premium at the time he applies for insurance is justified in assuming that payment will bring immediate protection,regardless of whether or not the insurer ultimately decides to accept the risk.smith,supra,cal d at.the court considered the rule for terminating temporary insurance in other jurisdictions,reviewed the reasoning behind temporary insurance,and concluded this reasonable expectation on the part of the applicant would,in our view,extend to a continuance of such coverage until the insurer had nullified the two factors responsible for its application for the policy by rejection and notice of rejection,and the payment of premium by a refund of it.unless the insurer manifest s this intention to refuse permanent coverage by the return of the premium within a reasonable time,the applicant could assume that his insurance was effective.citation.id.at.
the smith court stated its holding bluntly w here,as here,the insurer has received an application for insurance together with payment of the premium and thereafter decides to reject it,the contract of insurance immediately created upon the receipt of the application and payment of the premium is not terminated until a the insurer has actually rejected the application and by appropriate notice communicated such rejection to the insured and b refunded the premium payment to the insured.smith,supra,cal d at.the court found such requirements not only logical,but also fair.the requirement eliminates uncertainty as to coverage and controversy as to effective notice of rejection.id.at.
smith and the other cases establishing the parameters of temporary insurance focus on the reasonable expectation of the applicant.as banner correctly notes,smith holds that a n applicant reasonable expectation of immediate coverage continues until the insurer nullifies the factors responsible for its request for coverage and the payment of premium.michael reasonable expectation of continuing coverage ceased when banner returned his premium payment and informed him that any coverage that may have been provided under the conditional receipt is no longer effective.
hodgson acknowledges that banner returned the premium payment but finds greater significance in banner failure to cancel or disavow its authorization to draw premium payments from michael bank account through the pac form.according to hodgson,the receipt of the authorization constitutes immediate constructive receipt of the premium sufficient to create temporary life insurance.further,according to hodgson,banner decision to continue underwriting michael application negates any claim that banner canceled the policy.we disagree.
the undisputed facts reveal michael submitted a check for the initial premium banner returned the check.the return of the premium check complies with the requirement in smith that the insurer refunded the premium payment to the insured.smith,supra,cal d at.michael completion and banner retention of the pac form does not change this result.the pac form was filled out in anticipation of payment of subsequent premiums after the policy was approved.no further premiums were paid by michael or deducted from his account by banner via the pac form.
the return of the premium check is completely at odds with the notion that banner was extending temporary coverage.true,when banner returned michael initial premium payment,it informed him it intended to continue to underwrite his application.however,the letter also stated please return the conditional receipt to us for our file,since any coverage that may have been provided under the conditional receipt is no longer effective.
to terminate temporary insurance,smith requires that the insurer has actually rejected the application and by appropriate notice communicated such rejection to the insured.smith,supra,cal d at.here,banner unequivocally notified michael that the coverage he applied for was not available and he would not be covered.the letter that accompanied the refund of the premium does not lend itself to the uncertainty as to coverage and controversy as to effective notice of rejection id.at,disparaged by the supreme court in smith.smith strove to eliminate the mystery surrounding whether or not temporary coverage ceased in an effort to protect the reasonable expectations of an applicant.the notice in the present case fully comports with the stated aims of smith,informing any reasonable applicant that his or her application for the requested policy has been rejected.
in smith and all of the cases thus far discussed,the insurance company retained an initial premium payment but sought to deny coverage upon the applicant death prior to a determination of insurability and before the delivery of policy documents.in each case,the court concluded,based on the reasonable expectation of the applicant,that interim coverage arises upon payment of the premium and such coverage continues until the application is rejected prior to the event insured against.in the present case,banner did not retain the initial premium payment and unequivocally denied the existence of interim coverage but nonetheless continued to process michael application for insurance.ultimately,the application was approved,though the terms of the approval are disputed.
hodgson argues that banner continued processing of michael application for permanent insurance undermined its coverage disclaimer and thus created a reasonable expectation of temporary coverage.we are not persuaded that this fact should alter our analysis of the holding in smith and the other cases previously discussed.the argument does,however,invoke the provisions of insurance code section,which are dispositive of this appeal 
section states when a payment is made equal to the full first premium at the time an application for life insurance other than group life insurance is signed by the applicant and either the applicant received at that time a receipt for said payment on a form prepared by the insurer,or in the absence of such a receipt the insurer receives the said payment at its home office,and
