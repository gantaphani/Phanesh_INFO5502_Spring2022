a cloth rag remaining in an oil refinery compressor caused several million dollars in business interruption damages.tonicstar limited,one of the insurers of lovegreen turbine services,the company who serviced the compressor,brought this declaratory judgment action claiming it had no duty to defend or indemnify lovegreen in an action for damages brought by the owner of the oil refinery.the district court granted tonicstar motion for summary judgment,concluding the insurer did not owe lovegreen a duty to defend or indemnify.we affirm.
lovegreen is a service provider which is in the business of servicing turbines,generators,and compressors.flint hills resources,lp,is the owner of a crude oil refinery near rosemount,minnesota the pine bend facility.in,flint hills hired lovegreen to overhaul a compressor at the pine bend facility.it asked lovegreen to be responsible for the disassembly,cleaning,inspection,repairs as necessary,reassembly of the compressor,and inspection of the gear box.app.lovegreen worked on the compressor around the clock from september through september.in connection with the work,a large container of cloth rags were used to wipe the compressor during the overhaul.
after lovegreen work was complete,flint hills placed the compressor back into service.initially,the compressor ran as designed.one week later,however,flint hills shut down the compressor because a charge pump at the refinery failed.when flint hills restarted it the same day,it vibrated excessively and created a large volume of unusual noise.flint hills again shut down the compressor,inspected it,and found a cloth rag and cloth fragments lodged inside.flint hills instructed its own employees to remove the cloth rag and fragments,repair the compressor,and place it back in operation as quickly as possible.it documented its inspection and repair with photographs and saved the cloth fragments found inside the compressor.the compressor was out of service for five days,causing flint hills to incur loss of business damages exceeding million.
after returning the compressor to service,flint hills began pursuing lovegreen liability insurers to recoup its damages.lovegreen had million in primary insurance coverage through liberty mutual fire insurance company.a commercial umbrella policy issued by a syndicate of six insurers through lloyd of london provided additional coverage in excess of million.liberty mutual and five of the six subscribing lloyd of london syndicate agreed to pay their share of the business loss.the to pay.as a result,flint hills brought suit against lovegreen raising claims of negligence and breach of contract premised on its failure to perform the overhaul in a workmanlike manner by leaving the cloth rag inside the compressor.flint hills claimed loss of business damages in the amount of million the part remaining unpaid,as well as for the cost of repairs to the compressor.
the insurance policy issued to lovegreen by tonicstar generally provided coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising from the rendering of or failure to render professional services,app,but contained several exclusions.as relevant,exclusion.excluded coverage for property damage to that particular part of any property that must be restored,repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on it.an exception to exclusion.restored coverage for property damage included in the operations hazard.id.at.the policy defined property damage as 
physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
id.at.the policy defined your work as 
work or operations performed by you or on your behalf and 
materials,parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.
id.at.endorsement added the following definition of work the entire completed construction or the various separately identifiable parts required to be furnished under the contract documents.id.at.
after flint hills sued lovegreen,tonicstar brought this declaratory judgment action against lovegreen and flint hills asking the district court to declare tonicstar had no duty to defend or indemnify lovegreen in the action brought by flint hills.tonicstar moved for summary judgment arguing flint hills damages were excluded pursuant to several of the policy exclusions,including exclusion.f.the district court granted tonicstar motion for summary judgment,concluding exclusion.applied.the district court further concluded the exception to exclusion.for property damage included in the operations hazard did not apply because such coverage excluded property damage arising out of the existence of tools,uninstalled equipment or abandoned or unused materials.id.at.the district court concluded the cloth rag left in the compressor constituted abandoned or unused materials.
lovegreen filed a timely appeal.on appeal,it contends the district court erred in three respects.first,the argument about keeping a rag out of the compressor was not part of its work within the meaning of the policy.second,it is contended the district court erred in concluding the cloth rag was abandoned or unused materials,and flint hills loss of business damages should have been covered under the policy operations hazard provisions.finally,lovegreen argues that,even if exclusion.applies to exclude coverage,the exclusion does not apply to the million in loss of business damages,but only to the in repairs to the compressor itself.
both the district court grant of summary judgment,and its interpretation of the terms of the insurance policy,are reviewed de novo.macheca transport phila.indem,cir.
we agree with the district court that exclusion,which excludes coverage for property damage to property which must be repaired because the insured work was incorrectly performed,applies.cloth rags were part of the materials lovegreen furnished in connection with the overhaul of the compressor.in addition,using the cloth rags to wipe the compressor during the overhaul was part of the work or operations performed by lovegreen.as a consequence,leaving a cloth rag inside the compressor falls within the policy definition of work.such conduct triggers exclusion.because it indicates lovegreen work was incorrectly performed,and the compressor required repair as a result.furthermore,the million in business interruption damages flint hills suffered while the compressor was being repaired is excluded from coverage because the policy definition of property damage encompassed not only physical injury to the property affected by the defective work,the cost of the compressor repairs,but also the resulting loss of use of the property.see,tga,ins.of new york,cir interpreting a loss of use provision under minnesota law,and explaining that loss of use of property resulting from defective work falls outside the coverage of such policies.
lovegreen contends,however,that keeping a rag out of the compressor was not part of its work as defined by the policy.it relies upon the additional definition of work under endorsement which,as stated above,provided in part that work is the various separately identifiable parts required to be furnished under the contract documents.app.it contends a final inspection to remove foreign material from the compressor was not part of the work it was required to furnish under the contract documents.
even assuming arguendo a final inspection to remove foreign material was not specifically mentioned in the contract,lovegreen argument nonetheless fails.the definition of work in endorsement does not replace the definition of your work in the main body of the policy.endorsement specifically provides that the following additional definitions shall apply.id.emphasis added.in other words,both the definition of your work and the definition of work in endorsement apply.thus,leaving a cloth rag in the compressor could constitute lovegreen work under either definition.after all it prov
