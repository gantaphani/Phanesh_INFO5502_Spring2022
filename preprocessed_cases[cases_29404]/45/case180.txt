kevin tobin appeals the award of summary judgment to his former employer,liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual,on his state and federal claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate,pursuant to the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the massachusetts statute.laws ch.chapter.because we believe that summary judgment was improperly granted on tobin failure to accommodate claim,we vacate the district court judgment on that claim.we affirm,however,the remainder of the district court decision.
tobin was hired by liberty mutual on september,for an administrative position.in may,he was promoted to sales representative,a position he held until his termination in january.as a sales representative,tobin was responsible for selling insurance,including automobile,home,and life insurance.he was also expected to assist in customer service and retain business.
since,tobin has been under the regular care of a psychiatrist,mainly for treatment of bipolar disorder.this condition limited tobin focus and concentration,impaired his ability to prioritize and complete tasks,required that he have more time to finish his work,and affected his organizational skills.it was only in december,however,that tobin revealed his condition to officials at the company.
tobin performance 
although tobin had accumulated a large book of business over the years and the annual premiums generated from this book of business earned significant profits,tobin yearly new business sales were considered deficient beginning in.for example,for the period ending september,tobin had sold only new significant shortfall given that the quota for new policy sales was set at.in his sales representative appraisal for that year,on a scale from,with being the highest,tobin received a in the sales rating category.his overall evaluation was a.in and,tobin appraisals reflect similar negative ratings and comments for sales,prospecting,performance,and overall performance,and positive ratings and comments for quality,loss ratio,and retention 
in april,tobin supervisor,mike robin,gave tobin a written warning stating that failure to meet the sales requirements for a period would lead to a probation followed by possible termination.although tobin did not meet the requirements for the period,liberty mutual waived the probation because tobin wife was ill.on november,robin placed tobin on a warning period,emphasizing that new business sales were critical,as were participation in sales initiatives and refraining from inappropriate and insubordinate behavior in the office,including the use of profane language.robin made clear that tobin would face probation unless he brought his performance up to an acceptable level by demonstrating increased sales results and participating in sales initiatives.
tobin then took two disability leaves of absence.the first lasted from december until june,and the second from september until january.in both instances,tobin doctor,william kantar,indicated that he had diagnosed tobin as bipolar and that tobin was significantly restricted as to interpersonal relations,as well as to occupational and social activities.each time tobin returned to work,tobin new supervisor,manina schwitters,gave tobin a reduced work schedule for his first four weeks after he returned from leave.each time,upon resumption of his duties,tobin warning period was reinstated.
when tobin returned to work the second time,in january,liberty mutual hired a nurse,cathy harding,to assist him in resuming his position as a sales representative.after working reduced hours for four weeks,tobin resumed his duties on february.tobin supervisor extended the two weeks remaining from the november warning period to run for four weeks,from february to february.tobin failed to sell new policies during the warning period to avoid beginning a probation period.however,during a meeting with several supervisors,tobin produced several additional policies,which were accepted in order to meet the quota set for the warning period.
in a letter dated march,schwitters indicated that she would monitor tobin sales results in increments for the rest of the year beginning on march.at the end of the first increment,schwitters notified tobin he was being placed on probation for failing to meet the minimum sales requirements.the quota for the period had been,and tobin sold only ten.tobin then successfully completed the probationary period by selling the required thirty policies.tobin sales performance,however,deteriorated over the next several months,and he was again placed on probation on november.tobin failed to sell the required thirty policies during this second probationary period and was terminated on january.
mass marketing accounts 
mass marketing accounts mm accounts are group insurance discount programs offered to businesses and associations throughout the united states.the employees or association members who purchase insurance policies through mm accounts receive benefits such as discounted policy premiums,automatic deduction of premium payments from paychecks,and a waiver of finance and service charges.mm accounts provide sales representatives with access to employees of participating employers in workplace settings and thereby afford sales representatives exposure to a large volume of potential clients.these mm accounts are desirable to the sales representatives because they provide a good source for potential sales.
tobin says he repeatedly requested to be assigned mm accounts and to be provided with adequate sales support.he maintains that liberty mutual failure to assign him mm accounts was both a denial of a reasonable accommodation and discriminatory pursuant to state and federal law.tobin argues that but for the failure of liberty mutual to assign him mm accounts and to provide adequate sales support,he would have been able to meet the sales quotas set for him.
the parties dispute whether assigning tobin a mm account would have violated liberty mutual policy for assigning such accounts.liberty mutual contends that the mm accounts were distributed on the basis of to those sales representatives who most actively took initiative to land new mm well as according to workload.tobin,however,contends that on at least one occasion schwitters violated this policy by assigning an mm account to herb schneiderman,a sales representative with a substandard sales performance,and that tobin could have likewise been assigned such accounts despite his sales.liberty mutual responds that schwitter assignments were not inconsistent because,unlike tobin,schneiderman at least took some initiative to open new mm accounts.liberty mutual further argues that,in any event,there is no evidence that tobin would have been able to handle adequately such an account were it assigned to him or that he would have been able to meet the quotas,even with mm accounts.
tobin now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for liberty mutual,arguing that the district court erred because liberty mutual explanation for tobin termination was pretextual,there was a nexus between his disability and the requested accommodation of assignment of mm accounts,and liberty mutual failed to engage in an interactive process to help accommodate tobin disability.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,see,united parcel service,cir,and construe the record in the light most favorable to tobin.see united parcel service,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
disability discrimination claim 
in evaluating tobin disability discrimination claim under the ada and chapter,we use the framework outlined by the supreme court in green,d see higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir approving use of framework in connection with ada claims of disability discrimination.under this approach,tobin must first establish a prima facie case by establishing that he suffers from a disability or handicap,as defined by the ada and chapter,that he was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of his job,either with or without reasonable accommodation,and that liberty mutual took an adverse employment action against him because of,in whole or in part,his protected disability.see,at.carroll xerox,cir benoit technical,cir.if tobin is able to do this,the burden then shifts to liberty mutual to articulate a legitimate,reason for its employment decision and to produce credible evidence to show that the reason advanced was the real reason,at.finally,if liberty mutual offers such a reason,the burden shifts back to tobin,and he must proffer evidence to establish that liberty mutual justification is mere pretext,cloaking discriminatory animus.id.at.the ultimate burden of proving unlawful discrimination rests at all times with tobin.reeves sanderson plumbing,d 
here,it is undisputed that tobin has established a prima facie case and that liberty mutual has advanced a legitimate,reason for its employment decision.the issue in dispute here is whether liberty mutual asserted reason was,that the reason was advanced merely to disguise liberty mutual real reason for terminating tobin employment,his disability.in assessing pretext,the court must look at the total package of proof offered by the plaintiff.benoit,at.
tobin argues that liberty mutual proffered reason is indeed a pretext and that he was fired because of his disability.tobin,however,has to clear two significant hurdles before he is able to show pretext.first,he must refute the clear evidence put forward by liberty mutual showing that it was poor insurance sales,and not disability,that constituted the real reason for tobin termination.second,he must advance evidence of his own showing that liberty mutual asserted reason was a pretext hiding discrimination.see mesnick,cir stating that i t is not enough for a plaintiff merely to impugn the veracity of the employer justification he must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham,but a sham intended to cover up the employer real motive internal quotations omitted.
tobin,however,fails to clear either of these hurdles.with regard to the evidence produced by liberty mutual,the company provided a full and account of tobin longstanding performance deficiencies.as liberty mutual recounts,tobin failed to meet minimum quotas and standards he did not show up for meetings with supervisors and his performance reviews were poor.tobin has done nothing to show that this cited evidence is false.
moreover,tobin has produced no evidence of his own to prove that liberty mutual asserted reason was merely a pretext to disguise discrimination.although he does cite to several company and a list enumerating the measures the company took in order to assist an attempt to show discriminatory action on the part of the company,these documents tobin december disclosure of his disability to company officials.at the time of the drafting of these documents,in september and october,people at the company did not even know that tobin suffered from any sort of disability.as such,these documents can not serve to show any malice or discriminatory animus by liberty mutual.
similarly,tobin attempts to show that liberty mutual asserted reason was mere pretext by pointing to the fact that several employees who were similarly situated to him were given mm opportunity that was withheld from him.tobin,however,fails to provide specific evidence showing that these other employees were indeed similarly situated to him.see perkins brigham women,cir stating that a claim of disparate treatment based on comparative evidence must rest on proof that the proposed analogue is similarly situated in material respects.in fact,there is significant evidence in the record to show that tobin and these employees were not similarly situated.for example,one of the employees,herb schneiderman,had improved his performance over time at the company and was noted for his good improvement in his outlook and attitude.tobin,in comparison,was constantly criticized for his performance,his organization,and for his inability to follow the directions of his managers.as we can not conclude that there was any evidence here that tobin was a victim of disparate treatment,we can not find any evidence in the record to support tobin claim that liberty mutual decision to terminate his employment was not based on the company proffered grounds.for these reasons,we hold that the district court was correct in granting summary judgment on tobin disability discrimination claim.
failure to accommodate claim 
tobin second claim arises under both the ada and chapter.under the ada,employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability,unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer business.b a here,tobin sought two accommodations in particular from liberty mutual assignment of mm accounts and additional service representative assistance.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of liberty mutual on this claim.
looking primarily to tobin request for mm accounts,we think that this grant of summary judgment was improper.to survive summary judgment on his reasonable accommodation claim,tobin had to produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that he was disabled within the meaning of the ada,he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation,and liberty mutual,despite knowing of his disability,did not reasonably accommodate it.associates of north america,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
tobin presented sufficient evidence on the first and third prongs to survive summary judgment.see tobin,wl at,noting that t o be sure,tobin disability is grounds for accommodation under the ada and that tobin had requested but was refused an mm account as an accommodation for his disability.it was the second prong of the test that the district court based summary judgment a conclusion that allowing tobin access to mm accounts would have altered his job requirements and hence the essential functions of his employment.the district court wrote 
i find that summary judgment is warranted because the assignment of mass marketing accounts is not tied to tobin disability tobin has introduced no evidence as to how the assignment of mass marketing accounts would have addressed the particular deficiencies created by his particular disability m ore mass marketing accounts would likely have led to increased sales for any sales representative,whether disabled or not assignment of mass marketing accounts would,therefore,have been functionally equivalent to altering job performance requirements and quotas,which the ada does not require of employers.
tobin,wl at 
immediately prior to this excerpted passage,however,the district court had we there was a triable issue of fact as to whether access to mm accounts would have altered the nature of tobin job requirements and the essential functions of his employment.see tobin,wl at the evidence indicates that schwitters used a number of subjective factors in assigning mass marketing accounts that had nothing to do with prospecting.liberty mutual has made no showing that assigning tobin a mass marketing account would have created an undue hardship.
we have noted that many of our cases on essential function and reasonable accommodation have turned on the surprising failure of one party or the other to proffer any significant evidence in favor of their position.reed lepage bakeries,cir.that is exactly the situation here.despite its burden to come forward with some evidence on the essential function issue,see ward massachusetts health research,liberty mutual has failed to point to any evidence in the record that awarding tobin an mm account would change the essential function of his job.
liberty mutual asserts on appeal,as it did before the district court,that accommodating tobin with an mm account would have forced the company to ignore its own performance standards.however,as the district court concluded,there was a disputed issue of fact as to how mm accounts were assigned.tobin pointed to evidenc
