on february,metlife sent morrison a letter acknowledging receipt of his application for portable term coverage,but denied the application,explaining that this type of coverage is not available to michigan residents.because morrison was a resident of michigan,metlife denied his application,refunded morrison premium check,and directed him to its customer service unit with questions.morrison did not submit any further premium payments to metlife,request any further reconsideration,appeal,file suit,or otherwise communicate with metlife concerning his application for portable life insurance.

there are two plan documents which lay out the relevant benefits and obligations of employees,participants,and beneficiaries under the m m plan the plan certificate and the benefits overview handbook the handbook or spd,a summary plan description.the plan certificate provides for continuing life insurance benefits under several conditions.pertinent to this case,the plan certificate states that employees who make a request to continue group life benefits,must reside in a state which has approved such condition.at.
additionally,the plan certificate explains that if you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored,in whole or in part,you may file suit in a state or federal court.at.the plan certificate is silent as to when the suit must be filed.however,the handbook or spd,states that if you feel you have cause for legal action,petition may be presented to the company general counsel for service of legal process at the company address,and that such legal cause of action must be brought within three years of the date your benefit was denied or date your cause of action first arose,if earlier.emphasis in original at.
on april,morrison brought a complaint against m m,j h,the m m plan,and metlife.in count i of her complaint,morrison alleged that she was entitled to of portable life insurance benefits for coverage that her husband was denied shortly after resignation from j h.in count ii,morrison contended that m m,j h,the m m plan,and metlife owed her statutory penalties in the amount of per day for each day they failed to provide her with requested plan documents.
on july,m m,j h,and the m m plan filed a motion to dismiss morrison complaint,pursuant to.b.the motion asserted that i morrison was not entitled to any benefits under the plan ii morrison lacked standing to bring suit to collect benefits or statutory penalty fees and iii morrison claims were barred by the plan statute of limitations.m m argued that i morrison substantive claim accrued on february,the date metlife denied morrison application,and ii because the complaint was filed more than four years later,on april,the claim was untimely.metlife filed a brief adopting m m motion to dismiss.
on october,morrison filed a response opposing defendants motion to dismiss and a for summary judgment,in which she argued,inter alia,that her claim for benefits was not.she contended that i the handbook limitations period was unenforceable because a similar provision was not contained in the plan document and ii even if the handbook statute of limitations was enforceable,her action did not accrue until december,the day of metlife second notice of denial,rather than february,the day metlife denied morrison application for portable life insurance and refunded his initial premium payment.in the alternative,morrison argued that her rights as a life insurance beneficiary did not arise until,at the very earliest,the date her husband passed away.
the district court denied morrison for summary judgment and granted m m motion to dismiss on the grounds that i morrison claim was and ii morrison did not have standing to bring an action for statutory penalties.while initially noting that there was no valid life insurance policy of which morrison was a beneficiary,the district court focused its holding on the issue of enforceability of the statute of limitations contained in the m m handbook.the court found no conflict between the handbook and the m m plan document.the two erisa documents were reconcilable because the plan silence as to the limitations period did not render the handbook provision on the same issue ambiguous or contradictory.the district court also rejected morrison argument
