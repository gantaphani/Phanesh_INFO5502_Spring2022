caremark,caremark appeals the district court judgment denying caremark motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in favor of david goetz and jason hickey,sued in their official capacities as commissioner of the tennessee department of finance and administration,and deputy commissioner of the bureau of tenncare tenncare,respectively,collectively tenncare and the united states of america.caremark specifically challenges the district court declaration that the bureau of tenncare claims for medicaid reimbursement are not subject to certain card presentation and timely filing restrictions contained in the plans administered by caremark.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
factual background 
caremark is a company that contracts with plan providers to supply prescription drug distribution and claim processing to plan participants.in addition to operating its own pharmacies,caremark has contracted with retail pharmacy chains and independent retail pharmacies to form a network of more than retail pharmacies.tenncare is the state agency that provides health care coverage to individuals eligible for medicaid benefits in tennessee.
the pharmacy benefit plans at issue contain two relevant plan limitations that impact the payment of claims the card presentation restriction and the timely filing restriction when a plan has a card presentation restriction,caremark will decline to provide any prescription drug benefits if the participant does not identify himself or herself as a caremark plan participant at the time of sale.identification as a plan participant is usually achieved by presenting a caremark card.
other caremark plans allow participants to obtain their prescription drugs at retail pharmacies without identifying themselves as plan participants.under such plans,the participant pays for the prescription drugs and then seeks reimbursement from caremark.these plans are subject to a timely filing requirement,whereby a participant who seeks reimbursement for the expenditure must submit his or her request within a prescribed period of time.a plan may designate a filing period of any length,even a period as short as a few days.
some caremark participants are also eligible for medicaid dual eligibles in tennessee,when a dual eligible purchases prescription drugs at a retail pharmacy and presents only his or her medicaid card,the pharmacy sends a claim to tenncare.when tenncare is unaware of any liability any other source of coverage,such as caremark coverage,it pays the claim for the medicaid beneficiary.if,however,tenncare discovers that the beneficiary is also covered by a caremark plan after a claim is paid,it submits a reimbursement request to caremark pursuant to a,a process called pay and chase.
when tenncare seeks reimbursement for a dual eligible enrolled in a caremark plan that has a card presentation requirement,caremark will reject the reimbursement request on the grounds that a caremark card was not presented at the point of sale.similarly,when tenncare submits a reimbursement request for a dual eligible enrolled in a caremark plan with a timely filing requirement,caremark routinely denies tenncare request as untimely.since tenncare can not file a claim for reimbursement until it receives a claim from the pharmacy and subsequently discovers that the beneficiary is also covered by caremark,tenncare is often unable to file its claim for reimbursement within the time limit set by the caremark plan.
ii.procedural background 
on december,caremark filed an action against tenncare in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment that tenncare claims are subject to certain plan restrictions including the card presentation and timely filing restrictions applicable to individual plan participants.the united states successfully moved to intervene in the case on march.on the same date,tenncare filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that caremark has denied reimbursement to tenncare by improperly applying its card presentation and timely filing restrictions against tenncare,in violation of the medicaid statute,et and the employee retirement income security act erisa,b.
on july,tenncare,caremark,and the united states filed for summary judgment.on october,the district court granted tenncare and the united states motions for summary judgment and denied caremark motion for summary judgment.caremark,goetz,d.specifically,the district court found that a tennessee medicaid beneficiary statutory assignment of rights to tenncare occurs at the time the beneficiary requests covered goods or services,and thus the card presentation and timely filing restrictions set forth in plans do not apply to tenncare requests for reimbursement from caremark.id.at.the present appeal ensued.
standard of review 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.howard ex rel.estate of howard bayes,cir.because the denial of caremark motion for summary judgment was decided on purely legal grounds,we also review that decision de novo.citizens ins.of am.midmichigan health connectcare network plan,cir.moreover,statutory interpretation questions are reviewed de novo.cmtys.for equity michigan high school athletic ass n,cir citing ammex,united states,cir.
medicaid is a program,created in under title xix of the social security act,that pays for medical and assistance for certain individuals and families.see,et.medicaid is a joint federal and state program,which is administered by the states but financed with both state and federal funds.b.unless otherwise provided by federal law,medicaid is considered to be the payor of last resort.see wesley health care,debuono,cir,st sess.this means that all other available resources must be used before medicaid pays for the medical care of an individual enrolled in a medicaid program.thus,when a dual eligible purchases prescription drugs,caremark is the primary payor and tenncare is only a secondary payor.
federal law requires every state participating in a medicaid program to implement a third party liability provision that requires the state to seek reimbursement for medicaid expenditures from third parties who are liable for medical treatment provided to a medicaid recipient.a a.a state plan also must provide that,as a prerequisite to medicaid eligibility,the applicant must assign to the state whatever rights he or she may have to payment for pharmaceutical costs paid by the state plan on behalf of dual eligibles.a a a.federal law further requires group health plans to provide that payment for benefits with respect to a participant under the plan will be made in accordance with any assignment of rights made by or on behalf of such participant or beneficiary of the participant.b.
in accordance with the aforementioned federal law,tennessee law provides that the state shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery that medicaid recipients may have against any third parties,ann.a,and that u pon accepting medical assistance,the recipient shall be deemed to have made an assignment to the state of the right of third party insurance benefits to which the recipient may be entitled.id.b.tennessee regulations provide that claims should not be made against medicaid until other probable third party resources to the recipient have been collected.comp.regs.tennessee regulations specifically authorize the state medicaid agency,tenncare,to seek reimbursement from third parties,such as caremark,by means of direct billing when it is determined that a previously paid service s sic may have been covered by a third party.id.a.
the central issue presented on appeal is whether the card presentation and timely filing limitations contained in the plans can serve as permissible bases for caremark to deny reimbursement claims submitted by tenncare for medicaid payments made on behalf of dual eligibles.caremark argues on appeal that the district court erred in holding that tenncare claims are not subject to the card presentation and timely filing restrictions for three reasons a medicaid recipient does not assign his or her rights to tenncare until tenncare makes a payment for the recipient prescription drugs the district court impermissibly granted the assignee tenncare greater rights than the assignor plan participant and the district court ruling runs afoul of erisa.
ultimately,we find these arguments to be unconvincing for four reasons.first,a i and its legislative history establish that the card presentation and timely filing restrictions are impermissible grounds on which to deny reimbursement to a state medicaid agency like tenncare.second,the district court did not err in holding that a tennessee medicaid beneficiary assignment of rights to tenncare occurs at the.third,the card presentation and timely filing restrictions are invalid as applied because they violate medicaid policies.fourth,contrary to caremark contention,erisa actually requires health benefit plans such as caremark to allow state medicaid agencies to obtain reimbursement for medicaid expenditures.we discuss each of caremark arguments and our bases for rejecting those arguments,in succession,below.
on february,federal legislation went into effect that states that medicaid reimbursement claims can not be denied for violations of the type of card presentation or timely filing restrictions contained in the plans.specifically,a i provides in relevant part 
states shall effect laws requiring health insurers iv to agree not to deny a claim submitted by the state solely on the basis of the date of submission of the claim,the type or format of the claim form,or a failure to present proper documentation at the that is the basis of the claim,if i the claim is submitted by the state within the period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished and ii any action by the state to enforce its rights with respect to such claim is commenced within years of the state submission of such claim 
a i.caremark argues that these amendments to the statute demonstrate that medicaid third party claims were not exempt from card presentation requirements and timely filing limits under the prior version of the statute.appellant letter submitted pursuant to fed.j.the united states,in turn,argues that the amendments do not constitute new limitations,but simply clarify previously existing law.we are persuaded by the united states argument.
while the statutory language of itself does not indicate whether the amendments are intended to impose new obligations or clarify preexisting law,the legislative history provides insight.the provisions requiring states to enact laws mandating that private insurers not deny medicaid reimbursement claims on the basis of the date of submission of the claim,the type or format of the claim form,or a failure to present proper documentation at the were originally contained in section of the deficit reduction act of.see,stat.in amending section a of the social security act,a,congress chose to entitle this portion of the deficit reduction act of clarification of third parties responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service.id.emphasis added.the fact that congress expressly decided to denominate these amendments as a clarification is significant.this designation,viewed against the backdrop of the federal policy that medicaid is the payor of last resort,leads us to conclude that the amendments now contained in a i iv were clarifications of preexisting law.thus,a i iv establishes that,during the period in question,the card presentation and timely filing restrictions contained in the pharmacy benefit plans were impermissible when applied to deny medicaid reimbursement claims submitted by tenncare.
caremark argues that the district court erred in finding that the statutory assignment of a tennessee medicaid beneficiary rights to tenncare occurs at the,when the recipient purchases his or her prescription at the pharmacy.caremark posits,instead,that the assignment of rights by the beneficiary to tenncare occurs when tenncare pays for the beneficiary prescription drugs.the tennessee welfare statute governing medical assistance provides in section b that u pon accepting medical assistance,the recipient shall be deemed to have made an assignment to the state of the right of third party insurance benefits to which the recipient may be entitled.ann.b.in reaching its conclusion that assignment only occurs after payment,caremark relies on the definition of medical assistance,which is defined elsewhere in the tennessee statute,as payment of the cost of care,services,and supplies.id.caremark reasons that,pursuant to this definition,a medicaid recipient can only make an assignment to the state after the recipient accepts payment of the cost of the prescription.we reject this argument for four reasons.
first,such an interpretation of the tennessee statute is inconsistent with federal law and there is no indication that section b,as written and applied,does not comply with federal law.section b was avowedly adopted to comply with a a and.a provides in relevant part 
a for the purpose of assisting in the collection of medical support payments and other payments for medical care owed to recipients of medical assistance under the state plan approved under this subchapter,a state plan for medical assistance shall 
provide that,as a condition of eligibility for medical assistance under the state plan to an individual who has the legal capacity to execute an assignment for himself,the individual is required 
a to assign the state any rights,of the individual or of any other person who is eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter and on whose behalf the individual has the legal authority to execute an assignment of such rights,to support and to payment for medical care from any third party.
k a.thus,an individual assignment of rights to a state medicaid agency such as tenncare is a prerequisite or condition of eligibility for medical assistance under medicaid.because an assignment of an individual rights is a precondition to medicaid eligibility and the medicaid agency will only pay for a prescription on behalf of an individual if the individual is eligible for medicaid,the individual assignment of rights before medicaid makes a payment.see id.hence,caremark interpretation of the tennessee welfare statute that assignment does not occur until after medicaid pays for an individual pharmacy products is entirely incompatible with federal medicaid mandates.
second,caremark misconstrues the language of section b.essentially,caremark asks the court to read section b to mean that a recipient does not make an assignment of its rights to insurance benefits until tenncare makes a payment for a pharmacy product on behalf of the recipient.even assuming that in this context medical assistance means payment of care,services,or supplies,we are unpersuaded by caremark interpretation.contrary to caremark assertion,the plain language of the statute does not provide that a recipient can not assign his or her right until he or she accepts payment.rather,the statute states that u pon accepting medical assistance,the recipient shall be deemed to have made an assignment.ann.b.the fact that upon accepting payment,a recipient shall be deemed to have made an assignment does not necessarily preclude the possibility that assignment occurred at the,or,for that matter,at another point in time prior to payment by tenncare.see id.
third,any lingering confusion about the language of section b is promptly put to rest by reading the statute companion regulations.these regulations explicitly define the nature of a medicaid beneficiary assignment of rights,which are mandated by both federal and tennessee statutes.the assignment of benefits section of the regulations explicitly provides that a recipient assigns rights to medicaid when the recipient uses a medicaid card to receive medical assistance.comp.regs.a emphasis added.thus,the tennessee medicaid regulations unequivocally spell out that assignment of rights to medicaid is at the when a recipient uses a medicaid card to get prescription drugs.
fourth,the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,the federal agency charged with administering the medicaid statute,has interpreted the statute to mean that a benefic
