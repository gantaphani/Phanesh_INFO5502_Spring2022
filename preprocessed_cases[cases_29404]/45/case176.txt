this appeal concerns a claim for insurance coverage following a maritime loss.the matter was decided by the district judge adversely to the plaintiff,frank grande frank,on the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of plaintiff case during the trial before a jury.grande paul fire marine ins,d.we therefore recite the facts based upon the evidence offered by the plaintiff,drawing inferences in his favor.guilloty perez pierluisi,cir.
frank owned a catalina sailboat called aphrodite,based in maine.he had charter insurance for the vessel from paul fire marine insurance company,obtained through charter lakes marine insurance charter lakes,which was an authorized agent of paul.the latest version of the policy limited coverage to atlantic coastal waters of the united states between eastport,me and marys,ga,not more than miles from shore,coastal atlantic maine.
in spring,frank found a new sailboat,a irwin named gina,in miami,florida.his cousin,frank grande frank,paid for the vessel,on the understanding that frank would own and operate the vessel and eventually pay frank back the purchase price.frank planned to sail the gina from miami back up to maine and to use it in his charter business in place of the aphrodite.he contacted mark of charter lakes,requesting coverage for chartering the vessel in maine and for his trip from florida to maine.
on or about april,vanepps faxed an insurance quote and application to frank,who filled out the application,listing himself as owner and sole operator,and faxed it back to vanepps.the quote included trip coverage from florida to maine for a premium.according to frank,he told vanepps that he wanted to get the gina from florida to maine in a timely fashion and as the crow flies.
prior to frank departure from miami on may,vanepps reported by telephone to frank who had not yet received the new policy that he was now covered by paul and thus was good to go with the gina on his voyage to maine.on the trip to maine,the gina sought to evade bad weather near cape hatteras,adjusted her course southeast,and was to nautical miles from shore when frank and crew were rescued by the coast guard on may.the vessel,although later salvaged,was effectively a total loss.
after the incident,frank received a formal paul policy for the gina dated may,the day after he had called charter lakes to notify it of the loss,containing an endorsement covering the trip but also stating that the gina was covered only within miles from shore.when frank filed a claim with paul,it was rejected on the ground that the gina had been outside the limit when the loss occurred.
several months later,frank brought this diversity suit against paul and charter lakes in federal district court in maine.frank contract claim asserted insurance coverage.a separate negligence claim charged charter lakes with failing to procure the insurance that frank requested,and with failing to notify him of the supposed limit prior to his departure contrary to its alleged practice in prior dealings with frank.frank also asserted an estoppel claim arguing that paul was barred from denying coverage because of his justified reliance on their unreasonably misleading conduct.
the case was tried to a jury in april,but after the close of frank evidence,the district court granted judgment for the defendants as a matter of law.grande,d at.in substance,the court said that frank had failed to establish contract coverage for the trip he took that any insurance coverage he did procure was voidable because of the failure to disclose frank interest and that the negligence and estoppel claims foundered because of the and because frank had failed to show that anyone else would have insured him outside the limit.id.at.
on this appeal,review is de novo because the district court granted judgment as a matter of law,and we take frank evidence in the light most favorable to his case and assume credibility issues in his favor.guilloty perez,at.we accept the parties view that maine law applies except so far as it might be displaced by a governing federal rule applicable to maritime matters.see wilburn boat fireman fund ins.greenly mariner mgmt.group,cir.
we begin with frank contract theory,which,if successful,likely looks to liability of paul rather than charter lakes an agent who acts for a disclosed principal is not ordinarily party to the contract or liable for its breach by the principal.see county forest,green mountain agency,me.here,frank has not sought to recover on the policy as issued,regarding that avenue as blocked by the specific endorsement language excluding coverage beyond the limit.
instead,frank argues in substance that the contract in force during his trip was a temporary binder contract that filled the gap until a formal policy later issued,and that the formal policy misstated the coverage agreed to for the trip.this binder contract,in frank view,was formed by the exchanges between the parties,including vanepps ultimate good to go assertion,and does not incorporate any limit on the trip from florida to maine.according to frank testimony,he told vanepps that he was requesting trip insurance and vanepps told him after receiving the completed application back that he was covered.
frank testified that he told vanepps that he planned to travel from florida to maine in a straight line specifically,as the crow flies.during opening arguments,frank counsel stated that such a route would have taken frank outside of the limit although this statement itself was not evidence,united states rose,cir,cert.denied,d,frank later submitted into evidence a chart from which the jury could have determined that such a route would naturally have taken the gina outside of a limit between cape hatteras and maine.
frank further testified as to past practice in his dealings with charter lakes.he claimed that in the past,navigational limits for the aphrodite had been cited in charter lakes quote letter,and that the written binder issued thereafter had cited those same limits,which in turn were cited in the formally issued policy.frank testified that during his negotiations with vanepps,no navigational limit was mentioned by vanepps as to the trip from florida to maine.
in granting judgment for defendants as a matter of law,the district judge took the view that,under general law applicable to insurance,a temporary binder provides only that coverage that is common practice in the industry and that it was frank the claimant under a binder establish that such insurance could be procured from paul or others without a limit.grande,d at.admittedly,frank offered no evidence on this issue one way or the other.
case law does use common practice to fill in missing terms where,as is ordinarily the case,the binder arrangement is a temporary measure and contains little detail of its own.w hen a loss occurs after a binder has been issued,but before a policy is written,the insurer is bound to provide coverage in line with its standard policies referenced in the binder,or policies standard throughout the industry.pine ridge realty.bay ins,me citations omitted see also acadia ins.allied marine transp.llc,d.if frank binder claim rested on a general request for insurance followed by a standard binder commitment by vanepps,this would be a different case.
here,however,frank does not claim merely that he asked that insurance be switched from aphrodite to gina,which might easily be understood as importing the existing limit contained in the aphrodite policy or as compelling a search for common practice.rather,he testified that he also asked vanepps for coverage for the trip from florida to maine and that he told that the gina would follow the most direct course which a reasonable jury might on the chart submitted into take her more than miles offshore.
the common practice rule does not apply if a special agreement has been made in the course of contracting.acadia ins.allied marine transp.llc,d,the general rule regarding the terms of an oral binder or contract for temporary insurance pending issuance of a written policy consists,in the absence of a special agreement,of the usual provisions of contracts employed
