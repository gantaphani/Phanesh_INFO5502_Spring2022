prudential review for disability benefits 
jones worked for mountaire as a sales representative,selling animal feed products.he promoted sales to dealers and feeders within a region.his job included traveling frequently,attending trade shows,setting up displays for dealers,and conducting quarterly inventories.he also recommended proper feeds for animals,visited farms,and occasionally worked with large animals.his job required him to spend long hours on his feet,stoop,and lift and move to bags of a dusty,dirty environment.jones last day at mountaire was on september.
jones filed a claim for long term disability benefits on november,and indicated his job was sedentary.jones stated that he was unable to work because he had emphysema and could no longer work around dust and chemicals.mountaire completed an employer statement,which also stated that jones job was sedentary.
in november,the physician and surgeon filled out forms,certifying that jones could not return to work.the physician stated that stress and physical exertion would increase jones breathing problems and that jones was incapacitated and would likely worsen in the future.he diagnosed jones with progressive chronic emphysema and coronary artery disease.the physician noted,however,that jones had the functional ability to do sedentary work.the surgeon stated that due to progressive lung disease,jones should not do physical labor or be exposed to chemical agents.
prudential denied jones claim on december,based on the opinion of its nurse,nurse gillis,who reviewed jones medical records and found that the alleged disability lacked support.the nurse noted the lack of recent chest or pulmonary function tests to support the physician assertion that breathing problems rendered jones disabled and noted jones was stable from a cardiac standpoint.prudential explained that the medical records indicated no sudden worsening of his condition at the date of disability and that jones previously had worked despite his condition.
jones appealed the denial and submitted additional medical records.jones three treating doctors wrote letters stating that because of the combined effects of coronary artery disease and emphysema,jones was incapable of returning to work.the cardiologist opined that jones is totally disabled for performing anything more than the most sedentary type occupation.the physician stated that jones is totally and permanently disabled to hold gainful employment.the physician also placed restrictions on jones relating to standing,walking,lifting,climbing,balancing,kneeling,crawling,and reaching overhead,as well as restrictions relating to exposure to gas,dust,fumes,or changes in temperature.the surgeon opined that jones is presently incapacitated and likely will remain so in the future.
jones also submitted a job description showing that his job was not sedentary.the description indicated that jones duties included lifting up to bags of feed.mountaire also added duties to the job description visiting farms,handling large animals,and participating in quarterly inventories,which require standing,stooping,lifting,and moving inventory for hours in a dusty and dirty environment.
prudential rehabilitation specialist,chretien,reviewed jones job description and determined his regular occupation as defined by the plan.the rehabilitation specialist concluded that it was sales representative,products under the dot.the dot classified the job as light,which means the job includes the ability to exert up to twenty pounds of force occasionally and up to ten pounds of force frequently and to walk and stand for periods of time.
prudential medical director kowalski reviewed jones medical records and concluded that his medical history did not prevent jones from doing a job.prudential contacted jones and asked if there was any supplemental information.in response,the surgeon submitted an office visit note dated november.in it,the surgeon stated that jones has markedly improved from his first visit although he continues to have pleuritic type right chest wall pain,appears well and in no distress,and has rhythmic heart tones.finally,the surgeon stated that the chest today is satisfactory and showed marked resolution of his right upper lobe infiltrates noted earlier in june of this year.prudential also contacted jones to inquire about his heart treatment.jones responded that his last stress test was prior to his last day at work and that he had not seen his cardiologist since his surgery in october.
prudential claim manager furman summarized jones medical history and concluded that jones could perform light work.the claim manager noted specifically that jones cardiologist reported that jones had been doing well,that jones made no reports of shortness of breath,and that no diagnostic test results supported a finding of an impairment.on march,prudential notified jones that he did not meet the plan definition of disabled,based on mountaire job description and the dot definition of light work.
on march,jones appealed again,requesting that prudential look at jones actual job duties to make sure the chosen dot job title accurately portrayed his work requirements.jones noted that the dot job description did not reflect that he was exposed to various chemicals,frequently stooped,kneeled,and crouched,and lifted up to bags of feed.jones also requested an independent review by a specialist.jones included a copy of a treadmill stress test conducted earlier that month.the cardiologist final impression was that jones had a fair to poor exercise tolerance.jones also indicated he was having a breathing test performed that day.jones lastly requested that prudential contact jones treating doctors to receive a report on his physic
