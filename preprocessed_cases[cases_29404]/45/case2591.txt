an insurer and its insured,a homeowners association,settled disputed claims arising from the northridge earthquake,with the insurer paying million and the insured releasing the insurer from all claims or causes of action it had or may have arising out of its earthquake claim.two years later,the association sued the insurer,and still later discovered the limits of its insurance policy were almost million greater than had been represented by the insurer.the insurer insists that the association can not pursue its claim unless it rescinds the settlement agreement and returns the million,relying on supreme court precedents holding that a plaintiff can not avoid a fraudulently induced contract of release without rescinding the contract and restoring the money paid as a consideration for the release.garcia california truck cal,garcia.the association,which long ago used the million to repair earthquake damage,insists it has the option of affirming the settlement agreement and recovering damages for the fraud.see bagdasarian gragnon cal d.
we agree with the association,concluding that the supreme court precedents on which the insurer relies apply only to the release of personal injury claims,and not to the settlement and release of claims arising from a contract of insurance.accordingly,the trial court erred when it sustained the insurer demurrer on the ground the association could not have it both ways by keeping the settlement monies but not releasing the claims.
factual and procedural background 
this is the second time this case has come to the court of appeal.
the lawsuit arose from the northridge earthquake in january,and was filed in december,after the legislature revived insurance claims otherwise barred by the statute of limitations.village northridge homeowners association the association or the insured sued state farm fire and casualty company state farm or the insurer,alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the complaint alleged state farm improperly undervalued the association loss,inducing it to forego proper repairs and to forego payment of amounts properly owed under the policy.the association further alleged it was required to sign a release and did so under compulsion and with no other option afforded to secure partial benefits owed,and that it did not agree that the partial payments provided fully compensated the association for the actual damages and loss sustained 
previous trial court proceedings and appeal.
state farm filed a motion for summary judgment,contending the release the association executed barred its lawsuit.state farm declarations asserted,among other things,that the policy limits for earthquake damage were,with a deductible of ten percent,but it submitted no documentary confirmation of the policy limits.state farm made various payments,totaling approximately,and in the association sought additional policy benefits.state farm reomspected the property and determined that a portion of the claimed additional damage might be earthquake related and that a portion was not.in november,the parties negotiated a compromise of the claim,agreeing to payment by state farm of million.the association unconditionally released state farm from all claims,known or unknown,in any way related to the association earthquake claim.in late,the association contacted state farm to reopen the claim,and state farm declined to do so.
in its opposition to state farm summary judgment motion,the association asserted that the insurance contract provided a limit of with a percent deductible,and that state farm misrepresented its policy limits to the association in the course of adjusting the claim and inducing the execution of the release.a declaration from an association board member who signed the release stated that state farm offer was made in conjunction with overt representations,written and oral,that the policy limits were at the time,we had no idea that this representation regarding policy limits was untrue and we executed the subject release under the mistaken belief that state farm had honestly and accurately represented its policy limits to us.state farm million offer was made on a take it or leave it basis,and was not the product of any negotiation.the association was upside down financially and simply had no choice but to do whatever state farm insisted in order to at least secure a portion of the policy benefits that were owed and to partially fund the massive earthquake repairs that were presented.homeowners were individually assessed thousands of dollars to partially fund repairs but millions of dollars of further repairs remain to be performed at this time.with the declaration,the association submitted a copy of the policy declarations that was recently retrieved from storage from our property manager it showed policy limits of for buildings,an earthquake endorsement and percent earthquake deductible,and no indication of any different policy limits for earthquake coverage.
the trial court granted summary judgment for state farm,ruling the association had not demonstrated the release agreement was a product of undue influence or fraud,and that it was binding on the parties.
this court reversed the judgment,concluding material issues of disputed fact existed concerning the limits of the earthquake policy and whether the policy limits were misrepresented by the insurer during the adjustment process.village northridge homeowners association state farm fire casualty,nonpub.opn.because a resolution of these issues was necessary to a determination whether the insured release was valid and enforceable,we held summary judgment was improper.
current trial court proceedings.
when the case was returned to the trial court,state farm filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.state farm asserted the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted,because the association claims were barred by the settlement agreement and release,and the association could not rescind the settlement agreement without first offering to restore to state farm the consideration it paid under the agreement.the trial court granted the motion,with leave to amend,observing that the complaint did not allege fraud in the inducement or rescission,and that the association need s to either rescind the agreement or affirm the agreement and sue for damages.
the association then filed a first amended complaint,alleging a cause of action for fraud in addition to its original claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the association alleged it had spent the million on partial earthquake repairs and was not offering to return the million acknowledged a credit in that amount in state farm favor against the damages sought in the lawsuit did not seek to rescind the release and affirm ed the release,as requested by the court,and sought damages,contending the release was unenforceable as the product of fraud.
state farm demurred,asserting,inter alia,that the association could not affirm the settlement agreement and simultaneously assert claims that were explicitly released in it.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,stating that the association must either rescind the settlement agreement and release or affirm the settlement agreement and release,and that h ere,the release was the purpose of the settlement agreement and they are all part of the same agreement,citing garcia,supra,cal.
the association filed a second amended complaint,which was not significantly different from the first,alleging the million was a grossly deficient,partial payment toward an million loss the million was owed under the insurance policy independent of the release and the court had the inherent power to set aside a release procured by fraud.state farm again demurred.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,observing the association chose to affirm the settlement agreement and keep the money paid by state farm,but not to release the claims,and t hey ca have it both ways.
judgment was entered and the association filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
state farm contends the association only option under california law for avoiding its release was to rescind the settlement agreement and return the million to state farm,and it can not keep the money and sue.while the question is not without difficulty,we conclude that,in the circumstances of this case,state farm is mistaken.
in garcia,supra,cal,the supreme court made it clear that rescission is essential to the extinguishment of a contract of release in a personal injury case,and that there can be no rescission without restoration of the consideration.this is not,however,a personal injury case,in which the only purpose of the releasee payment is to obtain a release from an inchoate tort claim.this is an insurance contract case,in which the had an underlying contractual obligation to pay for damage to the insured dwellings caused by earthquake,and in addition a statutory obligation not to misrepresent the terms of its policy see.under these particularly where the consideration received by the releasor was long ago expended to repair the very damage the contracted to conclude garcia does not prevent the insured from avoiding the release without returning the consideration for which it was given.
we briefly describe the legal principles and precedents that inform our conclusion.two general principles are relevant.the first is the garcia principle that a plaintiff in a personal injury case can not avoid a fraudulently induced contract of release without rescinding the contract and restoring the money paid as a consideration for the release.garcia,supra,cal.at.the second is the more general principle that,if a defrauded party is induced by false representations to execute a contract,the party has the option of rescinding the contract and restoring any consideration received under it,or affirming the contract and recovering damages for the fraud.bagdasarian gragnon,supra,cal d at,hines brode cal.we conclude the second,more general,principle applies here,permitting the association to affirm the settlement agreement and recover damages for the fraud.
initially,we note our recognition of the apparent incongruity,noted by the trial court,in affirming a contract and yet avoiding one of its principal terms the release.the incongruity,however,is not as severe as may first appear.indeed,because of the underlying insurance obligation,the circumstance is not unlike both cases in which a settlement agreement and the mutual releases in it are considered separable,thus permitting the plaintiff to affirm the settlement and sue for fraud despite the release persson smart inventions,th,d,or cases,as described in garcia,applying the rule that one who rescinds a contract for fraud is not required to restore that which in any event he would be entitled to retain.garcia,supra,cal.at.while neither principle fits perfectly,either is more appropriately applied to a case in which an insurer has misrepresented policy limits to obtain a settlement than is a principle that requires the return of the insurance settlement monies as the price of a challenge to the insurer fraud.we turn to a review of the cases and state farm contentions.
garcia and taylor are not controlling.
state farm argues that garcia and a similar case,taylor hopper cal,taylor,control.in taylor,the supreme court held that the remedy of affirming a compromise agreement,retaining the money received under it,and suing for fraud does not exist in a case such as we are considering.taylor,supra,cal.at.but taylor,like garcia,was considering a personal injury case,in which plaintiff was run over by defendants automobile and released her claim in a compromise agreement.taylor concluded the affirm and sue remedy did not exist because t he difficulty in determining the amount of damages is insurmountable.ibid.the court explained 
if the jury found a fraud had been committed upon plaintiff to induce her to give up her cause of action,how would it determine what amount,if any,she would have received from another jury had she not compromised her action,but had proceeded to trial and how could damages in the instant case be assessed without some measure of what would have been accorded to plaintiff in the original action had she proceeded to trial in case the right of action had no value,she had gained by the transaction and was not injured.it had no value whatever if the true state of facts disclosed that it was an invalid and claim,or,in other words,that the defendant was not negligent an alleged value of the claim based upon facts sufficient to warrant the reasonable belief of the plaintiff that she had a just claim is of a nature too speculative and wagering to be recognized by the law in this action for fraud.taylor,supra,cal.at,italics omitted,quoting urtz new york central.
the court concluded the compromise was of a disputed claim,unliquidated in amount and there is no practicable measure of damages for the action sought to be maintained.taylor,supra,cal.at.
state farm insists garcia and taylor are not archaic decisions,and that their holdings comport with common sense and the strong policy in favor of settlement.while we do not disagree with these sentiments,we can not agree that the principle applies to the settlement of a claim grounded upon an insurance contract.indeed,taylor itself demonstrates that a personal injury settlement is very different from an insurance settlement.the principal difference,of course,is the existence of an underlying liability.in taylor or any other personal injury claim,there may or may not be a valid negligence claim and underlying liability on the part of the defendant.taylor,supra,cal.at,the claim had no value whatever if the true state of facts disclosed that it was an invalid and claim,or,in other words,that the defendant was not negligent.in an insurance settlement,by contrast,there is necessarily an underlying liability on the part of the insurer.while the scope of the insurer liability may be subject to dispute,the existence of its contractual obligation to pay for earthquake repairs is not.in other words,there is no question that state farm actually owed the association some amount of money for earthquake damage and was willing to pay million to settle that obligation.this is far different from the tort claim context,in which liability for payment of the claim may or may not exist.
other precedents confirm the distinction between release of a personal injury claim and settlement of an insurance claim.
the circumstances of this case are not unlike those in rescission cases where courts have applied an exception to the rule requiring restoration of the consideration paid a restoration is not necessary,in order to avoid the bar of a release,where there is no question as to the right of the plaintiff,arising independently of the release itself,to retain what he received.sime malouf d,r escission and restoration are required only under equitable principles and to prevent the taking of unfair advantage see denevi lgcc,llc th,d victim of fraud can not be required to undo the transaction in its entirety he has the right to retain the benefits of the contract,and make up in damages the loss suffered by the fraud he may affirm the contract,and simply sue for damages for the fraud.this case,of course,is not a rescission case,and would not in any event fit precisely into the exception because,as state farm points out,the amount of the claim settled for million was disputed by state farm,and it may be that the association was not entitled to the entire amount.nonetheless,because it was entitled to at least some portion of that amount,the exception to the restoration rule demonstrates that the rule in personal injury cases should not automatically be applied in other particularly in the context of a fraudulently induced insurance settlement 
state farm contends that if a plaintiff can settle a disputed claim,keep the money paid and then sue on the released claim,no defendant would pay to settle a disputed claim,and all settlements of actual or threatened litigation can be rendered meaningless.state farm both misstates its premise and exaggerates the consequences.correctly st
