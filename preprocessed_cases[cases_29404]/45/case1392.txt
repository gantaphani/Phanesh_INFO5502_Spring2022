metropolitan life insurance company metlife filed an interpleader action,requesting the district court to designate the proper beneficiary of jimmie johnson life insurance policy.the district court ruled in favor of lashanda smith,leonard smith and carolyn hall,and the insured former wife,mildred johnson,appeals.we affirm.
jimmie johnson was an employee of general electric ge from until his death on february.during his employment,he was a participant in the ge life,disability and medical plan the plan,an employee welfare benefit plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.ge funded the plan through an insurance policy issued by metlife.johnson had in life insurance as of the date of his death.the plan provides that the life insurance benefits will be paid to the beneficiary designated by the insured.
on october,johnson designated his mildred johnson as sole beneficiary of the plan.several years later,jimmie and mildred divorced.on approximately december,johnson completed a beneficiary designation form,naming lashanda smith,leonard smith and carolyn hall jointly referred to as ss h as the form contained a number of errors.first,johnson checked the box for ge s sp life insurance plan.however,he was never enrolled in that plan rather,he should have checked the box for ge life or ge leadership life insurance plan.also,johnson listed his mother address instead of his own.finally,he indicated on the form that he was separated from his wife,mildred,rather than divorced.
when johnson died on february,ge informed mildred that she was the beneficiary of his life insurance policy,and she filed a beneficiary claim.subsequently,on march,lashanda smith sent ge a letter stating that she was aware that her father had made her the only primary beneficiary to receive his life insurance benefits and inquiring how to receive those proceeds.in her letter,she stated that,in late,she and her brother had signed a change of beneficiary form,and that,in january,her father had received confirmation of the change of beneficiary.metlife claimed to have no record of the change of beneficiary designation and requested lashanda to provide documentation of the change.she provided a copy of the form and a copy of a letter sent to jimmie johnson from the general electric enrollment center dated january.in this letter,ge confirms receipt of johnson completed beneficiary designation form.however,the letter did not refer to a particular plan,nor did it indicate the identity of the newly designated beneficiaries 
in response to the multiple claims to the proceeds of johnson life insurance policy,metlife filed an interpleader action,requesting the court to determine who was properly entitled to the proceeds after mildred johnson and carolyn hall filed answers,all parties moved for summary judgment,agreeing that the sole issue was whether johnson had executed a valid change of beneficiary form in.the court denied mildred motion and granted summary judgment to ss h,concluding that the form evidenced jimmie johnson intent to change his beneficiary from mildred to ss h and that he substantially complied with the requirements of the plan in doing so.mildred johnson appeals.
standard of review 
we conduct de novo review of a district court decision involving for summary judgment.ozlowski henderson,cir quoting excel,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.with,our review of the record requires that we construe all inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made,at.accordingly,we review the record in the light most favorable to mildred johnson,viewing all of the facts,and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts,in her favor and reversing if we find a genuine issue concerning any fact that might affect the outcome of the case.id.however,the mere existence of an alleged factual dispute is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.vukadinovich board of sch.tr.of north newton sch,cir.
while we must construe the facts in favor of mildred,that,however,does not diminish her responsibility to present those facts in the manner dictated by local court rules.the local rules of the northern district of illinois require a moving party to submit,with its summary judgment motion,a statement of material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue and that entitle the moving party to a judgment as a matter of law.local a.this statement shall consist of short,numbered paragraphs,including within each paragraph specific references to the affidavits,parts of the record,and other supporting materials relied upon to support the facts set forth in that paragraph.id.at a.the opposing party must also submit a statement responding to each numbered paragraph of the moving party statement,likewise supporting any disagreement with references to the record.id.at b a.all supported facts set forth in a moving party rule statement will be deemed admitted unless controverted by the opposing party.id.at a.
in this case,mildred failed to follow the procedures set forth by local rule.mildred filed her summary judgment motion without the required statement,although her motion did include a section entitled facts.this section was not delineated into separate numbered paragraphs.she later filed an amended statement of material facts,which is structured in separately numbered paragraphs,but many paragraphs lack any reference to relevant portions of the record.however,ss h fared no better.they did not file a statement with their motion for summary judgment,and in responding to johnson statement,they,in many cases,also failed to make references to the record.but then,mildred never responded to ss h statement.the district court,faced with this of factual and often unsupported assertions,accepted those facts that both parties admitted were uncontroverted.the court also deemed admitted any facts supported with citations to the record set forth in mildred statement,where ss h stated they had insufficient knowledge to admit or deny the facts.the court then disregarded the statements set forth in ss h statement unless admitted by mildred.this resulted in a version of the facts that is perhaps not as favorable to mildred as it could have been had she followed the local rules.but,we have emphasized the importance of local rules and have consistently and repeatedly upheld a district court discretion to require strict compliance with its local rules governing summary judgment.bordelon chicago sch.reform bd.of trustees,cir upholding the district court decision to strike response in its entirety rather than selectively due to failure to comply with local rules.
in this case,mildred failure to comply with the local rules resulted in several significant factual assumptions.for instance,ss h attached ge letter to their summary judgment motion and to their response to mildred summary judgment motion,without properly authenticating the document in any way.however,mildred then referred to the letter in her response to ss h summary judgment motion,without contesting its admissibility.thus,the district court properly treated the letter as an uncontested fact even though it was not properly authenticated or contained within ss h rule statement.additionally,and more damaging to mildred case,she did not properly contest the change of beneficiary form.that form was initially offered into evidence by metlife as an exhibit to the interpleader action.it was then submitted by mildred in her motion for summary judgment and by ss h in their own motion for summary judgment.not one party sought to properly authenticate the form.while mildred attempted to cast doubt on the form validity through conclusory arguments,she did not present any evidence in her own rule statement to challenge it nor did she object to its admissibility given her failure to adequately dispute the possible factual issues surrounding the authenticity of the letter or the form,the district court properly concluded that the factual assertions contained in those documents were undisputed.
applicable law 
preemption.
consequently,the only issue before us is whether,as a matter of law,johnson effectively changed his beneficiary designation by executing the form.under erisa,a beneficiary is a person designated by a participant,or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.the terms of the plan,in part i c entitled,designation of beneficiary,provide in relevant part 
in the event of your death from any cause,the amount of your life insurance then in force will be payable to the beneficiary designated by you.you may change your beneficiary at any time.any designation of beneficiary or any change of beneficiary should be made in a form acceptable to the carrier and must be filed with the records maintained by your employee relations or personnel accounting office upon receipt of written notice of change of beneficiary by such office,the change shall relate back and take effect as of the date you signed such written notice,whether or not you are living at the time of such receipt emphasis added.
here,johnson attempted to designate ss h as his beneficiaries by executing the form and,according to the letter from the ge enrollment center to johnson,that form was filed and accepted by his employer.nevertheless,it is undisputed that johnson made several errors in executing the form.thus,the question before us is whether the beneficiary change form was effective,notwithstanding those errors.
to address this issue,we must first determine the controlling law.as noted,the plan is governed by erisa.however,erisa does not contain any provisions governing disputes between claimants to plan proceeds,or addressing whether an insured has effectively changed a beneficiary designation.phoenix mut.life ins.adams,cir.thus,mildred advocates that we apply the illinois doctrine of substantial compliance,relying on the principle enunciated in john hancock mut.life ins.harris trust sav.bank,d,that erisa leaves room for complementary or dual federal and state regulation.ss h,on the other hand,argue that erisa preempts state law and,therefore,urge us to apply federal common law to resolve the dispute 
generally,erisa preempts all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan which is subject to erisa.see a.the supreme court has set forth a inquiry for determining whether a state law relates to an employee benefit plan for purposes of a.according to the court,a state law relates to an erisa plan if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d citations omitted.a state law has reference to an erisa plan where it acts immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans,or where the existence of erisa plans is essential to the law operation.dillingham,at.the illinois doctrine of substantial compliance applies generally to life insurance policy beneficiary designations,see dooley,at,and accordingly does not have reference to an erisa plan for purposes of preemption.therefore,the only issue is whether the substantial compliance doctrine as applied in this case has a connection with erisa.
in egelhoff,the supreme court recently addressed whether a state law had a connection with erisa when it analyzed whether a washington statute providing for automatic revocation,upon divorce,of any designation of spouse as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy was preempted,as it applied to erisa plans.see egelhoff egelhoff,d.the court stated that,to determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection,we look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.id.at.citation omitted.applying this principle,the supreme court concluded that the washington statute in question had an impermissible connection with erisa plans because it purported to bind erisa plan administrators to a particular choice of rules for determining beneficiary status.the administrators must pay benefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state law,rather than to those identified in the plan documents.id.specifically,the supreme court found that the washington statute ran contrary to the erisa provisions that a plan shall specify the basis on which payments are made to and from the plan,b,and that the fiduciary shall administer the plan in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan,a d,making payments to a beneficiary who is designated by a participant,or by the terms of the plan.id.at.the supreme court criticized the washington statute as one which governs the payment of benefits,a central matter of plan administration,id.at.in contrast,the court has upheld generally applicable laws where erisa has nothing to say notwithstanding their incidental effect on erisa plans.id.at.
we have not directly addressed the precise issue of whether erisa preempts a state substantial compliance doctrine because the doctrine relates to an erisa plan other circuits have had occasion to do so,and their conclusions are split.for instance,the ninth circuit recently concluded that erisa did not preempt the state doctrine of substantial compliance because it would not affect the administration of the plan,but would merely aid in determining the identity of the proper recipient of the proceeds.bankamerica pension plan mcmath,cir,cert.denied,mcmath montgomery,d.see also peckham gem state mut.of utah,cir state law doctrine of substantial compliance does not materially modify a plan,but rather is simply a doctrine to assist the court in determining whether conduct should,in reality,be considered the equivalent of compliance under the contract.
in contrast,the fourth circuit,while agreeing that the doctrine of substantial compliance did not modify a plan,nevertheless concluded that the state law relates to such a plan because it involved the designation of the beneficiary of an erisa plan.phoenix,at.accordingly,the court concluded that erisa preempted the state law doctrine,and adopted the district court formulation of the following federal common law test an insured substantially complies with the change of beneficiary provisions of an erisa life insurance policy when the insured evidences his or her intent to make the change and attempts to effectuate the change by undertaking positive action which is for all practical purposes similar to the action required by the change of beneficiary provisions of the policy.id.at relying upon established south carolina law to formulate test.see also tinsley general motors,cir in interpleader action to determine legitimacy of beneficiary designation under life insurance policy,erisa preempted state law however,court looked to michigan state law to formulate federal common law test for analyzing beneficiary designations that are allegedly the result of forgery or undue influence.
given the supreme court latest word on erisa preemption in egelhoff,we believe that a state law affecting the designation of a beneficiary is sufficiently related to an erisa plan such that a state law doctrine of substantial compliance is preempted by erisa.thus,we find the fourth circuit decision in phoenix mutual persuasive and believe this conclusion is consistent with our own precedent.see maclean ford motor,cir in determining proper beneficiary of pension plan,where indiana testamentary transfer law,if applied,would determine the distribution under the plan,erisa preempted state law.under an erisa plan,benefits must be paid to a beneficiary who is designated by a participant,or by the terms of the plan.the plan administrator determination,and a court interpretation,of the identity of that beneficiary clearly relates to erisa insofar as it governs the payment of benefits,a central matter of plan administration.egelhoff,at.egelhoff stands for the proposition that a state law can not invalidate an erisa plan beneficiary designation by mandating distribution to another person.similarly to the operation of the washington statute und
