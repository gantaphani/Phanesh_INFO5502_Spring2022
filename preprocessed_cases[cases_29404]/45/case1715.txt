we review de novo the district court application of state law to the issues in this diversity case.ryan schneider carriers,cir.the insurers argue that missouri revised statute section and missouri rule of civil procedure b mandate the payment of attorneys fees and costs to a garnishee when a garnishor unsuccessfully attempts to garnish property in the hands of the garnishee.the lancasters do not dispute that the statute and rule mandate an award of fees and costs in garnishment actions but argue that this was not actually a garnishment action.though styled as such,the lancasters argue that this was in effect a direct action brought under missouri revised statute section,and that the garnishment rules do not apply to that type of action.the lancasters rely on wood,as did the district court.
the wood case was originally brought as a garnishment action pursuant to chapter to execute on insurance proceeds held by the insurer of a tortfeasor against whom the plaintiff had received a judgment.the parties did not dispute the propriety of using a garnishment proceeding to execute on insurance proceeds.though not raised by the parties,the court of appeals determined that the action was actually one under section rather than the general garnishment statute.the court reasoned that section was the exclusive method whereby a judgment creditor could judicially enforce payment of insurance proceeds owed to the judgment debtor.wood,at.thus,the court of appeals held that the insurer was not entitled to attorneys fees or costs under rule because rule does not apply to section actions.id.at.another missouri court of appeals case from a different district had previously held,directly to the contrary,that an insurer was entitled to attorneys fees under the garnishment rules when it successfully defended against a garnishment action.see nicely.the supreme court of missouri has not been faced with the specific issue of whether section is a judgment creditor exclusive remedy for obtaining insurance proceeds from the judgment debtor insurer,or whether a judgment creditor may still bring a chapter ordinary garnishment proceeding against an insurer.

in,the missouri legislature enacted what is now section,which in relevant part provides that 
u pon the recovery of a final judgment against any person for loss or damage on account of bodily injury or death,or damage to property if the defendant in such action was insured against said loss,the judgment creditor shall be entitled to have the insurance money,and if the judgment is not satisfied within thirty days after the date when it is rendered,the judgment creditor may proceed in equity against the defendant and the insurance company to reach and apply the insurance money 
prior to the enactment of this statute,insurance companies often included no action clauses in their contracts,which provided that the insurance company was not liable under the contract until the insured actually paid the judgment.thus,the insurer avoided liability on the judgment and was not subject to garnishment unless the judgment debtor first paid the judgment.schott cont l auto ins.underwriters.it also had not infrequently happened that an insolvent insured,after incurring liability,effected a collusive settlement with the insurer and canceled his policy in order to thwart the collection of a judgment against him through garnishment of the insurance money.id.at.the supreme court of missouri determined that the legislature passed the act to regulate the payment under insurance contracts.id.the statute was enacted to provide an equitable remedy where the insurer would otherwise be able to stymie the judgment creditor available legal remedy with a craftily written contract.see id.the remedy provided for in the act is one which may be invoked by a judgment creditor when the property and funds,including choses in action,of the judgment debtor can not be reached by execution,and when execution can not be otherwise satisfied.
