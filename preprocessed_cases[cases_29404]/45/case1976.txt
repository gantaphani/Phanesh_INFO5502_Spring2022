plaintiffs are three insurance companies and one trade organization of insurance companies who do business in california.they sued the california commissioner of insurance commissioner seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to bar enforcement of the holocaust victim insurance relief act of hvira,cal.the district court issued a preliminary injunction after ruling that plaintiffs had established a likelihood of irreparable harm and a probability of success on the merits of the questions whether hvira violates the commerce clause and whether it violates the federal government foreign affairs power.the commissioner brings this appeal.we leave the preliminary injunction in place,but for reasons different than those expressed by the district court.
factual and procedural history 
hvira requires insurers that do business in california and that sold insurance policies,in effect between and policies,to persons in europe to file certain information about those policies with the commissioner cal.a.the reporting requirement also applies to insurance companies that do business in california and are related to a company that sold policies,even if the relationship arose after the policies were issued.id.a related company is any parent,subsidiary,reinsurer,successor in interest,managing general agent,or affiliate company of the insurer.id.b.hvira requires the commissioner to store the information in a public holocaust era insurance registry.id.the commissioner must suspend the certificate of authority to conduct insurance business in the state of any insurer that fails to comply with hvira reporting requirements.id.
plaintiffs filed four separate actions against the commissioner,in which they sought to enjoin enforcement of hvira.the actions were brought by gerling global reinsurance of america and its affiliates collectively,gerling,who are,according to their complaint,arguably affiliated with or related to two german insurers that issued policies american insurance association aia,a nonprofit trade association of insurers whose are required to report under hvira,and american company,a wholly owned subsidiary of a german corporation that has investment interests in european insurance companies that do issue insurance policies winterthur international america insurance company,its affiliates,and numerous other insurance and underwriting companies collectively,winterthur,who are arguably related companies with more than forty insurance companies currently located in europe and assicurazioni generali generali,an italian insurance company that issued policies and currently does business in california.the district court determined that the four cases were related within the meaning of eastern district of california local rule a and assigned the cases to the same judge,but did not consolidate them.
plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming that hvira violates the commerce clause,the due process clause,the equal protection clause,and the foreign affairs power.gerling also asked the court to review two statutes that were enacted at the same time as hvira california code of civil procedure,which allows california residents to bring claims for the payment of insurance policies and extends the statute of limitations on such claims until december,and california insurance code,which requires the commissioner to suspend the certificate of authority of any insurer who has failed to pay on valid policies.the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss in which he argued that gerling did not have standing to challenge california code of civil procedure or california insurance code.the district court granted the motion,ruling that gerling had not established an imminent threat of prosecution under those statutes.gerling does not challenge that holding.
plaintiffs all filed motions for a preliminary injunction.the district court granted their motions,holding that plaintiffs have established a probability of success under the foreign affairs doctrine and the commerce clause.the court did not rule on plaintiffs other grounds for relief.the district court also held that plaintiffs had established the likelihood of irreparable injury.
the commissioner timely appealed the district court orders in all four cases.we have jurisdiction under a.because these cases all involve the same legal issues,we consider them together.
standard of review 
we review for abuse of discretion the grant of a preliminary injunction.fdic garner,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.roe anderson,cir.
discussion 
a.the standard for issuing a preliminary injunction 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,a party must establish either probable success on the merits and irreparable injury,or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make the case a fair ground for litigation with the balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.baby tam city of las vegas,cir.the two alternatives represent two points on a sliding scale.roe,at.the district court held that plaintiffs actions fell within the first category.the commissioner does not dispute the district court finding of irreparable injury rather,he questions whether the district court abused its discretion in ruling that plaintiffs established a probability of success on the merits.
the district court reasoning implies that plaintiffs demonstrated a probability of success on their claim that hvira is unconstitutional on its face.the court did not make individualized findings of irreparable injury,nor did it discuss either constitutional claim in the context of a particular plaintiff.as presented in this appeal,plaintiffs challenges to hvira involve issues of law only.
b.the commerce clause claim 
as noted,the district court held that plaintiffs established a probability of success that hvira violates the commerce clause.we disagree and hold that the district court based its conclusion on an erroneous view of the law.
the act,mccarran act 
in united states underwriters ass n,the supreme court held that the business of insurance fell within congress power to regulate interstate commerce.that holding conflicted with the previous understanding of the relationship between the business of insurance and the commerce clause before,the court had implied that the states could regulate the insurance industry without federal interference.see prudential ins.benjamin.discussing the history of insurance regulation and the commerce clause.
the mccarran act was congress response.id.title,of the mccarran act states 
congress hereby declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several states of the business of insurance is in the public interest,and that silence on the part of the congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several states.
section a provides that the business of insurance shall be subject to the laws of the several states which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business.the phrase business of insurance refers to the relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder and includes the fixing of rates,t he selling and advertising of policies,and the licensing of companies and their agents.sec national,d citations omitted.
the mccarran act applies to hvira 
plaintiffs argue,and the district court held,that the mccarran act does not apply to hvira because it is an impermissible extraterritorial regulation,as discussed by the supreme court in ftc travelers health ass n,d,and by this court in ace check cashing,aetna casualty surety in re insurance antitrust litigation,cir,aff in part,rev in part sub nom.hartford fire ins.california,d.neither travelers nor in re insurance applies to the present dispute,however.
travelers and in re insurance involved the interpretation of b of the mccarran act,which instructs courts not to construe any other federal statute as preempting a state insurance regulation unless there is a clear statement from congress to do so.section b reads in part no act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance.section b also provides that the sherman act,the clayton act,and the federal trade commission ftc act do apply to the business of insurance,but only to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law.
the supreme court in travelers and this court in in re insurance held that congress did not intend to shield an insurance company from federal regulation if one state expressly regulated an insurance company conduct,but the conduct that the federal government sought to regulate occurred in a different state.in travelers,a nebraska statute prohibited nebraska insurance corporations from engaging in unfair trade practices in any other state.at.a nebraska insurance corporation argued that the nebraska statute precluded the ftc,under b of the mccarran act,from regulating conduct of the insurance corporation that occurred outside nebraska.the supreme court disagreed,concluding that congress did not intend for the law of a single state to take from the residents of every other state the protection of the ftc act.id.at.
the court observed that congress had delegated its power to regulate insurance because it believed that insurance regulation was a local matter.id.at.the court reasoned that the insurance company argument would subvert the mccarran act if one state had a statute that purported to regulate nationwide,an insurance company located there would be free from the reach of the ftc act in every other state.the court interpretation of b avoided this absurd result.
similarly,in in re insurance,this court applied travelers to reject the notion that congress intended for the antitrust law of a single state to preclude application of the sherman act to insurers conduct that occurred in other states.in re insurance,at.we noted that s tate insurance schemes do not,and could not,purport to regulate the bulk of international insurance transactions.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in neither case did the court evaluate the constitutionality under the commerce clause of the state act that attempted to regulate extraterritorially.instead,both cases involved statutory interpretation.the courts merely held that,irrespective of the constitutional limits of a state power to regulate extraterritorially,congress did not intend for the regulatory scheme of one state to protect the citizens of all other states and thereby eliminate the need for federal regulation.
there is a second important distinction between the two cited cases and the present dispute the difference between hvira and the state laws considered in travelers and in re insurance.in those cases,the state laws sought to regulate directly the conduct of an insurer in another jurisdiction.by contrast,hvira seeks only to obtain information about conduct in another jurisdiction,without affecting directly any of that conduct.for those two reasons,neither travelers nor in re insurance answers the question that we face.
the district court holding that the mccarran act does not apply to hvira also rested on its belief that hvira must be viewed as a part of california overall plan to force foreign insurance companies to settle insurance claims with california residents.the district court cited hvira legislative findings and declarations and held that hvira encourages the resolution of claims concerning policies through an international process and thus attempts to regulate the decision making authority of european insurance companies to pay or not to pay claims on european policies.that reasoning mischaracterizes hvira as a matter of law.
hvira,by its terms,does not regulate the decision making authority of european insurance companies to pay or not to pay claims on european policies in any way.hvira requires california companies only to provide information about insurance policies that they or any of their affiliates issued.
a second and separate statute,california code of civil procedure,allows california residents to bring claims for payment of insurance policies.a third statute,california insurance code,authorizes the commissioner to suspend the licenses of insurance companies who have not paid valid claims.the district court dismissed gerling action challenging the validity of those two provisions because gerling lacked standing.in short,the question of the validity of those two statutes must remain for another day.
it is true that,by enacting hvira,california legislature intended to help california residents recover on unpaid policies that were entered into in foreign countries by giving them access to information.it also is likely that california legislature simply intended to protect its residents from insurance companies that have not paid valid insurance claims in any event,however,the legislature stated purpose in enacting a statute is not dispositive of a dormant commerce clause challenge.the commerce clause seeks to prevent extraterritorial economic effects,not purposes.see healy beer institute,d the critical inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the state.extraterritorial regulation is invalid regardless of the intent of the enacting legislature.emphasis added birth hope adoption agency,arizona health care cost containment,cir the first step in evaluating state regulatory measures under the dormant commerce clause is to determine whether it regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce,or discriminates against interstate commerce.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
hvira reporting requirements might force a related company of a california business to search for information,but that is the extent of hvira extraterritorial reach.hvira,on its face,does not regulate foreign insurance policies,or control the substantive conduct of a foreign insurer,or otherwise affect the business of insurance in any other country.
in conclusion,congress has expressly delegated to the states the power to regulate insurance,free from the constraints of the dormant commerce clause.the supreme court has noted that the licensing of companies is part of the business of insurance and is covered by the mccarran act national,at.hvira is a california insurance regulation of california insurance companies that affects foreign commerce only indirectly.consequently,the mccarran act applies and the dormant commerce clause does not.see benjamin,at.noting that congress,through the mccarran act,clearly put the full weight of its power behind existing and future state legislation to sustain it from any attack under the commerce clause to whatever extent this may be done with the force of that power behind it,subject only to the exceptions expressly provided for.
hvira does not impede the federal government ability to speak with one voice on a matter affecting foreign commerce 
hvira touches on foreign commerce because of the indirect effect described above.the question remains whether that fact provides an independent reason to hold that plaintiffs have established a probability that hvira is unconstitutional.the answer is no.
the supreme court confronted a similar issue in barclays bank plc franchise tax board,d.there,the court considered whether california tax system violated the dormant commerce clause.the supreme court,after noting that the california tax was constitutional under typical dormant commerce clause analysis,evaluated whether the tax effect on foreign commerce impaired the federal government ability to speak with one voice.id.at.the court held that it did not.id.
the court noted that congress had considered,and eventually rejected,legislation that would have precluded state statutes like the one in dispute in barclays.id.at.the court reasoned that congress was willing to tolerate the states tax statutes.id.at.significantly,the court then observed that the foreign policy of the united states is much more the province of the executive branch and congress than of this court therefore,the foreign companies argument that the california statute is unconstitutional because it is likely to provoke retaliatory action by foreign governments is directed to the wrong forum.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
similarly,in wardair canada,florida department of revenue,d,the court evaluated whether a florida tax on airline fuel,which increased the tax liability of foreign airlines,prevented the federal government from speaking with one voice.the court concluded that the florida tax did not violate the commerce clause.id.at.the federal government had entered into more than bilateral aviation agreements,none of which purported to preclude the type of tax enacted by florida.the court reasoned by negative implication,the united states has at least acquiesced in the type of statute enacted by florida.id.at.moreover,i t would turn dormant commerce clause analysis upside down to apply it where the federal government has acted,and to apply it in such a way as to reverse the policy that the federal government has elected to follow t he federal government is entitled in its wisdom to act to permit the states varying degrees of regulatory authority.id.emphasis in original.
barclays and wardair canada teach that,before we can hold that an otherwise constitutional state statute that affects foreign commerce is unconstitutional because it prevents the federal government from speaking with one voice,we must examine whether the federal government has chosen to permit the states to act.after conducting that examination,we hold that congress has spoken affirmatively in the area of insurance policies and has acquiesced in state laws like hvira 
in,congress passed the holocaust assets commission act of holocaust act,stat,as amended,stat.codified at note,in order to establish a commission to examine issues pertaining to the disposition of assets in the united states and to make recommendations to the president on further action,and for other purposes.holocaust act intro.the holocaust act instructs the commission to conduct a thorough study and develop a historical record of certain assets,if such assets came into the possession or control of the federal government.id.a.the commissioner and amicus the state of california argue that a,which concerns insurance policies,is relevant to this litigation 
in carrying out its duties under this act,the commission shall take note of the work of the national association of insurance commissioners with regard to insurance issues and shall encourage the national association of insurance commissioners to prepare a report on the claims practices of all insurance companies,both domestic and foreign,doing business in the united states at any time after january,that issued any individual life,health,or insurance policy to any individual on any list of holocaust victims 
id.a a.the report by the national association of insurance commissioners naic should include the following,to the degree the information is available the number of policies issued by insurance companies to victims of the holocaust the value of each policy at the time of issue the total number of policies,and the dollar amounts,that have been paid out and the total value of assets in the united states of each company.id.a b.section a,entitled coordination of activities,states that the commission shall,to the maximum extent practicable,coordinate its activities with,and not duplicate similar activities already being undertaken by,private individuals,private entities,or government entities,whether domestic or foreign.emphasis added.section b adds that the commission shall review comprehensively any research by government entities,whether domestic or foreign.emphasis added.
the holocaust act does not refer in so many words to state legislation as a cause of domestic governments undertaking this research,b,nor does it explain what work of naic the commission is to take note of,a.there are several reasons,however,why we read the holocaust act to embrace state legislation like hvira.
naic is an organization of insurance regulators from the states.the holocaust act asks for detailed information on the claims practices of all insurance companies,both domestic and foreign,doing business in the united states at any time after january.id.a a emphasis added.this information is to include data on individual policies.id.if congress was expecting a detailed report on the claims practices and policies of foreign insurance companies from an organization consisting only of state insurance regulators,congress must have expected that the regulators would be acting pursuant to state law.congress must also have been aware that,in order to fulfill the holocaust act broad objectives,state insurance commissioners might have to require the foreign affiliates of domestic insurance companies to search a foreign office for information on policies.
even if congress reference to the work of naic is not,by itself,encouragement of state statutes like hvira,congress was aware that domestic governmental entities were conducting research into the activities of insurers.as noted,b of the holocaust act requires the commission to review comprehensively any research by government entities,whether domestic or foreign emphasis added,and a requires the commission to coordinate its activities with those of domestic governmental entities.
the legislative history of the holocaust act supports our conclusion that congress was aware of the states efforts to obtain information on insurance policies.in,there was a flurry of activity in congress relating to assets.on february,the house committee on banking and financial services held a hearing on the restitution of art objects seized by the nazis from holocaust victims and insurance claims of certain holocaust victims and their heirs hearing before the house comm.on banking fin,cong.
state insurance commissioners quackenbush of california and senn of washington testified at that hearing.commissioner senn noted that she chaired the naic holocaust insurance issues working group,which was investigating insurance issues with the help of state insurance departments.id.wl.she explained that naic had requested voluntary cooperation from the insurance companies but,i f our requests for cooperation are not satisfied,then the states may begin to exercise regulatory powers.id.congress and the states can work together,commissioner senn concluded.id.cong.at.commissioner quackenbush added that he had held hearings in california relating to this issue,and he was prepared to revoke the certificate of authority,which allows a company to sell insurance in california,for any insurance company and any of its american subsidiaries,if it fails to provide information on policies.id.at.the chair of the house committee,representative leach,who sponsored the holocaust act two months later,noted 
l et me say that because this is an issue of international significance,there are aspects of the american system that are not widely understood abroad,and one relates to the federal nature of america,particularly in the insurance arena,the decision of the united states congress,in effect,either to devolve or not to assume responsibility for basic insurance regulation,which gives the states a significant role.and that means that as two symbolic state insurance commissioners,there a great deal of authority that resides in your offices.
id.at emphasis added on the basis of the text,context,and history of the holocaust act,we conclude that congress was aware of the states involvement in this area and,at least implicitly,encouraged laws like hvira.
notwithstanding the holocaust act,plaintiffs argue,and the district court held,that hvira conflicts with a federal policy relating to holocaust victims compensation efforts as evidenced by three actions undertaken by the executive branch.they are the foundation agreement between germany and the united states foundation agreement the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims icheic and the joint statement.the following is a brief summary of each 
a.the foundation agreement 
in december,the german government and german companies agreed to fund a dm billion foundation to settle claims,in exchange for the voluntary dismissal of lawsuits that had been filed against german companies.the german government has agreed to fund the foundation when all such claims pending in united states courts have been finally dismissed.
on july,the united states and the german government signed the foundation agreement.the agreement recognizes as legitimate the interest german companies have in and enduring legal peace.it also states that it would be in the interests of both parties for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy and forum for addressing all claims that have been or may be asserted against german companies arising from activities.foundation agreement at.
the united states,in article of the foundation agreement,agreed to the following in pertinent part 
the united states shall,in all cases in which the united states is notified that a claim described in article has been asserted in a court in the united states,inform its courts through a statement of interest that it would be in the foreign policy interests of the united states for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy and forum for resolving such claims asserted against german companies and that dismissal of such cases would be in its foreign policy interest.
the united states,recognizing the importance of the objectives of this agreement,including and enduring legal peace,shall,in a timely manner,use its best efforts,in a manner it considers appropriate,to achieve these objectives with state and local governments.
annex b of the foundation agreement explains that the united states will recommend dismissal of lawsuits on any valid legal ground.paragraph seven of annex b recognizes,however,that the united states does not suggest that its policy interests concerning the foundation in themselves provide an independent legal basis for dismissal,but will reinforce the point that policy interests favor dismissal on any valid legal ground.
b.the icheic 
the icheic was established in by naic in cooperation with several european insurance companies,european regulators,representatives of nongovernmental organizations,and the state of israel.the united states has the status of an observer.the icheic is a voluntary,private organization that was created with the goal of implementing a just process that will expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance policies.the icheic creates an international commission that is charged with initiating an investigatory process to determine the current status of those insurance policies for which claims are filed.to assess the remaining unpaid insurance policies of holocaust victims,a reasonable review will be made of the participating companies files.
c.the joint statement 
at the inaugural meeting of the joint economic commission in january,the two countries issued a joint statement stating that they h ave decided to endow their partnership with a perspective,through continued and institutionalized dialogue.section b of an action plan annexed to the joint statement notes that many swiss insurance companies have settled insurance lawsuits,and authorities will call on the state insurance commissioners and state legislative bodies to refrain from taking unwarranted investigative initiatives or from threatening or actually using sanctions against swiss insurers.
we next consider the effect of those three actions on the validity of hvira.significantly,plaintiffs do not argue that hvira is preempted by any of the three.instead,plaintiffs claim that the three actions simply are evidence of a foreign policy with which hvira conflicts.we are not persuaded.
first,we question whether there is in fact any policy conflict between hvira,the enactment of which congress encouraged in the federal holocaust act,and the executive branch initiatives.hvira seeks information for two main purposes enabling victims of the holocaust to know whether they have insurance claims,and protecting californians from insurers that have not paid valid claims.the second purpose conflicts with no federal policy of which we are aware.the first is consistent with the overall goal of the three initiatives to resolve claims.in other words,the holocaust act,hvira,and the executive branch initiatives share the same policy objective,although they seek to achieve that policy objective by varying techniques.
second,we note that two of the executive branch initiatives are.the german foundation agreement pertains to german insurers.the joint statement pertains to swiss insurers.that being so,neither of those initiatives governs with respect to generali an italian insurer or winterthur which apparently has affiliates throughout europe.
third,as plaintiffs concede,none of the three initiatives has preemptive effect.the german foundation agreement mentions the united states interest in the voluntary dismissal of lawsuits against german corporations and,by its terms,does not suggest that the united states policy interests concerning the foundation in themselves provide an independent legal basis for dismissal of any lawsuit.foundation agreement,annex b.the icheic is not an official executive branch action at all it is a voluntary,private organization in which the united states has the role of a mere observer.
of the three,only the joint statement refers specifically to a policy on gathering information about insurance policies the executive branch will call on the state insurance commissioners and state legislative bodies to refrain from taking unwarranted investigative initiatives or from threatening or actually using sanctions against swiss insurers.joint statement,action plan b.that is hortatory,not mandatory,wording.but even if we were to assume that a conflict exists between the holocaust act and the joint statement with regard to seeking information from swiss insurers congress action controls in this instance.article i,of the united states constitution expressly grants congress the authority to regulate foreign commerce.article ii,of the constitution grants the executive branch the authority,with the consent of the senate,to make treaties but,as noted,the joint statement is not a treaty,and preemption is not an issue here.plaintiffs argument that a policy interest found in an executive branch joint statement creating an economic commission trumps congress express constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce is incorrect 
in this connection,plaintiffs draw our attention to letters in which executive branch officials argue that hvira does conflict with the federal government policy concerning claims.in barclays,the supreme court rejected a similar argument.the plaintiff in barclays had pointed to a series of executive branch actions,statements,and amicus filings that,taken together,constitute a clear federal directive proscribing states use of worldwide combined reporting.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that the executive branch actions can not perform the service for which the plaintiff would enlist them.the constitution expressly grants congress,not the president,the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.id.at.quoting const.art.i,cl.
in conclusion,the district court erred when it held that plaintiffs established a likelihood of success on the question whether hvira violates the commerce clause.
c.the foreign affairs power 
the district court also held that plaintiffs established a probability of success on their claim that hvira violates the federal government power over foreign affairs.the court reasoned,and plaintiffs argue,that hvira has more than an incidental effect on foreign countries and has the potential to disrupt and embarrass the federal government in the field of foreign relations.we disagree as a matter of law.
relevant law 
the federal government foreign affairs power is not mentioned expressly in the text of the constitution but,rather,is derived from the structure of the constitution and the nature of federalism see generally harold maier,preemption of state law a recommended analysis,am.int l.the power is rarely invoked by the courts the supreme court has not applied it in m
