we are asked to decide whether a claim for damages from the northridge earthquake is by the limitations provision in an insurance contract.we conclude that code of civil procedure section applies and extends the deadline for presenting the claim 
factual and procedural summary 
jay hellinger owned a home in los angeles county which was damaged by the northridge earthquake of january.he and his brother,lee hellinger,lived in the residence.the hellingers purchased a single homeowners insurance policy from farmers insurance exchange farmers,fire insurance exchange,and insurance company.in,the hellinger brothers purchased a separate earthquake insurance policy for the home from insurance company.the earthquake policy provided we may not be sued unless there has been full compliance with all the terms of this policy.suit on or arising out of this policy must be brought within one year after the loss occurs.before the northridge earthquake,lee hellinger transferred his interest in the residence to his brother,jay.
within days of the earthquake,the hellingers noticed cracks in interior and exterior walls,the driveway,patio,gazebo,and a block wall a leak near the chimney and electrical problems with various appliances.farmers agent howard hammer called the hellingers within a week of the earthquake to ask about the status of their home.lee hellinger told hammer about the damage to the home.after some discussion,hammer told lee hellinger that he thought the losses would not exceed the deductible and that damages to the gazebo,retaining wall,sidewalk,jacuzzi,and landscaping were not covered by the policy.agent hammer did not report the loss to farmers nor did he ask an adjuster to inspect the hellinger home.
in april,the hellingers hired a contractor to repair the visible damage caused by the earthquake,at a cost of.in july,while gardening,lee hellinger noticed a large crack in the concrete foundation under the soil line.he reported this damage to hammer and asked for an inspection.
farmers sent a claims adjuster to inspect the damage in.the hellingers claim was denied in writing on november,citing the policy clause which requires that suit be brought within one year of the loss.
the hellingers sued farmers,fire insurance exchange,and on august.in their original complaint,they alleged causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.the second amended complaint alleged causes of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract.the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend to the second amended complaint on the ground that farmers and fire insurance exchange were not proper parties since the earthquake policy was separate from the homeowners policy they had issued.the hellingers were then granted leave to amend to add farmers as a defendant on an alter ego theory.the theory was that had no employees and had relied upon farmers and fire insurance exchange to investigate all northridge earthquake claims and to develop the practices and procedures for handling those claims.the third amended complaint,naming and farmers,is the charging pleading.it alleges causes of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of contract,alter ego liability,and joint venture liability.
and farmers filed a joint motion for summary judgment,or in the alternative,for summary adjudication.they based their motion on the hellingers failure to file their lawsuit within one year of the date of the earthquake,and on the ground that lee hellinger no longer had an insurable interest when the earthquake occurred.the hellingers opposed the motion on the sole ground that they needed a continuance pursuant to section,subdivision h to allow completion of outstanding discovery.they pointed out that five discovery motions were then pending before the court.
the trial court granted summary adjudication on the cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and on the claim for punitive damages,and continued the hearing on the cause of action for breach of contract.the court also granted summary adjudication against lee hellinger,because he had no insurable interest in the residence.
the hellingers sought reconsideration,based on a newly obtained sworn statement of a former claims supervisor for farmers and the recently completed deposition of lee hellinger.the trial court denied the motion.the hellingers then sought a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to grant their request for a continuance of the motion for summary judgment.that petition was denied.
on november,the trial court granted summary adjudication to defendants on the cause of action for breach of contract as to jay hellinger.it found the action was untimely under insurance code section and the limitations period contained in the policy.the court entered judgment in favor of and farmers.the hellingers motion for new trial was denied.they filed a timely appeal from the judgment,including the underlying summary adjudication and summary judgment and a costs order against lee hellinger.the briefing on appeal is on behalf of jay hellinger only with respect to the merits of the summary judgment and summary adjudication no issue is raised challenging the finding that lee hellinger had no insurable interest in the property.lee hellinger appeals from the judgment of costs assessed against him,but cites neither authority nor the record in support of his appeal from the award of costs.we regard his appeal as abandoned.see leader health industries of america,th,d.our references to plaintiff in the discussion portion of this opinion refer to jay hellinger.
after the normal briefing on appeal,we asked counsel to address the applicability of section,which became effective january.that statute revives certain claims arising out of the northridge earthquake that otherwise are.jay hellinger and filed letter briefs in response to our request 
discussion 
section was enacted in.it became effective on january,the usual date for nonurgency legislation enacted in.it provides a notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of the effective date of this section.this subdivision shall only apply to cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurer representative prior to january,regarding potential northridge earthquake damage.b any action pursuant to this section commenced prior to,or within one year from,the effective date of this section shall not be barred based upon this limitations period.c nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the applicable limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of the effective date of this section.d this section shall not apply to either of the following any claim that has been litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to the effective date of this section.any written compromised settlement agreement which has been made between an insurer and its insured where the insured was represented by counsel admitted to the practice of law in california at the time of the settlement,and who signed the agreement.we begin our discussion with the construction of this statute 
insurance code section 
the applicable limitations period in this case is contractual,rather than statutory under insurance code section.that statute specifies mandatory provisions for fire insurance policies,including a limitations period of one year from the date of loss,to commence an action on the policy.plaintiff argues that since the legislature has the power to revive a claim that is under a statutory limitations period,there is no persuasive reason why it would lack the power to alter a limitation period,it has legislatively permitted the insurer to insert in fire insurance policies abrogating the general statute of limitations.that may be true,but it does not resolve the issue in this case.
insurance code section does not apply because the insurance at issue is a policy covering earthquake damage only.it is not a fire insurance policy.see unetco industries exchange homestead ins.th,d earthquake policy is not standard form fire insurance policy as defined in.as the unetco court observed,a fire insurance policy must insure against loss by fire and lightning if it does not,it is not a fire insurance policy.id.at,d.the earthquake policy in this case specifically excludes coverage for losses caused by fire.the limitations period is strictly contractual under paragraph of the policy.
it may or may not be common for insurers to include a limitations period in earthquake damage riders to fire insurance policies,as well as in earthquake policies.the fact that insurers choose to include the limitation in earthquake policies does not bring those policies within the ambit of insurance code section.for that matter,there is no legal requirement that insurers include the period in homeowners policies that cover a multitude of risks besides fire,so long as it is included for fire coverage.
solely because of the applicable statute of limitations 
section subdivision a applies n otwithstanding any other provision of law or contract to revive certain claims arising out of damages from the northridge earthquake which are barred solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired italics added.does this mean that,despite the reference to any other provision of contract only the statutory bar is affected or does the law apply as well to claims that are barred by the contract limitations period arguments are made for each alternative.our first task is to determine which is correct.
when uncertainty arises in a question of statutory interpretation,consideration must be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.in this regard,it is presumed the legislature intended reasonable results consistent with its expressed purpose,not absurd consequences.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,quoting harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.courts properly examine the manifest purpose of the statute as a whole in interpreting its provisions.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino,supra,cal th at,d,applied to initiative in re marriage of walrath cal th,d,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citations.we examine the history and background of the statutory provision in order to ascertain the most reasonable interpretation of the measure.delaney baker cal th,d.
we begin with the amendment to the bill that added the specific reference to contracts.in his comments to the senate judiciary committee,senator john burton,principal author of the enacting measure,senate bill,offered an amendment to add the phrase or contract to the first sentence of subdivision a,which we reprise notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived,subd.a,see also comments of senator burton to judiciary italics added.senator burton explained this amendment is technical in nature,since earthquake policies are written pursuant to form fire policy contained in the insurance code.comments of senator burton to judiciary com.the amendment did not make a corresponding change to specify a contractual limitations period after the term statute of limitations.but it can not reasonably be read to exclude the contractual bar.otherwise the addition of the phrase or contract would have no meaning,and the legislative purpose which we next discuss would not be served.we agree with the conclusion reached in century insurance superior court,supra,th,d,that the term statute of limitations in this context should be understood as generic,applying to all applicable limitations periods.
whether it is part of a comprehensive homeowners policy or in a stand alone policy,earthquake coverage does not come within the insurance code section provision requiring a contract limitations period for fire policies.if we were to adopt interpretation of section,that it does not apply to contract provisions,most victims of the northridge earthquake would be unable to claim its benefits because the contract period expired long before the statute was enacted.surely this is contrary to the legislative intent to provide widespread relief to victims of the northridge earthquake 
the history of senate bill is replete with indications of its statutory purpose.the following excerpt from the legislative record is illustrative the author introduced this bill to bring needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake.he states that the statute of limitations contained in insurance code section has unfairly barred victims from being compensated for their losses because many were tragically misled about the extent of damage suffered as a result of the earthquake.news accounts have asserted that many of the quake victims have yet to receive full and fair compensation from their insurance companies to cover the costs incurred as a result of the quake.many victims,the accounts state,have received only partial settlements for their earthquake claims,and others have received no compensation at all,having been improperly told that the damage they suffered was below policy deductibles.in subsequent years,families have discovered damage that either was ignored or missed by the original claims adjuster,yet some insurers,according to these news accounts,have stonewalled claims,leaving homes,condominiums and apartment buildings in shambles and homeowners without any recourse.reflecting this apparent plethora of horror stories faced by many victims of the northridge earthquake,state senate leaders recently released market survey reports conducted by the department of insurance which reportedly demonstrate that several of the nation largest insurance companies mishandled hundreds of claims following the northridge earthquake.the market surveys concluded that the surveyed companies had repeatedly claims,failed to inform policyholders of their benefits and forced many claimants to sue to get full payment.according to the los angeles times,an analysis of the reports conducted by a consumer watchdog group found that one of the companies failed to properly explain benefits or misled policyholders in over a third of claims files reviewed in the report.ellis,virginia,reports on quake claims made public,times,june.according to the author,this bill seeks to provide these individuals,who,he asserts,were victimized twice once by the earthquake and a second time by their insurance companies with a reasonable second chance to seek redress for their damages.third reading analysis of bill,as amended july.these concerns apply equally to statutory and contract barred claims.
that certainly is the way it was understood both by the insurance industry and the legislature.the senate rules committee analysis of amendments by the assembly is instructive.it refers to the limitation of insurance code section,and to insurance industry opposition the american insurance association states that,this proposal appears to be unconstitutional.the requirement that claims be reported within one year of the loss is based upon provisions of insurance contracts.the california constitution article,section provides that a law impairing the obligation of contracts may not be passed.to the degree that sb attempts to modify the contractual obligations and rights of insurers and policyholders,it appears to violate this clear provision of the constitution.rules,off.of floor analyses,unfinished business analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.similarly,an analysis prepared for the assembly committee on the judiciary includes a discussion of the impairment issue raised by insurance industry opponents of the bill.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.
we conclude that the relief afforded by section applies to both contract and statutory limitations periods.
litigated to finality 
subdivision d of section makes the statute inapplicable to any claim that has been litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction before january.argues the statute does not apply because plaintiff claim had been litigated to finality before that date in the los angeles superior court,which is a court of competent jurisdiction.this is true,according to,because the judgment for the insurers was rendered on november,before the january,effective date of the statute.
the statute does not define litigated to finality.argues that a trial court judgment,if rendered by a competent court,is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subdivision d of section.it relies on sullivan delta air lines,cal th,d.the issue in that case was whether section,a claim survival statute,applies if the plaintiff was alive when judgment was rendered but died while the appeal was pending.the defendant had cited an earlier version of the statute which applied only when the plaintiff died before judgment.the defendant argued that before judgment meant before final judgment and that a judgment is not final until affirmed on appeal or until the time for appeal has passed.id.at,d.the supreme court agreed that one of the meanings of final judgment is that a judgment is not final as long as it is subject to direct attack by appeal or by motion for new trial or to vacate the judgment.ibid.examples at fn.at,d.but the court went on to explain that finality on appeal is only one meaning of the phrase,and others may apply,depending on the circumstances.id.at,d.one of these is that a trial court judgment is final from the moment it is rendered.id.at,d.
plaintiff cites mckee national union fire ins.th,d.in that case,the court concluded that a judgment creditor of an insured is not entitled to sue a judgment debtor insurer under insurance code section,subdivision b until an appeal from the underlying judgment is resolved or the time for appeal has passed.id.at,d.in reaching this conclusion,the court examined a statutorily required policy provision that the insurer may not be sued on an underlying judgment until it is final,in the sense that it was affirmed on appeal or the time for appeal has expired.id.at,d.in deciding that a judgment is not final until then,the court relied on section an action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal,or until the time for appeal has passed,unless the judgment is sooner satisfied.th at,d.analysis of this issue under the doctrine of res judicata yields the same result.id.at,d.
we think it is significant that in enacting section,the legislature employed neither the term final judgment nor the generic term judgment in creating the subdivision d exception.instead,it used the phrase litigated to finality.we understand this to refer to the final resolution of the matter on appeal,or by passage of the time within which an appeal can be filed.stated another way,we construe this term to refer to the point in time when the judgment is beyond direct attack.the judgment in this case was entered on december.plaintiff filed his timely appeal on january.the judgment had not been litigated to finality when section became effective on january.
in reaching this conclusion,we disagree with a contrary decision by a federal district court in campanelli allstate insurance d.in that case,the court granted a motion for summary judgment to an insurer on the ground that an action by victims of the northridge earthquake was barred by both contractual and statutory limitations periods.the court concluded that summary judgment constituted a final adjudication on the merits within the meaning of section.the case cites federal authorities but does not discuss the availability of review through a motion for new trial or appeal.id.at.for the reasons we have stated,and consistent with the principle that curative statutes such as this should be liberally construed kim servosnax,th,d,we decline to follow the district court decision.
argues that section violates the contract impairment clauses of both the federal and state constitutions,which prohibit a law impairing the obligation of contracts.article i,section,clause of the united states constitution provides that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts,thus making the restriction applicable to state legislation.see lynce mathis,fn,d contract clause prohibits states from passing retroactive legislation impairing the obligation of contracts.california constitution,article i,section is similar.it provides in pertinent part a law impairing the obligation of contracts may not be passed.
it has been established law for over a century that a legislature may revive a civil claim that is barred by the statute of limitations.the reason is that,in a civil case,there is no constitutional right of repose.campbell holt.upholding provision reviving civil actions chase securities donaldson.revival of a personal cause of action which did not involve creation of title does not offend due process liebig superior court d.lent doe th,d similar.
this case is different because it turns on a contractual limitations period.argument is that,to the extent section allows a party to proceed on a claim already barred by the contractual provision,it impairs the insurer contractual rights.
the dimensions of the constitutional argument were most recently and fully discussed by our supreme court in calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d.the court observed a ll presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does not afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity.statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly,positively,and unmistakably appears.citations.if the validity of the measure is fairly debatable,it must be sustained.citations.
the court cited exxon eagerton,d.that case reviewed a statute that prohibited increases on oil and gas prices even as to sellers with contracts which expressly allowed them.the eagerton decision explained that a lthough the language of the contract clause is facially absolute,its prohibition must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the state to safeguard the vital interests of its people.citations.this court has long recognized that a statute does not violate the contract clause simply because it has the effect of restricting,or even barring altogether,the performance of duties created by contracts entered into prior to its enactment.citation.calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.this summary is entirely congruent with the supreme court appraisal of the legislature power,in limited circumstances and in a circumscribed manner,to invalidate provisions of a contract.
the california cases on contract impairment are firmly rooted in established federal precedent.in a leading case,home blaisdell,the supreme court upheld a minnesota statute that empowered trial courts to extend the period of redemption from foreclosure for such additional time as the court may deem just and equitable.id.at,fn.the blaisdell court ruled that the reserved police power to impair contracts must be consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation of that power.home blaisdell,supra,at.it concluded it can not be maintained that the constitutional prohibition should be so construed as to prevent limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the enforcements of contracts if made necessary by a great public calamity such as fire,flood,or earthquake.citation.ibid.the key holdings in blaisdell are the contract clause is not an absolute prohibition contracts are made subject to the state police power and,in an emergency,this reserved power may be exercised directly to prevent the strict enforcement of the contract,in order to safeguard the public interest.the exercise of the power must be of a character appropriate to the emergency and reasonable in its conditions and the minnesota law,being reasonable,temporary and limited to the emergency,does not violate either the contract or the due process clause.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law.
the power of the government to enact legislation which impairs a contract also was recognized in norman,one of a trio of united states supreme court cases involving the gold clause.the court was concerned with the validity of a joint congressional resolution invalidating contractual provisions which required payment of a debt in gold or by a value set by the gold standard.congress retroactively declared such gold clauses to be in violation of public policy,and held that notwithstanding the express contract terms,outstanding debts could be paid in legal tender.
in norman the court rejected the obvious impairment of contract challenge to the legislation.it held that congress has the power to regulate the monetary system,including the power to invalidate provisions of existing contracts which interfere with the exercise of that authority,and that the gold clauses constituted such an interference and were invalid.the court ruled that c ontracts,however express,can not fetter the constitutional authority of the congress.contracts may create rights of property,but when contracts deal with a subject matter which lies within the control of the congress,they have a congenital infirmity.parties can not remove their transactions from the reach of dominant constitutional power by making contracts about them.id.at.the court concluded there is no constitutional ground for denying to the congress the power expressly to prohibit and invalidate contracts although previously made,and valid when made,when they interfere with the carrying out of the policy it is free to adopt.id.at.
the supreme court refused to the congressional determination that the gold clauses had to be invalidated as a part of the federal response to the monetary crisis which arose during the great depression we may inquire whether congress action is arbitrary or capricious,that is,whether it has reasonable relation to a legitimate end.if it is an appropriate means to such an end,the decisions of the congress as to the degree of the necessity for the adoption of that means,is final.citations.norman,supra,at.
the calfarm court applied the analytical framework developed in energy reserves group kansas power light,d.the court addressed state and federal power in this area,and it articulated a test for examining the contract impairment issue.see calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.the threshold inquiry is whether the state law has,in fact,operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.citations.the severity of the impairment is said to increase the level of scrutiny to which the legislation will be subjected.citation.total destruction of contractual expectations is not necessary for a finding of substantial impairment.citation.on the other hand,state regulation that restricts a party to gains it reasonably expected from the contract does not necessarily constitute a substantial impairment.citations.in determining the extent of the impairment,we are to consider whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been regulated in the past.citations.energy reserves group kansas power light,supra,at.
once the court has determined that a state regulation constitutes a substantial impairment,it moves to the second step of the analysis whether the state has a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation,citation such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem.citation.furthermore,since home blaisdell,supra.the court has indicated that the public purpose need not be addressed to an emergency or temporary situation.citations.the requirement of a legitimate public purpose guarantees that the state is exercising its police power,rather than providing a benefit to special interests.energy reserves group kansas power light,supra,at.
the third step in the analysis is whether the adjustment of the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties is based upon reasonable conditions and is of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the legislation adoption.citation.unless the state itself is a contracting party citation a s is customary in reviewing economic and social regulation,courts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.citation.energy reserves group kansas power light,supra,at,bracketed material in original except omitted citations and fns.
we proceed to apply this test to the statute to the case before us.in doing so we need not and do not consider the validity of the statute in situations other than the one presented here.thus,we do not consider the limitation in the exception clause that revives settled claims in cases where the insured was not represented by california counsel,subd.d,as that circumstance is not before us.
severity of the impairment 
this phase of the analysis involves assessing the severity of the impairment,since that assessment measures the height of the hurdle the state legislation must clear citation calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
argues the impairment is severe because section grants insureds a new right to claim lapsed contract benefits while wiping out the insurers existing contractual right to repose from stale claims.it claims this impairment is massive because each of the persons or entities who filed earthquake claims would be entitled to bring another claim.it also argues that there are others who may never have submitted a claim,but who will come within section as long as they contacted their insurer.argues that insurers will be practically defenseless to challenge the claims after the passage of time,and cites the specter of bad faith suits in adjusting resubmitted claims to argue that many insurers will be forced to pay skyrocketing amounts to settle what could be meritless claims.it concludes section thus presents a virtually strict liability situation for insurers.these arguments greatly overstate the case.
there is nothing before us to support claim that vast numbers of insureds would be rendered eligible to avail themselves of the section extension.the reference to persons apparently is to the gross number of claimants.we are concerned with a subset of unknown size those who were insured but did not settle by written agreement when represented by california counsel and who contacted an insurer representative before january.because that date is one year before the effective date of the statute,the size of the subset is severely circumscribed.thus,it does not apply to an insured who waited until section was enacted to contact an insurer representative.it is certainly no less speculative to posit,as we assume the legislature did,that many if not most insureds who suffered earthquake damage are satisfied with the treatment they received by their insurer and have no wish to engage in litigation at this point.it also is important to recall that the statute revives the time period in which claims may be brought for one year,and that it does not affect any other defense which the insurers may have.
devotes part of its briefing to the provision applying the extended statute of limitations to settlements not signed on behalf of plaintiff by a california licensed attorney,subd.d.but,as we have pointed out,that is not an issue in this action.
in calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d,a contract clause challenge was made to proposition,an initiative enacted in which made fundamental changes in the regulation of automobile and other types of insurance.cal d at.the extensive regulation of the insurance industry was a factor considered by the calfarm court in discussing whether there was an impairment of contract.the court concluded that further regulation of the industry could reasonably be anticipated and that the impairment of contract was relatively moderate and re
