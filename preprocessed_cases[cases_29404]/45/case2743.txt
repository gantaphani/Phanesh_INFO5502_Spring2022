city of la mesa city appeals a summary judgment in favor of california joint powers insurance authority jpia in its action to recover the balance of city equity account held by jpia.the jpia was organized by the member public entities joint powers agreement pursuant to government code section to provide a pool as an alternative to private insurance.city was a member from until it withdrew in july.
city disputes the enforceability of article a of the joint powers agreement,which provides that members deposits shall not be returned upon withdrawal.its challenge requires us to determine the applicability of government code section,which authorizes contractual limitations on the return of any surplus deposits.city argues section should not be applied retroactively to resurrect what it contends is a void clause 
background 
joint powers authority agreement 
since,the joint exercise of powers act has permitted two or more municipalities to form a joint powers authority which they agree will exercise any power that each municipality has power to exercise individually,et city of south el monte southern cal.joint powers ins.authority th,d.municipalities are specifically authorized to enter into a joint powers agreement to insure against a broad range of liabilities through.
in,a group of southern california cities entered into an agreement agreement to create jpia,which would administer a joint protection program by which the member cities would pool their losses and claims and jointly purchase excess insurance and administrative and other services 
city became a member of jpia in august.when it joined,section stated the joint powers agreement shall provide that after the completion of its purpose,any surplus money on hand shall be returned in proportion to the contributions made.
on january,the agreement was amended to its present form at jpia board of directors meeting.donald dodson,city risk manager,attended the meeting on city behalf and voted to adopt the amended agreement.
article of the amended agreement provides that jpia executive committee shall determine each member initial deposit.article also provides that the executive committee is required to adopt a cost allocation plan and formula to provide for an adjustment in the members deposits at the end of each year in order to produce a deposit for each year for each member that is equal to the sum of the amount of losses borne individually by the member,the member share of pooled losses and other expenses,and the member contribution to a catastrophe fund and reserves for losses.the deposit adjustments may be retrospective to the prior year,and each member is required to pay any additional deposit required by the retrospective adjustment 
article of the amended agreement,entitled effect of withdrawal,states 
a the withdrawal of any member from this agreement shall not terminate the same,and no member by withdrawing shall be entitled to payment or return of any deposits,consideration or property paid,or donated by the member to the authority,or to any distribution of assets.
b the withdrawal of any member after the effective date of the joint protection program shall not terminate its responsibility to contribute its share of deposits or funds to any fund or insurance program created by the authority until all claims,or other unpaid liabilities,covering the period the member was a signatory hereto have been finally resolved and a determination of the final amount of payments due by the member or credits to the member for the period of its membership has been made by the executive committee 
article of the amended agreement is entitled termination and distribution.subdivision b thereof states,in pertinent part,that upon termination of the agreement,all assets of the authority shall be distributed only among the parties that have been members of the joint protection program in accordance with and proportionate to their cash including deposits payments and property at market value when received contributions made during the term of this agreement.
articles and b contain the same substantive language that was contained in the version of the agreement in effect when city joined jpia in.they differ only to the extent they have been renumbered and have substituted the word member for city and the word deposits for premium.
neither the original nor the amended agreement defines or refers to a member city equity.however,an information brochure produced by jpia when it was still known as southern california joint powers insurance authority,sometime before january,states that member deposits are treated as their equity,and reduced only by claims and expenses actually paid.two flyers,summarizing the comprehensive general and automobile liability coverage program and the workers compensation coverage program,state that all deposits are credited to a member equity account balance.
on february,one month after the agreement was amended,senate bill was introduced to add section to the joint exercise of powers act.the bill was enacted as a statute on july.the statute states that section is added to the government code,to read if the purpose set forth in the agreement is to pool the claims of two or more local public entities,the agreement may provide that termination by any party to the agreement shall not be construed as a completion of the purpose of the agreement and shall not require the repayment or return to the parties of all or any part of any contributions,payments,or advances made by the parties until the agreement is rescinded or terminated as to all parties.the agreement may provide that after the completion of its purpose,any surplus money remaining in the pool shall be returned in proportion to the contributions made and the claims or losses paid.stats,ch.
the statute specifies that i t is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this act shall not apply to any lawsuits filed on or before may.stats,ch.
superior court proceedings 
city withdrew from jpia effective july.it then sought the return of its excess equity contributions,which it characterized as the monies it paid into the pool above the amounts necessary to cover its responsibilities.it claimed this sum exceeded.jpia denied the request,based on article of the amended agreement.
in february,city filed the present action.in multiple causes of action,including declaratory relief,breach of contract,and negligent misrepresentation,it sought the return of the balance of its equity account or a declaration that jpia was required to hold its equity in trust for the city until jpia dissolved.it alleged generally that in years when a member deposit to the jpia exceeds the amount needed to pay claims and cover other expenses,jpia accounts for the excess,in whole or in part,in an equity account in the name of the member.it further alleged that during its membership in jpia,its total deposits readjustments exceeded,and its total losses were less than,making its equity balance.
as affirmative defenses,jpia alleged that every claim in city complaint was barred as unenforceable,insofar as section permits a joint powers authority to limit a member ability to recover deposit premiums that city consented to and ratified the provisions of the agreement that preclude a withdrawing member from receiving deposits or distribution of assets until the agreement is terminated and that city waived any breach because it had full knowledge of jpia policy that equity interests contributions by any members would not be returned to those members upon their withdrawal from the pooling agreement.
city moved for summary adjudication of jpia affirmative defenses on the grounds,inter alia,the agreement was not amended on or after january,the date section took effect,and therefore city did not consent to or ratify any contractual restriction of its right to receive its equity contributions upon withdrawal,making section inapplicable to its action.jpia moved for summary judgment on the grounds it was not obligated to return the balance of the amounts city had deposited,insofar as both article of the agreement and section prohibited city from recovering any contributions until the termination of jpia.according to the supporting declaration of its executive director,the contributions in dispute were based upon reserves of reported claims,actuarial estimates of incurred but unreported claims,and the expenses to adjust and litigate those claims.
the parties agreed to a consolidated hearing on their motions,insofar as they raised substantially similar facts and issues.
the trial court granted judgment for jpia after concluding article a of the agreement barred city claims because section expressly permits such provisions in a joint powers agreement.it concluded section applied to the agreement because it was retroactive to may,nine years before the present action was filed,and,even if not explicitly retroactive to may,was applicable because nothing in section limited it to joint powers pools established or voluntarily modified after its effective date of january.
discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is properly granted if the moving papers show there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.in appeals from a summary judgment,appellate courts review the record and determination of the trial court de novo.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d.
applicability of section 
city contends section,effective january,is inapplicable to the agreement as amended on january,because the statute is prospective only,insofar as it is not explicitly retroactive.city further contends that section is inapplicable to the agreement because the statute was intended to apply to funds in a joint powers pool that are akin to a commercial insurance company earned premiums.by contrast,city argues,the agreement and the parties business practices establish that the money it seeks to recover is its equity,which is different from the commercial insurer earned premiums.
as we understand the heart of city contention,article a,barring a refund of any deposits or assets upon a member withdrawal from jpia,is void as an illegal forfeiture,unless section is applicable to the agreement.city argues that section,with an effective date of january,can not validate or resurrect a previously void clause.
to resolve the parties disagreement on the disputed statute effective date,on its retroactivity,and ultimately on whether it was intended to govern the jpia agreement as amended and reaffirmed on january,we must apply rules of statutory interpretation.
one such principle instructs that statutes are not to be given retrospective operation unless it is clearly made to appear that such was the legislative intent.evangelatos superior court cal d.however,an express declaration that the legislature intended a statute to have retroactive application is not necessarily required to show that the legislature did so intend extrinsic sources may make very clear that the legislature intended to depart from the normal rule of prospectivity.id.at,fox alexis cal d.
although the legislature did not use the specific word retroactive or any variants,retroactively,retrospective when it enacted section,its explicitly stated intent was that the statute shall not apply to any lawsuits filed on or before may.stats,ch.short of using the precise word retroactive,it is difficult to conceive a more plainly manifested intent from this language other than that the legislature,by denominating the exact date before which the newly enacted section was inapplicable,intended the logical corollary the statute shall apply to lawsuits filed after that specified date.
city argues that the may,date was chosen simply so that the new statute would have no effect on a then pending san diego lawsuit in which a hospital that had withdrawn from a joint powers pool sought recovery of its contributions from the joint powers authority,and the date was a drafting strategy to insulate the statute from the constitutional proscription against special laws applicable only to particular persons,as opposed to general application.cal,art.iv.were this court to accept city argument,we would effectively be treating the statute as a special law,which,as city recognizes,would make it constitutionally infirm.our mandate is to construe statutes to preserve their constitutionality,if feasible within the bounds of their language.metromedia,city of san diego cal d.
furthermore,nothing in the statute reflects a legislative intent that,if a provision in a joint powers agreement executed before section effective date contained language authorizing the joint powers authority to retain excess contributions,it would be void after the enactment of section,unless the joint powers authority formally readopted the provision.
the touchstone of statutory interpretation is the probable intent of the legislature.courts are to give a statute words their plain,commonsense meaning.bonnell medical board cal th,d.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning controls,and there is no need for statutory construction or resort to other indicia of legislative intent,such as legislative history.id.at,d,california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.the language of an unambiguous statute can not be expanded by statements of a committee during the course of the legislative process.kanter th,d.
here,section plainly states that an agreement by local entities to pool claims may provide that one party termination shall not require a return or repayment to that party of any of its contributions,payments,or advances until the agreement is terminated as to all parties.had the legislature intended that an existing agreement already containing such a provision was no longer valid unless reaffirmed by the signatories to the agreement,it could readily have said so.in effect,city would have us rewrite the statute by including such a requirement.however,in interpreting a statute,courts do not insert what has been omitted we do not,under the guise of construction,rewrite the law.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.the amended agreement of january,as jpia acknowledges,contains a provision that mirrors section a withdrawing member is not entitled to payment or return of deposits article a until the termination of the agreement,when all assets are distributed among the parties that have been members proportionate to their payments article b.the enactment of section subsequent to the january,amended agreement and challenged article a does not preclude enforcement thereof because the parties did not execute a reaffirmation of the agreement.
the same principles of interpretation apply to city contention that section was not intended to apply to agreements like the instant agreement.it argues that,according to the legislative history,the contributions to which section refers are contributions akin to earned premiums in commercial insurance policies,whereas it seeks the return of its equity.
again,the language of section is unambiguous an agreement to pool claims may provide that termination by a party shall not require the repayment or return to the terminating parties of all or any part of any contributions,payments,or advances made by the parties indeed,city itself defines its equity as the monies it paid into the pool above the amounts necessary to cover its responsibilities.nothing in the statutory language manifests an intent to categorize contributions to the pool,so that some categories of deposits are deemed immediately refundable upon the contributing party withdrawal from the agreement.rather,the plain meaning is that any kind of contribution or payment,however characterized,may be retained until all parties to the agreement rescind or terminate it.
legislative history 
we also observe that,in fact,the legislative history of section supports our conclusions.
senate bill,containing the proposed new section,was introduced on february.its sponsor was the california association of joint powers authorities.senate bill also proposed amending section,which permits public entities to form a joint powers authority for pooling,by adding section e where a joint powers agreement authorized by this part
