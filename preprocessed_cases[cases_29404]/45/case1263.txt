liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual appeals the first and third holdings of the district court final declaratory judgment in a case that determined the defense and indemnity obligations of liberty mutual with respect to asbestos lawsuits against plastics engineering company plenco.plenco,in turn,appeals the second holding.the three challenged holdings present important questions of wisconsin law that are presently unresolved by wisconsin appellate courts and are likely to recur in future lawsuits what constitutes an occurrence in an insurance contract when exposure injuries are sustained by numerous individuals,at varying geographical locations,over many years whether wisconsin statute applies to successive insurance policies and whether wisconsin courts would adopt an all sums or pro rata allocation approach to determining liability when an injury spans multiple,successive insurance policies.because current wisconsin law does not provide sufficient guidance as to how the wisconsin supreme court would resolve these issues,we stay this appeal and certify three questions to the wisconsin supreme court,pursuant to circuit rule and wisconsin statute.
plenco,a wisconsin corporation with its principal place of business in sheboygan,wisconsin,began manufacturing molding compounds in.plenco has been named as defendant in hundreds of lawsuits for claims arising from individuals exposure to the company products,which plenco manufactured from until.liberty mutual,a massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in massachusetts,provided primary general liability insurance policies to plenco beginning in september.plenco began purchasing umbrella excess liability policies from liberty mutual in may,and save for a period when plenco purchased umbrella coverage from another insurer,continued to purchase umbrella policies from liberty mutual at least until.to date,liberty mutual has paid all of plenco defense costs,settlements,and judgments stemming from the asbestos lawsuits.
liberty mutual advised plenco in that it would only pay its proportionate share of reasonable and necessary defense costs.however,liberty mutual has continued to pay all of plenco defense costs,settlements,and judgments under a reservation of rights.on september,plenco filed a complaint in district court,against liberty mutual,on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.see.plenco sought a declaratory judgment that liberty mutual was obligated,under the terms of the insurance policies purchased by plenco,to fully defend and indemnify plenco in connection with all of plenco pending and future lawsuits.in response,liberty mutual sought an opposing declaration that it was not obligated to pay certain defense and indemnification expenses,including some it had been paying on behalf of plenco,and that it was entitled to a refund for overpaid amounts.
the parties stipulated to a joint statement of facts,which outlined the insurance policies at issue in the suit primary policies between february,and january,umbrella policies from may,to january,and umbrella policies from january,to january,and detailed the particular policy language in dispute.thereafter,both plenco and liberty mutual filed for summary judgment.
the district court issued a decision and order on october,which granted in part and denied in part each party motion for summary judgment.on december,the court entered a final declaratory judgment,to which both parties consented.specifically,the court concluded that per the terms of the policies in question,each individual person injury caused by exposure to plenco products constitutes a separate occurrence when an injury is sustained over numerous,successive policy terms,the policies the court held do not violate wisconsin statute limit liberty mutual obligation for an individual claimant recovery to the maximum amount allowed in a single triggered policy for an occurrence and under the terms of the policies,liberty mutual is obligated to pay all sums accruing from an injury that triggers any one policy,and is not entitled to a pro rata contribution from plenco where the injury in question occurs partly within and partly outside of the liberty mutual policy period.
ii.analysis 
in this appeal,liberty mutual challenges the district court occurrence holding and its all sums allocation holding.plenco challenges the district court holding on.all three definition of occurrence in the context of exposure injuries,the applicability of to successive insurance policies,and the allocation of liability when an injury spans multiple insurance unsettled questions of state law that will directly affect the outcome of this appeal,and that will undoubtedly affect the outcome of future cases under wisconsin law.we consider each issue in turn,briefly discussing the arguments raised by the parties and the relevant points of wisconsin law.
definition of occurrence in asbestos litigation 
the insurance policies provide that liberty mutual liability for bodily injury will be limited to a certain amount per occurrence.thus,the extent to which liberty mutual must indemnify plenco depends directly on the number of occurrences underlying the asbestos lawsuits.the primary policies contain a provision qualifying occurrence for exposure injuries,which stated with insignificant wording changes depending on the policy year all bodily injury and property damage arising out of the continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.plenco and liberty mutual debate the number of occurrences underlying the lawsuits the district court ultimately held that each individual exposure to plenco products constituted a separate occurrence under the insurance policies.
wisconsin law provides some guidance as to what constitutes an occurrence in insurance contracts.in olsen moore,the wisconsin supreme court adopted the cause theory test for identifying an occurrence if a single,uninterrupted cause results in a number of injuries or separate instances of property damages,it is considered one occurrence.if,however,that cause is interrupted or replaced by another cause the chain of causation is broken and more than one accident or occurrence has taken place.id.as the district court pointed out,a cause and result that are closely linked in time and space are likely to be viewed as one occurrence.see welter singer.
the cause theory test for an occurrence has been applied by wisconsin courts in the context of exposure to dangerous conditions.in society insurance town of franklin,damages to surrounding property that were caused by a contaminated landfill were said to have resulted from one continuous the number of occurrences was not an issue in the case.in wisconsin electric power california union insurance,the wisconsin court of appeals held that there was one uninterrupted occurrence that began when a power supply was installed,and continued while the power supply was in order.although these cases may be analogous to the asbestos realm,they are different in one significant respect.in society insurance and wisconsin electric,the damage stemmed from exposure that happened at one geographical site.here,the company manufactured asbestos at its wisconsin plant,but much of the exposure to asbestos happened at varying locations across the country,where plenco products were incorporated into other manufacturers products.
liberty mutual invokes the cause test in arguing that there was one cause underlying all of plenco asbestos lawsuits the continuous manufacture and sale of molding compounds.plenco,in contrast,argues that the manufacture of asbestos itself caused no individual subsequent exposure to asbestos caused that individual injury.plenco emphasizes that the thousands of lawsuit claimants allege asbestos exposure that occurred at different locations,at different times,under different circumstances,via different plenco products.both parties cite several cases from other states and federal courts to support their positions,ultimately highlighting the varied interpretations other jurisdictions have accorded the term occurrence.
it is clear that an occurrence under wisconsin law can be ongoing and span a large amount of time,but still be one occurrence within the meaning of the policy.jonas builders,united states fidelity guaranty,unpublished table decision.however,whether the type of manufacture of,and exposure to,asbestos at issue here constitutes one occurrence under wisconsin law is unresolved guidance from the wisconsin supreme court would be useful.
applicability of wisconsin statute to successive insurance policies 
plenco argues that certain provisions in the insurance policies violate a because they limit liberty mutual liability for one occurrence to the coverage amount of any one policy that is triggered by the occurrence.in so doing,the provisions eradicate significant amounts of coverage that plenco purchased from liberty mutual over the years.wisconsin statute,titled other insurance provisions,provides that 
w hen or more policies promise to indemnify an insured against the same loss,no other insurance provisions of the policy may reduce the aggregate protection of the insured below the lesser of the actual insured loss suffered by the insured or the total indemnification promised by the policies if there were no other insurance provisions.
one of the policy provisions plenco believes violates the statute reads,in part 
i f an occurrence gives rise to bodily injury or property damage which occurs partly before and partly within the policy period the liability of the company under this policy for such occurrence shall not exceed minus the total of all payments made with respect to such occurrence under a previous policy or policies of which this policy is a replacement.the policies may by their terms define the extent to which each is primary and each excess 
liberty mutual argues that the statute applies only to other insurance provisions in policies other insurance provisions being particular types of clauses that delineate the primary and excess coverage between multiple,concurrent polices that cover the same loss.the application of does seem to have been limited to concurrent policies.see,tahtinen msi ins,krause.bay ins.the district court relied on the distinction between concurrent policies and successive policies when it held that does not apply to the provisions in plenco policies,which are successive.
plenco,on the other hand,argues that generally prohibits attempts by insurers to reduce or eliminate insurance coverage insureds have paid for.plenco believes the district court incorrectly held that applies only to concurrent insurance policies,noting that had the legislature desired to limit the statute in that manner,it could easily have done so by directly writing the limitation into the provision.further,plenco points to other states that have not limited the definition other insurance provisions to concurrent policies.
while issues pertaining to have arisen in wisconsin appellate courts,to our knowledge the specific question at issue prohibits an insurance company from limiting coverage for any given occurrence,which triggers multiple successive policies,to the limit of a single policy never been addressed.we therefore request guidance from the wisconsin supreme court regarding whether applies to successive insurance policies.
all sums or pro rata allocation of insurer liability 
the district court third holding addressed the allocation of liability among insurers when an injury triggering one policy occurs partly within and partly outside of that policy period.the ultimate issue is whether an insurer is responsible to pay all sums associated with the injury,subject to policy limits,or alternatively,whether the insurer is responsible only for a pro rata share of the costs,based on the proportion of the injury that occurred during the policy period.in considering the specific contract language,the district court explained a lthough the language varies slightly throughout the numerous policies,liberty obligations can be summarized as an obligation to pay all sums that plenco should be obligated to pay as the result of personal injury that occurred during the policy period.
there are two within the all sums allocation debate.the first concerns the insurer defense obligations when an insured faces a claim that triggers one insurance policy.the second relates to the insurer indemnification obligations arising from adverse judgments and settlements against the insured.the wisconsin supreme court has held that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.reid benz.the duty of defense depends on the nature of the claim and has nothing to do with the merits of the claim.the duty to indemnify,in contrast,arises when the claim is within the parameters of the policy and the insured is adjudged liable.id.quoting elliott donahue.
duty to defend 
plenco argues that the policies unambiguously assign to liberty mutual an absolute duty to defend entire asbestos lawsuits,not just portions of such suits,and cites wisconsin case law to support its position.grube daun,t he insurance company must defend the action when some of the allegations in the complaint fall within the policy coverage because apportionment of responsibility for the defense is neither practical nor desirable.quoting engsberg town of milford.
liberty mutual contends that the policies definitions of bodily occurring during the policy period necessarily limits the insurer defense liability to the pro rata share that corresponds with the injury attributable to the policy period.it acknowledges that wisconsin law has imposed broad defense obligations on insurers when one policy is triggered,but argues that those obligations should not be imposed in this context where the defense obligation can be allocated easily.
the issue of allocating defense costs has been litigated in wisconsin courts,and the law appears to favor plenco position i f some coverage exists,the insurer must defend the entire action,even though certain allegations may fall outside the scope of coverage.fire ins.good humor.additionally,the proper procedure for an insurance company to follow when coverage is disputed is to request a bifurcated trial on the issues of coverage and liability and move to stay any proceedings on liability until the issue of coverage is resolved.reid,at citing elliott,at.liberty mutual has been defending plenco in its asbestos lawsuits for years there is no evidence in the record suggesting that liberty mutual contested its coverage of the alleged asbestos injuries at the outset of the lawsuits,so as to limit its defense costs,or that it sought to stay liability proceedings to challenge coverage.
we feel that wisconsin law generally requires insurers to defend suits in their entirety.nonetheless,this issue may become more complicated if wisconsin courts follow a pro rata allocation approach for indemnification liability.if damages are allocated between insurers based on the percent of the injury that happened in each policy period,the same principles of proration may support allocation of defense costs.as discussed below,we are asking the wisconsin supreme court to decided whether wisconsin law follows an all sums or pro rata allocation approach,and we ask that it consider the implications for both the insurer duty to defend and its duty to indemnify.we turn now to the latter.
duty to indemnify 
with respect to the indemnification of damages under the policies,plenco again argues that the plain language of the contracts dictates that liberty mutual is obligated to pay all sums not just some portion of the damages incurred by plenco.the insurance policies never mention proration of liability directly,and plenco asserts that if its insurer is only obligated to pay a pro rata share of the insured liability,plenco reasonable expectation of complete security in its insurance contracts would be violated.plenco contends that,at the very least,even if the all sums language is ambiguous in the policies,the ambiguity would weigh in favor of the insured and against the insurer who drafted the contract.
liberty mutual,on the other hand,argues that wisconsin courts would adopt a pro rata approach to alloc
