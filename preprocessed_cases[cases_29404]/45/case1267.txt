plaintiffs paula and paul decker sued their employer cc services,ccs for overtime wages under the fair labor standards act flsa,a.ccs contracts with insurance companies to provide claims processing services for auto,home,commercial,and farm policies.and decker were employed as claims adjusters at different levels of ccs hierarchy.suing individually and on behalf of four classes of claims adjusters,the plaintiffs contended that ccs improperly classified them as administrative employees exempt from flsa overtime requirements under a.
applying the department of labor short test for determining whether employees fall within the flsa administrative exemption,the district court concluded that the primary duties of all four positions involved matters directly related to management policies or general business operations and requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.accordingly,the court held the employees were exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the flsa and granted summary judgment for ccs.
on appeal the plaintiffs develop no substantive challenge to the district court ruling as it relates to three of the four classes of employees ccs field claims representative ii,field claims representative iii,and property specialist positions.as to these employees,they argue only that material issues of fact preclude summary judgment for ccs.but they failed to identify any real factual dispute specific to these employees.regarding the final group of occupying the position of material damage appraiser plaintiffs contend that the duties of this position do not directly relate to ccs management policies or general business operations and do not require the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.we disagree.
material damage appraisers provide claims adjustment services for ccs insurance company clients up to a limit of claims settlement authority and represent the face of ccs to the countless claimants with whom they interact.they spend much of their time in the field without direct supervision.they conduct investigations of first and automobile insurance claims interview claimants,witnesses,and law enforcement personnel estimate loss determine whether parts should be repaired or replaced negotiate with mechanics and body shops and draft final repair estimates and settle claims up to the limit of their settlement authority.these duties directly relate to ccs business operations and reflect a sufficient degree of discretion and independent judgment to qualify for the flsa administrative exemption.summary judgment was properly entered for ccs on all four classes of employees.
background 
ccs is engaged in the business of processing insurance claims for auto,home,commercial,and farm insurers.headquartered in bloomington,illinois,and administered through field offices,ccs claims division settled roughly million in claims in.the staff in each field office typically consists of property specialists,field claims representatives,and material damage appraisers mda,as well as other positions not relevant here.
mdas draw an annual salary of to and primarily handle automobile claims.they do not make coverage or liability determinations,which are typically made by field claims representatives or other claims agents.mdas are responsible for investigating auto accident damage,making repair or replacement determinations,drafting estimates,and settling claims of up to where liability has been established and coverage approved mdas spend much of their time in the field without direct supervision.moreover,because of appraisals assigned to mdas come from the home office and not the local field office,the field office supervisors do not exert much direct daily control over mdas.
investigating accident damage entails a physical inspection of the vehicle to ensure the actual damage and its cause correspond to the claimed damage and cause.the cause of the accident often dictates the applicable policy,comprehensive or collision and deductible.mdas may also interview claimants,witnesses,and where relevant,police personnel.if an mda notes inconsistencies or otherwise suspects fraud,he relays his observations to a ccs superior in charge of final liability and coverage determinations.
after documenting and investigating vehicle damage on a given claim,the mda prepares an estimate.the first step in this process is determining if the vehicle is irreparably damaged a structural total loss in industry parlance or if the cost of repair exceeds the vehicle value an economic total loss.the latter calculation is performed by inputting the vehicle identification number and damage estimate into a software program that red flags potential economic losses.if an mda suspects a structural total loss,he will relay that suspicion along with photos of the damage to a claims representative with final say as to whether the vehicle is a structural total loss.
if the vehicle is not a total loss,the mda must decide which parts to repair and which to replace.for repaired parts,the mda estimates the total labor costs based in part on his estimation of the man hours needed to complete the repair.in some instances body shops disagree with the mda projection,and the mda negotiates for an adjusted hours estimate.mdas might also adjust a repair estimate to account for betterment,a concept intended to reflect the fact that parts that were in good repair cost more to restore to their original preaccident condition than parts already in disrepair at the time of the accident.
mdas also estimate the cost of replacing any parts they deem beyond repair.they input a description of the part into a software program,which then generates an estimate based on labor costs and part price.in estimating the price for the part,the software detects the availability of used parts and automatically factors in that discount.the mda may override the software and allow for new parts,but only after documenting the reasons for his deviation on a file summary sheet all other deviations from ccs adjusting guidelines must similarly be memorialized.betterment adjustments may also affect replacement part estimates.
after projecting the repair and replacement costs,mdas draft a final damage estimate.while they are responsible for explaining the estimate to the claimant and answering any questions,mdas refer dissatisfied claimants to a ccs adjuster with authority to determine coverage and liability.if,however,the claimant is satisfied with the estimate and the claims representative has already determined liability,mdas may settle claims of up to their limit of authority.claims representatives need not formally approve the actual amount of settlement or underlying estimate,though they informally review an mda work for errors.ccs auditors also periodically audit mda estimates to ensure compliance with the adjusting guidelines and to gauge each mda leakage,that is,the percentage of total claims paid in error.
in addition to mdas,ccs field offices are also staffed with field claims representatives ii and iii and property specialists.employees with these titles generally receive a higher salary than mdas and are authorized to make final coverage and liability determinations and settle and more complicated claims.for reasons we will explain,further discussion of the duties of these positions is unnecessary for purposes of this appeal.
ccs classified its mdas,field claims representatives,and property specialists as administrative employees exempt from overtime wages otherwise mandated by the flsa.two ccs employees took issue with the classification and brought this collective action under the flsa.see b.ccs moved for summary judgment with respect to all four positions the plaintiffs for summary judgment as to the mda position.the district court granted ccs motion and the plaintiffs appealed.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of ccs.allen city of chicago,cir.we will affirm if,construing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs,there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and ccs is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the burden is on ccs to establish that an employee falls within the flsa administrative exemption.corning glass works brennan,d.determining the duties encompassed by an employee position is a question of fact determining the appropriate flsa classification is a question of law.icicle seafoods,worthington,d.
the flsa requires employers to pay overtime wages,one and times the regular rate for any hours worked in excess of per week.a.exempt from the overtime requirements,however,are workers employed in a bona fide administrative capacity.a.congress has charged the secretary of labor with issuing regulations defining and delimiting the term bona fide administrative capacity.id.in the secretary issued the short test for determining whether salaried employees engaged in nonmanual work a description the plaintiffs concede applies to them are employed in an administrative capacity.all regulatory citations will be to the code of federal regulations unless otherwise noted.at the heart of this appeal are the short test two duties requirements,that is,that the employee primary duties must directly relate to management policies or general business operations of the employer or the employer customers and include work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.demos city of indianapolis,cir.an employee title is not controlling courts instead must engage in a analysis of the employee duties and responsibilities.b.
in the secretary issued a comprehensive set of new regulations addressing the scope of the overtime exemptions,codified at.the regulations replaced the short test and the longer test at section a e with a general rule for determining whether an employee works in an administrative capacity.id.at.the general rule,however,merely restates the short test two duties requirements.a.indeed,the only differences between the short test and the new general rule are the salary requirement at least per week under the old rule versus per week under the new rule and the additional explanation that an administrative employee must exercise discretion or independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.a.while that qualifying phrase was not explicitly part of the old test,it was built into the old rule definition of discretion and independent judgment found elsewhere in the applicable regulations.see.at.in other words,the new general rule is essentially a simplified restatement of the old short test.
the regulations also list examples of jobs that generally satisfy the duties requirements for administrative employees.included in that list are insurance claims adjusters,if their duties include activities such as interviewing insureds,witnesses,and physicians inspecting property damage reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates evaluating and making recommendations regarding coverage of claims determining liability and total value of a claim negotiating settlements and making recommendations regarding litigation.id.a.
because the regulations took effect after the plaintiffs brought this action,the old short test still determines whether they fall within the administrative exemption.see kennedy commonwealth edison,cir explaining that the regulations do not apply retroactively.but the new regulations are nonetheless informative on the issues before us in this appeal.the secretary of labor has characterized the promulgation of the new rules as an effort to consolidate and streamline the dense and unwieldy regulatory text of the old regulations.at.as we have noted,the regulations did not substantively alter the old short test to the contrary,the secretary undertook the regulatory revision to streamline the existing regulations by adopting a single standard duties test for each exemption category,rather than the existing long and short duties test structure.id.the secretary also described section,which lists examples of jobs that would be deemed administrative and therefore exempt from overtime pay,as consistent with the old regulations and case law.id.at see also in re farmers ins,cir section does not represent a change in the law.geico,d,same.
a.the mda position 
the directly related requirement 
for mdas to fall within the administrative exemption,ccs must first establish that their primary duties consist of work directly related to management policies or general business operations of the employer or the employer customers.this requirement encompasses those types of activities relating to the administrative operations of a business as distinguished from production or,in a retail or service establishment,sales work.id.a.the administrative operations of the business include the work performed by employees engaged in servicing a business as,for example,advising the management,planning,negotiating,representing the company,purchasing,promoting sales,and business research and control.id.b.the directly related requirement also limits the administrative exemption to persons who perform work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business of his employer or his employer customers.id.a.accordingly,the directly related component of the short test requires that the employee duties involve the administrative operations of the business,as distinct from production or sales work and be of substantial importance to the business or its customers.
ccs is in the business of processing claims brought by policyholders and other claimants against the insurance policies of its insurance company clients.mdas handle of all claims processed by ccs.a large percentage of those claims involve auto damage totaling less than,which mdas investigate,adjust,and settle with only minimal oversight.in so doing,mdas are required to analyze data and draw conclusions which are important to the determination of ccs policy.c.consequently,mdas play a significant role in the service ccs provides to its clients.mdas are at the front lines of ccs auto claims adjusting operation they spend most of their time in the field and represent the face of ccs to the claimants and mechanics with whom they interact.see id.b.investigating,estimating,and ultimately settling auto damage claims is obviously work of substantial importance to ccs business operations and is the core service it provides to its customers id.a.indeed,the plaintiffs have not mounted a serious challenge to ccs claim that an mda duties are of substantial importance to its business.as such,they have essentially conceded the point.see united states duran,cir.
the plaintiffs do argue,however,that the duties of an mda are not properly characterized as administrative for purposes of the first aspect of the directly related requirement.they contend mdas are the postindustrial equivalent of production workers and thus are not involved in ccs administrative operations.the plaintiffs are correct that the directly related test seeks to distinguish exempt administrative work from nonexempt production or sales work.a kennedy,at.but their attempt to cast mdas as production workers founders for two reasons.
first,the plaintiffs make too much of the fact that ccs does not actually underwrite or sell insurance policies.the gist of the plaintiffs argument is that ccs produces services though not the underlying policies and therefore mdas are essentially responsible for producing ccs product.this argument hinges on a distinction between claims processing by insurance companies,which the plaintiffs view as ancillary to the production of the policies themselves,and outsourced claims processing of the type performed by cc s,which they interpret as a product unto itself.under the department of labor interpretive regulations,however,this distinction is immaterial,as administrative operations of a business may be those of the employer or the employer customers.see a,d emphasis added.ccs customers are insurance companies in the business of selling policies,and employees who process claims against those policies are performing an administrative function for ccs customers,a task that administers the policies produced by the insurers.
