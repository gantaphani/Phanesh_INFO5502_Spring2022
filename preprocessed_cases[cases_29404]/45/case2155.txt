background 
issued to coral and its president,irby,two identical commercial general liability policies.the policies provided a general aggregate limit of liability coverage other than operations of million as well as a separate aggregate limit of liability coverage for operations of million.
underlying litigation 
during the coverage period,coral and irby constructed a house for jorge perez in coconut grove,florida.the house included windows manufactured by pozzi and installed by coral subcontractor,brian scott builders,scott.the windows apparently were defectively installed by scott.after moving into the house in,perez complained of water damage to his home as a result of leakage around the windows.
perez filed suit in state court against pozzi,coral,and scott.pozzi entered into a settlement with perez,under which pozzi agreed to remedy the defective installation of the windows.in the same lawsuit,pozzi filed against coral for negligent supervision of scott.pozzi later added irby as a defendant on its.coral and irby made a claim under the policies,and asserted that the damages pozzi was seeking were not covered.
provided a defense for coral under a reservation of rights.paid perez for his claims for personal property damage caused by leakage from the windows,and perez released coral and irby from any liability.however,continued to maintain that there was no coverage for the costs of repair or replacement of the windows.
irby retained stanley klett as his attorney in the litigation with pozzi.according to irby,initially refused to pay for irby defense.klett scheduled a mediation for april at the mediation,took the position that there was no coverage.as a result,pozzi lawyers told to go home,and pozzi,coral,and irby continued settlement talks without.
at the mediation,the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle all claims among them.under the proposed settlement,pozzi would recover from coral and irby and release its claims against them,and coral and irby would assign to pozzi their insurance claims against.
just after the mediation,having been informed of the separate settlement discussions among pozzi,coral,and irby,had thomas berger,the defense lawyer it had retained for coral,file a notice of appearance on behalf of irby.agreed to defend irby under the same reservation of rights issued to coral,however,continued to refuse to reimburse klett irby for the fees klett had incurred in representing irby in the previous seven months.according to irby and klett,although berger and klett had communicated about the case,irby and klett were not informed prior to the filing of the notice of appearance that berger would be taking over irby representation.
shortly thereafter,coral and irby entered into a settlement with pozzi.as part of the settlement,pozzi,irby,and coral signed onto a consent judgment,which was entered by the state court.under the consent judgment,pozzi was entitled to recover from coral and irby in principal,in prejudgment interest,and interest at the statutory rate.also under the settlement,coral and irby assigned to pozzi their claims against and their rights under the policies.
b.this litigation 
pozzi then filed this lawsuit in the district court alleging that breached its insurance contract by denying coverage to coral and irby for pozzi claims in the underlying litigation,refusing to defend irby or reimburse his defense costs,and refusing to participate in the settlement count one.pozzi also asserted that conduct was in bad faith count two.pozzi further asserted that,as assignee of coral and irby rights under the policies,it was entitled to fees and costs incurred by coral and irby in prosecuting this action count three.filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief,seeking a determination that it had no duty to defend coral and irby and that there was no coverage under the policies for the claims asserted in the underlying litigation.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court concluded the policies provided coverage for the repair or replacement of the defective windows and that had breached its duty to defend irby.the district court thus granted partial summary judgment in favor of pozzi.
pozzi and then consented to the magistrate judge conducting the jury trial on the issues of damages under the policies,bad faith,and punitive damages.before the case was submitted for the jury consideration,moved for a directed verdict concluding that there was no bad faith and that punitive damages were inappropriate.the magistrate judge reserved ruling on motion and submitted the case to the jury.the jury returned a verdict for pozzi,found bad faith,and awarded in punitive damages against.
the jury also made the following findings in special interrogatories the settlement between coral or irby and pozzi was not the product of collusion or fraud pozzi and coral and irby acted reasonably and in good faith in settling the underlying lawsuit,but the settlement in the amount of,as specified in the consent judgment in the underlying litigation,was not reasonable and in good faith,and was a reasonable settlement amount acted in bad faith in denying coverage for the asserted by pozzi against coral and irby in the underlying litigation and in breaching its duty to defend irby and an award of in punitive damages was warranted.
the magistrate judge entered final judgment in favor of pozzi and awarded compensatory and punitive damages in the amounts specified by the jury.then moved for judgment as a matter of law on three issues,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support an award of punitive damages,that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of bad faith,and that,based on the evidence at trial,the policies did not provide coverage,and the district court had erred in awarding partial summary judgment in favor of pozzi on the coverage issue.in the alternative,sought a new trial on all issues.
the magistrate judge granted in part motion for judgment as a matter of law.specifically,the magistrate judge concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury finding of bad faith or its award of punitive damages and set aside the jury award.the magistrate judge also conditionally granted the motion for new trial on these issues,specifying that a new trial on bad faith and punitive damages should proceed in the event that its decision is reversed or vacated on appeal.the magistrate judge concluded that he was without authority to modify the district court earlier grant of partial summary judgment as to coverage.
ii.discussion 
coverage appeal 
on appeal,argues that its policies do not provide operations hazard pcoh coverage for repair or replacement of defective work.argues that under florida law,comprehensive general liability cgl policies,such as the here,cover bodily injury and property damage resulting from defective work,but not the repair or replacement of the work itself.
the district court rejected this argument,concluding that the policies unambiguously provided pcoh coverage for repair or replacement of defective work by a subcontractor.we first describe the relevant policy language and then outline the florida law.
the policies 
the policies provide coverage for sums that the insured coral is legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury and property damage caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and during the policy period.specifically,the policies state as follows 
insuring agreement.
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.we may at our discretion investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result 
b.this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if 
the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and 
the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.
the policies also specifically provide for pcoh coverage limited to million.the policies define operations hazard as including all property damage arising out of your product or your work,as follows 
operations hazard includes all bodily injury and property damage occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of your product or your work except 
products that are still in your physical possession or 
work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.
your work will be deemed completed at the earliest of the following times 
when all of the work called for in your contract has been completed.
when all of the work to be done at the site has been completed if your contract calls for work at more than one site.
when that part of the work done at a job site has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the same project.
work that may need service,maintenance,correction,repair or replacement,but which is otherwise complete,will be treated as completed.
c.this hazard does not include bodily injury or property damage arising out of 
the transportation of property,unless the injury or damage arises out of a condition in or on a vehicle created by the loading or unloading of it 
the existence of tools,uninstalled equipment or abandoned or unused materials 
products or operations for which the classification in this coverage part or in our manual of rules includes products or completed operations.
pozzi claims that the defective windows here were completed perez home,in which he that the damages arose out of that work and thus would fall within the pcoh coverage definition.
the policies further define your work to mean w ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf,emphasis added as follows 
your work means 
work or operations performed by you or on your behalf and 
materials,parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.
your work includes 
warranties or representations made at any time with respect to the fitness,quality,durability,performance or use of your work and 
b.the providing of or failure to provide warnings or instructions.
emphasis added.pozzi thus claims that the work performed by coral subcontractor scott is also covered under the policies.
the policies also define property damage to mean 
physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
thus,the main question is whether the pcoh coverage provided to coral and irby includes coral and irby liability for the repair or replacement of defective work performed by coral subcontractor.
exclusions 
the policies also contain two relevant exclusions,as follows 
exclusions 
this insurance does not apply to 
property damage to 
that particular part of any property that must be restored,repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on it.
paragraph of this exclusion does not apply to property damage included in the operations hazard.
property damage to your work arising out of it or any part of it and including in the operations hazard.
this exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.
first,exclusion j provides that the insurance does not apply to property damage to t hat particular part of any property that must be restored,repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on it.however,the policies further provide that this exclusion does not apply to property damage included in the operations hazard.thus,if the costs of repair or replacement are covered under the pcoh coverage,this exclusion does not affect coverage.
second,exclusion l excludes p roperty damage to your work arising out of any part of it and including in the operations hazard.however,the policies further provide that this exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.here,the damaged or defective work was performed on the insured coral behalf by the subcontractor scott.thus,this exclusion also is inapplicable.
because none of the exclusions applies,the main question in this appeal remains,as stated earlier,whether the policies pcoh coverage includes coral and irby liability for the cost of the repair or replacement of defective work performed by coral subcontractor.
lamarche shelby mutual insurance.
viewing the language of the policies in isolation,the district court conclusion that coverage exists arguably would seem to be proper.the policies clearly cover pcoh property damage caused by occurrences in the coverage territory during the coverage period.defective construction is an occurrence under florida law,see state farm fire cas.ctc dev,so d,and it is undisputed that the defective work here occurred in the coverage territory and during the coverage period.thus,according to pozzi,the costs of repair or replacement are covered under the pcoh provision because it is a sum the insureds coral and irby were legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage damaged,incorrectly installed windows arising out of the subcontractor scott work.
however,the florida supreme court in lamarche shelby mutual insurance,so d,concluded that cgl policies do not cover the costs of repair and replacement of defective work,but only cover any damage or injury resulting from the defective work.in lamarche,the lamarches entered into a building contract for the construction of their home.the general contractor work proved to be deficient,and the lamarches sought payment from the contractor cgl insurance company for the replacement and repair of the defective work.the florida supreme court concluded that the policy covered personal injury or property damage as a result of faulty work,but that no coverage existed for the replacement and repair costs 
to interpret the policy as providing coverage for construction deficiencies,as asserted by the petitioners and a minority of states,would enable a contractor to receive initial payment for the work from the homeowner,then receive subsequent payment from his insurance company to repair and correct deficiencies in his own work.we find this interpretation was not the intent of the contractor and the insurance company when they entered into the subject contract of insurance,and the language of the policy clearly excludes this type of coverage.rather than coverage and payment for building flaws or deficiencies,the policy instead covers damage caused by those flaws.
