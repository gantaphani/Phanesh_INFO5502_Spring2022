plaintiff and appellant luiz baek,a massage therapist employed by heaven massage and wellness center hmwc,was accused in an underlying action of sexually assaulting a client during a massage.in the present action,baek alleges that defendant and respondent continental casualty company continental,hmwc comprehensive general liability cgl insurer,had a duty to defend and indemnify him in that action,and that its failure to do so constituted breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.the trial court sustained continental demurrer to all causes of action,concluding as a matter of law that baek was not entitled to a defense under the continental policy.
we affirm.to demonstrate that he was insured under the policy,baek had to allege that the acts on which liability was based were with respect to the conduct of hmwc business,within the scope of employment,or committed while performing duties related to the conduct of hmwc business.because the intentional sexual assault alleged in the underlying case can not properly be characterized as within the scope of baek employment or having occurred while performing duties related to the conduct of hmwc business,baek was not insured under the policy,and continental had no duty of defense or indemnity.the trial court thus did not err in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.
factual and procedural background 
i.the jaime action 
in may,jaime sued hmwc and baek for sexual assault.super.county,the jaime action.the operative complaint alleged that during a massage on january,baek touched,fondled,rubbed,grabbed and squeezed plaintiff breasts,buttocks,inner thighs and genitals,all while making and emitting moans,groans,grunts and other sounds and noises of sexual pleasure.the complaint alleged seven causes of action against hmwc and baek sexual harassment,sexual battery,assault,battery,false imprisonment,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligence.
hmwc tendered jaime claim to continental,which had issued hmwc a cgl policy for the period november,to november,the continental policy.continental denied hmwc claim,asserting there was no coverage because the policy professional services exclusion applied and excluded losses from b odily injury,property damage,or personal and advertising injury caused by the rendering or failure to render any professional service.hmwc then against continental for breach of insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the trial court granted summary judgment for continental on the,concluding there was no coverage under the continental policy and no duty to defend.hmwc appealed,and we reversed,concluding as a matter of law that jaime claim did not fall within the professional services exclusion because a sexual assault that occurs during the rendering of a professional service is not injury caused by the rendering of a professional service within the meaning of the policy.heaven massage and wellness center continental casualty company june,nonpub.opn.at.
ii.the present complaint and demurrer 
baek filed the present action against continental on october.the trial court sustained a demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend,and baek filed the operative second amended complaint complaint on may.the complaint alleges that continental owed baek a duty of defense and indemnity in the jaime action because baek was alleged to be either a partner or employee of hmwc and,as such,was an additional insured under the continental policy.the complaint asserts that continental failure to defend and indemnify baek gave rise to three causes of action breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.
continental demurred.it asserted that as a partner or employee,baek was covered by the continental policy only for acts within the scope of his employment by hmwc or while performing duties related to the conduct of hmwc business but not if the bodily injury arose out of his providing or failing to provide professional health care services.continental asserted that this court prior opinion compelled the conclusion that baek alleged sexual assault was not within the scope of his employment because baek alleged acts were not part of the professional services he was hired to perform,they are necessarily outside the scope of his employment.and,because the acts charged against him were outside the scope of his employment,he does not qualify as an insured under his employer liability policy.
baek opposed the demurrer.he noted that jaime had alleged he was a partner or employee of hmwc,an allegation continental was required to accept as true.thus,baek said,he was an insured under the continental policy because all the tortious acts jaime alleged arose out of hmwc business or were committed while performing duties related to the conduct of hmwc business,during the performance of a massage.
on august,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.its written order said baek sexual battery was not committed within the course and scope of his employment as a masseu r,was not apparently done for the purpose of carrying on hmwc business as a provider of massage services,and was not ca us ally connected to hmwc business as a provider of massage services.baek was not covered or potentially covered under the hmwc policy.as a result,continental did not breach the insurance contract,or the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,by refusing to defend baek or by refusing to reimburse baek for his defense costs.if there was no potential coverage for baek,continental can not have breached its duty reasonably to inform an insured of the insured rights and obligations under the insurance policy.plaintiff fails to suggest how it is possible to cure,and indeed,has failed to cure despite opportunity.
judgment was entered august,and notice of entry of judgment was served august.baek timely appealed.

overview of issues 
the sole named insured under the continental policy was heaven massage wellness center,identified in the insurance declarations as a p artnership.as relevant here,the policy also identified the following additional insureds 
members and partners if you are designated in the declarations as a partnership or joint venture,you are an insured.your members,your partners and their spouses are also insureds,but only with respect to the conduct of your business.italics added.
employees each of the following is also an insured your employees,but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.italics added.
baek contends continental owed him a duty of defense because the complaint in the underlying action alleged that baek was either a partner or an employee of hmwc,and the alleged sexual assault occurred in the scope of baek employment or while performing duties relating to the conduct of hmwc business.continental disagrees,contending that baek has never alleged that he is a partner or employee,and thus he is not an additional insured under the policy.further,even if baek had alleged he was a partner or employee,he would be an additional insured under the continental policy only with respect to the conduct of hmwc business,for acts within the scope of employment,or while performing duties related to the conduct of hmwc business.because the alleged acts of sexual battery can not properly be characterized as relating to the conduct of hmwc business or within the scope of baek employment,baek can not be an additional insured under the continental policy.
in the sections that follow,we review the legal principles applicable to interpreting insurance contracts.we then apply these principles to conclude that regardless of his employment status,baek is not an additional insured under the continental policy because the sexual misconduct alleged in the jaime action can not be characterized as relating to or arising out of baek employment relationship with hmwc.we thus affirm the order sustaining the demurrer.

a n insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.citations.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,the insurer must defend any claim that would be covered if it were true,even if it is groundless,false or fraudulent.gray zurich insurance cal d,implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.horace mann ins.barbara cal th.thus,when a suit against an insured alleges a claim that potentially could subject the insured to liability for covered damages,an insurer must defend unless and until the insurer can demonstrate,by reference to undisputed facts,that the claim can not be covered.in order to establish a duty to defend,an insured need only establish the existence of a potential for coverage while to avoid the duty,the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.citation.ringler associates maryland casualty th,fn.omitted.doubts concerning the potential for coverage and the existence of a duty to defend are resolved in favor of the insured.montrose chemical superior court cal th,palp,williamsburg national ins.th.
iii.baek was not an additional insured under the continental policy 
baek employment relationship with hmwc 
continental urges that baek can not be an additional insured under the policy because he does not allege in the complaint that he was an employee or a partner of hmwc.emphasis omitted.instead,continental says,he alleges he was an independent contractor,an allegation established as true by baek own material allegations.
we do not agree.baek complaint alleges that baek executed an independent contractor agreement with hmwc but that continental nonetheless knew at that early stage of the litigation indeed before even any appearance had been made by the defendants that no determination had yet been made regarding baek status hmwc.continental knew that jaime would attempt to prove that baek was hmwc employee or had some other status partner,with hmwc that would make hmwc vicariously liable for his alleged conduct and which would provide a basis for coverage under the continental policy.continental also knew that there was a potential for coverage for baek under its policy since there was a question of disputed fact regarding his status as an employee.because the underlying case settled,no conclusive judicial determination was ever made regarding baek relationship to hmwc.thus,it could have been established at trial in the underlying action that baek was an employee,partner or had some other relationship to hmwc entitling him to coverage under the continental policy as,for example,hmwc employee.
as the language makes clear,although in the complaint baek admitted he signed an independent contractor agreement,he did not allege he was an independent contractor.we therefore do not agree with continental that baek allegations regarding his employment status are inconsistent with coverage.
in any event,it is jaime allegations,not baek,that give rise to a potential duty to defend.t he carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.citations.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.citations.wausau underwriters ins.unigard security ins.th.thus,in resolving the question whether a duty to defend exists,the insurer has a higher burden than the insured.t he insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.american states ins.progressive casualty ins.th.
an insurer duty to defend arises when tender is made.it obligates the insurer,unless no part of any claim is potentially covered,to fund a defense to minimize the insured liability.citation.the housing group pma capital ins.th,italics added.s ometimes it will not be clear whether an action brought against the indemnitee is within the scope of the indemnity until after the underlying action has been resolved.in those situations,the duty to defend nonetheless arises.that is to say,the law implies in every indemnity contract,unless the contract provides to the contrary,the duty to defend claims which,at the time of tender,allege facts that would give rise to a claim of indemnity.crawford weather shield,cal th.city of bell superior court th.the duty to defend continues until the lawsuit is concluded or until the insurer shows that facts extrinsic to the third party complaint conclusively negate the potential for coverage.sprinkles associated indemnity th.
because the duty to defend arises when a potential insured tenders his or her claim,baek allegations in the present action about his employment relationship with hmwc are irrelevant to continental duty to defend.instead,we look to jaime allegations in the underlying action about baek status.the operative complaint in the jaime action alleged that at all relevant times,baek was the agent,managing agent,principal,owner,partner,joint venturer,representative,supervisor,manager,servant,employee of hmwc.continental was bound to accept these allegations as true unless extrinsic facts known to continental established otherwise,federal ins.steadfast ins.th,if,as a matter of law,there is no potential for coverage based on the allegations in the complaint or the extrinsic facts known to the insurer,then there is no duty to defend.we therefore assume for purposes of this appeal that baek was a partner or employee of hmwc and consider whether the allegations of jaime complaint give rise to a duty to defend.
b.the sexual assault alleged by jaime was not within the scope of employment 
the sole named insured under the continental policy was heaven massage wellness center,identified in the insurance declarations as a p artnership.as we have said,the policy also provided coverage to hmwc employees for acts within the scope of their employment.italics added.we thus address whether the sexual assault alleged in the jaime action was within the scope of baek employment.
in lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital cal th lisa,our supreme court rejected the contention that a hospital ultrasound technician sexual molestation of a patient during an ultrasound exam was within the scope of his employment.there,in the course of conducting an ultrasound of a pregnant woman,the technician inserted the ultrasound wand and his fingers into her vagina,telling her that he needed to excite her to get a good view of the baby.id.at.the court noted that the assaultive acts were causally related to the technician employment in the sense they would not have occurred had he not been so employed.the technician employment as an ultrasound technician provided the opportunity for him to meet plaintiff and to be alone with her in circumstances making the assault possible.the employment was thus one necessary cause of the ensuing tort.id.at.nonetheless,the sexual assault was not engendered by or an outgrowth of the technician employment.the court explained as with nonsexual assaults,a sexual tort will not be considered engendered by the employment unless its motivating emotions were fairly attributable to events or conditions.here the opposite was true a technician simply took advantage of solitude with a naive patient to commit an assault for reasons unrelated to his work.the technician job was to perform a diagnostic examination and record the results.the task provided no occasion for a dispute or any other emotional involvement with the patient.the technician decision to engage in conscious exploitation of the patient did not arise out of the performance of the examination,although the circumstances of the examination made it possible.if the assault was not motivated or triggered off by anything in the employment activity but was the result of only propinquity and lust,there should be no liability.citation.id.at.
the result was unchanged,the court said,by the fact that the technician job involved intimate physical contact with patients.it explained in our view,that a job involves physical contact is,by itself,an insufficient basis on which to impose vicarious liability for a sexual assault.citation.to hold medical care providers strictly liable for deliberate sexual assaults by every employee whose duties include examining or touching patients otherwise private areas would be virtually to remove scope of employment as a limitation on providers vicarious liability.in cases like the present one,a deliberate sexual assault is fairly attributed not to any peculiar aspect of the health care enterprise,but only to propinquity and lust citation.lisa,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.the court concluded although the routine examination the technician was authorized to conduct involved physical contact with lisa,his assault on plaintiff did not originate with,and was not a generally foreseeable consequence of,that contact.nothing happened during the course of the prescribed examinations to provoke or encourage the technician improper touching of plaintiff.citations.the assault,rather,was the independent product of his aberrant decision to engage in conduct unrelated to his duties.id.at.
the court reached a similar conclusion in farmers ins.group county of santa clara cal th farmers ins.there,the court considered whether a deputy sheriff tortious acts lewdly proposition ing and offensively touch ing other deputy sheriffs working at the county jail were within the scope of his employment.id.at.the court concluded they were not.it explained that if an employee tort is personal in nature,mere presence at the place of employment and attendance to occupational duties prior or subsequent to the offense will not bring the tort within the scope of employment.id.at.the deputy requests for sexual favors and inappropriate touching were motivated for strictly personal reasons unrelated to the guarding of inmates or the performance of any other duty of a deputy sheriff at a county jail,and thus were not within the scope of the employment.id.at.
the present case is analogous.as in lisa and farmers,baek employment as a massage therapist provided him the opportunity to meet jaime and to be alone with her,but nothing alleged in the underlying complaint suggested that the alleged assault was engendered by or an outgrowth of his employment in that its motivating emotions were fairly attributed to events or conditions.lisa,supra,cal th at.instead,as in lisa,the opposite was true as alleged in the complaint,baek simply took advantage of solitude with a naive client to commit an assault for reasons unrelated to his work.ibid.thus,as in the cases cited above,the alleged sexual assault was not an act within the scope of baek employment within the meaning of the continental policy.
c.the alleged sexual assault did not occur while performing duties related to the conduct of hmwc business or with respect to the conduct of hmwc business 
as we have said,the continental policy covered hmwc partners with respect to the conduct of hmwc business,and hmwc employees while performing duties related to the conduct of hmwc business.we therefore consider whether the alleged sexual misconduct can properly be so characterized.for the reasons that follow,it can not.
we are unaware of any california cases and the parties have not cited us to any that have considered whether sexual misconduct at work can be said to occur while performing duties related to the conduct of an insured business.several courts have considered the issue,however,concluding that a sexual assault does not come within this phrase,even if it occurs at the place of work and during the work day.
chestnut associates,assurance of america d wl chestnut associates is one such case.there,plaintiffs in an underlying action sued chestnut,a pool service company,alleging that while servicing plaintiffs pool,a chestnut employee removed his clothes,sexually pleasured himself in the pool and brought this sexual behavior to conclusion by casting ejaculate into plaintiffs pool.id.at wl at.plaintiffs sued chestnut for emotional distress,mental anguish,embarrassment,humiliation,loss of dignity,and diminution of the value of their house,and chestnut tendered the claim to its insurer,which denied it.ibid.chestnut then brought a separate action against the insurer,seeking a declaration that the insurer owed a duty to defend.id.at wl at.
the district court granted summary judgment for the insurer.it noted that the applicable cgl policy provided coverage for employees for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.chestnut associates,supra,d at wl at,italics added.it reasoned that the alleged tortious act did not come within either category n o reasonable jury could ever find the wrongful acts of the pool service technician were done while performing duties related to the conduct of chestnut business or acts within the scope of his employment.the alleged wrongful conduct was not of the kind the pool service technician was hired to perform.the pool service technician had stepped away from his employer business at the time the tort was committed,performing the alleged wrongful acts solely for his own benefit.based on the facts alleged in the underlying complaint,the pool service technician was not an insured under chestnut policy,emphasis omitted.
the court similarly concluded in parts utica mut.ins.d parts.there,an employee sued her employer and manager,alleging that the manager sexually assaulted her in the basement of the employer store.id.at.defendants tendered the claim to the employer insurer,which denied it,and defendants then sued the insurer for declaratory relief.id.at.in that action,the manager contended he was an additional insured under the employer cgl policy,which defined insureds as employees or managers acting within the scope of their employment or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.id.at,emphasis omitted.
the district court held that the manager was not an additional insured as a matter of law because the alleged sexual assault did not occur while the manager was performing duties related to the conduct of the employer business.it explained the case before the court is somewhat analogous to selective ins.oglebay,cir unpublished per curiam.in that case,a driving instructor was alleged to have sexually molested a student,and the fourth circuit concluded that a driving instructor was not an insured under the policy and thus the insurer did not have a duty to defend because the molestation was not an act of employment as contemplated by the policy.id.although the manager acts were committed during the time or at the place related to his employment,those acts were certainly not the performance of a duty related to the conduct of the insured business accordingly,the court concludes that,for purposes of this case,the manager is simply not an insured.parts,supra,d at,emphasis omitted.
the present case is analogous.although the alleged sexual assault of jaime occurred during a massage,the particular acts on which liability is premised,touch in
