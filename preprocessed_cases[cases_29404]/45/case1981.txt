these three appeals are the latest round in a seemingly bout of litigation between mydrin,and travelers casualty and surety company formerly,aetna casualty and surety company,one of mydrin insurers.all three appeals stem from a dispute over travelers coverage of mydrin for losses resulting from lawsuits filed against mydrin by two of its customers.
travelers brings two appeals.the first is from an order of the district court declining to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act,a,over a declaratory relief complaint filed by travelers against mydrin in federal district court the action.the second is from the district court order declining jurisdiction and remanding a separate declaratory relief action subsequently brought in state court by mydrin against travelers and removed to the district court by travelers the removed action.finally,two of travelers attorneys appeal the district court imposition of rule sanctions upon them for their conduct in removing mydrin action.
we dismiss the first appeal for lack of jurisdiction,reverse and remand in the second,and reverse in the third.because we reject the district court order declining jurisdiction over the removed action,the protracted jurisdictional squabbles in this litigation are finally at an end,and the district court may proceed to determine the merits of the coverage dispute.
background 
the background of this litigation is well laid out in this court decision,united national insurance r d latex,cir hereinafter latex.we draw largely from that opinion in this section.because after years of litigation jurisdiction is still the principal issue in dispute,there are few facts but a great deal of procedural history to relate.
a.the underlying litigation 
mydrin,and its predecessor in interest,r d latex corporation,manufactured and sold glue for use in tufted carpeting.two carpet makers,royalty carpet mills royalty and western dyeing and finishing corporation western,brought separate actions against mydrin in los angeles superior court alleging that mydrin product was defective.the complaints asserted claims for,inter alia,breach of contract and breach of express and implied warranties.the western action was settled by the parties in early,but,at least as of the time of oral argument,the royalty suit was still pending.
travelers,one of mydrin several insurers initially agreed to defend mydrin,but reserved the right to be reimbursed for the costs of doing so should it later be determined that insurance coverage was not available.travelers claims to have spent over defending mydrin in the underlying cases before cutting off financial support in.
travelers action 
in october,travelers brought suit against mydrin,royalty,and western in the central district of california seeking two remedies a declaratory judgment that travelers had no duty to defend indemnify mydrin in either the royalty or western action and a reimbursement of defense costs already advanced in the two cases.travelers suit,along with similar ones brought by two of mydrin other insurers united national insurance company and birmingham fire insurance was assigned to judge real.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of united,and several weeks later also granted partial summary judgment in favor of travelers on its claim for declaratory relief regarding its duties to defend and to indemnify mydrin in the royalty action.because travelers also raised claims for declaratory relief relating to the western action and sought reimbursement of defense costs in both cases,the decisions granting the two summary judgment motions did not constitute a final disposition of the consolidated cases.travelers and mydrin remedied this lack of finality by entering into a stipulation that,because the coverage issues related to the western action were virtually identical to those of the royalty action,the royalty order was deemed to adjudicate the western action as well.as part of that same stipulation,travelers dismiss ed without prejudice its claim for relief for reimbursement of defense costs.
once the stipulation had been implemented by the district court,mydrin appealed,arguing inter alia that the district court erred in exercising its discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act over the consolidated cases this court vacated the judgment and remanded to the district court to consider the propriety of its exercise of discretionary jurisdiction.united ins.mydrin,wl,at cir.
on remand,the district court,over mydrin objection,summarily reaffirmed its earlier decision,after finding that jurisdiction was proper.the district court did not,however,state its reasons for asserting jurisdiction.when mydrin appealed a second time,we again returned the case to the district court to consider the jurisdictional question,holding that the requirement that the district court articulate its rationale for exercising jurisdiction was the law of the case,and that the district court was required to abide by it.additionally,we held that even if it had jurisdiction,the court should not have granted summary judgment to united or travelers because issues of material fact remained in the case.in remanding to the district court,we ordered the case reassigned to a new district judge,stating 
judge real has twice granted summary judgment to united national and travelers and has failed to articulate his reasons for exercising discretionary jurisdiction.in light of the history of this litigation,we conclude that if this case were before him for a third time he would have substantial difficulty in putting his previously expressed views out of his mind.
r d latex,at.
the case was reassigned to judge baird.in december,the district court declined to exercise discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act,and therefore dismissed the action without prejudice.the court found the exercise of jurisdiction inappropriate for several reasons,principally because disposition of the controversy would have entailed needless determination of state law issues overlapping those raised in the underlying litigation.
although the district court dismissal of the case rested on a decision not to exercise discretionary jurisdiction,it also noted an unresolved question regarding subject matter jurisdiction.travelers complaint had not pled facts adequate to make out diversity jurisdiction,nor had it alleged the existence of federal question jurisdiction.subject matter jurisdiction is a necessary predicate to the issuance of a declaratory judgment,so if subject matter jurisdiction over travelers action could not be established,the question whether to exercise discretionary jurisdiction would not arise.american casualty krieger,cir.for purposes of the dismissal order,the district court assumed that travelers could properly plead diversity,and proceeded to dismiss the action on grounds of discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act.
travelers filed a motion for reconsideration,attacking the basis for the dismissal and explaining,with attached evidentiary support,that the parties were in fact diverse.shortly thereafter,travelers filed a notice of appeal,stating in the notice that pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure a c,the appeal was tolled pending the district court resolution of travelers motion for reconsideration.
after full briefing on the issue,the district court denied reconsideration of its dismissal order.on the same day,it issued an order to show cause osc requesting that travelers plead the principal places of business of the parties in order to demonstrate diversity.
disappointed with the dismissal of its declaratory judgment action,travelers responded to the osc with what appears to be a bit of legal gamesmanship.it stated that it had interpreted the osc as providing leave indeed requiring travelers to file an amended complaint,and submitted a complaint repleading the reimbursement claim it had dropped over three years earlier,ostensibly so as not to waive its right to repayment travelers then argued that the district court jurisdiction over the newly resurrected reimbursement claim was mandatory,and that the existence of mandatory jurisdiction with respect to that claim required the court to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction over the claim for declaratory relief mydrin opposed the amendment,arguing that the osc sought only correction of travelers faulty diversity pleading,and that travelers could not rely on that order to revive its reimbursement claim.
the district court never adjudicated the controversy as to whether travelers could retrieve the reimbursement claim from the dustbin to which it had been relegated years earlier.instead,the district court concluded that,in view of travelers notice of appeal,it lacked jurisdiction over what it construed as travelers motion for leave to amend.
mydrin removed action 
two weeks after the district court dismissed travelers complaint,mydrin brought suit against travelers in los angeles superior court seeking a declaration that travelers had a duty to defend and indemnify mydrin in the underlying litigation.travelers timely removed mydrin action to the federal district court for the central district of california on grounds of diversity.
when removing mydrin action,travelers attorneys submitted a pleading that would later trigger the imposition of rule sanctions by judge baird they filed a notice of related cases indicating that the removed case should be assigned to judge whom this court had specifically taken away the earlier,related only in the alternative to judge whom the related case had been reassigned.travelers notice of related cases at because the honorable manuel real has addressed the merits and substance of this dispute on three earlier actions,and the honorable lourdes baird has addressed only a discrete procedural issue following the second remand from the ninth circuit travelers respectfully submits that this matter should be related to judge real for all purposes.this brazen suggestion notwithstanding,the case was eventually assigned to judge baird.
shortly after removing mydrin action,travelers filed a counterclaim seeking reimbursement for the money it had spent defending mydrin.the upshot was that the district court once again had before it a request for declaratory judgment on travelers duty to mydrin in the underlying litigation,and a claim by travelers for reimbursement of its costs already expended.and once again,battle was joined not on the merits but on the issue of jurisdiction.
mydrin moved for the district court to decline jurisdiction and remand the case to state court,a motion travelers opposed on the ground that federal jurisdiction over the reimbursement counterclaim is mandatory.the district court sided with mydrin,remanding the case to state court for reasons similar to those supporting its dismissal of the action,and holding that the counterclaim did not provide an independent,nondiscretionary basis for jurisdiction but instead was entirely derivative of mydrin claim for declaratory relief.travelers appeals that second on today bill of fare.
rule sanctions 
the same day it issued the remand order,the district court issued an order to show cause why travelers three attorneys of record should not each be sanctioned pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure for making statements in the notice of related cases that the court deemed disingenuous.following a hearing,the district court imposed sanctions on two of the three lawyers in the amount of each to arrive at that figure,the court began with the number of hours that judge baird and judge morrow to whom the case was first randomly assigned spent in determining that judge baird should hear the case,multiplied that number by the national law journal s estimate of the average hourly billing rate of partners in los angeles law firms,and then divided that sum by two.
another appeal followed,this one by the sanctioned lawyers,bringing us to a total of three orders under review today.
ii.discussion 
travelers action 
we begin with the district court order declining jurisdiction over the action.we do not reach the merits of the controversy here,however,because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal 
the absence of final judgment.an appeal of right may be taken only by filing a valid notice of appeal.a.once a notice of appeal takes effect,the district court loses jurisdiction over the matter placed before the appellate court.the notice of appeal in this case did not,however,divest the district court of jurisdiction at the time it was filed because there was then a pending motion for reconsideration.a b i.the question is whether the notice of appeal was perfected by events subsequent to its filing but before the filing of the amended complaint containing the reimbursement claim.
mydrin urges us to answer this question in the affirmative.pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure a b i,mydrin argues,the notice of appeal became effective,and the district court lost jurisdiction,as soon as the court denied travelers motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order.ordinarily,we would agree.but here there were unusual circumstances that call into question the finality of the court order denying reconsideration.
the same day the district court issued that order,it issued the osc requesting that travelers properly plead diversity.the clear implication of the osc is that travelers was given leave to amend its complaint with respect to diversity jurisdiction,and given the timing of the osc,such amendment could not have been due until after the motion for reconsideration had been denied.
in wmx technologies,miller,cir en banc,we held that if a plaintiff has been given leave to amend its complaint,a further district court determination constituting final judgment must be obtained before an appeal may be brought.id.at.thus,where,as here,the district court makes statements clearly contemplating that an amendment may be made,there can be no finality,and no appeal,until a further,final judgment is entered.id.at.because in this case no final judgment was entered after the osc granting leave to amend,no appeal could lie,and the district court had jurisdiction over travelers motion to replead its reimbursement claim 
the rule.having determined that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal,we must nevertheless address certain issues raised here because their resolution will affect the nature of the district court proceedings after dismissal of this first appeal.
at the heart of travelers challenge is its claim for reimbursement,which,according to travelers,renders federal jurisdiction mandatory over the entire action.as recounted above,the reimbursement claim was dismissed by travelers in the joint stipulation submitted to judge real,then resuscitated after judge baird made clear her intention to dismiss travelers claim for declaratory relief.by travelers lights,the demise and resurrection of the reimbursement claim ought to be disregarded.that is so,according to travelers,because the district court decision regarding discretionary jurisdiction must be based on the facts as they existed at the time the complaint was filed.therefore,travelers contends,judge baird should have assumed when assessing her jurisdiction that a reimbursement claim was properly before her since such a claim was pled in travelers original complaint.
in the present posture of this,because appellate jurisdiction is argument takes on a different significance than the one anticipated in the parties briefing.if travelers is correct that events are not relevant to the assessment of discretionary jurisdiction,then the motion for leave to amend to add the reimbursement claim becomes moot for purposes of this appeal.we would therefore remand to the district court only for the limited,ministerial purpose of entering final judgment,so that we could decide now how the presence of the reimbursement claim affects discretionary jurisdiction.if,however,travelers is incorrect,then the district court would have to decide travelers motion for leave to replead the reimbursement claim,a decision we would review for abuse of discretion.california,cir.in that circumstance,the appeal could not proceed until the district court acts on that motion on its merits and then enters a final judgment.
there is some authority for travelers contention that courts assessing discretionary jurisdiction should look to the facts extant when the complaint was filed.see golden eagle ins.travelers,cir t he propriety of the district court assumption of jurisdiction is judged as of the time of filing,not the time of appeal.quoting employers reinsurance karussos,cir,both golden eagle and karussos overruled on other grounds by government employees insurance dizol,cir en banc maryland casualty knight,cir the propriety of the district court exercise of jurisdiction is judged as of the time of filing.
these cases,however,are not controlling here.to begin with,the cases applying the rule were decided in the regime,in which the district court was required sua sponte to make findings in support of its exercise of discretionary jurisdiction.see,paul fire marine ins,cir.not so after dizol,which held that such findings are necessary only if a party moves the court to decline jurisdiction.at.krieger suggests that the rule did not survive this change unaffected.at under dizol,the court was entitled to evaluate the motion to decline jurisdiction under the circumstances existing at the time the issue was raised rather than at the time of filing of the complaint.
in any event,the after dizol and krieger,perhaps,the not meant to be invoked in the context in which travelers now urges us to apply it.the purpose of the rule is to promote judicial economy and to advance the causes of comity and federalism by avoiding needless resolution of questions.karussos,at.the cases on which travelers relies have applied the rule to only one changed condition the termination of parallel proceedings.no case has held that changes to the scope or content of the federal litigation itself are not pertinent to the exercise of declaratory judgment act jurisdiction over that very action.
no valid as judicial economy,comity,or be served by compelling the district court to disregard travelers voluntary dismissal of its reimbursement claim.indeed,we encourage district courts assessing discretionary jurisdiction to take note of all existing circumstances internal to the lawsuit in front of them that bear on the jurisdictional issue.in first state insurance callan associates,cir,for example,we reversed the dismissal of a declaratory judgment action,noting that the parties joint case management conference statement revealed a claim for recission over which jurisdiction was mandatory.id.at.
similarly,in this case we conclude that the district court properly took account of travelers dismissal of its reimbursement claim when assessing discretionary jurisdiction.it is for the district court,then,to determine whether travelers may replead the reimbursement claim in its amended complaint 
mydrin removed action 
turning to the second appeal on today docket,we now consider whether the district court properly remanded the removed action to state court we review the court remand order for abuse of discretion.wilton seven falls,d.whether the district court has mandatory jurisdiction over the reimbursement claim is a question of law that we review de novo.general dynamics united states,cir.
travelers contends that the district court has mandatory jurisdiction over the reimbursement counterclaim in this action,and that therefore the court must accept jurisdiction over the claim for declaratory judgment.
background.our cases concerning the scope of the district court discretion to decline jurisdiction over declaratory claims joined with other causes of action have been less than crystal clear.in general,we have applied the principle that when other claims are joined with an action for declaratory relief,bad faith,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,rescission,or claims for other monetary relief,the district court should not,as a general rule,remand or decline to entertain the claim for declaratory relief.dizol,at see also chamberlain allstate ins,cir maryland cas,paul,snodgrass provident life and acc.ins,cir per curiam.
on two occasions,however,we have concluded that the presence of claims for monetary relief did not require the district court to accept jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act.karussos,cir golden eagle,cir both cases involved claims for declaratory judgment and contribution brought by an insurance company against another insurance company,seeking adjudication of their respective obligations to a policyholder with respect to underlying litigation.both times we concluded that,despite requests for monetary relief,the actions were primarily declaratory in nature and therefore jurisdiction remained discretionary.
in snodgrass,after the general clarification of this area of law provided by en banc consideration in dizol,we offered the following guidance to district courts seeking to determine whether jurisdiction over actions with both declaratory and monetary claims remained discretionary under karussos,or was rendered mandatory under the principle articulated in dizol the appropriate inquiry for a district court in a declaratory judgment act case is to determine whether there are claims in the case that exist independent of any request for purely declaratory relief,that is,claims that would continue to exist if the request for a declaration simply dropped from the case.snodgrass,at see also id.at karussos does not control where independent claims for monetary relief are joined with a request for declaratory judgment.paul fire,at karussos does not apply where the damages claim is a counterclaim independently sustainable under diversity jurisdiction.
it appears the district court believed that,for purposes of this analysis,two claims are independent of one another only if one can be resolved without disposing of the legal issues raised in the other.thus,the court determined that the reimbursement claim here was not independent of the declaratory claim,but rather derivative of it.we do not believe this is the proper analysis.a breach of contract claim could be deemed derivative of a declaratory claim raising the same substantive questions,yet the presence of the breach of contract claim would affect the district court discretionary jurisdiction.dizol,at.analogously,the rescission claim found to exist in callan required the court to travel through the same legal issues presented when the claim was construed as one for declaratory relief,yet we found jurisdiction to be mandatory in that case.callan.
analysis.the proper analysis,then,must be whether the claim for monetary relief is independent in the sense that it could be litigated in federal court even if no declaratory claim had been filed.in other words,the district court should consider whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over the monetary claim alone,and if so,whether that claim must be joined with one for declaratory relief.
here,the district court subject matter jurisdiction over travelers counterclaim for reimbursement is not in dispute so the question we face is whether the request for reimbursement could have been sustained in federal court in the absence of any claim for declaratory relief.if it could,then under the general rule explained in dizol,the district court abused its discretion by remanding to state court.if it could not,then the remand was proper under karussos and golden eagle.
an insurance company right to seek reimbursement for certain defense costs already expended in underlying litigation,such as travelers seeks here,was declared by the california supreme court in buss superior court,cal th,d.travelers argues that this from the equitable doctrine of restitution,and perhaps from contractual principles as independent of any separate statutory right to a declaratory judgment.id.at,d.thus,according to travelers,i f the declaratory judgment act were simply repealed,or had failed to exist,california law would still recognize a right to recover monetary damages under buss.
the procedural posture of buss does little to support travelers argument that reimbursement claims are wholly independent of declaratory claims.in buss,the insurance company prayed for relief including a declaration that it did indeed have a right to obtain reimbursement,and an order therefor id.at,d.we have found numerous additional actions conjoining requests for declaratory relief with requests for reimbursement.see,paul mercury ins.ralee engineering,cir american motorists insurance superior court,th,d venture lmi insurance,th,d western employers ins.arciero sons,d.
what we have not found,however,is an indication that this pattern reflects anything but the practical circumstance that an insurance company seeking reimbursement of defense costs already expended is likely also to want an assurance in the form of declaratory relief that it will not owe future defense costs or be required to indemnify the insured for liability.we can see no reason,in other words,why a reimbursement claim must be joined with a claim for declaratory relief.as the california supreme court explained,t he insurer has a right of reimbursement that is implied in law as,whether or not it has one that is implied in fact in the policy as contractual.buss,cal th at,d.reimbursement claims are therefore based on the equitable doctrine of restitution.id.at,d.traditionally,the holder of an equitable right to monetary relief could vindicate that right in the form of an action in contract,tort,or assumpsit,as circumstances require,restitution,at.satisfaction of equitable rights for monetary relief has not historically been predicated on favorable disposition of a claim for declaratory judgment.accordingly,it appears that under california law,travelers request for reimbursement is independent of the request for declaratory relief.
other factors supporting federal jurisdiction.our ruling that the district court must accept jurisdiction over the claim for declaratory relief does not,however,rest solely on the fact that the joined reimbursement claim appears under state law to be independent of the declaratory claim in the requisite sense.the unique circumstances of this case present additional forceful reasons for retaining federal jurisdiction over the declaratory claim.
the controversy over mydrin rights to defense and indemnity began almost seven years ago,and the parties are still at loggerheads over whether the issue will be decided by a federal or state tribunal.though we fully support our previous decisions in this matter,we can not ignore our own responsibility for the delay.when judge real first reached the merits of the controversy,we faulted him for failing to provide adequate reasons supporting his exercise of discretionary jurisdiction.later,however,in dizol,we determined that district courts need not articulate such reasons when,as was at first true in judge real case,jurisdiction is not challenged.had dizol been decided at the time of the first appeal,this case in all probability would have been decided on the merits in federal court long ago.
we note as well that,while mydrin artfully pleaded its complaint as one for declaratory relief alone,one of its causes of action is not far removed from a claim for breach of contract.the underlying suits against mydrin brought by western had already been settled when mydrin filed its complaint in the removed action,while the suit brought by royalty was still pending.thus,mydrin commenced its action with full knowledge of the amount of damages resulting from travelers alleged breach with regard to the western suit,but with incomplete knowledge of the damages that would flow from the royalty suit.
under these circumstances,an aggrieved party would ordinarily file one breach of contract claim to remedy the breach for which damages were known,and one declaratory judgment claim addressing the breach for which damages would depend on future,contingent events.mydrin,however,brought two declaratory judgment claims,thereby avoiding the mandatory federal jurisdiction that would have attached to the breach of contract claim upon removal by travelers.
though we do not agree with travelers that mydrin declaratory claim is merely a breach of contract damages claim in very thin disguise,we do find that mydrin artful pleading implicates one of the factors affecting the propriety of discretionary jurisdiction.as we have explained,district courts should discourage litigants from filing declaratory actions as a means of forum shopping.dizol,at.while the circumstances here are perhaps different than those anticipated when those words were first written,we nonetheless find the principle to be a sound one as applied in this context.forum shopping through the filing of declaratory judgment actions is no more appropriate when it favors state over federal jurisdiction than it is when it favors the reverse.accordingly,we regard the form of mydrin pleading as a consideration favoring retention of federal jurisdiction.
to sum up,we find that travelers reimbursement claim is,in all probability,sufficiently independent under california law to trigger mandatory federal jurisdiction.in any event,in view of all of the circumstances addressed above,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by remanding the removed action to state court 
rule sanctions 
we turn now to the district court decision to impose rule sanctions on travelers counsel counsel.
background.in pertinent part,rule prohibits lawyers from filing papers with the court that are presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the costs of litigation,or not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law.b.in reviewing sanctions imposed under rule,we review findings of historical fact under the clearly erroneous standard,the determination that counsel violated the rule under a de novo standard,and the choice of sanction under an abuse of discretion standard.simpson lear astronics,cir.
the application of rule is a task that requires sensitivity to two competing considerations.on the one hand,the perception underlying the rule is that on occasion attorneys engage in litigation tactics so vexatious as to be unjustifiable even within the broad bounds of our adversarial system,and that neither the other parties nor the courts should have to abide such behavior or waste time and money coping with it.cooter gell hartmarx,d t he central purpose of rule is to deter baseless filings in district court and thus,consistent with the rules enabling act grant of authority,streamline the administration and procedure of the federal courts.on the other hand,both the rule itself and our application of the rule recognize that our system of litigation is an adversary one,and that presenting the facts and law as favorably as fairly possible in favor of one client is the nub of the lawyer task.judges therefore should impose sanctions on lawyers for their mode of advocacy only in the most egregious situations,lest lawyers be deterred from vigorous representation of their clients.see schlaifer nance,estate of warhol,cir we are cognizant of the unique dilemma that sanctions present.on the one hand,a court should discipline those who harass their opponents and waste judicial resources by abusing the legal process.on the other hand,in our adversarial system,we expect a litigant and his or her attorney to pursue a claim zealously within the boundaries of the law and ethical rules.
in recognition of the latter,critical concern,rule sanctions may be imposed only in response to claims that are not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification or reversal of existing law.b.this standard is applied with particular stringency where,as here,the sanctions are imposed on the court own motion.in that the situation in which an opposing party moves for rule is no safe harbor in the rule allowing lawyers to correct or withdraw their challenged filings.see.c a providing safe harbor to withdraw filing where an opposing party moves for rule sanctions compare.c b requiring court acting on its own motion merely to enter an order to show cause why the rule has not been violated.in light of this important distinction,sua sponte sanctions will
