treiber straub,treiber,a store in wisconsin,needed to return a diamond ring to a california jewelry wholesaler.it turned to united parcel service,the world largest package delivery company and,using the ups website,it arranged to send the package via next day air.as part of the transaction,it purchased in insurance,the maximum permitted.
the ring was worth more than double that fact that gave rise to treiber problems here after ups lost the package.treiber reimbursed the wholesaler for the full loss and then filed this lawsuit against ups and ups capital insurance agency,a wholly owned subsidiary of ups that administers ups excess value insurance program.for simplicity,we refer in this opinion to both defendants as ups.treiber wanted to collect the for the lost package to which it believed it was entitled.ups denied liability,pointing to the disclaimer found in its terms and conditions,its shipping tariff,and its insurance policy.these documents warn repeatedly that when customers ship items of unusual value,defined as those worth more than,there is no liability at all.
finding federal jurisdiction proper because the case arose under the rules of federal common law that apply to lost or damaged goods shipped via air freight,the district court granted summary judgment for ups.the court found that the company disclaimers gave reasonable notice and were enforceable it declined to reach treiber state law theory,rejecting ups argument that it too arose under federal law because of field preemption.both ups and treiber appealed.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for ups on the federal common law claim,and we modify the court decision dismissing the state law claims without prejudice to a dismissal with prejudice.
michael straub,the president of treiber,initiated the shipping of the diamond ring by ups next day air by going to ups website,www.ups.com.his plan was for the ring to be picked up in wisconsin and delivered to norman silverman,the california jewelry wholesaler that owned it.the ring had a value of approximately.the terms and conditions of service that ups follows include the following restrictions on service 
c no service shall be rendered in the transportation of articles of unusual value as defined in the ups tariff,including,but not limited to 
i any package with an actual value of more than 
ups will not be liable or responsible for loss or damage to articles of unusual value as defined in item of the ups tariff.
notwithstanding those exclusions,which straub now claims were not prominent enough and were thus not properly drawn to his attention,he decided to purchase the maximum insurance permitted,paying for the policy.on the online airbill in the appropriate box,treiber filled in insured val.
ups picked up the ring on september,but the ring never arrived in california.on september,ups acknowledged that the package was lost.treiber submitted a claim for the it thought was due to it under the policy,but on october,ups disclaimed any liability because the ring actual value exceeded and thus it was an article of unusual value.treiber paid silverman the ring actual value of and then in january filed suit against ups for.
in order to ship a package using ups website,a shipper must first agree to the items described under the heading my ups terms and conditions,which include a separate document called the terms and conditions of service.as is common in internet commerce,one signifies agreement by clicking on a box on the screen.in addition,a shipper must click a second time to agree to these same terms and conditions.regular shippers also receive annually a rate and service guide containing,among other things,the terms and conditions of service,but there is no indication in the record that treiber was a regular shipper.the terms and conditions of service include the language we quoted earlier,which states that ups will not ship articles of unusual value,those valued at more than,nor will it be liable for or responsible for loss or damage to such articles.
ups tariff,the exclusive agreement between ups and its shippers,is not short.it is available online at www.ups.com,and it offers a table of contents for easy reference.item,titled definition of articles of unusual value,which are not accepted by ups for transportation,repeats that s hippers are prohibited from shipping articles of unusual value via ups,and it defines the term articles of unusual value to include a ny package having a value of more than.item,titled limitations of liability,also indicates that ups will not be liable or responsible for the loss of or damage to any package,the contents of which shippers are prohibited from shipping,which ups is not authorized to accept,which ups states that it will not accept,or which ups has a right to refuse.it too explicitly includes articles of unusual value as defined in item as falling within that provision.finally,item if one gets that far removes any remaining doubt about a shipment like treiber it says that ups maximum liability per package shipped domestically shall not exceed regardless of the amount of excess value insurance purchased by the shipper and that excess value insurance does not provide any insurance protection for packages or letters having an actual value of more than,even if a lesser amount is specified in the insured value field in the ups shipping system used.the same item continues,the excess value insurance policy does not cover or excludes coverage for articles of unusual value as defined in item.
another document,the excess value insurance policy,indicates twice on the very first page that it does not cover packages with actual values of more than.in a bullet point,the policy indicates that excess value insurance does not provide any protection for packages having an actual value in excess of even if a lesser amount is specified in the insured value field and then refers the reader to the exclusions section.right below that,the policy contains a section called what is covered that provides almost word for word the same disclaimer.the warning appears a third time in the exclusions section.the insurance policy,unlike the airbill generated by using the website or the terms and conditions and the tariff,is not available online.
after the parties gave their consent to have a magistrate judge handle the proceedings,see c,the district court ruled that treiber was provided plain and conspicuous notice of ups limitation of liability as it relates to articles of unusual value.with adequate notice,the limitation was binding the court therefore granted summary judgment for ups.in addition,concluding that treiber breach of contract claim arose under state law and was thus within its supplemental jurisdiction,see,the court relinquished jurisdiction over that claim.treiber appeals from the district court judgment ups has,seeking outright dismissal of the breach of contract claim as one that also necessarily arose under federal law.
this case is somewhat unusual in that its alleged federal law basis comes from federal common law,something the parties themselves did not initially realize.because treiber is seeking only the in insurance proceeds that it claims to have purchased validly,it appears that diversity jurisdiction is unavailable.see amount in controversy must exceed.we therefore must first assure ourselves that federal question jurisdiction is secure.normally,when one ships a package via ups and there is a dispute,that dispute belongs in federal court because of the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act.the carmack amendment,however,applies to ground carriers and not to air carriers.see mfrs.mut.ins.great western airlines,cir kemper ins.federal exp,cir collecting cases.thus,when straub selected next day air shipping,he also took this dispute outside the jurisdiction provided by the carmack amendment.
in some circumstances,a claim in federal court may arise under federal common law,which is a permissible basis for jurisdiction based on a federal question under.see illinois city of milwaukee,d.a federal common law contractual claim will support jurisdiction so long as it demonstrates o
