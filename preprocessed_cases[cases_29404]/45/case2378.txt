there is a general rule in california barring the assignment of a cause of action for legal malpractice.in this case,we recognize a narrow exception to that rule.specifically,a cause of action for legal malpractice is transferable when as here the assignment of the legal malpractice claim is only a small,incidental part of a larger commercial transfer between insurance companies the larger transfer is of assets,rights,obligations,and liabilities and does not treat the legal malpractice claim as a distinct commodity the transfer is not to a former adversary the legal malpractice claim arose under circumstances where the original client insurance company retained the attorney to represent and defend an insured and the communications between the attorney and the original client insurance company were conducted via a third party claims administrator.under the circumstances set forth above,the public policy concerns that have been determined in other cases to weigh against the assignment of legal malpractice claims do not arise.thus,the trial court erred in deciding that plaintiff white mountains reinsurance company of america white mountains lacked standing to prosecute this legal malpractice action against defendant borton petrini llp borton because white mountains acquired the cause of action through assignment from the original insurer.we will,therefore,reverse the judgment in favor of borton.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying facts are taken from a joint stipulation of facts the parties entered into for purposes of resolving a joint motion on agreed dispositive issue.
modern service insurance company modern service issued a car insurance policy to flora cuison covering the period from january to january,with a limit on bodily injury liability per person.in july,cuison caused an automobile accident that seriously injured karen johnson.in june,johnson filed suit against cuison.cuison was purportedly served with the complaint in the action,along with an undated day offer to compromise for the policy limits,around june.
on or about july,country insurance fidelity services country,the claims administrator acting on behalf of modern service,faxed a letter to borton petrini asking the firm to accept the defense of cuison in the action.borton took the case,representing modern service and cuison,and allowed the offer to compromise to expire without a response.
in and,borton reported on the progress of the case,submitted invoices to,and received payments from modern service for services rendered.
in october,mutual service casualty insurance company mutual service and folksamerica reinsurance company folksamerica entered into a stock repurchase agreement under which mutual service would be demutualized and folksamerica would acquire mutual service stock.
in december,while the stock repurchase agreement had not yet been completed,modern service entered into an assumption reinsurance and administration agreement with mutual service under which mutual service assumed the california liabilities of modern service.specifically,under that agreement modern service ceded to mutual service all of its gross direct obligations and liabilities and rights under and relating to all insurance business written by modern service since its incorporation in respect of risks located in california.modern service was ceasing to conduct business in california.the cuison policy was one of the polices mutual service assumed in the deal.
a few days after the modern service deal,the stock transaction between mutual service and folksamerica closed,and mutual service changed its name to stockbridge insurance company stockbridge.
in,borton continued to report on the progress of the case and continued to submit invoices to modern service in care of country,but the payments borton received in january and february were from mutual service.between june and september,the payments were from stockbridge.
in september,stockbridge transferred its liabilities to folksamerica.thereafter,although borton continued to report on the case and submit invoices to modern service care of country which it did throughout its participation in the case,the payments came from folksamerica.
in july,folksamerica changed its name to white mountains.nonetheless,borton continued to receive payments on the case in the name of folksamerica.it was not until may that the name of white mountains began appearing on the payments.two months earlier,however,a different law firm had been substituted in place of borton.thus,white mountains paid borton final invoices following the substitution of counsel.
in november,white mountains paid million to settle the case.
in january,white mountains,denominating itself the to modern service,commenced this action against borton by filing a complaint for negligence alleging that borton had committed malpractice by letting the offer to compromise expire,thereby exposing the insurer to liability in excess of the policy limits and causing the insurer to incur substantial expenses for attorneys and experts to defend cuison against johnson lawsuit.
in,borton moved for summary judgment on the ground that a legal malpractice cause of action may not be assigned and therefore white mountains lacked standing to pursue the action.in january,the trial court denied the motion on the ground that borton had failed to show when the cause of action accrued and therefore failed to show that white mountains had acquired the cause of action by assignment.
thereafter,the parties agreed to have the trial judge resolve the question of white mountains standing based on the stipulated set of facts set out above.the trial court decided that the legal malpractice cause of action accrued when modern service incurred legal expenses it would not have incurred if the case had been settled for the policy limits in july.thus,white mountains could have acquired the cause of action only by assignment.the court further concluded,however,that a legal malpractice cause of action may not lawfully be assigned in california,even under the facts presented in this case.accordingly,the court determined that white mountains lacked standing to prosecute the action,and the court entered judgment against white mountains in april.thereafter,white mountains filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
white mountains contends the trial court erred in mechanically appl ying the rule prohibiting the sale and assignment of a single legal malpractice claim to conclude modern service improperly assigned the malpractice claim,in the context of sale of corporate assets,to white mountains in contravention of california law.as we will explain,we agree the trial court erred.under the facts of this case,the recognized public policy reasons for barring the assignment of a cause of action for legal malpractice do not apply.
in california,the rule that a legal malpractice cause of action is not assignable can be traced to goodley wank wank,d goodley,which has been referred to as the seminal decision on the assignability of legal malpractice claims.mallen smith,legal malpractice.in goodley,it was alleged that the defendant attorneys had negligently represented one eleanor katz in the proceeding to dissolve her marriage because they had returned to her certain original insurance policies of which she was the beneficiary and had failed to secure a court order to restrain her husband from changing the status of those policies.goodley,at.it was further alleged that during the pendency of the dissolution proceeding,her husband found the policies and,without her knowledge,cancelled the m and shortly thereafter died and that as a result katz was damaged in the sum of.id.at.the plaintiff,goodley,further asserted that he was the owner of katz legal malpractice claim against the attorneys by virtue of a written assignment from her.ibid.
on summary judgment,the trial court concluded the action was without merit because the cause of action is predicated on a tort,malpractice and plaintiff is the assignee of the person who allegedly was the victim of malpractice,and causes of action for tort can not be assigned.goodley,supra,d at,fn.the appellate court affirmed,albeit for a different reason.id.at.
the appellate court began by explaining as follows 
in our legislature effected a change in the common law rule of nonassignability of choses in action by enacting sections and,civil code.thus a thing in action arising out of either the violation of a right of property or an obligation or contract may be transferred citations.the construction and application of the broad rule of assignability have developed a complex pattern of case law underlying which is the basic public policy that a ssignability of things in action is now the rule nonassignability the exception citations.a nd this exception is confined to wrongs done to the person,the reputation,of the feelings of the injured party,and to contracts of a purely personal nature,like promises of marriage.citation.thus,causes of action for personal injuries arising out of a tort are not assignable nor are those founded upon wrongs of a purely personal nature such as to the reputation or the feelings of the one injured.assignable are choses in action arising out of an obligation or breach of contract as are those arising out of the violation of a right of property citation or a wrong involving injury to personal or real property.goodley,supra,d at,fns.omitted.
recognizing that the personal nature of the duty owed to the client does not perforce convert the breach thereof to a tort of a purely personal nature on a par with those wrongs done to the person of the injured party or his reputation or feelings which fall within the exception to the general rule of assignability goodley,supra,d at,the appellate court nonetheless concluded that a chose in action for legal malpractice is not assignable because of the uniquely personal nature of legal services and the contract out of which a highly personal and confidential relationship arises,and public policy considerations based thereon.id.at.the court explained that i t is the unique quality of legal services,the personal nature of the attorney duty to the client and the confidentiality of the relationship that invoke public policy considerations in our conclusion that malpractice claims should not be subject to assignment.the assignment of such claims could relegate the legal malpractice action to the market place and convert it to a commodity to be exploited and transferred to economic bidders who have never had a professional relationship with the attorney and to whom the attorney has never owed a legal duty,and who have never had any prior connection with the assignor or his rights.the commercial aspect of assignability of choses in action arising out of legal malpractice is rife with probabilities that could only debase the legal profession.the almost certain end result of merchandizing such causes of action is the lucrative business of factoring malpractice claims which would encourage unjustified lawsuits against members of the legal profession,generate an increase in legal malpractice litigation,promote champerty and force attorneys to defend themselves against strangers.the endless complications and litigious intricacies arising out of such commercial activities would place an undue burden on not only the legal profession but the already overburdened judicial system,restrict the availability of competent legal services,embarrass the relationship and imperil the sanctity of the highly confidential and fiduciary relationship existing between attorney and client.id.at.
the appellate court continued as follows 
public policy encourages those who believe they have claims to solve their problems in a court of law and secure a judicial adjustment of their differences.the california supreme court has emphatically rejected the concept of self help citation.however,the ever present threat of assignment and the possibility that ultimately the attorney may be confronted with the necessity of defending himself against the assignee of an irresponsible client who,because of dissatisfaction with legal services rendered and out of resentment for monetary gain,has discounted a purported claim for malpractice by assigning the same,would most surely result in a selective process for carefully choosing clients thereby rendering a disservice to the public and the profession.goodley,supra,d at.
the goodley court also drew an analogy to the california supreme court early refusal to recognize a naked right of action for fraud and deceit as a marketable commodity,holding that assignment of a bare right to complain of fraud is contrary to public policy.goodley,supra,d at,fn.omitted.in doing so,however,the court noted in a footnote that w here the form of assignment to the plaintiff is sufficient to cover the property rights and claims of his assignors in and to the moneys or property so obtained by fraud and deceit,it constitutes a transfer of more than a mere naked right of action for fraud and deceit,since it includes also the right to recover the moneys or property so obtained.id.at,fn.thus,as will become important hereafter,the goodley court recognized that a person may assign a cause of action for fraud along with the person right to the property obtained by the fraud,but a mere naked right of action for fraud,divorced from any other property right,is not assignable.
california cases after goodley 
since goodley was decided in,california courts have consistently adhered to the goodley court conclusion that a cause of action for legal malpractice is not assignable for public policy reasons.a survey of these cases will be helpful in determining whether the goodley rule should apply under the facts presented here.
in jackson rogers wells d,the appellate court concluded that the public policies prohibiting assignment of legal malpractice causes of action applied notwithstanding the plaintiff characterization of his assigned claims as sounding in fraud and intentional breach of contract.id.at.in that case,the plaintiff jackson originally sued an attorney mix and others for legal malpractice and securities fraud.id.at.mix malpractice insurance carriers retained a law firm rogers wells and one of its partners lathrop to defend the action.id.at.after mix rejected several settlement offers on advice of counsel,jackson secured a judgment for more than a million.ibid.jackson then turned around and sued the insurers,along with rogers wells and lathrop,for bad faith refusal to settle.ibid.the insurers settled with jackson and as part of that settlement assigned to jackson their claims against rogers wells and lathrop,which jackson asserted in an amended complaint.ibid.
on appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer to the assigned claims without leave to amend,the appellate court noted with respect to the claim of fraud that if the court were to uphold a characterization of the claim as grounded in fraud rather than in classic attorney malpractice or negligence and thus assignable,the court would be requiring a trial court to the attorney professional evaluations communicated to the client and the strategic choices made in the past in a confidential relationship in which the current plaintiff had no part,and was in fact adversary to the partnership.such an attenuated theory of liability would lead to proof problems and would work mischief in the already busy field of legal malpractice litigation.jackson rogers wells,supra,d at.with respect to the allegation unnecessary services were rendered and the client charged for the same,the court held that only the would have the right to raise such a claim,since disputed billings which arose from an ongoing relationship are not sufficiently analogous to a specific,identifiable piece of property necessary to support the assignability of a cause of action for fraud.id.at.
the court also pointed out various public policy considerations that it believed point ed toward the disallowance of assignment of the causes of action pleaded u nder the peculiar facts of th e case.jackson rogers wells,supra,d at.among these we re the need to preserve the element of trust between attorney and client,which could be impaired if the attorney perceives a future threat of the client assignment to a stranger or adversary of a legal malpractice claim.similarly,counsel might be discouraged from pursuing vigorous advocacy on behalf of his or her client if that advocacy might alienate the adversary,who might someday be motivated to sue the attorney for legal malpractice under an assignment of rights.an attorney might also seek to please an at the expense of the insured best interest,if the attorney fears the employer might someday turn over its malpractice cause of action to a third party.finally,if malpractice claims could be bought and sold,the inevitable result would be raised malpractice insurance premiums.id.at.the court concluded that these public policy considerations applied to both the cause of action for fraud and the cause of action for breach of contract.id.at.
in kracht perrin,gartland doyle d,the plaintiff kracht originally sued a charles hogue and in the course of that suit served him with discovery requests.id.at.after judgment was entered in favor of kracht because of the inadequacy of hogue responses to those requests,kracht sought and obtained a court order,pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and,compelling hogue to assign all choses in action which he held against the attorneys in oregon who had assisted him with the deficient discovery responses.ibid.kracht thereafter filed suit against the attorneys.id.at.the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend,concluding that the gravamen of all the claims was legal malpractice,that california law applied to the question of whether the claims were assignable,and that legal malpractice claims are not assignable under california law.id.at.
relying on goodley and jackson,the appellate court began its opinion on kracht appeal by asserting that it was now well settled that under california law a former client may not voluntarily assign his claims for legal malpractice against his former attorneys.kracht perrin,gartland doyle,supra,d at,fn.omitted.after examining the public policy concerns discussed in both of those cases,the court concluded that those concerns are violated by any assignment of claims,whether voluntary or as here involuntary.id.at.the court then identified a dditional reasons against assignability where the assignment is an involuntary transfer to the former adversary.first,a suit could be filed,even though the former client to whom the duty was owed was entirely satisfied with the services and opposed the filing of a malpractice lawsuit.second,a suit brought on a claim acquired by involuntary assignment,and against the client wishes,places the attorney in an untenable position.he must preserve the privilege the client having done nothing to waive the privilege while trying to show that his representation of the client was not negligent.finally,a malpractice suit filed by the former adversary is fraught with illogic citation and unseemly arguments in the former lawsuit kracht judicially averred and proved she was entitled to recover against hogue but in the malpractice lawsuit kracht must judicially aver that,but for attorney negligence,she was not entitled to have recovered against hogue.reduced to its essence,kracht argument in the malpractice action is to the extent i was not entitled to recover,i am now entitled to recover.id.at,fn.omitted.the court concluded that b ecause of the uniquely personal nature of the relationship,and the numerous public policies which would be violated if involuntary assignments of malpractice claims were allowed,we agree with goodley and jackson that california law precludes such assignments.kracht,at.
fireman fund 
in fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg th,several insurers insurers paid more than million to settle a lawsuit against their developer insureds by homeowners alleging misrepresentations in the sales of residential units.the insureds then filed a legal malpractice case against their attorneys law firm for causing those misrepresentations to be made.later,insurers joined the malpractice lawsuit as plaintiffs under a theory of subrogation.law firm successfully demurred on the ground california law prohibiting assignment of legal malpractice actions also precluded insurers from proceeding as subrogees to their insureds claim against law firm.the court entered judgment dismissing insurers as plaintiffs.id.at.
on appeal,insurers contend ed the public policies articulated to restrict the assignability of legal malpractice claims are not applicable to a subrogation claim by a liability insurer who paid a claim against its insured client resulting from the insured attorney negligence.insurers sought to distinguish cases such as goodley and kracht factually as not involving a subrogee insurer whose interests were directly affected by its subrogor attorney malpractice and whose interests were aligned or virtually identical with and indeed derivative of the insured interests against the attorney.characterizing the superior court ruling as inequitable in light of other public policies favoring reasonable settlements,encouraging liability carriers to meet their insureds reasonable expectations,transferring risks to actual tortfeasors,and spreading loss among cotortfeasors,insurers assert ed those public policies require d that their lawsuit as subrogees be permitted.fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
the appellate court rejected these arguments because it found it could not depart from settled law namely,the california supreme court decision in fifield manor finston cal d that absent express statutory authorization nonassignable claims are not subject to subrogation.fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg,supra,th at.no statute expressly authorizes subrogation of legal malpractice claims.hence,as legal malpractice claims are nonassignable,such claims may not be subrogated.thus,case law compels a holding insureds legal malpractice cause of action is not assignable to insurers.id.at.
in baum duckor,spradling metzger th,a law firm and an attorney collectively,the attorneys represented two corporations in connection with their financial restructure and bankruptcy proceedings.id.at.according to the complaint in baum,the attorneys breached their fiduciary duties to the corporations and committed legal malpractice by handling several transactions,the result of which was the fraudulent transfer of at least million of the corporations assets to the corporations principal,to the detriment of the corporations creditors.ibid.baum,who was the trustee of one of those creditors the baum trust,claimed that he became the assignee of the corporations claims against the attorneys,which were assets of the corporations bankruptcy estates,under an agreement with the bankruptcy trustees that was approved by order of the bankruptcy court.id.at.
on appeal from a dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend,the appellate court concluded that the bankruptcy trustees purported assignment to baum trust of the debtor corporations legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims was invalid as a matter of california law and public policy.baum duckor,spradling metzger,supra,th at.more specifically,the court expressed its view that the holding in kracht,that the goodley rule prohibiting assignment of legal malpractice claims applies to any assignment of such a claim,whether voluntary or involuntary citation,should be extended for sound public policy reasons to cases such as the instant case in which a legal malpractice chose in action belonging to a bankrupt corporation involuntarily becomes an asset of the bankruptcy estate,and is then purportedly assigned by the bankruptcy trustee to a creditor of the debtor corporation.baum,at.the court explained that m any of the public policy concerns discussed in goodley,jackson and kracht are also of concern in the context of a bankruptcy trustee purported assignment to creditors of a debtor corporation potential legal malpractice claims against its former counsel.the relationship is unique and involves a highly confidential relationship even where the client is a corporation.an attorney owes all clients,including a corporate client,duties of undivided loyalty and diligence,among other fiduciary duties.a bankruptcy trustee purported assignment to creditors of a debtor legal malpractice chose in action,especially under circumstances in which the bankruptcy trustee has decided not to prosecute such a claim,could encourage unjustified lawsuits and the commercialization of claims condemned in goodley even where,as alleged here,the bankruptcy court would have an oversight role during a creditor assignee prosecution of the legal malpractice claim against the debtor former counsel,the assignment and prosecution of the claim would force attorneys to defend themselves against persons to whom no fiduciary duty of sic duty of care was owed.citation.such assignments would generate malpractice lawsuits,burdening the profession and the court system.baum,at.
the decision in baum was subsequently followed under substantially similar circumstances in curtis kellogg andelson th.
out of state cases 
as the foregoing cases demonstrate,in california the rule against the assignment of legal malpractice claims has never been applied at least in a published appellate opinion to a factual scenario like that present here.in other states,however,courts have determined that the rule should not apply where the assignment of a cause of action for legal malpractice is incidental to a larger commercial transaction involving the transfer of other business assets and liabilities,because the public policy concerns that weigh against the assignment of legal malpractice claims do not arise in that context.we turn to those cases.
in richter analex,the plaintiff richter had served as the attorney for a corporation known as analex during a time in which the corporation paid large bonuses to,and negotiated consulting agreements with,two of its former officers.id.at.after passing the costs of the bonuses and consulting agreements through to nasa,with which the corporation had an aerospace contract,analex ended up incurring both criminal and civil liabilities.ibid.
in,defendant analex corporation purchased certain assets from analex and assumed financial responsibility for some of the fines imposed on analex richter analex,supra.at.subsequently,richter sued analex corporation for breach of contract and other causes of action,and analex corporation counterclaimed for legal malpractice.id.at.on richter motion to dismiss the counterclaim,analex corporation argued that it could assert the malpractice claim as analex assignee because it had acquired the claim along with analex liabilities with respect to the bonuses and consulting agreements.ibid.
the district court recognized that whether a legal malpractice claim was assignable under district of columbia law was an issue of first impression.richter analex,supra.at.in deciding that analex malpractice claim was assignable,the court wrote as follows 
the courts that have barred the assignment of legal malpractice claims have relied primarily on factors not present in this case,including the fear that parties will sell off claims,particularly to opponents or completely unrelated third parties,and a concern about jeopardizing the personal nature of legal services.citations.
in this case,plaintiff was the attorney for the predecessor corporation whose liabilities now burden defendant.the legal malpractice claim was not bartered or sold to an unrelated third party indeed,analex corporation argues that its liabilities,assumed from analex,arose directly out of plaintiff conduct.moreover,the interests involved are purely pecuniary in nature and do not implicate the kinds of concerns raised by the sale or assignment of a personal injury claim.as the supreme court of maine persuasively put it,there is no reason to prohibit the assignment of a legal malpractice claim in a situation such as this.we are not here confronted with the establishment of a general market for such claims this assignee has an intimate connection with the underlying lawsuit a legal malpractice claim is not for personal injury,but for economic harm.the argument that legal services are personal and involve confidential relationships does not justify preventing a client like this one from realizing the value of its malpractice claim in what may be the most efficient way possible,namely,its assignment to someone else with a clear interest in the claim who also has the time,energy and resources to bring the suit.citation.
this court concludes that in circumstances such as these,public policy does not prohibit the assignment of a legal malpractice claim and district of columbia law does not prevent it.richter analex,supra.at.
in cerberus partners,gadsby hannah,on review from the granting of a motion for summary judgment,the rhode island supreme court was called upon to determine the validity of the voluntary assignment of a legal malpractice claim as part of a commercial transaction.id.at.the plaintiffs in the case were financial institutions that had purchased million in loans given by a group of lenders to slm international,slm along with all of the rights and obligations connected with those loans.ibid.the defendants were lawyers who had represented the lenders in the loan transactions.ibid.in suing for malpractice,the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had failed to perfect the lenders security interest in slm assets,making it so that the plaintiffs were unable to collect the full value of the loans after slm filed for reorganization in bankruptcy.id.at.
acknowledging that the assignment of legal malpractice claims as an integral part of a larger commercial transaction wa s an issue of first impression in rhode island,the court concluded that on the specific factual circumstances present in this case,where an assignee of a commercial loan agreement brings a legal malpractice action against the attorney who represented the original lender in the commercial loan transaction,the assignment of that negligence claim,if arising from the assigned commercial loan agreement,is not prohibited by rhode island law.cerberus partners,gadsby hannah,supra,at.the court explained the basis for its conclusion as follows 
the legal malpractice claim asserted by the plaintiffs here arose out of a larger earlier commercial loan transaction.the plaintiffs did not merely purchase the legal malpractice claim,but were instead the assignees of the lenders original agreements with respect to the loans to slm,and the plaintiffs acquired,along with those loans,all of the attendant obligations and rights that went along with those loans,including but not limited to the lenders legal malpractice action against the defendants.thus,we are not dealing here with a situation where a legal malpractice claim was transferred to a person without any other rights or obligations being transferred along with it.that was the factual situation present in the great majority of the cases cited to us from other jurisdictions that have considered the issue of the assignability of legal malpractice claims and it was upon those particular facts that the case holdings of appear to have been predicated.citation.
we are cognizant of the various and plausible,but in the main,public policy reasons related in those case holdings from those jurisdictions in which assignment of legal malpractice claims have been prohibited.we are not persuaded,however,that any public policy in this jurisdiction mandates blind adherence to a general rule of prohibition in all cases of assignment.we acknowledge the distinction between market assignments involving purely economic transactions,such as involved in the case before us,and freestanding malpractice personal injury claim assignments that necessarily involve and invoke the unique relationship and duty of confidentiality privity,and the duty of the lawyer that runs only to the client the creation of possible commercial markets for such claims and the demeaning of the legal profession along with the prospect of having attorneys defend themselves against strangers and the possibility of being forced to divulge confidential information in defending against assigned claims.we believe,howev
