in this case we are asked to decide whether the legislature,when it amended labor code section in,repealed the rule prohibiting consideration of regulations of the california occupational safety and health act in tort actions by employees against parties other than their own employers for injuries suffered in the workplace.defendant carl uveges appeals a judgment entered in favor of plaintiff rowdy elsner and intervenor state compensation insurance fund state fund on elsner complaint for personal injuries stemming from a construction site accident.uveges contends the trial court prejudicially erred by permitting into evidence purported violations of standards under a misinterpretation and improper retroactive application of sections and misinstructing the jury on the definition of employer and denying his motion in limine seeking to exclude reference to standards,and on that basis improperly excluding uveges proposed evidence of industry custom and practice.state fund also appeals the judgment,contending the damage award in its favor does not correctly reflect medical expense damages to which it is statutorily entitled under section.
based on our interpretation of the statute,we conclude section does not permit introduction of safety standards or orders into evidence in employee third party personal injury actions and that the trial court therefore erred in allowing use of such regulations to prove the standard of care and establish a presumption of negligence in this case.we conclude the court error was prejudicial because it resulted in the exclusion of evidence pertaining to the custom and practice of scaffold assembly in the single family residential construction industry,depriving uveges of a critical defense to elsner negligence claim based on uveges common law duties of care.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on december,elsner,a roofer employed by hoffman roofing,was injured when a scaffold failed beneath him at a construction site in the city of coronado.uveges was the general contractor for the pair of,single family homes.the day before the accident,sean frey,a carpenter employed by uveges,had constructed the temporary wood plank scaffold to assist his installation of plywood panels to the second story of the structure.frey used an approximately,plank,attaching one end to a sloping roof by a single nail and the other end to a window ledge with another single nail.frey did not drive the nails in fully,leaving one of them approximately of an inch up,so that he could later pry them up in order to remove the scaffold.he supported the scaffold with a center support consisting of a resting on an overturned truss lying on the ground below he attached the base of the support to the truss using a single nail driven at an angle.
uveges acknowledged he had the direct responsibility to supervise and control the work in order to ensure required safety practices were followed,by either talking to the subcontractors employees or otherwise ensuring the subcontractors took required safety precautions.on this job,he did not have a written safety program nor did he conduct formal safety meetings with his workers,instead he would say something only if he saw unsafe activities.because uveges considered frey an experienced carpenter,uveges did not feel he had to check his work for safety purposes he expected frey to be able to build a scaffold correctly.uveges did not see frey build the scaffold and he did not inspect it before the accident.according to frey,uveges did not have a practice of inspecting scaffolds he had built.
elsner sued uveges and uveges joint venturer on the project asserting causes of action for negligence,premises liability,breach of duty,failure to provide a safe place of work and peculiar risk.state fund intervened in the lawsuit seeking reimbursement for workers compensation benefits paid to elsner.
before trial,uveges moved in limine for an order to exclude references to osha regulations and their alleged violation.he argued expert or other testimony that the scaffolding violated regulations or safety orders was inadmissible for any purpose in an employee third party action under section as applied by spencer macdonald construction d,and mackey campbell construction d.he also argued the mention of a violation without supporting evidence would unduly prejudice him by permitting the jury to impermissibly infer wrongdoing.the trial court denied the motion.
the matter proceeded to jury trial against uveges only.based on its in limine ruling,the court permitted testimony by elsner experts as to how the scaffold violated requirements.having granted a separate evidentiary motion made by elsner during trial,the court also prevented uveges from eliciting expert testimony that the scaffold as constructed was customary and met the standard of care for such construction jobs.it gave the jury special instructions based on provisions of the labor code sections,and,including an instruction defining the term employer as used in those sections for multiemployer worksites as well as portions of particular regulations relating to housekeeping at the site and requirements for nailing,anchoring,size and railing of scaffolds,tit.the court instructed the jury with a modified version of baji as follows if you find that a party to this action violated labor code sections,cal osha regulations,the statutes and regulations just read to you and that any such violation was a cause of injury to another,you will find that such violation was negligence unless defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he did what might reasonably be expected of a person of ordinary prudence,acting under similar circumstances,who desired to comply with the law.in order to sustain such burden of proof,such party must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was faced with circumstances which prevented compliance or justified noncompliance with the statute or regulation.
the jury returned a special verdict finding uveges percent negligent and his negligence a cause of elsner injuries.it found elsner employer was not negligent.in addition to costs,the jury awarded elsner in economic and in noneconomic damages.it awarded state fund.both uveges and state fund appeal.
discussion 
osha standards remain inadmissible in third party actions under section 
uveges contends the trial court prejudicially erred by interpreting section as permitting admission of osha safety standards and orders into evidence in this third party action for purposes of establishing the standard of care and creating a presumption of negligence for violation of those standards.in part,he maintains the court interpretation is contrary to the statute plain language and to legislative history that demonstrates the legislature,while it originally considered permitting use of such evidence,in the end preserved the rule barring admission of such evidence in third party civil actions.as we explain,although the statute suffers from ambiguity,section legislative history compels us to agree with uveges and reject the trial court interpretation.
background 
we begin with an overview of the law leading up to the legislature introduction of assembly bill ab,which amended several provisions of the labor code,including section addressing admissibility of regulations and orders in personal injury and wrongful death actions.former section,applicable to personal injury or wrongful death actions arising after april,provided it is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this division division,sections through et,entitled safety in employment shall only be applicable to proceedings against employers brought pursuant to the provisions of chapter commencing with section entitled responsibilities and duties between employers and employees and commencing with section entitled appeal proceedings of part of this division for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.neither this division nor any part of this division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action arising after the operative date of this section,except as between an employee and his own employer.stats,ch,eff.april,arbaugh proctor gamble d,fn.
under the plain language of former section,reference to and introduction of standards and safety orders were expressly limited to actions between employers and their own employees this court and others interpreting the section logically concluded such regulations and their violation specifically could not be considered in evidence in an employee third party action.widson international harvester d.every appellate court in the state of california which has considered the question of legislative intent of this section has concluded regulations are not applicable to nor admissible in an employee action against a third person not his or her employer salinero pon d.the language of former section is abundantly clear the provisions of division of the labor include the statute appellant sought to have admitted into not admissible in any third party actions by an employee rodriguez mcdonnell douglas d,fn.brock state of california d.spencer macdonald construction,supra,d at.vallas city of chula vista d.presumption of negligence arising from violation of safety orders not applicable except as between employee and employer,disapproved on other grounds in peterson city of long beach cal d,fn.
the rationale behind the legislature actions was most thoroughly discussed in spencer macdonald construction,supra,d,in response to arguments by amici curiae that section violated the equal protection and due process provisions of the federal and state constitutions.id.at.there,the court explained division of the labor code safety in employment reduces or eliminates the need for the parties to resort to common law negligence to prove liability in certain cases because in those cases violations of safety orders found in the administrative code are admissible in evidence and could constitute negligence per se.citation.however,section makes obvious the legislature intent to restrict the admissibility of those safety code orders only to safety cases,et and et,and to personal injury or wrongful death cases between an employee and the party most directly concerned with his own employer.in other suits brought by the employee,he,like other personal injury litigants,must prove his case under the rules of common law negligence.to allow the admissibility of safety code orders to carry over to the latter kind of suit would discriminate against other personal injury plaintiffs for,by reducing or eliminating the need to prove his case under common law negligence,it would place an employee in a special,protected status third persons,although employees are not a suspect classification,nor is the admissibility of safety orders a fundamental right.spencer macdonald construction,d at,italics added.the california supreme court later agreed with spencer reasoning and its resultant holding that section was not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.griesel dart industries,cal d,overruled on other grounds in privette superior court cal th,d.
former section prohibition on admission of standards extended to theories beyond negligence to that of nondelegable duty thus,an injured employee was prohibited from suing a third party general contractor or premises owner for breach of any nondelegable duty to comply with applicable requirements.see,felmlee falcon cable tv th,d smith acands,th,d.but that did not prevent the employee from maintaining an action against the third party for breach of other nondelegable duties,or breach of its common law duties of due care.see felmlee falcon cable tv,at,d notwithstanding plaintiff inability to rely on duty doctrine,jury was free to consider whether general contractor was directly negligent in failing to correct any foreseeable,dangerous condition which may have contributed to the cause of plaintiff injuries smith acands,supra,th at,d court of appeal reversed judgment against premises owner pg e for injuries sustained by plaintiff who was not pg e own employee due to errors concerning claims of negligence per se and vicarious liability but remanded for retrial on general contractor general negligence,disapproved on other grounds in camargo tjaarda dairy cal th,d.
assembly bill 
ab,signed into law in october,amended in several significant ways,including to substantially expand civil and criminal penalties for willful,serious and repeated violations of regulations and safety orders.stats.pertinent here are the amendments to sections and.as amended,section,entitled applicability of division to proceedings on employee safety evidence in personal injury and wrongful death actions,provides 
it is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this division,and the occupational safety and health standards and orders promulgated under this code,are applicable to proceedings against employers for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.
neither the issuance of,or failure to issue,a citation by the division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action,except as between an employee and his or her own employer.sections and of the evidence code shall apply to this division and to occupational safety and health standards adopted under this division in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.the testimony of employees of the division shall not be admissible as expert opinion or with respect to the application of occupational safety and health standards.it is the intent of the legislature that the amendments to this section enacted in the regular session shall not abrogate the holding in brock state of california d.
section is entitled safe and healthful employment and place of employment.the legislature made nonsubstantive changes to section general statement of the employer statutory duty of care with respect to a safe workplace every employer shall furnish employment and a place of employment that is safe and healthful for the employees therein,subd.a.the legislature created new subdivision b,incorporating almost verbatim a regulation designating citable employers at multiemployer worksites.regs.tit,subdivision b of section provides on multiemployer worksites,both construction and,citations may be issued only to the following categories of employers when the division has evidence that an employee was exposed to a hazard in violation of any requirement enforceable by the division the employer whose employees were exposed to the hazard the exposing employer.the employer who actually created the hazard the creating employer.the employer who was responsible,by contract or through actual practice,for safety and health conditions on the worksite,the employer who had the authority for ensuring that the hazardous condition is corrected the controlling employer.the employer who had the responsibility for actually correcting the hazard the correcting employer.the employers listed in paragraphs through,inclusive,may be cited regardless of whether their own employees were exposed to the hazard,subd.b.
new subsection c of section expresses the legislature intent behind this addition c it is the intent of the legislature,in adding subdivision b to this section,to codify existing regulations with respect to the responsibility of employers at multiemployer worksites.subdivision b of this section is declaratory of existing law and shall not be construed or interpreted as creating a new law or as modifying or changing an existing law,subd.c.
with this background,we turn to the question at hand whether section as amended now permits introduction of regulations or safety orders in evidence against a third party tortfeasor.resolution of this issue turns on statutory construction.our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.citation.day city of fontana cal th,d.
section contains two separate unnumbered paragraphs,each having express statements of legislative intent.in the first,the legislature manifested its intent that provisions of division and standards and orders be applicable to proceedings against employers for the sole purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.section,directly preceding section,defines the term employer for purposes of and provides it shall have the same meaning as in section.section broadly defines employer in the workers compensation law to mean a the state and every state agency.b each county,city,district,and all public and quasi public corporations and public agencies therein.c every person including any public service corporation,which has any natural person in service.d the legal representative of any deceased employer.elsner does not contend uveges falls under section definition of employer and,indeed,uveges status as general contractor not elsner employer takes him outside the provision definition in view of the legislature unambiguous definition of employer under section,we are compelled to conclude elsner action against uveges is not a proceeding against an employer within the meaning of the labor code and thus,standards and orders are generally not applicable to the action.
turning to the second paragraph of section,we encounter ambiguity.one might argue that the separate paragraphs of section indicate the legislature meant to set forth separate evidentiary standards for different in the first paragraph for administrative proceedings against employers,proceedings against employers for the sole purpose of enforcing employee safety,and another in the second paragraph for personal injury and wrongful death actions.thus,section second paragraph might be interpreted as a provision limited to personal injury or wrongful death actions,essentially providing that in such actions neither the issuance of,or failure to issue,a citation by the division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence,except as between an employee and his or her own employer and evidence code sections and shall apply to those actions in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.as we explain,however,this interpretation would conflict with the legislature second expression of intent in that paragraph,namely,that its amendments shall not abrogate the holding of brock state of california,supra,d.brock.
brock arose out of an explosion at a plant resulting in the injury or death of several employees.the plaintiffs filed personal injury actions against certain defendants including the state of california,in part alleging the state had a mandatory,duty to inspect the plant to ensure it was a reasonably safe place to work but failed to do so in violation of labor code regulations and other provisions.brock,supra,d at.the state successfully demurred to the complaint on the ground former section prevented reliance on provisions as a basis for a personal injury or wrongful death action.brock,at.
pointing to former section language and case law limiting the applicability,consideration or admissibility of standards and safety orders to actions between an employee and his or her own employer,the court of appeal affirmed.it stated the fact that the state has a mandatory duty to inspect and to enforce provisions is irrelevant to the issue of whether those provisions can be relied upon in a personal injury action against the state when the state is not the employer.it is evident that the purpose of former section is to prevent the technical safety provisions from enlarging the personal injury liability of third parties beyond basic common law liability.brock,supra,d at,italics added.the court reasoned that the legislature did this because operating control over safety conditions rests with the employer alone since third parties,including the state,are not in control of such operations,and can not be even if hordes of inspectors were to be hired,the legislature sensibly limited the applicability of the safety provisions to actions involving employers alone.this has nothing to do with sovereign immunity,upon which plaintiffs premise their argument.former section does not undertake by its terms to immunize the state from suits by injured employees based on common law liability or even based on violations of duty under statutes other than.it merely requires that the provisions of shall have no application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in such suits,or other third party suits.brock,at,italics added.because the plaintiffs allegations against the state were based on provisions,the court ruled the demurrers were properly sustained.id.at.
we read section second paragraph in context with its first paragraph,and to comport with brock.pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d,when statutory language is ambiguous,the court may examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,statutory language must be viewed in context keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where the words appear in re cathey cal d,rules of statutory construction will not be utilized to contradict or vary a clear expression of legislative intent.in so doing,we interpret its references to evidence code sections judicial notice and failure to exercise due care as reflecting an intent that these evidentiary standards govern the introduction into evidence of violations in those proceedings in which regulations and orders against employers as defined in section.this interpretation is consistent with the legislature aim to preserve brock holding,under which personal injury liability of parties not having control over safety is confined to basic common law liability.further,since it is in keeping with a,judicially sanctioned,exception to the general rule permitting evidence of governmental regulations and ordinances to prove negligence,construction of section in this manner can not lead to an absurd or unintended result 
elsner contends the legislature only intended to preserve brock narrow holding that provisions are inadmissible in a suit against the state.he further maintains that had the legislature intended to bar reference to safety violations by any defendant and not just the state,it would have expressly retained the holdings of the cases relied upon by brock.we are not persuaded by these arguments for several reasons.first,brock language makes plain that the court holding did not turn on the fact the state was a governmental entity having any particular duty under.brock,supra,d at.this has nothing to do with sovereign immunity.rather,its holding turned solely on the fact the state was not the plaintiffs employer having operating control over safety,and under those circumstances,section prevented provisions of from being considered or admitted in the plaintiffs personal injury action.in our view,the decision contains no other rational holding the legislature could have intended to preserve by its reference to brock.second,we will not read from legislative silence an intent to overturn a substantial line of authority in line with brock to the contrary,had the legislature intended to abrogate decisions such as spencer macdonald constr,supra,d,as respondents urge it did,it would have so stated,as it has in other contexts.see,subd.a.third,elsner interpretation of the statement of legislative intent to preserve brock holding would carve out an exception tending to conflict with the legislature concurrent repeal of a provision immunizing the state from civil penalties.stats.until the legislature rewrote the provision in,former section provided the civil penalties provided for in this chapter shall not be assessed against employers that are governmental entities.following ab passage,the state is subject to civil penalties for its safety violations as are other employers and third parties,and nothing in the statute exempts it from the effects of section as long as it is an employer as defined in section.
legislative history does not compel a different result 
our consideration of the relevant legislative history does not change our conclusion.to the contrary,in our view it indicates lawmakers were ultimately persuaded to reject the expansion of civil negligence liability to third party defendants based on an alleged violation of regulations.
as originally drafted,assembly bill amended section pertaining to admissibility of standards and orders to expressly permit such standards and orders but not evidence of citations or the lack of citations to be introduced into evidence in any personal injury and wrongful death action.assem.bill.reg.sess.as introduced.in part,the initial version of section read neither the issuance of,or failure to issue,a citation by the division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action except as between an employee and his or her own employer.this division and the occupational safety and health standards and orders promulgated under this code may have application to,be considered in,or be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action,some italics and strikeouts omitted.the plain effect of the italicized language,as reflected by an assembly bill analysis dated april,was to repeal the law barring admission of safety regulations and standards into evidence for purposes of establishing the standard of care.assem.com.on labor and employment,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced february.

on september,the senate added the following language to the amended text of section the testimony of employees of the division shall not be admissible as expert opinion or with respect to the application of occupational safety and health standards.the next day,the senate made its final amendment to the bill,adding the statement it is the intent of the legislature that the amendments to this section enacted in the regular session shall not abrogate the holding in brock state of california d.the legislative council digest in the chaptered text of the bill gives no guidance as to the impetus for this final addition.indeed the legislative counsel digest fails to mention brock at all.
this sequence of events persuades us the legislature,ultimately,decided to maintain the prohibition on use of safety orders and standards in employees personal injury cases against third party defendants.we focus on the fact lawmakers once proposed a provision unambiguously stating otherwise,but deleted it when the bill was passed the rejection by the legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision.beverly anderson th,d see also california mfrs.public utilities com.cal d.similarly,t he fact that the legislature chose to omit a provision from the final version of a statute which was included in an earlier version constitutes strong evidence that the act as adopted should not be construed to incorporate the original provision.beverly anderson,at,d.id.elsner points out that at the same time this provision was deleted,the legislature inserted other language the provision as to evidence code,sections and stating the same principle in another way.while one could argue under this circumstance the established rule regarding deletion of a provision does not govern see el dorado palm springs,city of palm springs th,d,we believe the legislature put any such notion to rest by its later reference to brock.further,the final legislative council digest omitted the statement that the bill repealed the exception to the rule permitting use of government regulations and ordinances to prove negligence 
nor does a later opinion by the legislative counsel as to the meaning of assembly bill amendments change our conclusion.in april,six months after the governor signed assembly bill into law,the office of legislative counsel issued an opinion on the effect of the amendments to sections and.ops.cal.legis.counsel,april,employer liability.legislative counsel opined as to section,the legislature authorized statutory and regulatory standards to be admissible under sections and of the evidence code in actions by injured workers against his or her own employer,including a separate employer at a multiemployer worksite,or against a defendant,where the action is otherwise permitted by law and codif ied existing regulatory law governing employer liability at multiemployer worksites,as set forth in section of title sic of the california code of regulations.id.at.relying on california of psychology providers rank cal d,california,elsner contends this opinion is persuasive evidence of the legislature intent uveges disagrees,pointing out the opinion is merely an ex post facto interpretation of legislative intent and should not be given weight because,not having been presented to lawmakers during the legislative process,it can not be viewed as an indication of the legislature understanding of the effect of its measure.
we agree with uveges.in california,supra,cal d at,the california supreme court noted that opinions of the attorney general,while not binding,are entitled to great weight,and applied that rule to legislative counsel opinions.the court statement,however,was premised on its understanding that such opinions were prepared while the subject legislation was pending.ibid.while we have found no cases extending that rule to constructions by the legislative counsel,the logic is the same.indeed the rule is particularly compelling as to opinions of the legislative counsel,since they are prepared to assist the legislature in its consideration of pending legislation see also north hollywood project area city of los angeles th,d.we decline to consider this post hoc material evidence of legislative intent,el dorado palm springs,city of palm springs,supra,th at,d.
having concluded section only authorizes admission of regulations or violations into evidence in proceedings by an employee against his or her own employer and that the court erred in permitting the jury to consider evidence of applicable regulations and uveges violations,we turn to whether the trial court error prejudiced uveges.uveges contends he was severely prejudiced by the erroneous introduction of this evidence,which resulted in a improper instructions advising the jury that violation of the standards established a presumption of negligence b an erroneous instruction defining employer for purposes of section by reference to section multiemployer workplace provision c the exclusion of standard of care evidence by his own experts and d counsel repeated arguments highlighting these issues.he argues these errors combined to deprive him of a fair trial and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.elsner argues the court ruling regarding the regulations,even if error,caused no prejudice because the jury negligence finding rests on substantial evidence of uveges negligence unrelated to violations uveges retained a defense to negligence per se liability,namely,that he did what might reasonably be expected of a person of ordinary prudence,acting under similar circumstances,who desired to comply with the law and uveges conduct was in any event subject to multiemployer workplace regulations,tit.

we first address elsner contention that regardless of any possible error in admitting evidence of standards and giving negligence per se instructions on those standards,there was in any event substantial evidence on which the jury could conclude uveges breached his common law duty of due care he relies on the proposition if one count is not affected by error and there is substantial evidence to support a verdict with respect to it,it is immaterial that there may have been errors committed in connection with another count citations.one count sustained by sufficient evidence and free from error is all that is required to support a verdict.leoni delany d,see also berger southern pac.d,wells brown d.elsner points out his expert mcdowell testified that the scaffold at single plank spanning feet from one side of a patio area to a roof,anchored in the center with a strut nailed to an unstable pile of the most abysmal,substandard installation he had seen in his years of experience a widowmaker in his terms.the expert explained uveges did not meet his obligation to anchor the center support securely in that the center support was only three and a half inches wide and was used to support a plank the center support base was nailed through a corner with a single nail and did not sit flat upon the truss below and the center support was set on an unstable pile of lumber.mcdowell also noted the plank was attached to the roof with a single nail within three quarters of an inch from the end of the plank,and would have penetrated the plywood just slightly.
had the trial court limited its evidentiary rulings to admission of osha standards and regulations based on its erroneous interpretation of section,we would agree this evidence would be sufficient to uphold the jury finding of negligence based on uveges common law duty of due care.but the court reasoned custom and practice evidence is inadmissible when it contradicts a law or ordinance,namely the standards.it therefore excluded any expert testimony offered by uveges that the scaffold frey constructed met the standard of care for single family residential construction,or was in keeping with custom and practice for that type of job.thus,the trial court error did affect elsner case based on uveges general duty of due care unrelated to standards.in the absence of the trial court error in interpreting section,evidence of custom and practice would be admissible to rebut elsner contention that the scaffold construction fell below the standard of care and violated uveges duty to provide safe equipment.see mckown stores,supra,cal th at,d,when a hirer of an independent contractor,by negligently furnishing unsafe equipment to the contractor,affirmatively contributes to the injury of an employee of the contractor,the hirer should be liable to the employee for the consequences of the hirer own negligence mackey campbell construction,supra,d at.court correctly excluded expert testimony based on regulations,but properly allowed expert testimony on custom and practice of scaffold assembly in california.the ruling deprived uveges of an essential defense against elsner claim he breached his common law duty of due care.because the ruling prevented him from fully presenting his case,it denied him a fair trial,kelly new west fed.savings th,d effect of granting in limine motions was to prevent plaintiffs from offering evidence to establish their case this exclusionary error resulted in denial of a fair trial and was reversible per se see also southern pacific transportation santa fe pacific pipelines,th,d court ruling excluding all evidence of a particular valuation method for calculating easement rents based on an erroneous application of contract interpretation principles was prejudicial per se.
elsner contends uveges can not complain of the court ruling on appeal because he failed to make the required offer of proof under evidence code section,providing an appellant show the trial court the substance,purpose,and relevance of the excluded evidence we reject elsner offer of proof contention for two reasons.first,an exception to the general requirement of an offer of proof under evidence code section applies here an offer of proof is not a prerequisite to an argument of improper exclusion of evidence w here an entire class of evidence has been declared inadmissible or the trial court has clearly intimated that it will receive no evidence of a particular type or class,or upon a particular issue lawless calaway cal d,castaneda bornstein th,d,overruled on other grounds in bonds roy cal th,d.here,the trial court declared an entire class of evidence,expert opinion on the standard of care or custom and practice in the single family residence construction industry.the excluded testimony,which was relevant to elsner claim under general negligence principles,obviously fell within that class.the court evidentiary ruling was the natural consequence of its previous determination that standards were relevant and admissible to prove standard of care in view of the court final determination on that issue it would have been futile for uveges to extend an offer of proof,subd.b see,pacific gas electric thomas drayage rigging cal d,fn.witkin,cal.evidence ed.presentation at trial.
second,evidence code section was satisfied as to the excluded testimony without a formal offer of proof.elsner made clear the substance of the expert testimony in his motion he sought to prevent the expert,edward martinet,from testifying frey scaffold met the standard of care for smaller construction jobs and attached a portion of martinet deposition testimony in which martinet set forth his conclusion the temporary scaffold was very common on single family projects and met the standard of care for this industry.because the record establishes that the substance,purpose,and relevance of the excluded testimony was known to the court,subd.a,uveges was not required to make a formal offer of proof to preserve his claim of evidentiary error.
although we need not address them,we reject elsner other arguments pertaining to prejudice.because elsner could not assert a theory of negligence per se based on regulations under section,it is irrelevant that uveges purportedly could have proved a defense to that claim,namely,that he did what might reasonably be expected of a person of ordinary prudence,acting under similar circumstances,who desired to comply with the law.elsner asserts uveges presented such evidence through the testimony of edward martinet.we disagree with elsner characterization of the record.the trial court evidentiary ruling essentially prevented martinet from testifying that the scaffold was built in a reasonable manner,in keeping with scaffolds of the sort used in similar projects.indeed martinet testimony was confined to his opinions that certain violations did not cause elsner injuries,and the scaffold construction and the placement of a scrap pile underneath nevertheless complied with standards as he interpreted them.
finally,we reject elsner argument that
