background 
infinity issued plaintiff an rsvp repair satisfaction vehicle program physical damage only policy the policy,which contains the following limitation of coverage clause if you choose to utilize a repair facility which is not a rsvp shop,we will pay eighty percent of the fair and responsible charges from that repair facility.the policy lists affiliated repair shops,called rsvp shops,that are exempt from the limitation of coverage clause.of the rsvp shops listed in the policy,are located in the los angeles area where plaintiff resides.
when plaintiff vehicle was damaged in an automobile accident,he filed a claim with infinity and had the vehicle repaired at a shop of his choice.infinity inspected plaintiff vehicle and approved the reasonable repair costs,which were discounted by percent in accordance with the policy limitation of coverage clause.
on october,plaintiff filed a purported class action complaint against infinity based on the theory that the policy limitation of coverage clause violates subdivision d of section.plaintiff filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself and a class of california plaintiffs who meet the following conditions plaintiffs were covered during a specified time period under the policy plaintiffs suffered covered losses to their vehicles plaintiffs had their vehicles repaired at the shops of their choice and due to the policy limitation of coverage clause,plaintiffs received coverage for only percent of the reasonable repair costs.
based on the theory that the policy limitation of coverage clause violates subdivision d of section the complaint requested the following relief compensatory damages for violation of section first cause of action punitive damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing second cause of action and restitution,disgorgement of profits,and injunctive relief for violation of the ucl third cause of action.on april,plaintiff amended the complaint to add a fourth cause of action under a theory of unjust enrichment.
infinity demurred to the first amended complaint on the ground that the policy limitation of coverage clause does not violate section.infinity argued that it is free to contract with its insureds for two tiers of coverage and that nothing in section requires that it pay percent of all reasonable repair costs in excess of the deductible.infinity contended that section allows it to provide a reduced rate of coverage for repairs performed at shops,provided that the reduction is not tied to the amount that would have been charged by an rsvp repair shop.infinity asserted that because the policy limitation of coverage was not based on charges that would have been incurred had the vehicle been repaired by the insurer chosen shop,subd.d,there was no statutory violation 
in opposition to the demurrer,plaintiff argued in relevant part that the policy limitation of coverage clause violates both the express language and the clear intent of section.plaintiff contended that because the statute requires infinity to pay percent of all reasonable repair costs,the discounts beyond the reasonable repair costs are a per se violation of the bill express language,as well as its clear intent.the insurer must pay the prescribed coverage level,in this case,of the reasonable costs of repair,less the deductible.plaintiff further reasoned that because the reduced rate of coverage violates section,the statutory violation provides the basis for a claim under the unlawful prong of the ucl.plaintiff pointed out that virtually any law can serve as a predicate for a claim of unfair competition,under the unlawful prong,including a regulatory statute.express,llc fetish group,d.
the trial court rejected plaintiff arguments and sustained the demurrer to the entire complaint without leave to amend.as relevant to this appeal,the trial court held that the first cause of action for violation of section must fail because the limitation of coverage clause is not based on the amount that would have been charged by an rsvp shop and,therefore,does not violate the statute and the third cause of action for violation of the ucl must fail because there is no illegality on which to base the ucl claim because there was no statutory violation.the trial court denied leave to amend on the ground that an amendment would be futile in light of plaintiff failure to establish the existence of facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal on june.plaintiff has timely appealed from the judgment.

ii.section does not require percent coverage of reasonable repair costs 
plaintiff contends,as he did below,that section requires insurers to pay percent of the reasonable repair costs incurred at any facility of the insured choice.in support of this contention,plaintiff argues that the legislative intent in enacting section was to prohibit insurers from steering insureds to particular repair shops by requiring insurers to pay the cost of repair charged by the insured chosen shop without discount,if the amount charged for the repairs is reasonable.the prohibition is intended to prevent insurance companies from using coercive tactics to illegally steer consumers to particular body shops or dissuade consumers from using their own chosen shops.excerpt from the insurance commissioner legislative analyst endorsing section.infinity policy is coercive a
