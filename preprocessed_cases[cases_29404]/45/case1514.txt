on march,kelly ann kelly was killed in a car accident involving a rig driven by david white.white,the owner of the freightline tractor,was pulling a trailmobile trailer for supreme transport services,llc together.supreme leased the trailer from united trailer leasing,a division of hargol corporation,which in turn is a subsidiary of koch.kelly ann kelly husband,kevin kelly kelly,brought a wrongful death action in minnesota state court against the driver of the car she was riding in,the driver of a car that was driving next to the car she was in,and.koch was not a party to the kelly litigation.tendered their defense in the kelly litigation to sirius american insurance company sirius,which insured for in liability coverage.
during the discovery phase of the kelly litigation,kelly obtained a copy of koch policy with great west.on june,with a trial scheduled for september,kelly put koch and great west on notice of the kelly litigation and asserted that great west coverage was exposed because qualified as insureds under the policy.on july,great west notified kelly of its position that the policy did not extend to.on july,kelly counsel wrote a letter to great west,which it forwarded to koch the following day,stating that kelly believed koch policy was implicated in the kelly litigation because the trailer involved was a covered auto pursuant to the policy definition of the term and supreme was an insured under the policy as coverage was afforded not only to the named insured,but also to permissive users of covered autos including those subject to a contract or rental.the letter recognized sirius as the primary insurer for with the great west policy providing excess coverage.the letter also provided that,due to great west position that coverage did not exist,kelly would attempt to mediate the claim against supreme and then pursue great west directly for coverage.on july,tendered the kelly litigation to great west to the extent coverage is provided under the policy.
in response to these developments,great west retained an attorney,ted smetak,to advise it of its obligations to.smetak performed a lengthy coverage analysis,and,on august,recommended that great west deny coverage for the kelly accident.however,smetak qualified his recommendation,acknowledging that there were arguments both for and against coverage such that the position that the policy did not cover,although valid,might lose.smetak also pointed out two settlement devices under minnesota law that kelly could utilized to pursue great west coverage assuming the policy covered the kelly accident,a settlement agreement and a drake ryan settlement agreement 
on august,smetak authored a follow up opinion,discussing an intimation by kelly counsel in his correspondence to great west,that a hybrid settlement agreement might be reached among the parties to the kelly litigation which combined the features of a settlement agreement with a drake ryan agreement,which if valid,might possibly allow the claimants to simultaneously settle for some dollar sum the sirius layer and stipulate to another in damages.smetak suggested that if this was kelly intention,great west should proceed with more caution in denying coverage because denying coverage is a necessary to a miller shugart stipulated judgment great west might not have another opportunity to step in and admit coverage the dollar exposure after a miller shugart settlement could be a lot more than that which a jury would assign after a trial and the risk that coverage can be found to exist under the great west policy was not an insignificant risk.thus,the bottom line,as stated by smetak,was that the argument for coverage exists and that t he defense theories against that argument are far from rock solid.accordingly,as of late august,great west had serious concerns that the policy extended to for purposes of the kelly accident.
the trial in the kelly litigation was to begin on september.on september,great west informed william sullivan,koch risk manager,via fax,that great west had not yet made a decision on whether the policy provided excess coverage for the kelly accident,that great west would keep koch posted about developments in the case,and that sullivan could call great west with any questions.the fax also contained copies of two letters,both of that same date,from kelly counsel and smetak.the kelly letter provided that kelly,as well as two other plaintiffs in the kelly litigation,had made a joint demand in all three cases for the sirius policy limits of that there was a substantial likelihood of the jury finding more than at fault,rendering jointly and severally liable for all of the damages which would be far in excess of the sirius coverage and as a result,koch would be liable for the excess judgment.the smetak letter addressed the information provided in the kelly letter,noting that the joint demand by the kelly plaintiffs had removed some of the obstacles to settlement with sirius.
on september,with the kelly litigation approaching trial,kelly counsel notified smetak of kelly intention to pursue a agreement with.on september,great west provided sullivan with smetak coverage opinion of that same date.there,smetak acknowledged both that great west does not wish to accept coverage and that coverage for this kind of claim is illogical.smetak goes on to state that if great west was very confident that there was no coverage then it should not admit coverage.then the issue would be whether the policy provided coverage for and,if a court found that it did not,any settlement agreement involving a stipulated judgment against koch would be of no consequence.however,smetak again cautioned great west that if it believed there was a risk that a court would construe the policy to apply to,then it is a risk.because that is what kelly attorneys will try to put into the miller shugart.that is the balancing act.while i would like to be able to guarantee you a declaration of no coverage,the risk is greater than that.
immediately before the trial began,sirius entered into a drake ryan release with kelly,preserving kelly right to proceed against great west and further increasing the likelihood that would enter into a settlement with respect to the policy.based on smetak observations,the developments between kelly and,great west concern that it would be unsuccessful in disproving coverage,and great west belief that it was very likely that there would be a defense verdict at trial exonerating and mooting the coverage issue great west accepted coverage for on september.at that time,koch had not issued a written objection to coverage.however,sullivan testified that he verbally objected to coverage when he learned that great west was planning on accepting coverage,which according to sullivan,was one to two weeks before the kelly litigation went to trial.
the kelly litigation proceeded to trial,and the jury returned a million verdict,assigning of the fault to.see kelly ellefson.appealed the judgment,and the minnesota court of appeals,citing a number of trial errors,reversed and remanded for on the liability issues.kelly ellefson,wl,unpublished.though kelly petitioned for review of all issues,the minnesota supreme court granted review and reversed only as to the court of appeals finding that the trial court abused its discretion by denying admission of kelly pleadings,interrogatory answers,and expert affidavit.kelly,at.the court then remanded the case.id.at 
in may,while the kelly verdict was on appeal,the claims of corbin ellefson,who was also injured in the accident,were being addressed in a mediation session.great west agreed to pay ellefson to settle his claims.in accordance with the retention,great west paid the full settlement to ellefson and then requested reimbursement of from koch.koch declined to pay the retention,asserting that it had never acquiesced that coverage is applicable in this case.
in june,koch filed this declaratory judgment action,seeking a declaration that were not insureds under the policy and that great west had breached the fiduciary duty it owed koch by accepting coverage for the kelly accident and settling with ellefson great west counterclaimed,seeking a judgment that supreme and white were insureds under the policy and that great west had acted properly in accepting coverage for the kelly accident and settling the ellefson claim.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted great west motion and denied koch motion,finding that were insureds under the policy and,even if koch had raised a breach of fiduciary duty claim in its complaint,there was no evidence that great west had breached such a duty by accepting coverage in the kelly litigation or settling with ellefson.thus,the district court found that koch was obligated to pay great west the retention.koch brings this appeal.
koch contends that the district court erred in determining that were insureds under the policy for purposes of the kelly accident because the policy trucker exclusion precludes coverage and under the minnesota automobile insurance act the act,koch did not own the trailer at the time of the accident.koch further contends that the court erred in granting summary judgment to great west on the breach of fiduciary duty claim because great west breached its fiduciary duty by accepting coverage without koch consent and contrary to its express wishes and genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment for great west.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.we also review the district court interpretation of an insurance policy provision de novo.source food,fid.guar,cir.we address each of koch contentions in turn.
interpretation of an insurance policy is a matter of state law,allstate ins.blount,cir,and it is undisputed that the issues in this case are governed by minnesota law.under minnesota law,w hen insurance policy language is clear and unambiguous,the language used must be given its usual and accepted meaning.wanzek,employers ins.of wausau,quoting lobeck state farm mut.auto.ins.because the policy terms are unambiguous,our review of this appeal turns on the plain language of the policy.
t he insured bears the initial burden of demonstrating coverage,and the insurer carries the burden of establishing the applicability of exclusions.travelers indem.bloomington steel supply.however,e xclusions are to be strictly interpreted against the insurer and an insurer denying coverage because of an exclusion bears the burden of proof.agri.ins.focus homes,cir quoting bob useldinger sons,hangsleben,see am.family ins.walser,providing that insurance contract exclusions are construed narrowly and strictly against the insurer see also wanzek,at ambiguity is construed in favor of coverage.thus,due to the role reversal in this case,where it is the insured,koch,who is contending that the policy does not provide coverage,there is a corresponding reversal of the burden of proof.accordingly,it is great west that bears the burden of establishing that are insureds under the policy,and koch that must prove the applicability of the exclusion.see travelers indem,at see also agri.ins,at am.family,at.
great west contends that supreme and white are insureds under the policy because it provides coverage for anyone permissibly operating a covered vehicle,and there is no dispute as to either element supreme leased the koch trailer and the policy defines a trailer as a covered auto.however,koch argues that both sections of the policy trucker exclusion except from coverage because supreme and white are truckers,not koch employees,and they are not affiliated with koch in any way the lease agreement for the trailer states that are covered by their own motor carrier insurance requirements were covered by their own insurance policy not koch and other courts have concluded that the trucker exclusion at issue here excludes coverage for truckers like supreme and white.
we find that are insureds under the policy for purposes of the kelly accident because the definition of an insured plainly extends to permissive users of the koch trailer which is undisputedly the case here.moreover,koch has failed to demonstrate the applicability of either section of the trucker exclusion.falls within the policy definition of trucker.however,section a is inapplicable because it excludes truckers who are subject to motor carrier insurance requirements and satisfy them in a way other than auto liability insurance,and the record shows that,though subject to such requirements,met them only through the sirius policy,as koch concedes.koch has offered no argument as to how this is not dispositive of its claim as to section a.
with regard to section a,it excludes coverage for truckers that operate hired autos,here the koch trailer involved in the kelly accident,without obtaining primary insurance for the auto.koch contends that section a applies here,despite the fact that the sirius policy provides primary coverage for the tractor involved in the kelly accident,because the record does not demonstrate that obtained primary auto liability insurance for the koch trailer.this contention fails for a number of reasons.first,koch did not raise this argument until its reply brief,and we will not address it absent some explanation by koch for its failure to do so,which koch has not provided.see.plastics,holland colors americas,cir this court does not consider issues first raised in a reply brief unless the appellant gives some reason for failing to raise and brief the issue in his opening brief.furthermore,even if we were to address koch contention,the allocation of the burden of proof on the application of an exclusion under
