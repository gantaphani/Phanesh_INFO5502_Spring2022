pursuant to a construction contract,a subcontractor agreed to indemnify the general contractor for claims and liabilities arising out of the subcontractor performance and to obtain a commercial general liability cgl policy listing the subcontractor as the named insured and the general contractor as an additional insured.the general contractor also had its own separate cgl policy,designating it as the named insured.
while the construction was in progress,an employee of the subcontractor was injured and filed suit against the general contractor.the subcontractor insurer provided a defense and settled the case,using its own funds.
the subcontractor insurer then filed this action against the general contractor own insurer,seeking payment of of the defense and settlement expenses.the general contractor own insurer asserted it was not liable for contribution because,under the indemnity provision in the construction contract,the general contractor was not liable to the subcontractor in any amount.on for summary judgment,the trial court agreed with the subcontractor insurer and entered judgment against the general contractor own insurer.
we conclude that,just as the general contractor is not liable to the subcontractor under the indemnity provision,so the general contractor own insurer is not liable to the subcontractor insurer.to hold otherwise would negate the indemnity provision in the construction contract.we therefore reverse.
background 
because this case comes to us on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we treat as true all of the factual assertions and reasonable inferences supported by plaintiff evidence.see jackson county of los angeles th,d.
pcs was the general contractor on a construction project commonly known as the willis project,located in sherman oaks,california.pcs was insured under a cgl policy obtained on its own,issued by hawley insurance company hawley,effective may,to may.
on january,pcs entered into a subcontract with kowalski sheet metal,doing business as valley metal supply valley metal.the subcontract required valley metal to obtain a cgl policy for itself and to include coverage for pcs as an additional insured.valley metal fulfilled that obligation by purchasing a cgl policy from hartford casualty insurance company hartford,effective through april.
the subcontract also contained an indemnification provision,stating the insurance maintained by valley metal shall insure the performance of valley metal indemnification obligations as set forth herein,but nothing in the insurance shall in any way limit the indemnification provided for hereunder.to the fullest extent permitted by law,valley metal shall defend,indemnify and hold pcs harmless from and against any and all costs,liabilities,losses,expenses,liens,claims,demands and causes of action of every kind and character including those of valley metal,its agents and employees for death,bodily injury,and personal injury including costs,attorneys fees and settlements arising out of or in any way connected with the performance of work under this subcontract,by act or omission,whether performed by valley metal or any other subcontractor or any independent contractor or any agent,employee,invitee or licensee of valley metal,whether resulting from or contributed to by negligence in any form,whether active or passive,except the sole negligence or willful misconduct of pcs 
on march,an employee of valley metal,jack cortez,was injured at the jobsite while attempting to carry materials to the roof of a partially constructed building.cortez was at the site for the first time.he was following his supervisor,also employed by valley metal,to a stairway.they came to an unlit area where cortez fell four to six feet to the bottom of an open elevator shaft.he injured his left wrist severely,requiring surgery and extensive therapy.
cortez received workers compensation benefits from valley metal carrier,fremont compensation insurance company.fremont in turn filed suit against pcs to recover in benefits already paid and estimated future benefits of about fremont compensation insurance,no.cortez filed a complaint in intervention against pcs,seeking damages for personal injuries 
pcs contacted its general liability insurer,hawley.pursuant to the insurance and indemnity provisions of the subcontract,hawley tendered defense of the suit to valley metal general liability insurer,hartford.on february,hartford accepted the defense of the action and assigned the case to the law firm of cline associates.cline filed separate answers to fremont and cortez complaints.cline also filed a against electric,the subcontractor allegedly responsible for lighting at the jobsite,contending that failed to provide adequate lighting in the area where cortez fell,thus causing the accident.
subsequent correspondence between hartford and hawley addressed,but failed to resolve,the issue of whether hartford would provide pcs with indemnity.eventually,by letter to pcs dated january,mary johnson,a claim consultant with hartford,stated the hartford hereby agrees to indemnify you in the pending action.per the indemnity provision in the contract,full indemnification will be provided except for your sole negligence or willful misconduct 
on january,hartford tendered the defense of the case to electric insurer,reliance insurance company,based on an indemnity provision in the subcontract between pcs and electric.reliance was in liquidation,and the california insurance guarantee association,which was defending electric,denied the tender.
on april,johnson spoke with defense counsel at cline and evaluated the case for purposes of settlement.in her typed roundtable notes of the same date,johnson stated,per the contract,hartford policy is primary and indemnification is owed for all except sole negligence or willful misconduct of pcs.johnson also allocated fault among those involved in the accident,estimating that pcs was to percent negligent,electric was percent negligent,valley metal was to percent negligent,and cortez was percent negligent,if at all.
the next day,johnson prepared a reserve memo for hartford home office,essentially repeating the information from her roundtable notes,estimating pcs negligence at to percent and stating that i ndemnification is owed to pcs except for claims arising from sole negligence or willful misconduct of pcs.
the superior court ordered the case to mediation.johnson sent a memo to hugh downes,an independent adjuster,asking him to attend the mediation on hartford behalf.the memo noted that hartford is defending general contractor,pcs,per their status as an additional insured.per the contract,hartford policy is primary and indemnification is owed for all except sole negligence or willful misconduct of pcs.the memo also discussed how pcs,electric,and valley metal were each negligent in causing the accident.
by letter dated april,coverage counsel for hartford encouraged hawley to participate in the mediation,stating that a jury could easily feel sorry for cortez and solely blame pcs for the inadequate lighting and for their failure to barricade an open ditch i t is our position that hawley insurance company is facing a large potential exposure,and they should participate and contribute toward a resolution of this claim.
the mediation was held on april.hartford settled cortez complaint in intervention for.on april,johnson received an from cline,asking that she process the settlement check.hartford funded the entire settlement.
after the settlement with cortez,hartford pursued settlement of fremont workers compensation lien.the matter was submitted to mediation.johnson was still of the opinion that cortez employer,valley metal,was partly at fault for the accident.on may,cline sent johnson an,stating that fremont had accepted a settlement offer of.hartford paid the entire amount.
on november,hartford filed this action against hawley,seeking declaratory relief,contribution,and indemnity based on the amounts hartford had paid to defend and settle the lawsuit by cortez and fremont.neither of the insureds,pcs and valley metal,was sued.the complaint alleged that cortez injuries were caused by the sole negligence of pcs.it was further alleged that the respective insurance policies contained identical other insurance provisions,stating when coverage would be primary or excess and describing how multiple insurers would contribute toward defense costs and indemnity 
both insurers filed for summary judgment.hartford argued that hawley was liable for of the defense and settlement expenses under a theory of equitable contribution.hawley asserted that,because pcs was not solely negligent in causing cortez injuries,the indemnity provision in the subcontract obligated valley metal to indemnify pcs.thus,according to this argument,valley metal insurer,hartford,could not obtain contribution from pcs insurer,hawley.the trial court granted hartford summary judgment motion,denied hawley motion,and awarded hartford,plus interest.hawley appealed.

subrogation and contribution 
an insurer that has paid defense and settlement expenses may pursue reimbursement from other insurers on various equitable grounds,including subrogation and contribution.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group to,to.hartford contends it is entitled to contribution from hawley.for its part,hawley argues that hartford is not entitled to payment on any basis.
subrogation is defined as the substitution of another person in place of the creditor or claimant to whose rights he or she succeeds in relation to the debt or claim.by undertaking to indemnify or pay the principal debtor obligation to the creditor or claimant,the subrogee is equitably subrogated to the claimant or subrogor,and succeeds to the subrogor rights against the obligor in the case of insurance,subrogation takes the form of an insurer right to be put in the position of the insured in order to pursue recovery from third parties legally responsible to the insured for a loss which the insurer has both insured and paid as now applied the doctrine of equitable subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder,pays a debt for which another is primarily liable,and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.
the right of subrogation is purely derivative.an insurer entitled to subrogation is in the same position as an assignee of the insured claim,and succeeds only to the rights of the insured.the subrogated insurer is said to stand in the shoes of its insured,because it has no greater rights than the insured and is subject to the same defenses assertable against the insured.thus,an insurer can not acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured has no rights,and may claim no rights which the insured does not have 
equitable contribution is entirely different.it is the right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk,each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured.equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others 
this right of equitable contribution belongs to each insurer individually.it is not based on any right of subrogation to the rights of the insured,and is not equivalent to standing in the shoes of the insured instead,the reciprocal contribution rights of coinsurers who insure the same risk are based on the equitable principle that the burden of indemnifying or defending the insured with whom each has independently contracted should be borne by all the insurance carriers together,with the loss equitably distributed among those who share liability for it in direct ratio to the proportion each insurer coverage bears to the total coverage provided by all the insurance polices as a matter of equity,insurers of the same risk may sue each other for contribution this right is not a matter of contract,but flows from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden.the idea is that the insurers are equally bound,so therefore they all should contribute to the payment.
unlike subrogation,the right to equitable contribution exists independently of the rights of the insured.it is predicated on the commonsense principle that where multiple insurers or indemnitors share equal contractual liability for the primary indemnification of a loss or the discharge of an obligation,the selection of which indemnitor is to bear the loss should not be left to the often arbitrary choice of the loss claimant,and no indemnitor should have any incentive to avoid paying a just claim in the hope the claimant will obtain full payment from another coindemnitor 
the different equitable principles on which contribution and subrogation are based are reflective of different underlying public policies.the aim of equitable subrogation is to place the burden for a loss on the party ultimately liable or responsible for it and by whom it should have been discharged,and to relieve entirely the insurer or surety who indemnified the loss and who in equity was not primarily liable therefor on the other hand,the aim of equitable contribution is to apportion a loss between two or more insurers who cover the same risk,so that each pays its fair share and one does not profit at the expense of the others.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d,citations and fn.omitted,italics in original see maryland casualty nationwide mutual ins.th,d equitable contribution,not subrogation,applies where construction contract does not contain indemnity provision.
effect of the indemnity provision 
as stated,hartford relies on equitable contribution in arguing that hawley is liable for of the defense and settlement expenses.hawley contends that equitable contribution is precluded because its insured,pcs,is not liable to valley metal,hartford insured,by operation of the indemnity provision.as a general matter,the courts will assess whether the factual circumstances create a relationship between the indemnity contract and the insurance allocation issues travelers casualty surety american equity ins.th,d travelers.
hartford seeks to obtain equitable contribution from hawley notwithstanding the indemnity provision in the subcontract between pcs and valley metal,which reads the insurance maintained by valley metal shall insure the performance of valley metal indemnification obligations as set forth herein,but nothing in the insurance shall in any way limit the indemnification provided for hereunder.to the fullest extent permitted by law,valley metal shall defend,indemnify and hold pcs harmless from and against any and all costs,liabilities,losses,expenses,liens,claims,demands and causes of action arising out of or in any way connected with the performance of work under this subcontract,except the sole negligence or willful misconduct of pcs 
thus,valley metal agreed to indemnify and hold pcs harmless absent pcs sole negligence or willful misconduct.pcs had no contractual duty to indemnify valley metal.hartford was undoubtedly aware of the indemnity provision throughout the underlying litigation as it repeatedly stated in writing that p er the contract,hartford policy is primary and indemnification is owed for all except sole negligence or willful misconduct of pcs,or words to that effect.indeed,in the complaint in this action,hartford alleged that pcs was solely negligent in causing cortez injuries,thus acknowledging the effect of the indemnity provision.yet,hartford now argues that the indemnity provision is irrelevant and that principles of equitable contribution are controlling.
in rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d,rossmoor,the supreme court rejected that very argument.there,a property owner,rossmoor sanitation,owner,employed a contractor,pylon,contractor,to construct a sewage pump station and sewer lines.although the owner already had insurance through insurance company of north america owner insurer or ina,the construction contract required the contractor to obtain a cgl policy and to include the owner as an additional insured.to that end,the contractor obtained insurance from united states fire insurance company contractor insurer or fire.the contract also obligated the contractor to indemnify and hold the owner harmless against all claims for damages arising out of the work.both insurance policies contained other insurance provisions calling for apportionment if the insured had other insurance against a loss covered by the policy.
two of the contractor employees were working in an open trench when it caved in,injuring one employee and killing the other.in a suit against the owner by the injured employee and the heirs of the deceased worker,the plaintiffs recovered a judgment of around,plus costs of suit and other expenses.the owner insurer paid those amounts.
the owner then brought an action against the contractor and the contractor insurer,seeking declaratory relief and indemnification for the amounts paid in the prior action.the contractor insurer filed a against the owner insurer,seeking to apportion the amounts between the two insurers pursuant to the other insurance provisions.the trial court found that the terms of the indemnity provision in the contract were sufficiently clear to cover the accident the owner negligence,if any,was passive neither the contractor nor the contractor insurer was entitled to any benefits or setoffs by reason of the owner coverage and the owner insurer and the contractor insurer were subrogated to the rights of their respective insureds,enabling the owner insurer to benefit from the indemnity provision.the trial court entered judgment in favor of the owner and its insurer.
on appeal,the supreme court affirmed,stating where,as here,the parties have expressly contracted with respect to the duty to indemnify,the extent of that duty must be determined from the contract and not by reliance on the independent doctrine of equitable indemnity 
t he question whether an indemnity agreement covers a given case turns primarily on contractual interpretation,and it is the intent of the parties as expressed in the agreement that should control.when the parties knowingly bargain for the protection at issue,the protection should be afforded.this requires an inquiry into the circumstances of the damage or injury and the language of the contract of necessity,each case will turn on its own facts.
under the indemnity agreement in the present case,the owner is not to be held accountable for any loss or injury to any person occurring during construction undertaken by the contractor,and the contractor has agreed to indemnify the owner for all claims arising out of its execution of the work.it is a reasonable and practical conclusion that the parties bargained for the protection here at issue,given the language of the contract and the facts,as found by the trial court,that the accident resulted from the contractor inadequate execution of the work,not from any active negligence by the owner.since the accident may be seen as one of the risks against which the owner sought to be covered,the owner is entitled to the protection it seeks under the agreement.
generally,an insurer on paying a loss is subrogated in a corresponding amount to the insured right of action against any person responsible for the loss california law is in accord that insurance companies may be subrogated to the rights of their insureds it would appear,therefore,that the trial court could properly find that the owner insurer was subrogated to the owner right of indemnification since the owner insurer paid the judgment for the owner and since the owner has a right of indemnity against the contractor.
the contractor and its insurer,however,cite case law for the proposition that the terms of the insurance contracts requiring proration in case of other insurance should control,rather than the right to indemnification that exists between the parties insured by the contracts.under the circumstances of the present case,we can not agree the case at bar concerns a contractual indemnity agreement,not theoretical noncontractual rights of indemnification between insureds 
it appears that both of the insurers calculated and accepted premiums with knowledge that they might be called upon to satisfy a full judgment.there is no evidence that either company knew there was or would be other insurance when they issued the policies.the fact that there is other insurance is a mere fortuitous circumstance.we view one factor as compelling,however to apportion the loss in this case pursuant to the other insurance clauses would effectively negate the indemnity agreement and impose liability on the owner insurer when the owner bargained with the contractor to avoid that very result as part of the consideration for the construction agreement.we therefore conclude that the rights of indemnity and subrogation must control,and are persuaded the trial court was correct in finding that because the contractor policy was part of the consideration for the construction job,it must be viewed as primary insurance under the facts of this case and that the owner insurer was subrogated to the rights of the owner.rossmoor,supra,cal d at,citations omitted,italics added.
similarly,in this case,the indemnity provision in the subcontract stated that pcs would not be liable for any claims or damages unless caused by its sole negligence or willful misconduct.in its complaint,hartford alleged that pcs was solely negligent in causing the accident.the complaint did not allege nor does hartford contend on appeal that pcs engaged in willful misconduct.in moving for summary judgment,hawley established as an undisputed fact that pcs was not solely negligent.in that regard,hartford claims consultant,mary johnson,consistently stated that,at most,pcs was to percent negligent,with valley metal,electric,and possibly cortez bearing the rest of the fault.valley metal included pcs as an additional insured under the hartford policy as part of the consideration for the construction job.and it appears both insurers knew that they might have to satisfy a full judgment.in short,the indemnity provision precludes any recovery by valley metal against pcs.
as rossmoor instructs,the indemnity provision would be effectively negated if valley metal insurer,hartford,were permitted to recover against pcs insurer,hawley,pursuant to the insurance policies other insurance provisions or the doctrine of equitable contribution.see rossmoor,supra,cal d at fn.hartford seemingly agreed that it could not recover against hawley by repeatedly representing to pcs in the underlying litigation that,because of the subcontract,pcs was not liable for any damages,and valley metal was to hold pcs harmless except for pcs sole negligence or willful that,based on the complaint in this action and hawley summary judgment motion,do not apply as a matter of law.
to require hawley to pay hartford,plus interest,when hawley insured,pcs,is not liable for anything due to the indemnity provision,is inconsistent with equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice,is not predicated on any commonsense principle,and does not further the goal that each insurer pay its fair share.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d,italics added.hartford acknowledged in the underlying case that its defense and indemnity obligations to pcs were dictated by the subcontract.but in this case,hartford attempts to invoke principles of equity to negate the subcontract and collect from hawley.
just as valley metal has no right of recovery against pcs,so valley metal insurer,hartford,has no right to recover from pcs insurer,hawley.it would be unjust to impose liability on hawley when pcs bargained with valley metal to avoid that very result as part of the consideration for the construction agreement.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.hartford does not point to any language in the subcontract or the insurance policies suggesting otherwise.
as one leading treatise has stated in a variety of commercial relationships,such as,the contracts between the parties contain indemnification agreements in which one agrees to hold the other harmless for its own acts of negligence or that of its employees.such contractual arrangements can nullify a right to contribution.couch on insurance ed.similarly,an indemnity agreement between the insureds or a contract with an indemnification clause,such as is commonly found in the construction industry,may shift an entire loss to a particular insurer notwithstanding the existence of an other insurance clause in its policy.
and rossmoor does not stand alone.other courts have concluded that indemnity agreements,not policy provisions,may determine the right to contribution.in continental cas.ins.cir continental,burlington northern railway owner contracted with fitzsimmons service company contractor to salvage goods from some derailed cars.the owner was insured by interstate fire and casualty company owner insurer,and the contractor was insured by insurance company contractor insurer.in the agreement,the contractor agreed to indemnify the owner with respect to claims of injury arising out of the work performed under the agreement.one of the contractor employees was injured and sued the owner.the case settled,and the settlement was funded by both insurers.in a declaratory relief action between the insurers only,the district court ruled that they both had to contribute to the settlement.
the court of appeals reversed.it first determined that both insurers had covered the loss.it then looked to the indemnity agreement between the owner and the which the contractor had agreed to hold the owner harmless from any and all claims of concluded that the contractor insurer was obligated to bear the entire loss.as the court pointed out,the present action is founded not just on the insurance policies but also on the agreements between the owner and its c ontractor.continental,supra,at applying minnesota law.
in stores,rli ins.cir,a retailer,entered into a contract with a distributor,cheyenne industries,distributor,for the delivery and retail sale of halogen lamps.the contract stated that the distributor would indemnify against any liability resulting from the sale of the product.the contract also required the distributor to have at least million in liability insurance.
the distributor was covered by two insurance policies.paul surplus lines insurance company distributor first insurer provided primary coverage with a million limit rli insurance company distributor second insurer issued a policy with a million limit that contained an other insurance clause stating that the policy was excess as to any other unscheduled insurance of the insured.was insured under both of the distributor policies.
in addition,had its own insurance from national union insurance company insurer,which had a million limit.insurance policy was not scheduled insurance on the distributor second policy and contained an other insurance clause,stating that coverage was excess over any of the other insurance bought specifically for an insured,supra,at.
an allegedly defective lamp,which originated with the distributor and was purchased at,caused a fire,resulting in personal injuries.a lawsuit followed,brought against,the distributor,and others.the case settled for million.the distributor first insurer paid million of the settlement,and its second insurer paid the remaining million.all parties agreed that the distributor first insurer was liable for the first million of the settlement.they disagreed about the allocation of the million.
and its insurer filed a declaratory relief action to determine if they were liable to the distributor second insurer for any portion of the outstanding sum.the district court held that,by virtue of the other insurance provision in the distributor second policy,the distributor coverage was secondary to insurance,and and its insurer were therefore liable for the full million.
the court of appeals reversed,stating t he indemnity agreement controls the outcome,not the other insurance clauses e xamination of the relationships between the parties has convinced us that the distributor intended to and did make a valid promise to indemnify for claims arising from the halogen lamps,and that the distributor second insurer provided liability insurance to the distributor that covers both the settlement and the distributor indemnification obligation.in this situation we think consideration of the indemnity agreement reflects the intention of the parties and does not unfairly prejudice the insurers 
the language of the provisions is clear.the distributor has promised to indemnify for any liability or loss resulting from sale of its lamps 
notwithstanding the distributor obligation,the distributor second insurer urges this court that the indemnification provision is irrelevant to this case.it contends that only the language of insurance policies determine s the priority of payment between insurers.we reject this argument 
insurer and point this court to cases from several jurisdictions holding that an indemnity agreement prevents the indemnitee insurer from being liable for a settlement arising from a covered loss.our own court has recently reached this conclusion in continental,supra,

in american indem.lloyds travelers property cir,elite masonry,subcontractor,entered into an agreement with caddell construction company general contractor,to provide masonry services in the construction of a prison in texas.the subcontractor agreed to indemnify and hold the general contractor harmless from any and all claims and liabilities arising out of the work performed under the agreement unless there was a judicial determination that the injury,death,or damage was attributable solely to the fault or negligence of the general contractor.
pursuant to the agreement,the subcontractor obtained a cgl policy from american indemnity lloyds subcontractor insurer with itself as the named insured and the general contractor as an additional insured.the general contractor purchased a separate policy of its own from travelers property casualty insurance company general contractor insurer on which it was the named insured.both policies contained the same other insurance provisions,which are virtually identical to those in the present case.
an employee of the subcontractor was injured on the job and filed suit against both contractors.upon request,the subcontractor insurer defended the general contractor.the subcontractor was dismissed from the suit,and the action went forward as to the general contractor.the subcontractor insurer settled the case for,using its own funds,and incurred around in attorneys fees and costs in defending the general contractor.
the subcontractor insurer filed suit against the general contractor insurer,seeking of the defense and settlement expenses.the insurers filed for summary judgment.the subcontractor insurer relied on the other insurance provisions in the two policies in arguing for contribution.the general contractor insurer argued against contribution,relying on the indemnity provision in the construction agreement and pointing out that there had not been a judicial determination that the general contractor was solely at fault or negligent,either in the underlying action or the instant action.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the general contractor insurer.
on appeal,the fifth circuit affirmed,relying in large part on,supra,and rossmoor,supra,cal d.see american indem.lloyds travelers property,supra,at.the court concluded that,because the subcontractor had to indemnify the general contractor under the construction agreement,the subcontractor insurer could not obtain contribution from the general contractor insurer.see id.at fn.applying texas law accord,aetna insurance fidelity cas.of new york cir where property owner hired contractor,and contractor employee was injured while working on owner property,owner insurer did not owe contribution to contractor insurer indemnity provision in construction contract required contractor to indemnify owner and controlled over provisions in insurance policies.

more recently,in paul fire ins.am.intern.spec.lines cir paul,the owner of a vacation resort,vms lansdowne limited partnership owner,entered into a management agreement with benchmark management company operator.under the agreement,the owner agreed to indemnify the operator for liability arising out of negligence,and the operator agreed to indemnify the owner for liability arising out of gross negligence,fraud,or willful conduct.one of the resort guests became ill,allegedly as a result of food poisoning,and filed suit against the owner and the operator defendants.the case settled,funded by the defendants insurers.
the defendants insurers then joined in a declaratory relief action to determine issues of coverage and expense allocation.the district court concluded that all of the owner and operator insurers were obligated to contribute to the settlement.the operator insurers appealed,contending that they were not liable for any portion of the settlement.the court of appeals agreed and reversed,concluding that the incident of alleged food poisoning was caused by ordinary negligence,which,under the indemnity provision in the management agreement,made the owner liable to the operator.as the court explained the operator insurers argue that the owner insurance policies must respond first to satisfy the settlement because the management agreement requires the owner to indemnify the operator in this regard,the operator insurers rely on cases that give priority to indemnification agreements between the insured s in assessing the respective obligations of the insurers and hold that such agreements may prevent the indemnitee insurer from being liable for a settlement arising from a covered loss,notwithstanding the existence of an other insurance clause in the indemnitor insurance policy 
we agree with the operator insurers w e conclude that the indemnification provisions control the allocation of liability between the insurers in this case because it results in the owner having responsibility for the operator share of the settlement

it is of no consequence that hartford seeks contribution by way of equitable principles as opposed to enforcing the policies other insurance provisions.equitable contribution often serves as a substitute for that type of provision,especially where two or more insurers policies contain conflicting terms.see dart industries,commercial union ins.cal th,d,century surety united pacific ins,supra,th at,d fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d.hartford contends that such a conflict exists here.we do not address that contention given our conclusion that hawley is not liable for any portion of the defense or settlement expenses in light of the indemnity provision in the subcontract.
this is not to say that,under rossmoor,an indemnity agreement always prevails over provisions in an insurance policy,as for example where there are two levels of insurance coverage,primary and excess.as one court has noted t he supreme court decision in rossmoor did not establish that in all cases where a contract for indemnification exists an insurer is entitled to bring a subrogation action on the agreement rossmoor did not purport to establish a general rule that a contractual indemnification agreement between an insured and a third party takes precedence over general rules of primary and excess coverage in an action between insurers repeatedly articulated by california appellate courts 
the appellant primary contention is that rossmoor supports the theory that in all cases an indemnification agreement allows an insurer to be subrogated to the rights of its insured,even against an insurance company providing excess coverage.it is undisputed that the parties to the indemnity agreement are not present and this is an action between primary and excess carriers as identified by their policies.the risks involved in providing primary coverage are different from those involved in issuing an excess policy.these differences are reflected in part by the premium costs this is not a case between two primary carriers which have each received premiums for bearing the loss which ultimately occurred rather,this is an action between an excess and a primary carrier under the circumstances,rossmoor,a case involving a subrogation and indemnity dispute between two primary carriers and their insured is not controlling in the present case.reliance nat.indemnity general star indemnity th,d reliance,some italics added.
and,as rossmoor teaches,of necessity,each case will turn on its own facts,requiring an inquiry into the circumstances of the damage or injury and the language of the contract.rossmoor,supra,cal d at,see,shell oil national union fire ins.th,d scope of liability coverage afforded property owner as additional insured under contractor insurance policy not limited by indemnity provision applicable to contractor under construction contract.
c.the travelers decision 
we conclude that travelers,supra,th,d,is not dispositive here.in that case,the receiver of an apartment building in foreclosure,lakeview tower apartments owner,retained the services of a property management company,preferred capital manager.the property management agreement required the owner to obtain insurance coverage for the property and to include the manager as an additional insured.the agreement also contained an indemnity provision stating that the owner would indemnify the manager against any claims arising out of the agreement.
the owner was the named insured on a cgl policy issued by travelers casualty and surety company travelers or owner insurer,which also provided coverage for the manager as an additional insured.the manager was the named insured on a cgl policy obtained on its own from american equity insurance company american equity or manager insurer.both policies had virtually identical other insurance provisions.each policy stated that it was primary,except that it was excess over other valid and collectible insurance.travelers,supra,th at,d.
a tenant was injured at the apartment complex and filed suit against the manager.the defense of the action was tendered to both insurers.the owner insurer accepted the tender and settled the case for.the manager insurer did not participate in the defense or contribute to the settlement.the owner insurer filed suit against the manager insurer,seeking contribution for of the expenses incurred in defending and settling the case.on for summary judgment,the trial court ruled that the owner insurer was entitled to equitable contribution from the manager insurer.
on appeal,the manager insurer,relying on rossmoor,supra,cal d,argued that its coverage was excess to the owner insurance because the indemnity provision in the property management agreement stated that the owner would indemnify the manager against all claims.the court rejected that argument and affirmed,stating rossmoor is distinguishable as an action primarily between two insureds on a contract for indemnity between the two 
here,the action is between two insurers,both of whom have issued contracts of insurance covering the same insured,the manager.thus,the case looks more like the typical dispute between insurance carriers,which should be governed by general principles governing the interpretation and enforcement of other insurance clauses between insurers.
more importantly,subrogation of the insurer to the rights of the insured presupposes the insured,the manager,has a right to indemnity from the owner under the indemnity agreement.this determination was never made below and those parties the owner and the manager are not parties to this action.were the manager to seek indemnity directly from the owner under the agreement,it might be shown that the manager was not entitled to indemnity on the grounds that it was actively or intentionally negligent in causing the victim injury 
in determining whether the contractual right to indemnification between parties to insurance contracts should control over the terms of the insurance contracts requiring proration,the supreme court in rossmoor found certain equitable considerations controlling that both companies accepted premiums with knowledge they might be called upon to satisfy a full judgment,and that to apportion the loss pursuant to other insurance clauses would effectively negate the indemnity agreement and impose liability upon the owner insurer when the owner bargained with the contractor to avoid that result as part of the consideration for the construction agreement here,too,both insurers were prepared to satisfy a full judgment,although both also agreed to apportion loss in case of other insurance at the same level.however,because it has not been established and we can not say with certainty under the circumstances that the manager is entitled to indemnity from the owner under the property management agreement,we never reach the equitable consideration that rossmoor found controlling.indeed,in these circumstances,the equitable considerations favor apportionment.concern that the indemnity agreement between the manager and the owner would be negated by prorating the loss presupposes the determination that the owner would be liable to indemnify the manager under that agreement.that determination has never been made.travelers,supra,th at,d,citation omitted see also reliance,supra,th at,d language in insurance policies,not indemnity agreement,determined right to indemnity where dispute was between primary insurer and excess insurer,parties to indemnity agreement the insureds were not parties to action,and trial court in underlying suit did not decide agreement applicability or effect.
the court in travelers also commented that it would be against public policy and inconsistent with equitable considerations if insured the owner as a named insured and the manager as an additional required to prove that the manager was actively or intentionally negligent in order to recover equitable contribution from the manager own insurer,american equity.see travelers,supra,th at,d.
we conclude that travelers does not aid hartford for several reasons.
determination of pcs fault 
in moving for summary judgment here,hawley did raise the issue of liability under the indemnity provision,namely,whether hartford insured,valley metal,was obligated to indemnify hawley insured,pcs.hawley established as a matter of law that pcs was not the sole cause of cortez injuries,and,thus,under the subcontract,valley metal had to indemnify pcs.as a consequence,the determination that was not made in one insured was liable to another insured under an indemnity made in this case.travelers does not preclude such a determination the parties in travelers simply chose n
