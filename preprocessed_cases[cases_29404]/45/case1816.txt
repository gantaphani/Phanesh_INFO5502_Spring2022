after developing heart disease and other ailments,zev lagstein,filed with certain underwriters at lloyd,london lloyd a claim for benefits under a disability policy.after nearly two years passed without a decision on the claim,lagstein sued lloyd in federal court.the case was stayed pending binding arbitration mandated by lagstein policy.the majority of a arbitration panel found in favor of lagstein,awarding him full policy benefits,emotional distress damages,and punitive damages,all of which totaled more than six million dollars.the district court vacated the overall award on the ground of its excessive size and vacated the punitive damages award on the additional ground that the arbitration panel lacked jurisdiction to enter it after the panel had entered its compensatory award.we reverse the district court vacatur of the awards.we agree,however,with the district court ruling that lloyd did not establish partiality of two of the arbitrators as an additional ground of vacatur.
background 
appellant lagstein is a cardiologist and disability examiner.in,he obtained an insurance policy from appellee lloyd in which lloyd agreed to pay lagstein per month for up to sixty months in the event that lagstein became unable to practice medicine due to disability.in,lagstein developed heart disease,as well as severe migraine headaches and other neurological problems.several physicians who examined lagstein concluded that he was permanently disabled from practicing medicine.lagstein then submitted to lloyd a claim for benefits under the disability policy.
because lagstein had received no benefits or even a decision on his claim by early,he went back to work against the advice of his doctors.relations between the parties increasingly soured,and each accuses the other of delay and bad faith in the months that followed.in september,still having received no decision on his claim lagstein filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of nevada for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and unfair trade practices.upon lloyd motion,the district court stayed the lawsuit pending binding arbitration required by lagstein policy.
as provided in lagstein policy,each party appointed an arbitrator and those two arbitrators appointed a third.lagstein selected jerry carr whitehead,lloyd selected ralph williams,iii,and whitehead and williams together appointed charles springer.each of the arbitrators submitted a disclosure statement to the parties setting forth prior relationships with the parties,the parties attorneys,and those attorneys law firms.
the initial arbitration hearing was held from july to july,and the panel issued a decision on august.all three arbitrators concluded that lloyd breached the insurance contract and acted unreasonably,but the panel split on the amount of damages to be awarded.the majority,formed by springer and whitehead,concluded that lagstein should be awarded the full value of his policy,as well as for emotional distress.the majority also concluded that punitive damages were warranted,but ordered that the amount be determined at a separate hearing.
the dissenting arbitrator,williams,would have awarded lagstein only under his policy and no emotional distress damages or punitive damages.the disagreement between the majority and the dissent turned on whether the evidence showed that lagstein remained disabled from practicing medicine after he returned to work,whether lagstein proffered sufficient evidence of emotional distress,and the significance of delays in lloyd handling of the claim that were attributable to lagstein himself.
the punitive damages hearing was held on november and,over lloyd objection that the panel jurisdiction had ended once it issued the initial award.the same majority of the panel,after explaining the basis for its continued jurisdiction,awarded lagstein in punitive damages.arbitrator williams again dissented,arguing that the panel lacked jurisdiction to make the award,and that,even if it had jurisdiction,the award appropriately should have been.
following the panel initial award,lloyd investigated the backgrounds of arbitrators springer and whitehead and discovered their roles in a controversy that had occurred over a decade earlier.in,whitehead,who at the time was a nevada trial judge,became involved in an ethics controversy arising from his handling of peremptory strikes entered against him under nevada rule for peremptory striking of judges.the nevada commission on judicial discipline filed a complaint alleging that on several occasions whitehead,through ex parte contacts,permitted counsel for the party to select a replacement judge.although the commission complaint against whitehead eventually was dropped,the fbi subsequently investigated whitehead on unspecified charges.whitehead ultimately signed a agreement conditioned on his retiring from the bench,agreeing not to seek reelection,and agreeing not to serve again in any state judicial capacity.
in the meantime,a related controversy erupted over the commission procedures and jurisdiction in the whitehead investigation.these matters were addressed by an increasingly divided nevada supreme court over the course of several decisions arbitrator springer was a member of the nevada supreme court at the time and consistently sided with whitehead on these procedural and jurisdictional issues.see,whitehead iv,at springer,concurring.
lloyd filed in the district court a motion to vacate the arbitration awards on several grounds,including springer and whitehead failure to disclose the prior ethics controversy,as well as the majority decision to hold a separate punitive damages hearing after the issuance of the initial award.following a hearing on the matter,the district court vacated the awards,concluding that the size of the awards was excessive and in manifest disregard of the law,and that the punitive damages award contravened public policy and exceeded the panel jurisdiction.the district court concluded,however,that vacatur was not independently warranted by springer and whitehead of the prior controversy.
lagstein appeals the district court vacatur of the arbitration awards.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court vacatur of an arbitration award.new regency,nippon herald films,cir.our review is limited by the federal arbitration act faa,which enumerates limited grounds on which a federal court may vacate,modify,or correct an arbitral award.bosack soward,cir quoting kyocera trade,cir en banc,cert.denied.section a of the faa permits a district court to vacate an arbitration award under only four circumstances 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a.unless the award is vacated as provided in,or modified as provided in not in issue here confirmation is required even in the face of erroneous findings of fact or misinterpretations of law.kyocera,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see hall,mattel,holding that and provide the faa exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification.
the district court first ground for vacating the arbitration awards was the awards total size.as the district court explained,the amount of the awards shock ed the court conscience,suggested bias,was unsupported by the record,manifestly disregarded the law,and contravened public policy.lagstein argues that none of these reasons justified the awards vacatur.we agree.
a district court may not vacate an arbitration award simply because the court disagrees with its size.the heart of such disagreement concerns the panel weighing of the evidence,here,on matters such as the length and severity of lagstein disability and the egregiousness of lloyd conduct.but of the faa does not sanction judicial review of the merits,collins horton,cir,and w hether or not the panel findings are supported by the evidence in the record is beyond the scope of our review,bosack,at.thus,it was error for the district court to vacate the arbitration awards simply because it found the total size either shocking or unsupported by the record 
nonetheless,lloyd argues that vacatur was proper because the arbitration awards manifestly disregarded the law and were completely irrational.section permits vacatur where the arbitrators exceeded their powers.a.this is a high standard for vacatur i t is not enough to show that the panel committed an even a serious error.animalfeeds int l.a rbitrators exceed their powers not when they merely interpret or apply the governing law incorrectly,but when the award is completely irrational,or exhibits a manifest disregard of law.kyocera,at citations omitted.we conclude that neither excess occurred in this case.
first,the district court erred in concluding that the size of the arbitration awards demonstrated manifest disregard of the law manifest disregard of the law means something more than just an error in the law or a failure on the part of the arbitrators to understand or apply the law.mut.ins.unigard sec.ins,cir.to vacate an arbitration award on this ground,i t must be clear from the record that the arbitrators recognized the applicable law and then ignored it.see,comedy club,improv,cir,cert.denied.here,the district court found manifest disregard of the law without citing any applicable law that the panel recognized and ignored.similarly,on appeal,lloyd does not cite a single nevada statute or decision pertinent to the size of the arbitration award that the panel manifestly disregarded.
lloyd argues,however,that at times legally dispositive facts are so firmly established that an arbitrator can not fail to recognize them without manifestly disregarding the law.coutee barington capital group,cir.but the facts of lagstein continuing disability were hotly contested.the panel conclusion that lagstein remained disabled from the practice of medicine after returning to work is not contrary to firmly established legally dispositive facts.thus,manifest disregard of the law did not provide a basis for vacating the arbitration award.
lloyd also attempts to recast the district court vacatur as an expression that the arbitration awards were completely irrational.see,kyocera,at citation and quotation marks omitted.an award is completely irrational only where the arbitration decision fails to draw its essence from the agreement.comedy club,at citation and brackets omitted.an arbitration award draws its essence from the agreement if the award is derived from the agreement,viewed in light of the agreement language and context,as well as other indications of the parties intentions.bosack,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.lloyd,however,defends the vacatur of the award on the ground that the awards were irrational in light of the facts.for example,lloyd argues that it was irrational for the panel to conclude that lagstein was totally disabled from practicing medicine when the evidence showed that lagstein returned to work to complete tasks that he considered easy.however,the question is whether the award is irrational with respect to the contract,not whether the panel findings of fact are correct.id.whether or not the panel findings are supported by the evidence in the record is beyond the scope of our review.id.at.
further,lloyd assertion that the majority misinterpreted certain policy provisions is insufficient to show that the amount of the awards was completely irrational.the fact that the majority may have made a mistake in citing a benefit that lagstein had not purchased does not establish irrationality of its ultimate conclusion that lloyd breached its contract.the majority provided several independent reasons for finding a breach of contract,such as lloyd failure to advise lagstein of the acceptance or denial of his claim within thirty days.this rationale was consistent with applicable nevada law,see,and not inconsistent with the terms of lagstein policy.
equally unavailing is lloyd argument that the majority,in concluding that lloyd acted in bad faith and repudiated the contract,mistakenly concluded that lloyd had violated the policy referee provision.this provision required that lloyd physician and lagstein physician,in the event that they disagreed about whether lagstein was disabled,choose a third physician to evaluate lagstein.after such a disagreement arose,lloyd hired a third physician of its own choosing to evaluate lagstein.while lloyd claims that the physician was hired to evaluate an entirely different medical condition,so that the referee provision was inapplicable,the panel majority interpreted the evidence differently,concluding that lloyd violated the provision by not informing lagstein of its applicability.disagreement over lloyd compliance with a policy provision is insufficient to show that the award failed to draw its essence from lagstein policy.see bosack,at we will not vacate an award simply because we might have interpreted the contract differently.
we conclude,therefore,that the district court vacatur of the overall awards was not supported by any permissible ground under the arbitration act or the controlling decisions interpreting it.
the district court also vacated the punitive damages award on the alternative ground that the panel no longer had jurisdiction over the dispute after issuing the initial arbitration award.we conclude that the panel did not exceed its authority because the timing of the arbitration award was a procedural matter committed to the panel interpretation,and the panel conclusion that it retained jurisdiction was a plausible construction of the parties agreement and the procedural rules the agreement incorporated.
lagstein policy provided that the arbitration was governed by the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa.at issue is rule,which provides that an award shall be made promptly by the arbitrator and,unless otherwise agreed by the parties or specified by law,no later than thirty days from the date of closing the hearing.am.arbitration ass n,commercial arbitration rules and mediation procedures,rule hereinafter car.upon the close of the initial hearing on july,arbitrator williams stated that the panel would treat the matter as submitted.he also noted that,u nder the aaa rules,a decision is required generally within days.because of scheduling concerns,williams requested a extension for making an september,the parties granted.
the panel issued its initial decision on august,awarding compensatory and emotional distress damages.the initial award also specified that a punitive damages hearing would be held at a later date.the parties,however,did not expressly agree to extend the time for making an award past september.rule specifies that the arbitrator may for good cause extend any period of time established by these rules,except the time for making the award.car,rule emphasis added.thus,lloyd argues that,by holding the punitive damages hearing and then making an award past september,the panel exceeded its jurisdiction.we conclude that lloyd is mistaken.
section of the faa permits vacatur where the arbitrators exceeded their powers.a.a party has a right to arbitration according to the terms for which it contracted,employers ins.jefferies,cir,and arbitrators exceed their powers for purposes of a when they act outside the scope of the parties contractual agreement.mut,at see.at.however,w e have no authority to vacate an award solely because of an alleged error in contract interpretation.employers ins.of wausau union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.instead,we need only determine whether the arbitrators interpretation was plausible.id.citations omitted see also mckesson local ibt,cir.
