carl gaeth was employed as a sales manager at oracle from until.as a result of serious medical conditions,he began receiving disability payments in.oracle subsequently discovered that gaeth was operating an restoration business,and surveillance video showed him moving about without apparent difficulty.the plan administrator,hartford life insurance,determined that gaeth was no longer totally disabled and terminated his benefits in.
gaeth challenged that decision in court.the federal district court found that hartford determination was arbitrary and capricious because it was not supported by any medical evidence of gaeth physical condition.it therefore remanded the case to hartford for further consideration.the court also awarded attorney fees to gaeth,even though it did not find that gaeth is still entitled to disability benefits under the plan.hartford has appealed only the award of attorney fees.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the district court judgment awarding attorney fees and remand the case for reconsideration of that issue.
background 
factual background 
the basic facts of this case are undisputed by the parties.gaeth was a sales manager for oracle beginning in.after experiencing a series of health problems,he was deemed totally disabled under oracle employee welfare benefit plan and was approved for disability benefits in february of.oracle plan is subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.hartford has the discretionary authority to make benefits determinations under the plan.
in,hartford approached gaeth about the possibility of settling his disability claim with a payment.during the course of pursuing the settlement,hartford discovered that gaeth had been operating an restoration business since.hartford suspected gaeth of fraud and suspended his disability payments pending an investigation by the company.
the ensuing investigation consisted of interviewing gaeth about his antique business and the income derived from it,reviewing his medical and financial records,and surveilling him at antique shows and at his place of business in an effort to document his physical capabilities.in his interviews with hartford,gaeth moved slowly and with considerable effort,consistent with records from his treating physician.but hartford investigators reported that minutes of surveillance video,captured over the course of one week,showed gaeth moving about,sitting,standing,carrying antique lamps,pushing and pulling a cart,and setting up and taking down his sales booths at antique trade shows,all without apparent difficulty.gaeth also traveled long distances to attend antique shows,an activity that was inconsistent with his doctor prior evaluations.
to explain his travel,gaeth said that his van was customized to allow him to lie down during his trips.he also told hartford that his business generated no income.hartford investigators,however,came to the opposite conclusion based on a copy of an automobile lease application indicating that gaeth monthly income exceeded,and information that an undercover investigator obtained by engaging gaeth in conversation at an antique show.
in june of,hartford determined that gaeth was no longer totally disabled from performing the duties of his own occupation as of january,date his own business was established.alterations omitted.it terminated his disability benefits and demanded reimbursement for all payments made to him since that time.gaeth disputed hartford determination,arguing that his business did not generate income and that hartford did not have any evidence showing that he was no longer disabled with regard to his occupation as a sales manager.
also in,hartford alerted the kentucky department of insurance doi of the company suspicions regarding gaeth possible fraudulent conduct.the doi investigated the matter and referred it for criminal prosecution in.a grand jury subsequently indicted gaeth on two counts of theft by deception,but the indictment was eventually dismissed without prejudice in.state prosecutors have not refiled the indictment.
procedural background 
in december of,gaeth sued hartford in kentucky state court,asserting federal and claims.his federal claims,brought under erisa,challenged hartford determination that he was no longer totally disabled and therefore ineligible for disability benefits,and its determination that he was required to reimburse hartford for prior payments.hartford removed the case to federal district court.
the district court subsequently granted gaeth motion for summary judgment,concluding that hartford decision to terminate gaeth benefits was arbitrary and capricious because the company investigation produced no medical evidence showing that gaeth was able to return to his occupation as a sales manager.it further explained that r eliance solely on surveillance with an average of ten minutes of video per day is not a reasonable basis for concluding that the plaintiff is now able to perform his prior work or that his activities are inconsistent with the restrictions imposed by his physicians.
the district court,however,did not find that gaeth continued to be totally disabled,noting that the record contained minimal objective medical evidence of his continued disability.it therefore remanded the case to hartford for a further review of his eligibility for benefits.although the court did not decide that gaeth was entitled to benefits,it nevertheless awarded him attorney fees.hartford filed a timely appeal of that decision.the parties agree that the only issue before us is the propriety of awarding attorney fees to gaeth at this stage of the case.
ii.analysis 
standard of review for awarding attorney fees under erisa 
a district court award of attorney fees pursuant to g is reviewed under the standard.first trust bryant,cir.a n abuse of discretion exists only when the court has the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a clear error of judgment in its conclusion upon weighing relevant factors.moon unum provident,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also stough mayville cmty,cir a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,when it improperly applies the law,or uses an erroneous legal standard.

in determining whether to award attorney fees to gaeth,the district court did not cite the sixth circuit king test.it instead applied the following test from the second circuit 
the degree of the offending party culpability or bad faith,the ability of the offending party to satisfy an award of attorney fees,whether an award of fees would deter other persons from acting similarly under like circumstances,the relative merits of the parties positions,and whether the action conferred a common benefit on a group of pension plan participants.

despite the differences in phrasing,the factors set forth in both formulations of the test are largely the same.but a close reading reveals two material differences.the first difference relates to the common benefit factor.under the sixth circuit test,the fourth factor asks whether the plaintiff sought to confer a common benefit on other plan participants.king,at emphasis added.in contrast,the second circuit corresponding fifth factor does not look to plaintiff motive in bringing suit,but instead considers whether the suit had the effect of conferring a common benefit.chambless,at.the other material difference is the alternative consideration under the sixth circuit fourth factor of whether the case resolved a significant legal question regarding erisa.that consideration is not contemplated by the second circuit test.we address the district court failure to fully analyze the fourth factor in part.below.
discussion 
the district court determined that attorney fees are appropriate in this case after briefly reasoning that the termination of gaeth benefits was arbitrary and capricious,that hartford has the ability to pay gaeth attorney fees,that a fee award might deter hartford from making such unsupported decisions in the future,and that the deterrent effect of awarding fees could benefit not only gaeth but other claimants.hartford argues that all of the court conclusions are erroneous.we will therefore examine the district court analysis of each factor in turn.
culpability or bad faith 
in its first assignment of error,hartford contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to make an explicit finding that hartford decision to terminate gaeth benefits was either culpable behavior or made in bad faith.it also argues that the record does not contain any evidence that would support such a finding.
hartford emphasizes the statement in moon that an arbitrary and capricious denial of benefits does not necessarily indicate culpability or bad faith.at alteration omitted emphasis added.but this court caselaw by no means precludes a finding of culpability or bad faith based only on the evidence that supported a district court determination.see,id.at finding that the plan administrator was culpable for the same reason that its rejection of a disability claim was arbitrary and is,it adopted wholesale the opinion of a physician in its employ who based his findings on selective information in the administrative record and did not examine the claimant.
the district court in the present case did not explicitly make a finding of culpability or bad faith.on the other hand,the court recited a test similar to king and then proceeded to analyze most of those factors,beginning with the statement that hartford termination of the plaintiff benefits was made with little support on the record,and the court finds that there is no reasoned explanation on the record for the decision.a fair reading of the court discussion of this first factor makes clear that it found culpability on hartford part,and that the court weighed this factor in favor of awarding attorney fees to gaeth.we are therefore unpersuaded by hartford argument that the court failure to use the word culpability is enough to constitute an abuse of discretion.the critical question is instead whether the court determination that the first factor weighed in favor of awarding attorney fees is supported by the record.
this court has found a plan administrator to be culpable where the administrator terminated benefits based primarily on the opinions of doctors employed by the company own claim department.see hoover provident life accident ins,cir finding culpability where a plan administrator denied disability benefits based solely on the opinion of a physician in its employ,the latter having neither examined the claimant nor considered substantial evidence in the record indicating that the claimant was disabled moon,at same.the disability determination made by hartford in the present case was arguably based on even less competent evidence than that which was available to the plan administrators in the above cases.
hartford might very well have had a basis for believing that gaeth was no longer disabled.but it terminated his benefits without a single piece of current medical evidence regarding his physical condition as it relates to the occupation for which he had been deemed disabled,as the district court explained at length.hartford is therefore culpable for making a benefits determination that was unsupported by competent medical evidence.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the first factor in favor of awarding attorney fees.
hartford ability to satisfy an award of attorney fees 
hartford does not challenge the district court conclusion that the company would be able to pay the attorney fees incurred by gaeth.it argues instead that the court placed undue weight on this factor.the company quotes firestone tire rubber neusser,cir,in asserting that a party financial ability to pay a fee award,even if undisputed,should not be dispositive when examination of all other relevant factors indicates that fees should not be awarded.
firestone tire simply restates the general principle that this factor,like each of the king factors,is not dispositive.see id.concluding that firestone undisputed ability to satisfy an award of attorney fees under erisa did not justify such an award where all of the other king factors indicated that awarding fees was inappropriate see also moon,at explaining that no single factor is dispositive.furthermore,nothing in the district court opinion indicates that it placed greater weight on this factor than on any other factor in the analysis,or that it considered this factor to be outcome determinative.the court simply stated the undisputed fact that hartford would likely be able to satisfy the award.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing this factor in favor of awarding fees.
deterrent effect of a fee award 
hartford next argues that the district court erred in its determination that an award of attorney fees might deter the company from making unsupported and poorly reasoned decisions in the future and encourage it to make more reliable inquiries before terminating disability benefits.the company does not challenge that finding rather,its argument on this point is that the deterrence factor requires consideration of the deterrent effect on other plan administrators facing similar circumstances,but that the court considered the deterrent effect only on hartford.
a review of sixth circuit caselaw supports hartford position.this court has consistently interpreted the deterrence factor as requiring consideration of a fee award deterrent effect on other plan administrators.see,foltice guardsman,cir considering the deterrent effect of a fee award on other plan administrators firestone,at analyzing whether a fee award would deter other employers see also hoover,at considering the deterrent effect on other similarly situated defendants and on the offending party.
the sixth circuit opinion in moon,is particularly instructive regarding the proper analysis under this factor.in moon,the court concluded that the facts of that which the plan administrator denied benefits based solely on the opinion of its own employed physician,who ignored record evidence of the claimant disability and did not examine the claimant are not so unique that they fail to serve any deterrence value to other insurance companies under similar circumstances,and that the court opinion in an earlier appeal of the same case articulated important principles that all plan administrators should heed.for example,before terminating a plan participant benefits,a plan administrator should ensure that the opinions upon which they rely to make their decisions to terminate are based on a thorough review of the administrative record.id.at.the key question in analyzing this third factor is therefore whether the fee award would have a deterrent effect on other plan administrators.
although the district court did in fact fail to explicitly make a finding regarding the deterrent effect of a fee award on others,its reasoning about the deterrent effect on hartford leaves little doubt that the court on remand would make the same finding with respect to the administrators of other plans.and nothing i
