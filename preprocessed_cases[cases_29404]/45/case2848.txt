this case concerns the application of insurance code section to appellant vasilios lambros life insurance policy,issued by respondent metropolitan life insurance company metlife.that statute provides that a unless the insurance contract otherwise provides,a person insured is entitled to a return of premium if the policy is canceled,rejected,surrendered,or rescinded,as follows where the insurance is made for a definite period of time and the insured surrenders his policy,to such proportion of the premium as corresponds with the unexposed time,ins.code,subd.a.
on respondent motion for summary judgment,the trial court determined that appellant policy did otherwise provide.we agree,and affirm the ensuing judgment in favor of metlife.
on august,in washington,appellant bought a whole life insurance policy from metlife.the policy had an annual premium of,payable once a year on the anniversary of the policy purchase.the policy provided that payment of the annual premium maintained the policy for a period of months.
the policy also provided that appellant could surrender the policy and receive a cash surrender value which shall be equal to the cash value according to the table on page,plus the reserve on any dividend additions and plus the amount of any dividend accumulations then outstanding to the credit of this policy,and less any indebtedness,including interest then accrued,for which this policy is security to the company.
the table on page sets forth the benefits available at the end of the year indicated,based on number of years policy has been in force with all due premiums paid,for the next years in the section which immediately follows the table,the policy provides that the cash value at anytime prior to the end of the period for which premiums have been paid shall be the cash value at the end of such period less interest from the date of payment to the end of such period at the effective rate of percent per annum.
text following the table explained that the benefits on surrender are computed by the standard nonforfeiture value method producing values equal to the full net level premium reserve for the fifteenth and all subsequent anniversaries 
in september,after paying his august premium,appellant submitted a request to surrender his policy.on or about october,metlife sent him a check for and a statement which explained that the amount was calculated by adding the cash value of to the current dividend of and the terminal dividend of,then subtracting the total of an outstanding loan and the interest on that loan.the statement also showed that the policy would remain in effect until august.the cash value did not include a refund of any portion of the premium paid on august.
appellant sued metlife for breach of contract and for violation of business and professions code section et contending that nothing in the policy allowed metlife to respond to his request for surrender by continuing coverage and retaining the full premium,and that metlife was obligated instead to terminate coverage and refund a portion of his premium.metlife moved for summary judgment,as did appellant 
in addition to the undisputed facts set forth above,metlife proposed as undisputed that t he policy did not contain a provision for a refund of any part of the annual premium when it was surrendered prior to the end of a policy year.appellant agreed that the policy did not contain such a provision,but contended that by operation of law,insurance code section was incorporated into the policy and made a part of it.
in the separate statement which accompanied his for summary judgment,appellant proffered evidence concerning metlife policies and practices regarding refund of premiums in policies such as his.some of this evidence comes from the deposition of jeanne keller,supervisor of metlife rates and values department.she testified that metlife does not refund premiums when policies such as appellant are surrendered for cash value,and that metlife so notifies policyholders at the time of surrender 
appellant also proffered documents relating to a resolution of the metlife board,in which that board noted that the cash surrender value of a whole life policy then termed an ordinary policy was approximately the same as the sum the insured could secure by taking out the maximum available loan on the policy.the board also noted that if the loan option was chosen,the policy would remain in force.the board thus resolved that when a policy was surrendered prior to the next premium due date,in the event of death or disability of the insured on or before such due date,the same death or disability benefit be granted that would have been granted had the amount of the cash surrender been advanced as a loan.metlife decided not to mention this practice in sales presentations,because it could be changed.
the trial court granted metlife motion and denied appellant,determining that nothing in the policy entitled appellant to a refund of premiums and that insurance code section did not apply because the statute does not apply to life insurance,citing jennings prudential ins.d,and because the policy,in the words of insurance code section,otherwise provides.the court also determined that the cause of action under business and professions code section was derived from the contract claim and fell with it.
discussion 
in jennings prudential ins,supra,d,the insured surrendered his life insurance policy,deposited the insurance company check for the cash surrender value,and died a few days later.the insured widow sued for policy benefits,contending,inter alia,that because the insurance company had not fulfilled its insurance code section obligation to return premiums,the policy remained in force.d at.the trial court rejected the contention and we affirmed.
we ruled that we find no merit in appellant contention that insurance code section is applicable.appellant cites no authority applying section to the cash surrender option of a life insurance policy.one court has noted that section is obviously applicable to insurance such as fire insurance,but less obviously applicable to life insurance or annuities there can be no doubt that from an early date the legislature treated return premiums as one thing,and cash paid on surrender or cancellation of life policies as quite another.equitable life.soc.johnson d,see also state larson so d.jennings prudential ins,supra,d at.
appellant contends that this statement is dicta,and does not amount to a holding that insurance code section is inapplicable to life insurance policies.he attacks equitable life.soc.johnson,supra,d,cited by jennings,on the same ground.we need not concern ourselves with the arguments,because jennings was clearly right when it went on to say that by its terms section is applicable u nless the insurance contract otherwise provides,see jensen allstate ins,d.thus it is within the power of the parties to contract that upon the insured decision to surrender the policy,the amount to be returned to the insured shall be governed by the terms of the cash value option and tables contained in the policy,excluding the return of unearned premiums.jennings prudential ins,supra,d at.
appellant argument is essentially that insurance code section applies unless a policy specifically states,perhaps in precisely these words,that premiums will not be refunded when the policy is surrendered.we do not think that the insurance code requires anything so literal.appellant policy tells policyholders exactly what they will receive on surrender.it says that cash surrender value will be paid,and that cash surrender value consists of the cash value according to the table in the policy,plus the reserve on dividend additions,plus the amount of any dividend accumulations then outstanding,less any indebtedness.
further,the policy specifically recognizes that surrender may occur prior to the end of a policy period and provides that in that case,the cash value is the cash value at the end of such period less interest from the date of payment to the end of such period at the effective rate of percent per annum.
this policy is not ambiguous,triggering the rule that ambiguities must be construed against the drafter.vargas athena assurance th,d.instead,the question of value on surrender is fully covered.the policy describes the exclusive method of determining surrender value.by telling the policyholder what will be paid,the policy explains what will not be paid.there is no specific reference to premiums,but none is necessary.on any fair reading of the policy,surrender value does not include a return of premiums.
like the policy in jennings,appellant policy specifies that the surrender value,even before the end of a policy period,will be calculated with reference to the tables contained in the policy and other matters.refund of premiums is not included in the calculation.
appellant seeks to distinguish jennings by arguing that the policy in that case was not identical to the one before us here,in that this policy,unlike the jennings policy,discounts the surrender value if the surrender is made prior to the end of the period for which premiums have been paid.the distinction is not,for our purposes,meaningful.jennings did not base its holding on the substance of the method of calculation of surrender value,but on the fact that the policy set forth such a method,one which did not involve a refund of premiums.we find that jennings thus correctly interpreted the statute 
the unfair competition act claim 
in this context,unfair competition means any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.bus,et communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
appellant argues that the cause of action survives summary judgment because the evidence is that metlife breached its contract,violated insurance code section,and engaged in unfair and fraudulent business practices.as we have seen,appellant did not establish even a triable issue on breach of contract.since we have found that metlife had no obligation under insurance code section on this policy,we can not see even a triable issue on whether it breached any statutory obligation.
nor do we see a triable issue on unfair or deceptive practices.appellant relies on the facts concerning the metlife board resolution,the fact that the cash surrender statement includes the information that the policy does not provide for premium refunds,and the fact that the policy does not state,in those precise words,that premiums will not be refunded on cash surrender.appellant argues that these facts show a pattern of fraud and deception metlife decided not to refund premiums although it knew that it should,then concealed the information about this improper practices from its customers.the facts do not support any such inferences.
in,metlife decided to continue coverage for its insureds under certain circumstances.nothing in the resolution or other documents proffered by appellant so much as indicates that metlife attempted to wrongfully withhold a refund which was due under any statute or under the policy.the policy does not include the words premiums will not be refunded,but it does set forth the method of calculation of the cash surrender value,thus informing the policyholder that premiums will not be refunded.the fact that the statement explaining the cash value includes certain information does not logically imply that metlife fraudulent concealed the information before it issued the check.appellant presented no evidence of any unfair or fraudulent business act or practice or any unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.
appellant also argues that his claims brought on behalf of the general public survive even if his individual claims do not.those claims are that metlife does not refund premiums when a policy such as appellant is surrendered,thus breaching its contracts and violating insurance code section,and the same fraudulent and deceptive practices theories discussed above.as we have seen,there is no triable issue on any of the claims.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.respondent to recover costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
in august,vasilios lambros lambros bought a whole life insurance policy from metropolitan life insurance company metlife.lambros purchased the policy from a new york company in the district of columbia and moved to california,from which,for many years,he paid premiums to metlife.in,lambros paid the full annual premium and then during the year covered by that premium exercised his right to surrender the policy and receive the cash surrender value.he also requested the return of that portion of the premium attributable to the period after the surrender of the,the unearned premium.metlife refused to return the unearned premium.the majority hold that even though there is no reference in the policy to what happens to unearned premiums upon surrender of the policy,the provision for cash surrender value provides what the policyholder receives upon surrender of the policy,and thus the return of unearned premium is,in effect,excluded by the policy.
it is important to distinguish between cash surrender value and premiums.under the express terms of the metlife policy,when lambros surrendered his policy,he was entitled to receive certain benefits that he had already accrued.those benefits consisted of the cash value or cash surrender value and the amount of any dividend accumulations then outstanding to the credit of this policy.lambros policy provides that cash surrender value is computed by the standard nonforfeiture value method producing values equal to the full net level premium reserve for the fifteenth and all subsequent anniversaries including those not shown.the policy also specifies that t he cash value at any time prior to the end of the period for which premiums have been paid shall be the cash value at the end of such period less interest from the date of payment to the end of such period at the effective rate of percent per annum.the cash surrender value on life insurance policies is a property right created by the policy.state ex rel.pacific mut.life ins.larson,so d.
premiums are payments for the insurance and other rights that accrue under the policy.although premium payments may be one aspect of the computation of cash value,t here can be no doubt that from an early date the legislature treated return premiums as one thing,and cash paid on surrender or cancellation of life policies as quite another.citations.jennings prudential ins.d.jennings,quoting equitable life assurance soc.johnson d.
cash surrender value is,like the insurance itself,a benefit that is acquired by paying the premium.but the return of an unearned premium is not a benefit.return of an unearned premium is a right under any or all of contractual,or statutory law theories.a leading authority has said,a s a general rule,an insurer is entitled only to such premium as the risk carried reasonably warrants.it follows that where a greater premium has been paid,or a premium has been paid for which there has been no corresponding assumption of risk,the unearned premium should be returned to the insured.to illustrate,upon canceling a policy an insurer must return the advance premiums which have been paid and are unearned.the duty of the insurer to return unearned premiums is contractual or in nature.couch on insurance ed.
in coming to my conclusion,i rely upon california law.although originally new york or washington,law would have applied because those were the locations of performance,by accepting premium payments in california for the policy,metlife waived the right to assert that a law other than california law applied.blair new york life ins.d,see also baekgaard carreiro cir,fn.
insurance code section,subdivision a section requires the return of unearned premiums u nless the insurance contract otherwise provides.the majority hold that the contract otherwise provides for the unearned premium by not including it in what has to be given to the surrendering policyholder.i believe that the obligation to return an unearned premium is an or term of the policy.and if that obligation can not be implied,there being no reference to that obligation in the policy,return of the unearned premium is required by section.
