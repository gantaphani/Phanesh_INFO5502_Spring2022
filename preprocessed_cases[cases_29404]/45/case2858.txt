when plaintiff kevin beach filed a complaint alleging breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,defendant harco national insurance company harco responded by filing a motion to strike under the statute,code of civil procedure section.further undesignated statutory references are to the code of civil procedure.the trial court denied the motion,and defendant appeals,subd.j.we affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
the nature of this appeal requires a detailed chronology of events.
plaintiff was a truck driver.on the night of february,he pulled over his rig to the side of the road to help another truck driver who was having problems.plaintiff daughter,who was riding as a passenger with her father,got out of the truck and stood by the side of the road.she was struck by a car driven by jason abbot,an uninsured motorist,and was seriously injured.the traffic collision report ascribed fault to abbott but also noted that plaintiff,by leaving his headlights on and pointing them into oncoming traffic,contributed to the accident.
plaintiff was insured with harco.his policy included in uninsured motorist coverage for bodily injury.
on january,plaintiff filed suit against abbott,asserting he suffered serious emotional distress when he witnessed the accident.
in july,plaintiff daughter filed suit against her father,abbott,and others.her complaint alleged,in part,that her father was negligent or reckless in parking his vehicle in an unsafe manner and in allowing his daughter to be in a position of danger.
on january,plaintiff,grant pegg,wrote to harco,demanding the limits of his uninsured motorist policy.pegg noted that harco should be familiar with accident because defendant was handling the lawsuit that has been filed by plaintiff daughter,tara beach,that arose from said accident.he stated that plaintiff was standing only a few feet of tara when she was struck by the abbott vehicle.as a result of the trauma of witnessing his daughter being struck by a vehicle and from witnessing the horrific injuries to his daughter,plaintiff has suffered from great emotional distress since the date of the accident.pegg concluded in short,i believe this is the perfect example of a dillon legg cal d,type of claim and i am hopeful that we can resolve this matter without too much effort.i believe that our demand is completely reasonable in light of the proximity of plaintiff to his daughter at the time of impact,and the nature of the injuries sustained by his daughter.
according to a declaration later filed by pegg,plaintiff made a formal demand for arbitration in may,although as late as august,harco stated it was unaware of any such demand.at some point,however,the parties selected joe ramsey to act as an arbitrator even as a mediator ahead of time in advance of the arbitration,if we so choose to mediate.
on november,harco attorney sent pegg a letter,stating,in part when we last spoke some time back,you were planning to provide me copies of the materials to document your client uninsured motorist claim,including his treatment records.i still have not seen those materials.he continued also,in light of the nature of the accident,i am somewhat confused about the scope of your client claim.therefore,i would ask you to clarify the following in writing,to help set the parameters of the uninsured motorist claim.harco asked is it true that plaintiff is not claiming that he suffered any actual physical injuries,but rather,his uninsured motorist claim is solely for a dillon legg bystander emotional distress claim harco also sought to verify that plaintiff employer and the driver of the other truck both had valid and collectible auto coverage,each with policy limits of million.this letter concluded assuming that the answers to both of these questions is yes,and assuming further that you provide me with the documents referred to above,it would appear that,as far as we are concerned,we could proceed with the arbitration and without depositions or discovery.
pegg replied days later,on november,confirming that plaintiff is making a dillon legg claim arising from the subject accident and that the uninsured motorist is jason abbott.pegg also confirmed that the other truck driver and plaintiff employer carried million in insurance policies.pegg stated i agree that little discovery needs to be done prior to the arbitration.other than the records from plaintiff treating physician,please let us know if you want any other documents to prepare for the arbitration.
at some point the same month,november,plaintiff replaced pegg with a new lawyer,glenn guenard.according to his declaration,guenard telephoned and wrote to harco attorney on november,to find out why policy limits had not been paid.
in december,plaintiff filed a demand for the production of documents,to which harco responded in january.
guenard wrote letters to the attorneys representing harco in february,march and june but received no reply.in a letter dated june,guenard wrote that he would contact the previously selected arbitrator,joe ramsey to obtain an arbitration date to resolve this case.i select dates within days from today.
guenard sent a letter to harco on july,which resulted in further communication between the parties.harco wrote guenard on august,to confirm our telephone conversations over the last week.the letter stated that harco tentative position in this case remains that there is no uninsured motorist coverage available to plaintiff here.this position was previously communicated to grant pegg,plaintiff attorney before you.harco explained that this was based on pegg confirmation that plaintiff had not suffered any physical injuries.harco stated that coverage was available under the policy only for bodily injury or property damage,and that emotional distress without physical injury or manifestation was not bodily injury and therefore not a covered occurrence.
this letter continued however,harco has made no final determination on this issue,as we have been awaiting the receipt of the medical and psychological information requested from plaintiff in our november,correspondence to date,we have not received that information.once harco has received and evaluated that information,it will be in a position to formally decide its coverage obligation to plaintiff based upon this issue.in this regard,the policy requires that plaintiff cooperate with harco with respect to its investigation,as well as to his medical records.
harco also expressed its doubt that this case even constitutes an uninsured motorist matter given that there were other ostensibly responsible tortfeasors such as the other truck driver and plaintiff employer,who had applicable insurance coverage with higher limits than plaintiff.
harco stated it was unaware of any formal demand by plaintiff for arbitration,but it reiterated its willingness to participate in arbitration.in response to plaintiff apparent suggestion of bad faith,it opined that any delay in responding to plaintiff claim was attributable to plaintiff in,inter alia,not formally demanding arbitration and then setting the arbitration,as well as,furthermore,in not supplying the medical and psychological information and records requested by harco in.
finally,harco confirmed that the parties had earlier agreed to present two issues to joe ramsey for a rendition of advisory rulings,and that this hearing,scheduled for september,was to determine whether there is coverage for your client claim under the policy,and if there is coverage,the amount to which your client is entitled up to the uninsured motorist policy limits.the decision of ramsey will be advisory only,and either side may reject his decision and proceed with the binding uninsured motorist mediation.
harco enclosed a copy of plaintiff insurance policy,which plaintiff had requested previously.
on august,attorney guenard responded.he stated that harco letter was the first communication he had received since undertaking plaintiff representation,despite numerous letters sent earlier.he wrote t his is the first time anyone from your office has stated that it is harco tentative position that there is no uninsured motorist coverage available to plaintiff.harco letter of november,to pegg,which you enclosed in your letter to me,was the first time that i saw that letter.it was not provided to me in the materials that plaintiff obtained from his prior attorney,pegg.you are correct that the uninsured motorist claim of plaintiff is based on a dillon legg claim.however,you are incorrect that it is only for emotional distress.plaintiff has been diagnosed with stress disorder with physical manifestations arising out of the occurrence.
guenard continued n o request for medical records or information regarding plaintiff was ever made to me,and as stated previously,i had never seen that request contained in harco letter of november.we will provide this information now that you have requested it.plaintiff has always been willing to cooperate with harco with regard to investigation of this claim.
guenard expressed surprise at harco suggestion that the fact others were insured might indicate plaintiff did not have a valid uninsured motorist claim.guenard noted harco had not responded to form interrogatories that had been propounded in march,and asked that harco provide all facts and documents in support of their contention.
guenard added i f a formal demand for arbitration has not been previously made,i am now making a formal demand for arbitration.
in discussing a possible claim for bad faith,he added your opinion that any claimed delay in responding to plaintiff claim is attributable to him not formally demanding arbitration and then setting the arbitration,as well as not supplying medical and psychological information in records requested by harco in,is totally incorrect.plaintiff made an uninsured motorist claim,and harco has the duty to investigate that claim and pursue the resolution of that claim with reasonable diligence.in fact,harco was supposed to find a way to pay uninsured motorist benefits to plaintiff.the fact that whether or not plaintiff ever demanded arbitration does not abrogate harco duty to investigate and resolve plaintiff claim with reasonable diligence.as far as supplying medical and psychological information and records that were requested by harco,i was never aware of that request,as stated previously,and plaintiff was not aware of this request either.however,again,once i notified your office of my representation of plaintiff,your office never requested that information from me.i would have gladly provided it if requested.
guenard agreed to the proceeding before joe ramsey but stated,i would characterize this proceeding as a mediation,because it is advisory only and either side may wish to pursue to a binding uninsured motorist arbitration pursuant to the insurance code.
he concluded plaintiff is,and always has been,willing to cooperate in the investi g ation of his claim.i have requested his medical records associated with treatment arising out of this occurrence.if you need any other documents,please let me know.
these medical records were not submitted to harco.instead,appended to the mediation brief prepared by plaintiff was an unsworn letter from robert johnson,dated august.this letter stated plaintiff was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and had a poor prognosis.johnson outlined plaintiff symptoms and the psychotherapy sessions he had conducted.he stated that physical manifestations of plaintiff psychological distress included tremor,tachycardia,and double vision.he believed that psychotherapy and medication management would continue for the next two to four years.
the hearing before the mediator occurred as scheduled,and on september,the mediator issued his opinion,finding coverage under the policy and plaintiff damages equal to,or greater than,the policy limits.
correspondence between harco and plaintiff ensued over the next few months.on november,plaintiff filed a petition to compel arbitration.on december,harco wrote plaintiff to confirm that the parties had agreed to settle the case for.plaintiff executed a release on february,and the case settled.
on january,plaintiff filed a complaint against harco for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he asserted that harco failed to provide a copy of the insurance policy when requested failed to accept or deny his claim within days offered no explanation for that failure failed to respond to discovery requests failed to respond to a request for arbitration failed to participate in an arbitration proceeding to resolve the claim,failed to communicate with plaintiff failed to make payment under the policy when it was clear that said obligation was owing and failed to evaluate plaintiff claim in a systematic,fair and reasonably prompt manner.
harco filed a motion to strike the complaint under section,the suit statute.it asserted that the statute was applicable to this type of complaint,and that plaintiff could not demonstrate the probability of prevailing on his action.it argued plaintiff claim lacked merit,and was also barred by the litigation privilege,civil code section,subdivision b.
plaintiff opposed the motion,arguing that section was inapplicable,because his lawsuit for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing was not brought with the intent to chill defendant first amendment rights.he asserted that the provision should not be so broadly interpreted so as to abrogate the law of contracts,and he argued he would in fact prevail on the merits of his case.
the trial court denied the motion to strike,finding this case did not fit the profile of a slapp suit.the court ruled that arbitration in an uninsured motorist proceeding did not involve petitioning within the meaning of the statute,and it further held that permitting motions in this context would completely emasculate insurance code section,subdivision h,which outlines unfair claims settlement practices.the court found that there was a probability plaintiff would prevail on his claim,and rejected harco assertion that its conduct was privileged under civil code section,subdivision b.

discussion 
section was designed to eliminate at an early stage of the proceedings nonmeritorious or retaliatory litigation meant to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition in connection with a public issue.citation.these meritless suits,referred to under the acronym slapp,or strategic lawsuit against public participation,are subject to a special motion to strike unless the person asserting that cause of action establishes by pleading and affidavit a probability that he or she will prevail.sipple foundation for nat.progress th,d seelig infinity broadcasting th,d.section prevents abuses of the judicial system,and its protections are to be construed broadly,subd.a.
subdivision b of this statute provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
in making these determinations,the court shall consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.
in reviewing the denial of a motion to strike under section,we apply a test.first,we determine whether plaintiff causes of action arose from acts by defendant in furtherance of defendant rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.citation.assuming this threshold condition is satisfied,we then determine whether plaintiff has established a reasonable probability that he will prevail on his claims at trial.we must reverse the order denying the motion if plaintiff failed to make a prima facie showing in the trial court of facts,which,if proved at trial,would support a judgment in his favor.citation.whether section applies and whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing are legal questions which we review independently on appeal.seelig infinity broadcastin
