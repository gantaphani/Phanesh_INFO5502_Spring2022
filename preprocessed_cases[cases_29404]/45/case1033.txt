plaintiff,new hampshire insurance company new hampshire or nhic,appeals from the district court order and judgment granting defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to its discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction over claims brought under the declaratory judgment act of.applying the brillhart wilton abstention framework,the district court dismissed new hampshire complaint in favor of parallel proceedings pending in ohio state court.on appeal,new hampshire challenges the district court application of the brillhart wilton doctrine,contending that several factors support federal jurisdiction.
for the reasons set forth herein,we reverse the district court assumption that it has jurisdiction and vacate its analysis of the abstention issue,but affirm its judgment dismissing nhic claims,although on different grounds.
in november,national marine,national marine,a yacht dealer and marina operator,purchased a yacht operators general liability insurance policy from nhic.the policy covered both yacht dealer operations and marina operations,as those terms are defined in the contract.roa at.generally speaking,the policy insured national marine against loss or damage to its inventory,loss or damage to property while in its custody,personal injury or property damage occurring on its boats or at its marina,and loss or damage to its tools and equipment.the policy also includes in truth in lending errors and omissions liability coverage,to insure against any damage due to the unintentional violation of any federal or state consumer credit act,or similar statute,law or ordinance.roa at.
in november,several of national marine customers and two banks sued national marine in the court of common pleas in trumbull county,ohio,see suhar lukowski,alleging that national marine made fraudulent misrepresentations and failed to deliver certain boats with clean title,as promised.these former customers and banks sought recovery for breach of contract,fraud,and violation of the ohio consumer sales practices act.national marine filed a claim with nhic under the truth in lending provision of the policy,requesting legal defense and indemnification from the charges.
nhic provided coverage under reservation of rights,but also sued in federal court naming all the parties that had been named in the state court action,including home savings loan company of youngstown,ohio home savings,sky bank financial group sky bank,national marine and its predecessor national marine auto collectively national marine,andrew suhar,receiver for national marine,and additional individual defendants.because one of these defendants was a new york resident and nhic is a corporation with its principal place of business in new york,nhic could not establish federal jurisdiction based on diversity.see.nhic instead asserted that jurisdiction existed under,federal maritime jurisdiction.nhic complaint asked the district court to rescind the policy on misrepresentation grounds or declare that it did not cover these charges.
in light of the pending state court proceedings,sky bank moved to dismiss this action in october.home savings subsequently joined that motion.defendants motion primarily argued that the federal district court should abstain from exercising its discretionary jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act because prior state court proceedings would resolve the same factual and legal disputes between the same parties.
due to a november bankruptcy filing by one of the defendants,the district court stayed the federal proceedings without resolving the defendants motion to dismiss.after the case was reopened in march,nhic filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss.home savings filed a reply brief in support of the motion.
in may,before the district court resolved defendants motion,nhic filed an amended complaint seeking additional relief,including an order that the insurance policy at issue was void ab initio due to material misrepresentations in the policy application by national marine.in addition to this rescission claim,nhic also sought restitution,costs,and attorney fees.
on june,the district court dismissed the case without prejudice,framing nhic complaint as a request for declaratory judgment and concluding that,under the declaratory judgment act,a,it had discretion to accept or deny jurisdiction.because the declaratory judgment act does not provide for its own federal subject matter jurisdiction,the court stated that it would assume subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to because the insurance policy at issue was a marine insurance policy.the court then proceeded to hold that brillhart excess insurance of america,and wilton seven falls,d,provided the appropriate framework for resolving defendants motion and that the factors set forth in those decisions supported abstention.the district court rejected nhic contention that its claims for additional relief rendered the brillhart wilson framework inapposite,declining to apply the exceptional circumstances test set forth in colorado river water conservation district united states,d.
this timely appeal followed.
the district court assumed that nhic had established federal subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to because the insurance policy at issue was a marine insurance policy,and the parties have not contested this assumption on appeal.but federal courts have a duty to consider their subject matter jurisdiction in regard to every case and may raise the issue sua sponte.answers in genesis of,creation ministries,cir.as an initial matter,then,we must fulfil our duty to determine whether nhic claims fall within the scope of our federal maritime jurisdiction.
whether this dispute falls within the scope of our jurisdiction under depends upon whether the underlying claims arise under a maritime contract,which in turn depends upon the nature and character of the contract,and the true criterion is whether the contract has reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.norfolk ry.kirby,d quotation marks,citations,and editorial marks omitted.
the yacht operators policy that nhic issued to national marine covers both yacht dealer operations and marina operations,as those terms are defined in the policy.roa at.with respect to the operation of the marina,the policy covers repairs,moorings of slips,hauling and launching of craft,and other marina services.roa at.the policy also covers certain operations and services with respect to pleasure craft covered by this policy which are being operated within a mile radius of the insured premises.roa at.the policy does not cover any particular vessel or any particular commercial transaction.in fact,the policy appears to exclude any owned water craft from coverage.roa at.with respect to the yacht dealer operations,the policy provides insurance coverage for stock for sale,which includes vessel s being held for sale by the insured or in the insured care,custody or control,but only while such vessel s are afloat.roa at.the policy also includes,with respect to both operations,in truth in lending errors and omissions liability coverage,to insure against any damage due to the unintentional violation of any federal or state consumer credit act,or similar statute,law or ordinance.roa at.
simply because this insurance policy relates to boats and a marina does not necessarily imply that it is a maritime contract.as the supreme court explained in kirby,t o ascertain whether a contract is a maritime one,we can not look to whether a ship or other vessel was involved in the dispute,as we would in a putative maritime tort case.at.rather,we must focus our inquiry on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce.id.at emphasis added accord sisson ruby,d the fundamental interest giving rise to maritime jurisdiction is the protection of maritime commerce.quoting foremost ins.richardson,d.after the court decision in kirby,there can be no doubt that our inquiry into whether a contractual dispute falls within our maritime jurisdiction must focus on whether the contract primary objective has an essentially maritime nature and relates to maritime commerce.at finding that the contracts at issue were maritime contracts because their primary objective is to accomplish the transportation of goods by sea from australia to the eastern coast of the united states emphasis added.in conducting this inquiry,kirby also requires us to consider the contract as a whole.see id.at.
although defining the central concern of our inquiry,the supreme court decision in kirby offers very little guidance as to how we are to determine what in fact is the primary objective of a mixed contract.the court disapproval in kirby of cases such as hartford fire insurance orient overseas containers lines uk,cir,raises serious questions as to whether the incidental test applied by our sister circuits still provides a valid approach,or whether the court was rejecting only the application and geographical focus of that test.see kirby,at disapproving of the incidental test applied in hartford fire on the grounds that it seems to us imprecise to describe the land carriage required by an intermodal transportation contract as incidental and to the extent that these lower court decisions fashion a rule for identifying maritime contracts that depends solely on geography,they are inconsistent with the conceptual approach our precedent requires.the court decision in kirby also does little to clarify how we are to treat contracts that are incidental to maritime commerce.see planned premium,int l ins.agents,cir the focus becomes even more fuzzy when the scope is brought to bear on that genre of conventions known as preliminary contracts,contracts that involve preliminary services leading to maritime contracts.citation omitted.
confronting the same difficulty we face here,the second circuit has suggested that the jurisdictional analysis should include a threshold inquiry that asks whether the particular dispute between the than the underlying contract as a maritime concerns.see folksamerica reinsurance clean water of,cir holding that prior to inquiring into the subject matter of the contract,we first make a threshold inquiry into the subject matter of the dispute citing atl.mut.ins.balfour maclaine int l in re balfour maclaine int l,cir.if we were to accept and apply this test,we likely would conclude that this dispute falls outside the scope of our maritime jurisdiction inasmuch as the claims asserted by nhic under the truth in lending provision of the policy do not implicate maritime commerce.however,we do not adopt the second circuit approach.while we do not necessarily disagree with the second circuit fact,we find it rather have serious reservations as to whether the focus of this threshold inquiry can be squared with controlling supreme court precedent.
most importantly,the supreme court has never endorsed an inquiry into the subject matter of the dispute,despite its long history of dealing with precisely the types of claims at issue here,a point the second circuit acknowledged in folksamerica,see at noting some uncertainty as to the extent to which the threshold inquiry test survives the supreme court most recent admiralty decision,norfolk southern railway james kirby pty citations omitted.instead,the supreme court consistently has held that the nature and of the contract at issue should be the crucial consideration in assessing admiralty jurisdiction.exxon cent.gulf lines,d new eng.marine mut.ins.dunham,wall.t he true criterion to determining whether federal maritime jurisdiction exists over a contractual dispute is the nature and of the contract,as whether it was a maritime contract,having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.although the supreme court has acknowledged that its decisions do not draw clean lines between maritime and contracts,kirby,at,its abiding instruction,as even the second circuit has recognized,folksamerica,at,is that the answer to whether maritime jurisdiction exists depends upon the nature and character of the contract,and the true criterion is whether it has reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.kirby,at quotation marks and citations omitted.
by inquiring into the nature of the particular dispute,the second circuit test improperly narrows the scope of our maritime jurisdiction by effectively raising the bar for plaintiffs seeking to bring a contractual claim in federal court under.under the second circuit test,a case does not fall within the scope of our maritime jurisdiction where the subject matter of the dispute is so attenuated from the business of maritime commerce that it does not implicate the concerns underlying admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.atl.mut.ins.balfour maclaine int l,cir.although this limitation appears reasonable to us,it ignores clear supreme court authority to the contrary.in kossick united fruit,d,for instance,the court held that a shipowner promise to assume responsibility for any improper treatment that his crew might receive at a new york hospital was a maritime contract,reasoning that this fringe benefit was sufficiently related to peculiarly maritime concerns as not to put it,without more,beyond the pale of admiralty law.id.at.in reaching that conclusion,the court rejected the narrow reading of the contract espoused by the court of appeals in that case.id.at.as the court explained in kirby,kossick stands for the proposition that a dispute involving a fringe benefit of a maritime contract nevertheless falls within the purview of federal admiralty jurisdiction so long as that promise,although itself attenuated from the business of maritime commerce,was in furtherance of a peculiarly maritime concern.kirby,at internal quotations,alterations,and citations omitted.
we also have concerns regarding the second circuit formulation of this inquiry as a threshold matter,especially given that the approach mandated by the supreme court already seems to address some of the concerns raised by the second circuit.according to the supreme court,even where a contract primary objective is maritime commerce,not every term in every maritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined admiralty rule.wilburn boat fireman fund ins.rather,interpreting a particular provision of a maritime contract may so implicate local interests as to beckon interpretation by state law.kirby,at citing kossick,at.as the supreme court has put it,even where the dispute between the parties arises out of a maritime contract,a reviewing court must clear a second hurdle and determine whether this case is inherently local before applying federal law.id.although this inquiry into the inherently local nature of the case addresses some of the same concerns underlying the threshold inquiry adopted by the second circuit,it operates slightly differently.because this second hurdle arises only after the reviewing court is satisfied that the contract is a maritime contract,the inherently local nature of the case functions more like a basis for abstention than a prerequisite for jurisdiction.
although we find the reasoning offered by the second circuit in support of its threshold inquiry to be reasonable and persuasive,we disagree that an inquiry concerned primarily and initially with the nature of the dispute can be squared with the approach mandated by the supreme court.we take the supreme court at its word that our inquiry should be focused on the nature and character of the contract as a whole,and thus we can not accept the test developed by the second circuit.
the appeal of the second circuit approach in a case such as this is that conducting a threshold inquiry into the subject matter of the dispute avoids the difficult questions involved in determining whether the primary objective of a multifaceted contract covering an array of concerns relates to maritime commerce.because we can not rely on the second circuit approach,we must find some other way of unraveling this question.despite our best efforts,however,we have not been able to divine an overarching principle or scheme that brings together all of the disparate maritime contract cases under a single,unified banner.although the supreme court repeatedly has acknowledged this difficulty,see kirby,at our cases do not draw clean lines between maritime and contracts.kossick,at th
