monumental life insurance company appeals from the district court order enforcing an administrative summons issued by the internal revenue service irs.the summons requested voluminous documents from monumental,a third party in the irs investigation of johnson systems.on appeal,monumental argues that the district court erred in rejecting the magistrate judge findings that the irs already had in its possession many of the documents requested,and the irs summons was overbroad in that it sought documents not relevant to the investigation of johnson.monumental also contends that,even if we were to affirm the district court decision,a protective order should be imposed upon any proprietary materials that monumental is required to provide to the irs.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and deny enforcement of the irs summons.
background 
in november of,the irs served a summons on monumental in the civil investigation of johnson tax liability for the tax years from september,through september.the investigation focused on whether johnson had properly taken income tax deductions for the contributions it made to its employee welfare benefit plan.johnson plan used employer contributions to purchase three different monumental life insurance products for its employees the continuous group term product,the millennium group product,and the signet group life insurance product.
john marien,an irs agent who specializes in investigating improper uses of employee benefit plans,explained in an affidavit that these types of insurance arrangements can be characterized as employee welfare benefit plans,plans,or vehicles that hold assets for select employees.the classification of the insurance arrangement affects the tax consequences that attach.these arrangements are often used to disguise schemes.marien believed that the same types of products provided by monumental to johnson were involved in the case of neonatology associates,commissioner,wl,aff,cir.in that case,the tax court held that the contributions made by two professional medical corporations into an employee benefits program were disguised taxable dividends and not deductible expenses by the employer.at.
employers are not generally prohibited from funding term life insurance policies for their employees and deducting the premiums paid as business expenses.the magistrate judge explained,however,that an unlawful twist occurs when small businesses,in which the employees are generally the owners,buy policies at inflated premiums and then place the amount in excess of the reasonable cost of the insurance risk into an investment account for the employees.in those cases,employers are disguising investments that accumulate cash value as deductible expenses.
to investigate whether johnson deductions exploited this unlawful twist,the administrative summons requested categories of documents,including subparts,from monumental.a copy of the summons is appended to this opinion.some of the document requests related specifically to johnson insurance policies,while others related generally to the and products that monumental offered to many of its customers.for example,item a of the summons sought,in relation to monumental product,a ll documents memorializing,describing,identifying listing the insurance costs premium rates in effect during the period beginning july,through september.this request,covering all of monumental customers who used the product during the time span identified by the irs,was intended to better inform the irs about how the product was generally administered by monumental.marien claimed that this information would help determine whether johnson was deducting the proper amount as a business expense.
monumental moved to quash the summons.after the district court dismissed monumental motion,monumental delivered approximately pages of documents to the irs.monumental also expressed a willingness to produce more documents if the irs would place them under a protective order to keep the proprietary information confidential.this the irs was unwilling to do.moreover,the irs was displeased with monumental production of an insignificant portion of the requested documents,so it filed a petition to enforce the summons in april of.attached to this petition was marien affidavit.marien averred that monumental full compliance with the summons would assist the irs in characterizing the arrangements made by johnson in order for the irs to determine the tax consequences.in addition,he declared that the documents sought by the summons were not already in the possession of the irs in a form useable to investigate johnson.
monumental raised several objections to the enforcement of the summons,prompting the district court to refer the case to a magistrate judge.in august of,after lengthy proceedings that included six hearings,further production of documents by monumental,and an attempted settlement between the parties,the magistrate judge issued his findings of fact,conclusions of law,and recommendations.the magistrate judge concluded that the summons did not suffer from technical difficulties,the irs did not issue the summons in bad faith,the government already had a portion of the requested documents in its possession because of the neonatology investigation,and some of the documents that the government requested were irrelevant to the investigation.because the magistrate judge did not believe that partial enforcement of the summons was legally permissible,he recommended that the district court deny enforcement in full.he also recommended that the district court not require a protective order,if the summons were to be enforced,because placing a condition on the enforcement of an irs summons is improper according to the ninth circuit decision in united states jose,cir.
the government then filed an objection to the magistrate judge recommendation.in october of,the district court declined to follow the recommendation of the magistrate judge and entered an order enforcing the summons in full.the district court,applying a de novo standard of review,rejected the conclusions of the magistrate judge that some of information sought by the irs was irrelevant and that the irs possessed some of the documents requested in a form that it could use in the johnson investigation.monumental now appeals.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a district court order enforcing an irs summons will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.wagenknecht united states,cir unpublished citing fortney united states,cir.clear error exists if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.alexander local,laborers int l union of,cir.issues of statutory interpretation,however,are reviewed de novo.fortney,at.
prima facie case for summons enforcement 
in order to ensure the proper determination of tax liability,congress has endowed the irs with expansive authority.united states arthur young,d.section of the internal revenue code,is the centerpiece of that congressional design.arthur young,at.under,the commissioner of the irs is authorized,f or the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return,t o examine any books,papers,records,or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry and to summon any person to produce such documents.a.the summons power is not limited to the taxpayer under investigation,but may also be issued to a third party who has relevant information.a.
the courts,and not the irs,are authorized to enforce this summons power.united states will,cir affirming the district court enforcement of a summons over the taxpayer objection that the summons was issued in bad faith.in united states powell,d,the supreme court enunciated the analytical framework that governs enforcement decisions.first,for the government to establish a prima facie case for enforcement,it must demonstrate that the investigation has a legitimate purpose,the information summoned is relevant to that purpose,the documents sought are not already in the irs possession,and the procedural steps required by the tax code have been followed.id.at.the requisite showing is generally made by the submission of the affidavit of the agent who issued the summons and who is seeking enforcement.will,at.
once the government has made this prima facie showing,the burden shifts to the party being summoned to either disprove the elements of the prima facie case or demonstrate that judicial enforcement of the summons would otherwise constitute an abuse of the court process.united states davis,cir.in this case,monumental claims that the irs has failed to establish a prima facie case for the reasons discussed below.
alleged insufficiency of the agent affidavit 
monumental first argues that marien affidavit in support of the petition to enforce the summons is insufficient because marien was not the agent who issued the summons.agent lola lee,who issued the summons,did not prepare the affidavit.but marien is a specialist in the tax treatment of employee benefit plans and was specifically assigned to the johnson investigation.although this court authority on point states that the agent who issued the summons is an appropriate person to establish a prima facie case for enforcement,will,at,there is no caselaw holding that another irs investigator is incompetent to provide the requisite information.
agent marien had personal knowledge of the johnson investigation and the documents needed to determine johnson tax liability.see.requiring affidavits to be based on personal knowledge.because marien,the irs national specialist in this area,was competent to establish the powell factors,his affidavit does not fail due to an alleged technical deficiency.the district court reliance on the affidavit,therefore,was not clearly erroneous.
the neonatology documents 
monumental also argues that many of the documents sought by the summons are already in the possession of the irs.specifically,monumental produced some of the general information regarding its products when the irs was investigating neonatology associates the neonatology documents.neonatology associates used many of the same types of insurance arrangements as johnson.the irs does not dispute that it already has the neonatology documents,but claims it does not possess them in a form that it can employ in the investigation of johnson because of the confidentiality requirements of.
under a,federal tax returns and tax return information are confidential.federal employees may not disclose such information unless an exception is met,and a taxpayer has a statutory cause of action for damages in the event of an unauthorized disclosure of return information.rowley united states,cir citation and quotation marks omitted see also a imposing civil liability for disclosure of return information by a government agent.return information includes a taxpayer identity,the nature,source,or amount of his income,payments,receipts,deductions,exemptions,credits or any other data collected by the irs with respect to a return or with respect to the determination of possible tax liability.b a.
but return information does not encompass data in a form which can not be associated with or otherwise identify,directly or indirectly,a particular taxpayer.b d.moreover,an explicit exception to the confidentiality requirements is made for inspection by or disclosure to officers and employees of the department of the treasury whose official duties require such inspection or disclosure for tax administration purposes.h.internal use by the irs of the neonatology documents in the johnson investigation,therefore,would not violate the confidentiality requirements.
the irs further argues,however,that actual possession of or access to information by the irs is not an absolute ban to enforcement of a summons for that information,quoting phillips united states,wl,at cir.march,unpublished.but the summoned taxpayer in phillips produced no evidence to contradict the irs agent affidavit declaring that the irs did not possess any of the requested information.id.the quoted language in phillips is therefore dicta,to say nothing of the fact that the case is also unpublished.phillips is thus easily distinguishable from the present case,where the irs does not dispute that it already possesses certain of the requested documents.
in addition,the proposition stated in phillips that actual possession is not an absolute ban to summons enforcement derives from a fifth circuit case in which there was little evidence that the irs actually had possession of the summonsed documents.see davis,at enforcing a summons in part where the taxpayer did not request discovery as to whether the irs possessed the questioned documents.the fifth circuit in davis balanced the unnecessary harassment of the taxpayer inherent in a summons requesting information with the need to expedite proceedings to allow for effective investigations by the irs.id.at.this balancing test was applied in another unpublished case from this circuit,united states alpha medical management,wl,at cir.june,which held that district courts may limit enforcement of a summons to documents not already possessed by the irs,but that actual possession is not an absolute ban.
in the present case,the district court held that monumental has not shown that the irs has practical means to access any of the neonatology documents,nor has monumental shown that production of these documents would work an unnecessary hardship on monumental.but even assuming without deciding that this circuit would adopt the davis balancing test,the burden must be placed on the government rather than on monumental to prove that the government interests outweigh monumental hardship.see united states theodore,cir holding that the obligation is upon the irs to demonstrate that it has no practical way of obtaining the material within its possession.the government should bear this burden because monumental has successfully shown that the irs does,in fact,possess some of the requested materials in a form it can use in this investigation.because monumental has successfully rebutted the government prima facie showing as required by powell,the irs must prove that,on balance,the neonatology documents can not be practicably accessed.
the irs,by simply asserting that the neonatology documents have been locked in a file somewhere,has not shown that the davis balancing test weighs in its favor,even if we were to accept the government argument that davis applies.although proceedings are designed to be summary in nature and to be concluded quickly,united states kis,cir,the district court should not have dismissed monumental meritorious objections simply to avoid a fresh round of litigation regarding exactly which documents the irs already may have.expediting an irs summons is an important consideration,but it is not the only goal.monumental,because it is a third party to the irs investigation of the taxpayer johnson,deserves greater protection against a burdensome summons.see united states bisceglia,d holding that federal courts should scrutinize summonses issued to third parties with extra care superseded by statute on other grounds.
finally,the irs argues that the validity of a summons should be tested as of the time that it was issued.the summons to monumental was issued in november of,almost nine months before the tax court decision in neonatology,causing the irs to claim that there is no proof that it possessed the documents at the time the summons was issued.it relies on united states kemper money market fund,cir assessing the validity of a summons as of the time that it was issued in affirming the denial of fees and costs to the taxpayer.but kemper is inapplicable because it dealt with the question of whether a referral for criminal prosecution invalidated a summons,an entirely different issue than the one before us.id.the irs cites no authority for the proposition that,in this equitable proceeding,the panel may not consider the fact that the neonatology documents are now in the irs possession.see kennedy rubin,a suit to compel compliance with an administrative subpoena is,by nature of the relief sought,a mandatory injunction proceeding,equitable in character.
because monumental has demonstrated that the neonatology documents are already in the irs possession,the irs has not satisfied this aspect of the powell requirements.the district court therefore committed a clear error in enforcing the summons with respect to those documents.
relevance of the documents requested 
monumental next challenges the relevance of many of the documents requested.applying the powell test for relevance,the question is whether the records requested might throw light upon the correctness of a return.arthur young,at.this threshold is very low,united states noall,cir,but judicial protection against sweeping or irrelevant orders is particularly appropriate in matters where the demand for records is directed not to the taxpayer but to a.theodore,at citation and quotation marks omitted emphasis removed.
marien affidavit asserts that all of the documents requested are relevant to the investigation of johnson.he further states that the determination of deductions claimed by johnson and the characterization of insurance arrangements is a complex and inquiry.the district court found that marien affidavit sufficiently established relevance because courts have consistently recognized that declarations or affidavits by irs directors or agents generally satisfy the powell requirements.see,united states stuart,d holding that the powell requirements were satisfied by an irs employee affidavit will,at holding that the requisite showing for the powell factors is generally made by an affidavit of the issuing agent.
on appeal,monumental contends that many of the documents sought by the irs relate not to johnson,but to other unnamed taxpayers.according to monumental brief,paragraphs three through seven of the summons request practically everything related to various insurance policies as a whole,including insurance pricing,agent commission,marketing allowances,and reinsurance information,as they are sold to insureds all over the country.monumental therefore argues that the summons is overbroad and disproportionate to the ends sought.see theodore,at reversing the district court order enforcing a summons because it was unreasonable.the magistrate judge agreed with monumental that request a,which seeks a ll documents memorializing,describing,identifying,listing insurance costs premium rates in effect during the period beginning july,through september,seemed particularly irrelevant because the irs was only investigating johnson tax liability between and.
in response,the irs contends that it is authorized to determine the course and conduct of its audits.see united states norwest,cir.it further argues that the details on monumental product lines will assist the irs in classifying the true nature of johnson benefit plan.to fully understand the purpose of the payments made to the plan,and to discern whether the payments are intended to accumulate value,the irs asserts that it must examine the general operation of monumental group policies.
proceedings seeking enforcement of an irs summons are intended to be summary in nature,and defining the permissible scope of the hearing is a decision left to the discretion of the district court.will,at permitting the district court to decide if further discovery on the powell factors is warranted.nevertheless,in close cases,the mere assertion of relevance by an irs agent will not necessarily satisfy the government burden.united states goldman,cir.the present case exemplifies an exceptional circumstance where automatic reliance upon an agent affidavit is not adequate because the subpoena is directed to a third party,not to the taxpayer being investigated,the irs seeks a voluminous amount of highly sensitive proprietary information about monumental general administration of its products,the irs has opposed the imposition of a protective order,and the magistrate judge,who spent years considering the scope of the summons,found that the irs was seeking some irrelevant information.
we agree with the magistrate judge that some of the documents requested by the irs appear to be far removed from the investigation of johnson tax liability.the district court abbreviated analysis of this issue does not persuade us otherwise.in this case,where a large burden is imposed upon a third party to produce proprietary documents that the irs has refused to place under a protective order,marien word that all of the documents summoned are relevant should not be the end of the district court inquiry.
we would normally remand this case with instructions for the district court to limit enforcement of the summons to relevant documents that are not already in the irs possession.narrowing the scope of the documents that may be summoned constitutes the partial enforcement of a summons,which an unpublished case in this circuit has found permissible.see alpha medical,wl at limiting enforcement of the summons to documents not already accessible to the irs.see also part.below distinguishing partial enforcement from conditional enforcement of a summons.in this case,however,the magistrate judge has held six hearings and undertaken extensive efforts to work out a compromise.the fact that the parties could not reach a mutually agreeable solution leads us to believe that a remand to the district court to determine which documents are relevant and which are not would prompt a long,and contentious process.in proceedings that have already spanned several years,we think the best course,in terms of both administrative and judicial efficiency,is to deny enforcement of the summons in full and permit the irs,if it wishes,to redraft a more narrowly tailored summons that complies with the powell requirements.
protective order 
because we are reversing that district court order enforcing the summons,we do not need to decide the question of whether monumental is entitled to a protective order.we should clarify,however,the distinction between granting partial enforcement of a summons and conditionally enforcing a summons,because this distinction has become muddied throughout these proceedings.monumental request for a protective order covering the documents sought by the irs would constitute conditional enforcement of the summons because restrictions would be imposed on the irs use of summoned materials.partial enforcement,in contrast,narrows the scope of the summons by limiting the type and amount of documents that the summoned party must produce.although this court has permitted a summons to be limited in scope,see alpha medical,wl,at,we have never addressed the question of whether conditional enforcement is question that has been addressed by both the fifth and ninth circuits.see jose,at requiring the irs to give the summoned parties notice before transferring the documents to other divisions within the irs was held to constitute impermissible conditional enforcement united states barrett,cir holding that district courts can not place conditions on enforcement of a summons,but must simply decide whether to enforce or not to enforce the summons.this circuit position on the issue need not be decided at the present time in light of our disposition of the enforcement request.
iii.conclusion 
for all of the reasons set forth above,we reverse the judgment of the district court and deny enforcement of the irs summons.
