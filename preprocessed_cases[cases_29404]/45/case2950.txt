other insurance clauses direct how liability is to be allocated among multiple insurers who are liable on the same risk.the drafters of such clauses are engaged in a game of hot potato each insurer is trying to shift as much of the risk as possible to other insurers,well aware that they will be trying to shift it back again.when faced with conflicting other insurance clauses,the courts ordinarily split the potato that is,they dole out the risk in more or less equal portions to each of the participating insurers.
the new twist in this case is that plaintiff scottsdale insurance company scottsdale used two different other insurance clauses.one purported to apply to the duty to indemnify the other purported to apply to the duty to defend.moreover,the clause applicable to the duty to defend was made an integral part of the statement of that duty.thus,it provided that scottsdale shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured,seeking damages which are payable under the above insuring agreement,provided,however,that no other insurance affording a defense or indemnity against such a suit is available to the insured.capitalization omitted.by contrast,defendants national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pennsylvania national and american international specialty lines insurance company american each used a standard other insurance clause,which applied solely to the duty to indemnify.
at least three we must assume,for purposes of our opinion,involve covered been filed against the parties common insured.national and american have stepped up to the plate and defended scottsdale has refused to defend.in this action,on for summary judgment and summary adjudication,the trial court ruled that scottsdale had no duty to contribute to national and american defense costs.
we will assume,without deciding,that scottsdale other insurance clause regarding its duty to defend is governed by the same rules of law as other insurance clauses in general.thus,we do not reach scottsdale contention that,because it engrafted this clause onto its promise to defend,the clause is part of the insuring grant and hence not subject to these rules.
we will hold that this case does not involve conflicting other insurance clauses.scottsdale other insurance clause is therefore enforceable,unless it leaves the insured less than fully protected.as we read scottsdale clause,so long as national,american,or any other insurer has a duty to defend,scottsdale does not but if and when every other insurer duty to defend has terminated,scottsdale duty to defend will debut.thus,the insured will always be fully protected.we will therefore affirm the trial court ruling that national and american are not entitled to contribution from scottsdale.
factual background 
the following facts are taken from the papers filed in connection with the parties for summary judgment and summary adjudication.consistent with the applicable standard of review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the losing party slatkin university of redlands th,d fourth,div.two,in this case,to appellants national and american.
each of the parties issued an umbrella liability insurance policy,for a different period,to davey roofing,davey.thus,superior national insurance company superior not a party to this appeal issued a policy covering the period from may,to may.national issued a policy covering the period from may,to may.scottsdale issued one policy covering the period from may,to may,and a second policy covering the period from may,to may.industrial indemnity company industrial also not a party to this appeal issued a policy covering the period from may,to may.finally,american issued a policy covering the period from may,to may.
appellants policies.
the other insurance clauses of national policy and american policy were virtually identical they both provided if other valid and collectible insurance with any other insurer is available to the insured covering a loss also covered hereunder,this insurance shall be excess of,and shall not contribute with,such other insurance.capitalization omitted from national policy comma added to american policy.
the duty to defend provisions of national policy and american policy were likewise identical.they both provided this section shall apply to occurrences not covered by any underlying insurance due to exhaustion of any aggregate limits by reason of any losses paid thereunder 
we will defend any suit against the insured alleging liability insured under the provisions of this policy and seeking recovery for damages on account thereof 
finally,national policy provided this policy shall cease to apply after the applicable limits of liability have been exhausted by payment of defense costs judgments settlements.american policy,however,provided we agree to pay the amounts incurred under this insurance agreement,defense costs in addition to the limits of liability 
scottsdale policies.
scottsdale policies included an other insurance clause which provided the insurance afforded by this policy shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured provided that if such other insurance provides indemnity only in excess of a stated amount of liability per occurrence,the insurance afforded by this policy shall contribute therewith with respect to such part of ultimate net loss as is covered hereunder but the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than the amount which would have been payable under this policy bears to the sum of said amount which would have been payable under each other excess indemnity policy applicable to such loss,had each such policy been the only policy so applicable.capitalization omitted.
with respect to the duty to defend,however,scottsdale policies also provided the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured,seeking damages which are payable under the above insuring agreement,provided,however,that no other insurance affording a defense or indemnity against such a suit is available to the insured.capitalization omitted.
a number of construction defect actions have been filed against davey.these include billedo john laing homes,san bernardino superior court case no.billedo action,dorsey manning company,san bernardino superior court case no.dorsey action and alonzo,san bernardino superior court case no.scv alonzo action.at least for purposes of this appeal,it is undisputed that these actions allege that davey is liable for property damage that occurred continuously throughout the parties respective policy periods.
appellants have advised us there are at least eight other actions now pending against davey that are at least potentially covered by the policies at issue.they filed a request for judicial notice of these actions.we hereby deny the request.we generally do not take judicial notice of matters that were not before the trial court when it ruled.doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,fn,culligan state compensation ins.fund th,d.thus,as far as the record is concerned,the only such actions are the billedo,dorsey and alonzo actions collectively,the covered actions.we understand,however,that in principle additional actions covered by the policies could be filed.
all the primary insurance policies that would otherwise provide davey with a defense have been exhausted.national,american,superior and industrial have provided davey with a defense.when the billedo and dorsey actions were settled,scottsdale contributed to davey portion of the settlement.scottsdale,however,has refused to participate in or to contribute to davey defense.
procedural background 
scottsdale filed this action against superior,national,industrial and american.in the operative complaint,it sought a declaration that it had no duty to participate in providing davey with a defense against the covered actions.
national and american against scottsdale,superior,and industrial,seeking a declaration that they were entitled to contribution from the toward davey indemnity and defense costs.
the commissioner of insurance placed superior in a conservatorship due to insolvency.scottsdale then voluntarily dismissed its complaint against superior without prejudice.
scottsdale filed a motion for summary judgment.national and american filed a for summary adjudication,which was set for hearing at the same time as scottsdale motion for summary judgment.
after hearing argument,the trial court granted scottsdale motion it denied national and american.it explained i think that when contractual language is clear that i under an obligation to follow it.t he express language contained in the policy makes clear that the scottsdale policy is only triggered when there is no other policy of insurance available to davey roofing.there is other insurance coverage afforded to davey.
national and american voluntarily dismissed their against scottsdale and industrial,without prejudice.the trial court then entered judgment on the complaint in favor of scottsdale and against national and american.
the relevance of the differing policy periods 
appellants contend the provision of scottsdale policies requiring it to defend if,and only if,no other insurance affording a defense or indemnity against such a suit is available does not apply,because davey had no other umbrella insurance for the same policy period.we disagree.
insurance policies are contracts construed in accordance with the parties mutual intent at the time of contract formation,as inferred from the written provisions.citations.the clear and explicit meaning of the provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,controls judicial interpretation unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.citation.if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to insurance contract language is not ambiguous,courts will apply that meaning.citation.vandenberg superior court cal th,d,quoting.
scottsdale policies defined the other insurance that would excuse its duty to defend as insurance affording a defense or indemnity against any suit against the insured,seeking damages payable under the above insuring agreement.capitalization omitted.thus,other insurance was defined in terms of particular suits,not any particular policy period.the policy is clear and explicit on this point.
a duty to defend arises when the suit potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.citations.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d,quoting gray zurich ins.cal d.indeed,the insurer must defend the entire action even when only one of several causes of action is potentially covered.citations,national union fire ins.cal th,d.
under a standard comprehensive general liability policy,bodily injury and property damage that is continuous or progressively deteriorating throughout successive policy periods is potentially covered by all policies in effect during those periods.montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d.t he duty to defend embraces all the parts of such a claim in which some such harm may possibly have resulted,whether within the policy period or beyond.transport indemnity cal th,d.accordingly,even though appellants policies cover a different policy period than scottsdale,their policies all afford a defense against the covered actions.
we conclude that appellants policies constitute other insurance affording a defense against the covered actions within the meaning of scottsdale policies.it is irrelevant that appellants policies covered different policy periods than scottsdale.
the effect of the policy provision qualifying scottsdale duty to defend 
appellants contend the trial court erred by denying them contribution based on the provision of scottsdale policies that states that it has no duty to defend if other insurance affords a defense or indemnity.first,they argue that this is really an escape clause rather than an exception to coverage.second,they argue that an escape clause is unenforceable when it would leave the insured less than fully protected.scottsdale responds that this provision is part of the insuring grant and therefore not an escape clause.scottsdale also responds,alternatively,that,even if this provision is an escape clause,it can be enforced because it will not leave the insured unprotected.
we need not decide whether it makes any difference that the critical provision appears in the insuring grant.see chamberlin smith d.but see home ins.paul fire marine ins.cir,fremont indem.new england reinsurance.we will hold that,even assuming it is a true escape clause,enforcing it will not leave davey without a defense at any time.accordingly,appellants are not entitled to contribution.
t he right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d,fn.omitted.
the reciprocal rights and duties of several insurers who have covered the same event do not arise out of contract,for their agreements are not with each other their respective obligations flow from equitable principles designed to accomplish ultimate justice in the bearing of a specific burden.as these principles do not stem from agreement between the insurers their application is not controlled by the language of their contracts with the respective policy holders.citation.signal companies,harbor ins.cal d,quoting amer.auto.ins.seaboard surety d.t he trial court determination of which method of allocation will produce the most equitable results is necessarily a matter of its equitable judicial discretion.citations.centennial ins.united states fire ins.th,d.
even so,absent compelling equitable reasons,courts should not impose an obligation on an insurer that contravenes a provision in its insurance policy.citation.truck ins.exchange unigard ins.th,d accord,signal companies,harbor ins,supra,cal d at,see also montrose chemical admiral ins,supra,cal th at,fn,d,a llocation of the cost of indemnification once several insurers have been found liable requires application of principles of contract law to the express terms and limitations of the various policies.
most insurance policies contain other insurance clauses that attempt to limit the insurer liability where other insurance covers the same risk.such clauses attempt to control the manner in which each insurer contributes to or shares a covered loss.citation.citation.historically,other insurance clauses were designed to prevent multiple recoveries when more than one policy provided coverage for a particular loss.citation.pacific indemnity bellefonte ins.th,d,quoting fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d.
the modern comprehensive general liability policy typically contains such a clause.it may take the form of outright denial of coverage under the policy if there is other insurance covering the risk an escape clause,a provision that the policy provides only excess coverage if there is other insurance covering the risk an excess clause,a provision that if there is other insurance covering the risk the loss will be shared on some proportional basis with that other insurance a pro rata clause,or some other variation upon the same theme.citation.stonewall ins.city of palos verdes estates th,d.
in general,an other insurance clause dispute can not arise between excess and primary carriers but only between insurers on the same level.citations.this is because an other insurance clause is only relevant when two or more policies apply at the same level.citations.reliance nat.indemnity general star indemnity th,d.it is therefore important to keep in mind the distinction between a policy with an excess clause and a true excess policy,which does not apply until the limits of a specified primary policy have been exhausted.a primary policy may have an excess clause.see pacific indemnity bellefonte ins,supra,th at,d commerce industry ins.chubb custom ins.th,d.conversely,an excess policy may not have an excess clause it may have a pro rata clause,an escape clause,or no other insurance clause whatsoever.
an umbrella policy,such as the policies at issue here,provides coverage which is excess to specified underlying insurance.however,it may also fill gaps in the coverage provided by the underlying insurance.century indemnity london underwriters th,fn,d croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,to.thus,an umbrella policy,although something of a hybrid,is more akin to a true excess policy than a primary policy.see continental ins.lexington ins.th,d.that is particularly true in this case,because there is no issue regarding the aspect of the umbrella policies the only issue is regarding their excess insurance aspect.
p roration is a favored method of apportioning a loss among those who have contracted to insure against it.thus,public policy disfavors escape clauses,whereby coverage purports to evaporate in the presence of other insurance.citations.this disfavor should also apply,to a lesser extent,to clauses cse ins.group northbrook property casualty th,d.nevertheless,c ontractual terms of insurance coverage are honored whenever possible.the courts will therefore generally honor the language of excess other insurance clauses when no prejudice to the interests of the insured will ensue.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d.no case holds that escape clauses are void per se as long as the insured is protected and financial responsibility is provided for the protection of the public an escape clause is not contrary to public policy or the law.citation.underground constr.pacific indemnity d.
the most common instance in which a court may disregard an escape or excess clause to protect the insured is when it conflicts with another escape or excess clause.when two or more applicable policies contain such clauses,both liability and the costs of defense should ordinarily be prorated according to the amount of coverage afforded.citations.the reason for this rule is that the conflicting provisions are deemed essentially irreconcilable if given effect competing clauses would strand an insured between insurers disclaiming coverage in a manner reminiscent of alphonse and gaston.citations.commerce industry ins.chubb custom ins,supra,th at,d,quoting argonaut ins.transport indem.cal d.that is not,however,the only such instance.for example,a court may disregard an escape clause where the policy limits of the other insurance are inadequate to indemnify the insured fully.continental casualty pacific indemnity d.
here,with respect to the duty to indemnify,each of the policies has an other insurance clause.but t he duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d.whereas the duty to indemnify can arise only after damages are fixed in their amount citations,the duty to defend may arise as soon as damages are sought in some amount citations,at,d.with respect to the duty to defend,only scottsdale policies have any other insurance clause whatsoever.appellants duty to defend is unqualified their policies require them to defend any suit against the insured alleging liability insured under the provisions of this policy 
appellants disagree.their other insurance clauses provide that i f other valid and collectible insurance with any other insurer is available to the insured covering a loss also covered hereunder,this insurance shall be excess of,and shall not contribute with,such other insurance.italics added.they argue that a loss,as used in their policies,includes defense costs.they conclude that their other insurance clauses do apply to the duty to defend.
appellants policies do not define loss.however,they do define ultimate net loss,as the total sum which the insured,or any company as its insurer,or both,become obligated to pay by reason of personal injury,property damage or advertising liability claims,and shall also include hospital,medical and funeral charges and all sums paid or payable as salaries,wages,compensation,fees,charges,interest,or expenses for doctors,nurses,and investigators and other persons,and for settlement,adjustment,investigation and defense of claims italics added comma added to national policy.
we may assume,without deciding,that loss as used in appellants policies does include defense costs.their other insurance clauses,however,apply only when there is other insurance covering a loss also covered hereunder.italics added.the policies set forth two distinct insuring agreements.the first,entitled coverage,provides we will pay on behalf of the insured that portion of the ultimate net loss which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of personal injury,property damage or advertising liability,caused by an occurrence to which this insurance applies per american policy will become legally obligated to pay in national policy.the second,entitled defense,provides we will defend any suit against the insured alleging liability insured under the provisions of this policy and seeking recovery for damages on account thereof thus,a covered loss is one within the insuring agreement entitled coverage a loss for which the insured is entitled to indemnity.even assuming defense costs are a loss,they are not a covered loss.jarrett allstate ins.d.loss payable meant loss as capped by policy limits,not total loss suffered by insured.
our interpretation is consistent with the distinction,in ordinary legal usage,between coverage and the duty to defend,national union fire ins,supra,cal th at,d,a n insurer has a duty to defend when the underlying suit potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy italics added.the concept of insurance which covers defense costs makes sense in one,and only one,the policy expressly provides that the insurer has no duty to defend,merely a duty to reimburse the insured for defense costs.apparently such a provision is not uncommon in excess policies see fmc plaisted companies th,d and directors and officers liability policies.see helfand national union fire ins.th,d.needless to say,the umbrella policies here expressly included a duty to defend.
our interpretation is also consistent with case law applying other insurance clauses.for example,in continental cas.zurich ins.cal d,the insured tendered the defense of the underlying action to three insurers.one accepted the tender and provided a defense the other two refused.the insurer who had provided a defense then filed a declaratory relief action against the other two,at.each of the three policies had an other insurance clause.one was a pro rata clause,which applied when there was other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the other two were excess clauses,which provided that with respect to loss arising out of the use of any automobile the applicable insurance afforded by this policy shall be excess,at,italics added,italics omitted.
the supreme court began by holding that all three insurers policies covered the risk.continental cas.zurich ins,supra,cal d at.next,it held that the excess clauses were enforceable therefore,the policy with the pro rata clause provided primary insurance,and the other two policies were excess only and should be prorated after the primary coverage had been exhausted.citation,at.
finally,the court upheld the trial court order that all three companies share in the costs of defense in the same ratio that they share in paying the judgment continental cas.zurich ins,supra,cal d at.it explained a ll obligated carriers who have refused to defend should be required to share in costs of the insured defense,whether such costs were originally paid by the insured himself or by fewer than all of the carriers.a contrary result would simply provide a premium or offer a possible windfall for the insurer who refuses to defend,at.the facts that the agreement to defend the insured may be severable from the general indemnity provisions,and that each insurer independently owes that duty to its insured,constitute no excuse for any insurer failure to perform.ibid.
it should be apparent that the supreme court did not believe that loss,as use
