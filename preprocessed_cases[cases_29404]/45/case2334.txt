a fire destroys a house.the homeowner insurer agrees to pay for the damages resulting from the fire,then sues the contractor who installed the fireplace several years earlier,claiming negligence.the contractor tenders defense of the action to its liability insurer,asserting that even though the fire occurred after the relevant policy periods ended,there is a possibility of coverage because the fire may have been the result of ongoing damage to the wood in the chimney chase during one or more policy periods due to the exposure of that wood to excessive heat from the chimney every time a fire was burned in the fireplace.under the standard language in a commercial general liability policy,does the liability insurer have a duty to defend the contractor for reasons we will explain,we say yes.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment here that concluded otherwise.
factual and procedural background 
defendant financial pacific insurance company,financial pacific provided general liability insurance coverage to plaintiffs greg tidwell,tidwell enterprises,and tidwell enterprises fireplace division jointly,tidwell between march and march.although the specific policy forms varied over the years,the provisions that are relevant here were the same throughout all of the forms.under the policies,which appear to be standard commercial general liability policies,financial pacific agreed to pay sums that tidwell became legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence if the property damage occurred during the policy period.the policies defined occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.the policies further defined property damage as p hysical injury to tangible property,including or resulting in loss of use of that property or l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.
in or,tidwell participated in the construction of a house in copperopolis by installing a fireplace.apparently,tidwell contract included the fabrication and installation of a custom termination top for the fireplace designed by the project architect,although greg tidwell later testified at a deposition that his employees did not install the top on the chimney.
on november,months after the end of the last policy period for tidwell general liability coverage with financial pacific the house in copperopolis,owned by kendall fox,was damaged by fire.at the time,fox was insured by state farm general insurance company state farm.
on november,state farm attorney sent a letter to tidwell notifying tidwell of the fire.the letter stated that the cause of the fire may be related to the manufacture,design or installation of the fireplace,chimney chase,residence structure or involved component parts and expressed the understanding that tidwell might have been involved with the construction elements of the home specifically related to the area of the fireplace,chimney chase and residential structure.the following day,tidwell forwarded state farm letter to financial pacific.
on december,financial pacific sent a letter to tidwell acknowledging receipt of tidwell claim and agreeing to investigate the claim subject to a reservation of rights.at some point thereafter,financial pacific received a fire investigation report dated january,that was prepared for state farm attorney by dale feb of associates.feb concluded that the fire was caused by the installation of the unlisted shroud located at the top of the chimney chase.in feb opinion,the unlisted shroud prevented the fireplace from drafting properly,which resulted in the overheating of the fireplace and heat transfer to the surrounding wood framing members.according to feb,t he overheating of this fireplace resulted in the ignition of the surrounding framing members at the sides,top and bottom of this fireplace.
on february,state farm sued tidwell for negligence,alleging that tidwell had negligently installed the fireplace system in the fox home and that tidwell negligence was the proximate cause of the fire,which resulted in damage to fox property.state farm alleged that it was seeking subrogation losses pursuant to the insurance policy it had issued to fox,under which state farm was required to,and will pay damages to and on behalf of its insured,as a direct and proximate result of tidwell negligence.
at some point,financial pacific retained engineering,to inspect the fire scene.in a report dated may,reported to financial pacific that the chimney assembly had been modified by the use of the customized termination top that tidwell fabricated and installed at the direction of the general contractor following a design by the architect.concluded that the termination top posed a fire hazard because it restricted the air flow in the chimney,which would result in increased operating temperature of the flue vent sections and the fireplace.could not rule out the installation of the custom terminal top as a cause of the fire.
in june,financial pacific sent a letter to tidwell declining tidwell tender of the defense of the state farm action based on financial pacific conclusion that no potential for coverage existed.financial pacific concluded that the fire started as a result of the chimney shroud which did not allow free movement of air but further concluded that the property damage occurred on november,the date of the fire at issue,long after financial pacific policies had expired,and for coverage to exist,the property damage must take place during the policy period.
in august,tidwell attorney wrote to financial pacific,disagreeing with the insurer denial of a duty to defend tidwell in the state farm action.among other things,tidwell attorney asserted that t he construction of the fireplace and the continuous burning of fires therein create d the potential for continuous and repeated exposure to the same general harmful conditions.the policy definition of occurrence does not rule out the possibility that damage could have been occurring prior to the final fire that burned the house.referring to the reports financial pacific had already received,tidwell attorney further asserted that t he fact that the installation of the termination top could have led to continuous and progressive damage as a result of each fire in the fireplace running too hot fits squarely within the definition of an occurrence.the attorney concluded by asserting that financial pacific could not at this point in the case,based on the allegations and expert reports,conclude that there was no continuous and progressive property damage occurring during the policy period.there could have been occurrences of property damage long before the fire manifested itself on the date provided in the complaint.as you can not conclude there was a lack of property damage during the policy period and you have no other basis for further denying the duty to defend the insured against the complaint,it is clear that there has been an ongoing duty in financial pacific to have mounted and funded the insured defense since the initial tender of defense.
in september,financial pacific attorney responded,asserting among other things that the insurer had no duty to defend tidwell because the only property damage alleged and being sought in state farm complaint occurred on november,the date of the fire.
in april,tidwell attorney informed financial pacific attorney that tidwell was in the process of obtaining additional expert reports that we believe will continue to support our position that the ongoing use of the fireplace during the policy period in its allegedly defective condition created occurrence of damage to the fireplace that culminated in the november,fire.thereafter,in july,tidwell attorney sent financial pacific a report prepared by a retained expert,randy brooks,who had concluded that the repeated exposure of the combustible materials framing the chimney chase to the excessive heat from every fire burned in the fireplace since it was installed would begin to lower the ignition temperatures of that combustible framing to in some cases below degrees.this structure fire would not happen in most cases with the first or a single fire but rather would take a number of fires over several years since to complete pyrolysis and cause ignition.thus,it was tidwell position,based on brooks opinion,that successive fires over the course of six years during five of which tidwell was insured by financial pacific each caused damage to the chimney system and lowered the point of combustion which eventually resulted in the main fire damage to the fox home.
in september,financial pacific attorney once again responded to tidwell attorney,affirming the insurer denial of tidwell tender of the defense in the state farm action.financial pacific attorney asserted that c overage under the financial pacific policies applies to property damage during the policy period caused by an occurrence and argued that the insurer policy did not provide coverage for injury sustained after the expiration of the policy period as the result of a condition created during the policy period.
in april,tidwell commenced the present action by filing a complaint against financial pacific for declaratory relief,breach of contract,and tortious breach of contract.essentially,tidwell alleged that financial pacific had breached its insurance contracts with tidwell by refusing to pay tidwell defense costs in the state farm action because it was possible there was a continuing occurrence of property damage allegedly caused by tidwell during the operative period of the policies,which continuing occurrence led inexorably and inextricably to the eventual total destruction of the fox residence.tidwell alleged on information and belief that numerous fires were repeatedly set in the fireplace at the fox residence during the period covered by the policies,and that each of those fires actually caused physical injury to tangible property,property damage as defined in the policies,by causing,inter alia,a chemical decomposition of wood in framing proximate to the fireplace,in a process known as pyrolysis.tidwell sought a declaration that financial pacific owed tidwell a duty to defend the state farm action and damages from financial pacific for the insurer breach of its duty to defend.
in september,financial pacific moved for summary judgment on the ground that the insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify tidwell in the state farm action because financial pacific lacked any potential or actual coverage under its insurance policies for the claims asserted in that action.in december,the trial court granted that motion.in its ruling,the court found that state farm sought recovery for the fire which occurred november.the insurance policy at issue in this case lapsed march,plaintiffs may not assert alternative causes state farm should have alleged in order to create coverage issues.the formal order granting summary judgment was filed in january,and the resulting judgment in favor of financial pacific was filed in february.tidwell timely appealed from that judgment.
discussion 
an insurer bears a duty to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts which give rise to the potential of liability under the policy.gray zurich insurance cal d.f acts known to the insurer and extrinsic to the third party complaint can generate a duty to defend,even though the face of the complaint does not reflect a potential for liability under the policy.citation.this is so because current pleading rules liberally allow amendment the third party plaintiff can not be the arbiter of coverage.montrose chemical superior court cal th.any doubt as to whether the facts establish the existence of the defense duty must be resolved in the insured favor.id.at.t he insurer need not defend if the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.id.at,quoting gray,supra,cal d at,fn.thus,to prevail on a motion for summary judgment premised on a claim that the insurer had no duty to defend,the insurer must present undisputed facts that eliminate any possibility of coverage.american states ins.progressive casualty ins.th.
on appeal,tidwell essentially contends that financial pacific did not eliminate any possibility of coverage in the state farm action because the undisputed facts show that financial pacific was aware of evidence that the november fire for which state farm sued tidwell may have been simply the culmination of an integrated process of continuing and progressive property damage without which the house fire would never have occurred and some of that property damage could have occurred during the periods when financial pacific policies were in effect.financial pacific,on the other hand,contends there was no possibility of coverage because state farm sought to recover from tidwell only for the fire damage financial pacific coverage and not for any earlier damage that might have been done to the wood framing the chimney chase as a result of the pyrolysis process.as we will explain,we conclude tidwell has the better argument.even though state farm did not seek to recover from tidwell damages directly attributable to physical injury to the fox house that predated the november fire,there was a possibility that the damages state farm did seek to recover occurred because of earlier physical injury to the house for which tidwell was responsible,and thus there was a possibility that the damages state farm sought fell within the coverage provided by the terms of the general liability policies financial pacific issued to tidwell.because there was a potential for liability under the policies,financial pacific owed tidwell a duty of defense.
we reach this conclusion via a straightforward application of the applicable policy provisions.it is undisputed that under the policies at issue here,financial pacific agreed to pay sums that tidwell became legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence if the property damage occurred during the policy period.the policies defined occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.the policies further defined property damage as p hysical injury to tangible property,including or resulting in loss of use of that property or l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.
when the foregoing provisions are read together,it can be seen that financial pacific would be liable under the policies for any sums tidwell became legally obligated to pay as damages because of physical injury to tangible property that occurred during a policy period and was caused by continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.thus,if tidwell negligence resulted in a repeated exposure of tangible property to substantially the same general harmful conditions an occurrence,and that repeated exposure to those conditions resulted in physical injury to that property property damage during a policy period,and tidwell became legally obligated to pay damages because of that negligence,then coverage would,at least potentially,exist under the financial pacific policies.
with this understanding of the policy language,it is apparent there was possibility of coverage here based on the allegations of state farm complaint and the facts known to financial pacific.this is so because,based on the allegations and the known facts,there was reason to believe tidwell might have negligently installed a custom top on the chimney in the fox house that restricted the flow of air in the chimney,which in turn might have resulted in excessive heat in the chimney every time a fire was burned in the fireplace from the time the house was built,which in turn through the process of pyrolysis might have altered the chemical composition of the wood framing the chimney chase,thereby reducing the temperature at which it would ignite,until eventually,on november,the wood framing the chimney chase did ignite,which in turn resulted in the fire that damaged fox house,for which state farm was obligated to indemnify fox as fox insurer.if that is what happened,then financial pacific would potentially be liable under its policies to pay any sums tidwell became legally obligated to pay state farm as damages because the repeated exposure of the wood framing the chimney chase to the excessive heat in the chimney,for which tidwell was responsible,may have caused physical injury to the wood by altering its chemical composition and reducing its ignition point during one or more policy periods,and that physical injury would have caused tidwell legal obligation to pay damages for the fire that resulted at least in part from the damaged wood.
of course,we need not and do not conclude that this is what happened we conclude only that under the allegations of state farm complaint and the facts known to financial pacific this is what might have happened.and because this might have happened,there was a potential for liability under the policies,and financial pacific had a duty to defend.
financial pacific contentions to the contrary are unavailing.to the extent financial pacific addresses the relevant policy provisions at all,the insurer position is that t he coverage grant of the policies requires the damage at issue take place in the policy period and here that did not happen because state farm claim was based on damage sustained in the fire at the fox home on november,after the last policy period ended.thus,financial pacific argues that coverage is determined by the damage for which the third party sues the insured in financial pacific words,the damage at issue and whether that damage occurred during a policy period,and here state farm did not sue tidwell for the damage to the wood framing the chimney chase prior to the november fire but for the damage to the house resulting from the november fire.it is in connection with this point that financial pacific relies heavily on remmer glens falls indem.d remmer for the proposition that it is the damage,injury,and cause of action alleged in the third party complaint that controls the coverage determination.
contrary to financial pacific position,remmer does not compel the conclusion that there was no potential for coverage here.in remmer,the remmers,who owned a lot uphill from a lot owned by the morrises,graded and filled their lot in.remmer,supra,d at.at the time,the remmers had a comprehensive personal liability insurance policy with glen falls indemnity company,which was later canceled in january.ibid.four years later,in january,large quantities of earth and rock slid from the fill on the remmers property onto the property of the morrises.ibid.in april,the morrises sued the remmers,alleging among others not relevant here a cause of action for nuisance.id.at.the nuisance cause of action apparently characterized the fill that remained on the remmers property as a nuisance and sought an injunction,as well as damages for the diminution in the value of the morrises property from the continuing nuisance.id.at.the insurer rejected the remmers tender of the defense of the action.id.at.thereafter,the morrises recovered a judgment for against the remmers for the diminution to the value of their property caused by the continuance of the nuisance.id.at.
the remmers then sued the insurer to recover the amount awarded to the morrises,as well as their defense costs in the morris action.remmer,supra,d at.the trial court found in favor of the insurer,concluding that t he damage complained of was the present threat to,and depreciation of,the morris land caused by the current maintenance of the balance of the rocks.this damage occurred after the policy was cancelled in.id.at.on appeal,the remmers argued that the action in morris remmer was for damages caused by a nuisance created in,and,therefore,the occurrence was created during the policy period.ibid.the appellate court disagreed,noting that t he general rule is that the time of the occurrence of an accident within the meaning of an indemnity policy is not the time the wrongful act was committed,but the time when the complaining party was actually damaged.ibid.the court further explained that while the findings of fact in morris remmer declare d that the nuisance was created by the fill of,and was a continuing nuisance,and it was by reason of this nuisance that the morrises property diminished in value,this wa s not a complete or proper description of what was involved in the case of morris remmer.the pleadings in that action demonstrate that the damage,injury and cause of action there alleged were for the maintenance and continuance of a nuisance at the time the action was filed,april of.the action of morris remmer was for the maintenance and existence of that nuisance.that was the nuisance that constituted the occurrence for which damages were allowed.this occurrence was in,and therefore not within the coverage.id.at.the court also went on to observe that t he fact that the morrises were suing for the present maintenance of a present nuisance is demonstrated not only by the allegations of the complaint,but also by the fact that in the morrises could not have successfully sued for damages for the original creation of the nuisance in,because such cause of action would have been barred by either the three or statute of limitations.id.at.
in relying on the damage,injury and cause of action alleged in the earlier action to determine there was no coverage,the remmer court did not purport to state a rule that compels the conclusion there was no potential for coverage here.even assuming remmer can be reasonably understood as holding,as financial pacific claims,that it is the damage,injury,and cause of action alleged in the third party complaint that controls the coverage determination,application of that rule here would not eliminate all potential for coverage.as we have explained,state farm sought to recover from tidwell the amounts it was going to be liable to pay fox because of the fire in november.as financial pacific argues,that was the damage,injury,and cause of action alleged by state farm.as we have also explained,however,it was possible that the november fire was caused by the repeated exposure of the wood framing the chimney chase to excessive heat resulting from a custom chimney cap installed by tidwell,which altered the chemical composition of the wood and reduced its ignition point until the wood finally ignited on the date of the fire.and as we have also explained,due to this possible causal relationship between what happened to the wood and tidwell potential legal obligation to pay damages to state farm for the november fire,there was a potential for coverage under the language of financial pacific policies because the excessive heat in the chimney,for which tidwell may have been responsible,might have caused physical injury to the wood framing the chimney chase and that physical injury might have occurred during one or more policy periods,which would mean that physical injury during a policy period caused tidwell legal obligation to pay damages for the resulting fire,which would be sufficient to trigger coverage under the policy provisions at issue here.under this scenario,the fact that the damage,injury,and cause of action state farm alleged in its complaint against tidwell was for a fire that occurred outside any policy period does not preclude the possibility of coverage because of the causal role that the degradation of the wood during one or more policy periods may have played in causing the fire for which state farm sought to recover damages.the decision in remmer does not compel a contrary conclusion.
to the extent financial pacific attempts to refute the foregoing reasoning by citing montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,for the proposition that a cause of damage is insufficient to create a potential for covered damage,we do not find any such proposition in that case.what the supreme court explained there was that,for purposes of triggering coverage,there is a distinction between the occurrence and the resulting bodily injury or property damage,and it is the latter,not the former,that must occur during the policy period for coverage to exist.ibid.this distinction between the causative event an accident or continuous and repeated exposure to conditions and the resulting bodily injury or property damage ibid.is entirely unremarkable and does not refute the reasoning set forth above.here,an initial causative event constituting an occurrence namely,the repeated exposure of the wood framing the chimney chase to excessive heat in the chimney may have resulted in property damage over a period of years namely,the physical degradation of that wood which in turn may have led ultimately to the fire in november.it is true that the initial occurrence was,by itself,insufficient to create a potential for covered damage,but there is nothing in the relevant policy language,or in the case on which financial pacific relies,to support the conclusion that the physical injury to the wood that resulted from this initial causal event could not itself have served as a further causal event in the chain of causation between tidwell negligence in installing the custom chimney top and the ultimate fire in november for which state farm sought to recover damages from tidwell.thus,contrary to financial pacific assertion,a cause of damage may be sufficient to create a potential for covered damage if that cause of damage constituted physical injury to tangible property that occurred during a policy period,resulted from an occurrence,and ultimately led to the insured legal obligation to pay damages.
to the extent financial pacific attempts to call into question the validity of the pyrolysis theory whether by complaining that it originated with tidwell own expert,pointing out that it was not specifically mentioned by feb or,or asserting that it is a controversial concept the insurer arguments go nowhere because they do not eliminate all possibility of coverage.to prevail on summary judgment based on the contention that pyrolysis could not be used to establish a potential for coverage under the policies,financial pacific would have had to establish as a matter of law on undisputed facts that pyrolysis is not a valid scientific theory and that,as such,it could not be used to establish that physical injury to tangible property occurred during a policy period.the insurer did not do so.whatever aspersions financial pacific may seek to cast on the idea that the repeated exposure of wood to excessive heat can result in the physical degradation of that wood,those aspersions are not sufficient to eliminate all possibility that pyrolysis is a valid theory and that it was operative here in causing the fire in november.
to the extent financial pacific relies on hurley construction state farm fire casualty th hurley and gunderson fire ins.exchange th gunderson for the proposition that an insured may not speculate about facts or theories to create a duty to defend,those authorities are of no moment here.in hurley,a contractor hurley was sued by an insurer fireman fund for participating in a conspiracy to engage in fraudulent billing practices.hurley,at.hurley tendered the defense of that action to its liability insurer,state farm.id.at.state farm denied coverage hurley sued for breach of the insurance contract.id.at.state farm successfully moved for summary judgment,arguing that it had no duty to defendant because among other things the fireman fund complaint did not seek compensation for property damage or bodily injury.id.at.on appeal,hurley argued that even though fireman fund complaint showed no potential for coverage on its face,state farm had a duty to defend because fireman fund might have amended its complaint in the future such that the action would become an action for property damage and bodily injury.ibid.the court rejected this argument because t he extraneous facts regarding potential liability came from hurley counsel who speculated about how fireman fund might amend its complaint at some future date,and the insured may not speculate about unpled third party claims to manufacture coverage.id.at.
in gunderson,a property owner ferrando sued adjacent property owners the gundersons to quiet title to real property,for declaratory relief,and for injunctive relief relating to an easement the gundersons claimed over her property.gunderson fire ins.exchange,supra,th at.the gundersons tendered defense of the action to their homeowners liability insurer fire insurance exchange,but the insurer declined the tender because ferrando complaint contained no reference to a claim for bodily injury or property damage.ibid.after the ferrando action settled,the gundersons sued their insurer for breach of the insurance contract,but the insurer successfully moved for summary judgment on the ground that it had no duty to defend the ferrando action.id.at.on appeal,the gundersons argued the insurer had a duty to defend because ferrando could have made a claim for physical injury to or destruction of tangible property in connection with a fence across a portion of the easement which the gundersons removed at the outset of the dispute over the easement.id.at.the court rejected this argument because,among other things,as in hurley,ferrando complaint,on its face,alleged no facts showing a potential for coverage and t he extrinsic facts regarding potential liability for property damage came from speculation about how ferrando might have but did not amend her complaint at some future date.just as a third party complainant is not the arbiter of the coverage of an insurance policy,so is it also the rule that insureds themselves may not manufacture coverage by speculating about unpled third party claims.id.at.
hurley and gunderson both stand for the proposition that an insured can not manufacture a duty to defend by speculating that the third party plaintiff might amend or could have amended its complaint to allege a claim for damages arising from bodily injury or property damage when the operative complaint did not contain any such claim.that proposition has no bearing here.the speculation financial pacific complains of here consists of the opinions of tidwell own experts of what may have occurred inside the walls of fox house,the pyrolysis damage to the wood framing the chimney chase from the excessive heat in the chimney.but that is not the sort of speculation forbidden by hurley and gunderson.in determining whether a bare potential or possibility of coverage exists,which is all that is necessary to trigger the duty to defend montrose chemical superior court,supra,cal th at,neither hurley nor gunderson bars an insured from speculating about how its actions may have led to the damages for which the insured is being sued by means of property damage that could have occurred during a policy period.
stated another way,all tidwell did here was offer a viable theory as to how the fire that damaged fox house,for which state farm was suing tidwell,might have been the result of physical injury to tangible property that occurred during one or more of financial pacific policy periods and that resulted from an occurrence,thus potentially triggering coverage and,in turn,a duty to defend.tidwell did not speculate that state farm might plead some other claim against tidwell that would potentially be covered by the financial pacific policies.rather,tidwell simply hypothesized how the claim that state farm had already pleaded might be covered.neither hurley nor gunderson precluded tidwell from doing so.
to the extent financial pacific relies on three decisions that have rejected the pyrolysis theory as a basis for establishing a duty to defend a lawsuit for a fire that postdated the applicable insurance coverage,we do not find any of those cases persuasive.in greenlee sherman.greenlee,a furnace installer installed a furnace in the greenlees home in.id.at.after a fire destroyed their home in,the greenlees sued the executor of the estate of the furnace installer on the theory that improper installment of the flue pipe from the furnace resulted in the exposure of a wooden joist to intense radiant heat while the furnace was operating,which in turn allegedly caused a chemical process,known as pyrolysis,in the wooden joist which ultimately lowered the ignition temperature of the wood the point where it was ignited by the flue pipe.id.at.in a related action,the furnace installer liability i
