plaintiff and appellant monticello insurance company monticello appeals a stipulated judgment in favor of defendant and respondent essex insurance company essex in an action for equitable contribution.
in this action,monticello seeks contribution from essex for defense costs to defend mutual insured blumenfeld construction company blumenfeld,a general contractor,against construction defect claims in an underlying action.blumenfeld was a named insured under the monticello policy and an additional insured under an essex policy.dana drywall,blumenfeld drywall subcontractor,was the named insured under the essex policy.
the essential issue presented is whether essex had a duty to defend blumenfeld in the underlying action.
we conclude essex did not owe blumenfeld a defense because neither the pleadings nor the extrinsic evidence in the underlying action revealed a possibility that the homeowners claims against blumenfeld might be covered by the drywall subcontractor policy.therefore,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
events preceding the instant action.
blumenfeld was the general contractor on a project involving the construction of the goldman residence in tarzana.dana drywall was the drywall subcontractor on the project.the notice of completion indicates the project was completed on april.
monticello insured blumenfeld as a named insured under its policy effective december,to december.this policy was not renewed.monticello issued no other policy to blumenfeld.
essex issued a liability policy to dana drywall,effective september,to september.the essex policy contained an additional insured endorsement.the endorsement was conditional,making blumenfeld an additional insured under this policy,but only as respects negligent acts or omissions of the named insured and only for occurrences,claims or coverage not otherwise excluded in the policy.it is further agreed that where no coverage shall apply herein for the named insured,no coverage nor defense shall be afforded to the additional insured 
on july,the goldmans filed the underlying action,a suit against blumenfeld and others for construction defects in the project.dana drywall was not named as a defendant in that action.monticello defended blumenfeld in the underlying action subject to a reservation of rights.
on october,blumenfeld filed a against dana drywall and others,alleging they were responsible for the damages at the project.
essex defended its named insured,dana drywall,in the underlying action.
on july,blumenfeld tendered defense of the underlying action to essex,pursuant to the additional insured endorsement in the essex policy.on november,essex declined to defend blumenfeld.
monticello incurred in defense costs to defend blumenfeld in the underlying action and obtained reimbursement from the insurer of another subcontractor in the sum of,leaving it with in unreimbursed defense costs.
the underlying action settled.monticello contributed on behalf of blumenfeld to a global settlement of million.the insurers of dana drywall,including essex,collectively contributed to the settlement on behalf of dana drywall.
the instant action for equitable contribution.
on december,monticello filed the instant action against essex,seeking equitable contribution from essex of essex share of all sums paid by monticello to defend blumenfeld in the underlying action.
monticello motion for summary adjudication.
on december,monticello filed a motion for summary judgment summary adjudication.two of the issues as to which monticello sought summary adjudication were essex had a duty to defend blumenfeld in the underlying action and essex had a duty to contribute with monticello towards blumenfeld defense 
monticello contended essex had a duty to defend blumenfeld in the underlying action because the complaint in the underlying action,as well the defect list in that action defect list,contained allegations of consequential damage caused by the drywall work,including damage to the paint,custom interior finishes and stucco of the goldman residence.in other words,the allegedly defective drywall damaged the paint,custom interior finishes and stucco at the residence.thus,there were sufficient allegations that dana drywall work damaged the products or work of others,that dana drywall work caused consequential damage and thus met the essex policy definition of property damage.
essex opposition papers.
in opposition,essex contended monticello had the burden to establish blumenfeld status as an insured under the essex policy.in order to sustain that burden,monticello was required to establish that blumenfeld liability in the underlying action rested on dana drywall negligence,and that the damages sought against blumenfeld for dana drywall negligence were covered under the essex policy.because the cost to repair an insured own defective work is not covered under the essex policy,monticello had the burden to show the damages against blumenfeld for dana drywall negligence related to something other than dana drywall work,damage to other property as a result of dana drywall allegedly defective work.nothing in the complaint alleged such damage.monticello separate statement purported to establish the fact of resultant property damage,by asserting the defectively installed drywall damaged the paint,custom interior finishes and stucco of the goldman residence.notwithstanding those assertions,there was no evidence of resultant property damage.rather,at best,there were references to defectively installed drywall and the work and expense required to remedy that problem.in the absence of any evidence of resultant property damage,monticello was unable to sustain its burden to show blumenfeld was entitled to a defense as an additional insured under the essex policy.
trial court order denying monticello motion for summary adjudication.
after taking the matter under submission,on march,the trial court issued an order denying monticello motion for summary judgment summary adjudication of duty issues,ruling as follows 
monticello has failed to meet its burden because it has failed to show the essex policy provides coverage for the claims against blumenfeld.monticello basically contends that because the duty to defend is greater than the duty to indemnify,then essex has a duty to reimburse.monticello relies on the law that if any potential for coverage exists,the duty to defend is triggered unless the insurer is able to demonstrate the absence of any potential for coverage.citation.the problem with monticello argument is that monticello is not seeking to have essex participate in an ongoing defense.instead,monticello has already provided the insured a defense,and the duty to be determined in the instant case is whether or not essex must reimburse monticello for the costs of an already completed defense.
in buss superior court cal th d,the court held that an insurer,who defends under a reservation of rights,may seek reimbursement from its insured for the defense of claims for which there was no coverage.in the instant case,monticello states that it has decided not to seek reimbursement from its insured,rather,to seek reimbursement from essex.monticello submits no evidence whatsoever as to whether or not essex was required to indemnify because the work performed by dana drywall resulted in property damage other than to the insured own work.instead,monticello argues that 
essex confuses the additional insured endorsement potential limitation on indemnity coverage with its obligation to provide a full and complete defense to blumenfeld.although essex duty to indemnify blumenfeld may have been limited to the negligent act or omissions of dana drywall,essex owed a duty to defend blumenfeld for both covered claims from dana drywall negligence and uncovered claims claims resulting from the independent negligence of blumenfeld in the underlying action.as this action involves only a claim for reimbursement of defense costs,the endorsement potential limitation on indemnity is not relevant.
this is simply an incorrect statement of law.in order for monticello to obtain reimbursement from another insurance company,monticello must establish that the other insurer owed a duty to indemnify.equitable contribution assumes that the competing policy covers the loss at issue,and gives an insurer the right to require those insurers who are obligated to provide coverage to contribute the payment.see,fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th d.in the instant case,monticello is seeking to pass the duty of paying defense costs to essex,without first establishing that essex was ever obligated to cover the injuries alleged in the underlying action.italics added.
d.the stipulated judgment.
monticello disagreed with the trial court ruling,contending that in order to obtain equitable contribution for defense costs,all monticello had to do was to prove the potential for consequential damage arising from dana drywall work.
in order to enable monticello to seek immediate appellate review following the denial of its motion for summary adjudication,monticello and essex entered into a stipulation for judgment,which states in relevant part 
whereas,the court required standard for equitable contribution towards defense fees and costs is a critical,outcome determinative,issue in the action as monticello anticipates that it will not be able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence at trial that dana drywall work actually caused consequential property damage,and i n order to save the time and expense of a trial on both the parties and the court,and to seek immediate appeal of critical issues in this action,monticello and essex stipulated that judgment be entered for essex.
pursuant to the stipulation,the judgment in favor of essex is based solely on the following grounds because the underlying action concluded,monticello must prove that there was actual coverage for liability resulting from dana drywall work b.in order to obtain contribution towards defense fees and costs from essex,monticello is required to prove that the work of dana drywall actually damaged the work of others,it caused consequential damage monticello can not meet its burden of proof that dana drywall work actually caused damage to the work of others,caused consequential damage monticello contention that it need only prove a potential for coverage in order to obtain equitable contribution towards defense fees and costs from essex is incorrect whether essex owed a defense to blumenfeld in the underlying action is not relevant and whether blumenfeld sic monticello owed a defense obligation to blumenfeld in the underlying action is not relevant.
on september,monticello filed a timely notice of appeal from the stipulated judgment entered july.
contentions 
monticello contends the trial court applied the wrong standard in determining whether monticello was entitled to equitable contribution the trial court erroneously ruled that because monticello sought equitable contribution from essex after the underlying action was concluded,rather than while it was pending,monticello was required to prove there was actual coverage for the liability resulting from dana drywall work instead of merely a potential for coverage and monticello was entitled to equitable contribution from essex because essex had a duty to defend blumenfeld in the underlying action.monticello seeks reversal of the order denying its motion for summary adjudication and remand to the trial court to determine the appropriate amount of reimbursement of defense costs from essex to monticello.
discussion 
the stipulated judgment is appealable.
as a preliminary matter,monticello consent to judgment,which was given merely to facilitate an immediate appeal following an adverse determination on a critical issue,does not bar standing to appeal.norgart upjohn cal th,d,norgart covers the point.
in that case,a wrongful death action against a drug manufacturer,because the appellate court decision in squibb superior court th,d appeared to be dispositive,the norgarts and upjohn entered into an agreement,on the norgarts proposal,to resolve the proceedings in the superior court in upjohn favor following the superior court tentative ruling on its summary judgment motion against the operative complaint,in order to hasten review in the court of appeal.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,accord upland police officers city of upland th,d in stipulating to judgment parties agree d that plaintiffs respondents will not raise appealability as an issue.
in norgart,the plaintiffs entered into the stipulation relating to the ruling in question in order to complain thereof before the court of appeal t they were doing more,and nothing less,than endeavoring to make the best of a bad situation for which they were not responsible citation namely,the unfavorable result at trial that would have been compelled by squibb.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.thus,in norgart,the plaintiffs stipulated to judgment in order to proceed with the appeal because,given the state of the law,it would have been an idle act by the plaintiffs to proceed to trial.
similarly,in this case,it would have been an idle act by monticello to proceed to trial following the denial of its motion for summary adjudication,because monticello anticipate d that it would not be able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence at trial that dana drywall work actually caused consequential property damage therefore,the parties properly stipulated to judgment in order to obtain immediate appellate review of the trial court critical and outcome determinative ruling relating to the standard for equitable contribution toward defense fees and costs.
accordingly,monticello consent to judgment is no impediment to the appeal.
standard of appellate review.
the parties disagree as to the standard of appellate review.
monticello contends denial of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is subject to de novo review,and that review of the judgment herein presents a question of law,involving the application of equitable contribution principles to stipulated facts.
essex asserts that because the appeal is from a final judgment,this court review is pursuant to the substantial evidence standard.according to essex,the issue is whether monticello satisfied its burden of proof to establish blumenfeld status as an additional insured under the essex policy,a burden that could only be met by evidence that blumenfeld was being held liable for the negligent work of dana drywall and that the damages being sought were covered damages under the essex policy.the trial court held there were insufficient facts to satisfy that burden,and essex asserts this court is required to give due deference to that finding by the trial court.
essex position is meritless because this appeal is not from a judgment after trial.rather,the matter concluded below in a stipulated judgment following the denial of monticello motion for summary adjudication.therefore the substantial evidence test plays no part in this appeal.
the issue before this court is the legal standard for equitable contribution and whether,on the facts presented,the trial court properly denied monticello motion for summary judgment summary adjudication on the issue of monticello entitlement to equitable contribution.our review is de novo.as stated in certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d,an order denying summary adjudication is subject to independent review because i t resolves a pure question of law citation,namely,whether there is any triable issue as to any material fact and,if not,whether the moving party is entitled to adjudication in his favor as a matter of law citation.
thus,after examining the facts before the trial judge on a summary judgment motion,we independently determine their effect as a matter of law.citations.t he trial court stated reasons for its ruling do not bind us.we review the ruling,not its rationale.citation.california aviation,leeds d.
we now turn to the merits of the appeal.
general principles 
equitable contribution toward defense costs.
equitable contribution is the right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when s
