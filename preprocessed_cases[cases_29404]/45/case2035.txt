on november,three couples for whom advantage had built homes sued advantage in the district court of johnson county,kansas,seeking compensatory damages for windows on each of their homes that were allegedly damaged by advantage.the homeowners alleged claims for negligence,breach of,and violations of the kansas consumer protection act.after learning of the homeowners suit,advantage submitted a claim of loss to maryland under the policy.maryland refused to provide advantage with a defense,and likewise denied coverage,based upon exclusions contained within the policy.
the homeowners suit proceeded to trial and the state district court determined that the damage to the windows was caused by mcgarrah masonry mcgarrah,a subcontractor hired by advantage.the state district court entered judgment in the homeowners favor and against advantage in the amount of on the claims of negligence and breach of.with respect to the homeowners claims under the kansas consumer protection act,the state district court entered judgment in favor of advantage.the state district court also entered judgment in favor of advantage on its for indemnification against mcgarrah.mcgarrah subsequently paid this judgment in full.
advantage filed this action against maryland for declaratory judgment on august,in the district court of johnson county,kansas.maryland removed the action to federal district court based upon diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy.advantage subsequently amended its complaint and moved for judgment on the pleadings.maryland filed its own motion for judgment on the pleadings or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.the district court conducted a telephonic hearing during which the parties agreed that the stipulated facts contained in the pretrial order constituted the entire body of evidence that would be presented if the case were to proceed to trial.on april,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting maryland motion for judgment on the pleadings and denying advantage similar motion as moot.judgment was entered in favor of maryland on that same date.advantage subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings.park,american cas,cir.judgment on the pleadings should not be granted unless the moving party has clearly established that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
because this is a diversity action,we apply the substantive law of the forum state,including its choice of law rules.bottling of pittsburg,pepsico,cir.kansas is the forum state in this appeal.under kansas rules,an insurance contract is governed by the law of the state where the contract was entered into.fidelity and guar.federated rural ins,cir citing safeco ins.of am.allen.although the record on appeal does not indicate where the insurance contract at issue was entered into,the parties agree that kansas law controls and thus,presumably,the contract was entered into in kansas.as mcgarrah has paid the underlying state court judgment,the only issue remaining is whether maryland had a duty to defend advantage.
under kansas law,insurers have a duty to defend if there is a potential for liability under the policy at issue.south central kansas health ins.group harden.ins.more specifically,an insurer has a duty to defend if,based on the pleadings and any facts brought to the insurer attention or reasonably discoverable during the insurance investigation,there is a potential for liability.id.at citing spruill motors.underwriters ins.when there is no coverage under the insurance policy at issue,there is no duty to defend.id.at.in applying these principles,the result is that t he duty to defend and whether the policy provides coverage are not necessarily coextensive.spivey safeco ins.that is,because the duty to defend hinges on the potential for liability,rather than actual liability,an insurer may have a duty to defend even if it is ultimately determined that the policy does not provide coverage.
where,as here,an insured files suit against its insurer seeking coverage under a policy of insurance,the insured has the burden of proving he or she falls within the coverage provisions of the policy.brumley lee.more specifically,the insured has the burden of proof to establish the nature and extent of any loss and that the loss claimed was caused by one of the perils insured against covered by the policy.kansas farm bureau ins.reynolds,d,internal quotation marks omitted.assuming the insured can satisfy this burden,the insurer then has the burden of proving that any exclusionary clauses within the policy apply to preclude coverage.exploration place,midwest drywall.
did the district court err in concluding that advantage failed to meet its initial burden of showing that coverage existed under the policy at issue 
in its first issue on appeal,advantage contends the district court erred in concluding that advantage failed to meet its burden of showing a possibility of coverage under the policy.according to advantage,it fully briefed the reasons why the damages claimed in the underlying action fell within the general provisions of the insurance policy and maryland waived this argument by not responding aplt.br.at.in particular,advantage contends that a the parties stipulated that the submission of th e claim was timely,b the property damage alleged to have occurred was caused by an occurrence which took place in the coverage territory during the applicable policy period,and c maryland never refuted the veracity of any of these elements id.at.thus,advantage asserts,it necessarily satisfied its burden of establishing the possibility of coverage.
we reject advantage arguments for two reasons.first,it is far from clear that the district court intended to conclude that advantage failed to satisfy its initial burden of establishing that the claims asserted against it in the underlying action fell within the coverage provisions of the policy.rather,it appears that the district court order focused on the ultimate question of whether,taking into account the policy exclusionary provisions,advantage was entitled to coverage under the policy.second,even assuming the district court did err in concluding that advantage failed to satisfy its initial burden,that error is harmless because we apply a de novo standard of review in determining whether maryland was entitled to judgment in its favor.
did the district court err in concluding that the claims asserted in the underlying action fell within the scope of policy exclusions 
advantage next contends the district court erred in concluding that the claims asserted in the underlying action fell within the scope of policy exclusions.more specifically,advantage contends the district court failed to recognize that maryland possessed the burden of proving that an exception to coverage applied,and instead placed the burden on advantage to prove that an exception to coverage did not apply.aplt.br.at.advantage further contends that,in any event,it is clear that the two exclusions cited by the district court do not apply to exclude coverage and can not justify maryland refusal to defend advantage id.at.
advantage first argument is easily disposed of.a review of the record on appeal clearly establishes that the district court did not shift the burden to advantage to prove the inapplicability of the two policy exclusions cited by the district court.moreover,the argument is immaterial because,as we have noted,we apply a de novo standard of review in determining whether maryland was entitled to judgment in its favor.
that leaves advantage second argument,that the two policy exclusions cited by the district court were inapplicable.in assessing the applicability of the policy exclusions asserted by maryland and relied upon by the district court,we begin by reviewing the factual allegations asserted in the underlying lawsuit.according to the complaint in the underlying lawsuit,each of the three plaintiff couples contracted with advantage for the construction and purchase of new home s id.at.the complaint further alleged that,after the homes were completed by advantage and the couples moved in,the couples each discovered extensive damage to the windows of their homes.id.at.count i of the complaint,which asserted claims for negligence,alleged that advantage owed the plaintiffs a duty to install all window units in the home s in a professional,workmanlike manner and without any material defects or damage to any of the windows,but breached those duties by providing homes to plaintiffs with significant damage to the window units.id.at.count ii of the complaint,which asserted claims for breach of,alleged that advantage breached its contracts with plaintiffs by failing to construct their homes in a professional and workmanlike manner and without any material defects.id.at.count iii of the complaint,which asserted claims under the kansas consumer protection act,alleged that advantage fail ed to disclose material defects in plaintiffs homes id.at.
maryland contends,and the district court agreed,that two exclusionary provisions of the policy applied to preclude coverage and,in turn,any duty to defend.these two provisions,hereinafter referred to as j and j,provide as follows 
exclusions.
this insurance does not apply to 
damage to property 
property damage to 
that particular part of real property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations,if the property damage arises out of those operations or 
that particular part of any property that must be restored,repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on it.
paragraph of this exclusion does not apply to property damage included in the operations hazard.
exclusion j 
the district court interpreted exclusion j as applying to any property damage that occurred while the work on the house was ongoing.armed with that interpretation,the district court concluded that the key question was whether mcgarrah masonry was performing its work when the damage occurred.id.at.after reviewing the record,the district court concluded that the property damage occurred concurrently with the negligent acts of the advantage windows were scratched when the subcontractor dropped mortar on them,and there was no dispute that the work was in progress when the subcontractor damaged the windows.id.thus,the district court concluded that exclusion j applied and maryland had no duty to indemnify advantage for the damages assessed against it in the underlying suit.id.
advantage disputes the district court conclusions.as it did below,advantage argues that exclusion j must be interpreted to apply only at the time an actual claim arises,and not merely at the time damage occurs,during the performance of the insured work.accordingly,advantage argues,exclusion j is inapplicable here because there is no reasonable dispute that no one was performing operations at the time that the claims of the underlying lawsuit arose.aplt.br.at.
we reject advantage interpretation of exclusion j.the language of exclusion j unambiguously focuses on when the property damage at issue occurs,not,as suggested by advantage,when a legal claim accrues against the insured.more specifically,the language of exclusion j refers to property damage defined under the policy as physical injury to,or loss of use of,tangible property occurring to real property during the course of the insured work.see emy poulad grotell,understanding the basics of commercial general liability policies,practising law institute,litigation and administrative practice course handbook series,noting that s ome commentators indicate that the exclusion only applies to the extent that the damage occurred while the insured was performing and to the extent that the damage occurred after the operations have ceased the exclusion would not apply.no mention whatsoever is made in the policy in question of a claim accruing against the insured during the performance of the work.
we likewise reject the principal case relied upon by advantage in support of its interpretation,american states insurance company powers,d.in american states,a commercial general liability insurer,american states,filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend its insured,garold powers,against a lawsuit filed against him alleging that he breached a contract and was ne
