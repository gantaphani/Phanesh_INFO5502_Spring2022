the issue in this case is whether a health care provider has a right to seek reimbursement directly from the health care insurer for services rendered to enrollees of the health care plan.its resolution depends in part on whether,under the health care service plan act of health,et,knox kleene act an insurer has a direct obligation to reimburse the provider.in the published portion of this opinion we conclude that the act does not apply to the factual circumstances here,and does not bar the provider from seeking direct compensation on a common law breach of contract theory or under the unfair competition law bus.
in the unpublished portion of the opinion we conclude the trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer as to the cause of action for breach of contract by assignment,but correctly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend to the causes of action for breach of implied contract,breach of contract based on third party beneficiary theory,open book account,quantum meruit,and unjust enrichment.because we conclude that the act does not apply to this case,we do not address the provider argument about the constitutional application of that statute.
factual and procedural summary 
this appeal is from an order of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend.on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.citation.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.
we take our factual summary from the allegations of the complaint.coast plaza doctors hospital coast is a health care facility and provider,offering emergency and other care to the general public.coast provided emergency and other services to patients patients who were insured under health insurance policies issued by uhp healthcare uhp when patients were admitted to coast for medical care,they executed an assignment to coast of their rights to reimbursement by uhp.coast attached an exhibit to the complaint detailing the names of the patients,the dates of treatment and the cost of treatment.
uhp was obligated under its policies to pay for the reasonable and necessary health care expenses incurred by patients.coast alleged that uhp knew that patients living in the norwalk area were likely to seek treatment from its facility in that region.coast alleged that uhp understood that health care facilities and hospitals would provide medical care to patients in reliance on the insurance contract between patients and uhp.it also alleged that i n consideration for coast implied agreement to treat the patients,defendants implicitly agreed to reimburse coast for the reasonable expenses incurred by the patients in the course of such treatment.according to the allegations of the complaint,coast and uhp acted consistently with this implied agreement.coast claims entitlement to reimbursement for for treatment it provided to patients.
coast sued uhp,alleging causes of action for breach of contract under health and safety code section all statutory references are to that code unless otherwise indicated breach of contract based as a third party beneficiary breach of contract based on assignment,open book account quantum meruit violation of business and professions code section unjust enrichment and violation of section.
the complaint does not allege that coast had any agreements with physician groups,capitation contracts or other service agreements with any health maintenance organization or intermediary organizations such as large medical groups,independent physician organizations or limited license plans.while coast does not specifically deny entering into such agreements with uhp,both sides treat the matter on the assumption that it did not.that is consistent with the complaint,and we shall review the issues on that assumption.
uhp demurred on the ground that coast lacked standing to pursue any of the claims.uhp also maintained that it had no responsibility to coast for the services provided to patients.it denied an implied agreement to pay for the medical services provided by coast that coast was an intended third party beneficiary under its contracts with patients and that coast was an assignee of the rights of the patients.it contended there were no facts alleged to establish that uhp had been unjustly enriched or that it had engaged in any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice in violation of business and professions code section.finally,it argued that there is no separate,cognizable claim for a violation of section as claimed in the eighth cause of action.
in support of its demurrer,uhp asked the court to take judicial notice of extensive materials,including a november petition to the commissioner of the department of corporations to adopt a regulation,a department of corporations decision in december declining to do so,and trial court minute orders in cases brought in the superior courts in san diego,riverside and orange counties.we also are asked to judicially notice the first amended complaint in the orange county litigation.
coast opposed the demurrer,challenging the propriety of uhp reliance on the matters contained in the request for judicial notice.it also argued that its claims were supported by section and that it had standing to bring them.coast argued that it had sufficiently pled each cause of action and requested leave to amend if the demurrer was sustained,and requested the court to take judicial notice of the department of managed health care report of nonroutine examination,file,dated august.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.it found that the gravamen of the plaintiff complaint seeks to enforce the provisions of the act.the legislature has vested jurisdiction over such enforcement exclusively in the department of corporations and,therefore,leave to amend is denied and this action is dismissed.
the complaint was dismissed and coast filed a notice of appeal from the order of dismissal.there is no indication that a judgment of dismissal was entered.the order sustaining the demurrer is not itself appealable.ross creel printing publishing th,fn,d.we agree with the observation of the court in smith hopland band of pomo indians th,footnote,d to the effect that it fails to understand why the clearly established law on this point continues to be disregarded,in the interest of judicial economy,we shall deem the order to incorporate a judgment of dismissal.nevertheless,we follow common practice in deeming the appeal to be from a judgment.
discussion 
coast sixth cause of action is for violation of business and professions code section,the unfair competition law ucl it alleges that uhp violated this statute by a failing to pay,underpaying,or delaying payment to coast in violation of section and other statutes b attempting to transfer patients at coast to other hospitals in violation of united states code section and c attempting to transfer the patients at coast to other hospitals because coast insisted that it honor its obligations under section et.we assume,as we must at the demurrer stage,that coast has alleged conduct that could be unlawful,unfair or fraudulent.congress of cal.seniors catholic healthcare west th,d.
section of the ucl defines unfair competition to mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by section.the california supreme court confirmed that the test for determining a violation of the unfair competition law is a disjunctive one namely,a plaintiff may show that the acts or practices at issue are either unlawful or unfair or deceptive.walker countrywide home loans,supra,th at,d,citing communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
uhp argues that to the extent coast bases its unfair competition claim on a violation of section,it fails because that statute does not obligate uhp to pay for the services at issue.
uph took the position in the trial court and in its briefing here that the act applies and precludes coast from obtaining reimbursement from uph.coast argues that this body of law does not apply here because this case does not involve a contract between uph and an intermediary or a contract between coast and an intermediary.we begin our analysis with an examination of the regulatory scheme.
the act is a comprehensive system of licensing and regulation van de kamp gumbiner d,formerly under the jurisdiction of the department of corporations doc and presently within the jurisdiction of the department of managed health care dmhc citation.all aspects of the regulation of health plans are covered,including financial stability,organization,advertising and capability to provide health services.van de kamp,at.california medical aetna healthcare of california,supra,th,fn,d.
section provides that a health care service plan is to reimburse uncontested claims no later than working days after receipt,unless it is a health maintenance organization,in which case it has days to pay.it also provides the obligation of the plan to comply with this section shall not be deemed to be waived when the plan requires its medical groups,independent practice associations,or other contracting entities to pay claims for covered services.this clause has been referred to in the regulatory and case law as the nonwaiver clause.
uhp relies on extensive extrinsic evidence presented to the trial court in its request for judicial notice,and two cases interpreting section decided shortly after coast filed its notice of appeal.all of this material relates to whether a provider who has a contract with an intermediary agency is entitled to compensation directly from a health care plan insurer.the material we are asked to judicially notice is irrelevant to the issue before us because all of it is based on contractual relationships between a health care insurer,an intermediary,and a provider because there is no allegation of such an arrangement in this case,we must assume that there was none.as we have noted,that is the position taken by both parties in their briefing.
uhp cites aetna,supra,th,d.in that case,the plaintiff,california medical association,cma,was the assignee of claims owned by physicians and medical groups.cma sued two health care insurers for payments allegedly owed to physicians for services provided to enrollees in health care service plans operated by defendants.the decision explains the typical contractual relationships under which patient care is provided and reimbursed under the act.
the defendant insurers entered into defendant enrollee agreements with their enrollees that imposed obligations upon defendants to pay for services rendered by physicians to enrollees.they also entered into agreements with various contracting entities including large medical groups,independent practice associations and limited license plans.under those agreements,defendants paid their agent intermediaries to perform specific tasks on behalf of defendants,including signing up panels of primary care and specialty physicians,processing claims and making payments to physicians.the intermediaries then entered into agreements with physicians to provide health services to defendants enrollees.to participate in the managed care plans offered by the defendants,physicians were required to enter into agreements or otherwise be accepted into panels of providers established by the intermediaries.once care was provided to an enrollee,the physician submitted a claim to defendants through the intermediaries.according to the cma,the agreements required the providers to look solely to intermediaries for payment for the services the provided to enrollees by the physicians.aetna,supra,th at,d.
but due to insolvency,many intermediaries failed to pay physicians for these services.defendants maintained their contractual relationship with these insolvent intermediaries,despite knowledge of their financial instability and continued to make payments to them.defendants denied repeated demands for direct payment by the physicians,while still collecting premiums from their enrollees.aetna,supra,th at,d.
in aetna,cma argued that section imposed an obligation on the insurer to pay for all covered medical services rendered by physicians to defendants enrollees even when defendants purported to delegate such obligation to intermediaries.it further alleged that the defendants failed to make these payments within the time frames specified in section,and that any contractual provision purporting to waive these requirements or other portions of the statute was unlawful.aetna,supra,th at,d.
cma asserted that the defendants were obligated to the physicians under the nonwaiver clause we have quoted,despite language in the intermediary agreements imposing the ultimate responsibility to pay the physician claims on the intermediaries.the aetna court held that the statutory nonwaiver clause simply means that section time limits and other procedural requirements must be satisfied even when health plans have delegated their payment obligations to contracting entities under agreements consistent with other provisions.ibid.
the court also examined the legislative history of section and found nothing indicating that section was intended to impose an obligation on health plans to pay treating physicians where the plans had no contractual obligation to do so.aetna,supra,th at,d.based on this history,the court concluded that the nonwaiver clause was intended simply to require contracting entities such as intermediaries to make timely compliance with the statute procedures for handling claims cma failed to identify anything in the legislative history indicating that section statutory nonwaiver clause was intended to require health plans to pay treating physicians absent a contractual obligation to do so.ibid.
the aetna court also noted that department of corporations had denied a request by the california medical association that it issue a regulation to make health plans the primary obligors for payments of claims notwithstanding contractual provisions to the contrary.aetna,supra,th at,d.
the analysis in desert healthcare dist.pacificare,fhp,th,d desert healthcare was similar.in that case,a hospital sued a health care service plan for the cost of services provided to enrollees of the plan.the insurer,pacificare,had contracted with an intermediary,desert physician association dpa.this was a capitation agreement for which pacificare paid a flat fee per person to dpa to provide physicians and obtain hospital services for pacificare subscribers.the intermediary,dpa,contracted with a provider,desert healthcare,to obtain hospital services for pacificare subscribers.under this arrangement,desert healthcare billed dpa rather than pacificare for the services it provided to pacificare subscribers.dpa filed for bankruptcy,extinguishing its debt to desert healthcare for millions of dollars.desert healthcare sued pacificare to recover payment for the services it rendered to pacificare subscribers under the contract with dpa.
the court rejected desert healthcare argument that the nonwaiver clause of section of the act required pacificare to bear the ultimate responsibility for the services provided despite its capitation agreement with dpa.desert healthcare,supra,th at,d.like the aetna court,it held that whether read in isolation or as a part of the whole statute,the nonwaiver clause did not impose an obligation on the insurer to pay the provider directly.id.at,d.it merely imposes certain procedural requirements on the processing of claims it does not cre
