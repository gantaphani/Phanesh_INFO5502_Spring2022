plaintiff jennifer durand appeals the district court dismissal of her complaint filed under the employee retirement income security act of,et.erisa.the district court held that durand had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.we conclude that exhaustion of those remedies would have been futile,and reverse.
durand complaint challenges the legality of defendants methodology for calculating distributions pursuant to their pension plan.under a defined benefit plan,an employee benefit is an amount,either in the form of an annuity or a payment,equal to a specified percentage of the employee salary in the final years of his or her employment.west ak steel,cir.
the plan at issue allmerica financial cash balance pension plan the allmerica plan or plan belongs to a subset of plans,known as plans.see erisa.a plan creates an account for each participant,but the account is hypothetical and created only for recordkeeping purposes.ak steel,at.the hypothetical account on paper looks much like a traditional k account.id.each participant account is funded by hypothetical allocations,called pay credits,and hypothetical earnings,called interest credits,that are determined under a formula selected by the employer and set forth in the plan.notice.
this case is about interest credits.interest credits may be fixed or variable.ak steel,at.of importance here,e ven if the employee ceases working for the plan sponsor,interest credits continue to accrue to the employee hypothetical account until he or she begins receiving pension benefits.when an employee reaches the normal retirement age of,the pension benefit is the value of this hypothetical account balance.id.that value is known as the normal accrued benefit.erisa a,a.
an employee who leaves the plan sponsor can usually choose whether the benefit is distributed in the form of a annuity,pursuant to which payments begin when the departing employee reaches retirement age,or a distribution,made at the time of the employee departure.ak steel,at.a departing employee can not be penalized for choosing the distribution thus,t o comply with erisa,payments such as the one received by the plaintiff in the present case must be the actuarial equivalent of the normal accrued pension benefit.id.at emphasis added.
for distributions made prior to,determining this actuarial equivalent required a whipsaw calculation first,the participant account balance was projected forward to its value at the participant normal retirement age,using the rate at which future interest credits would have accrued had the participant remained in the plan.id.emphasis added.second,that projected amount was discounted back to its present value on the date of the actual distribution.id.
critically for our purposes here,the projection forward must have include d a fair estimate of what the participant future interest credits actually would have been had she retained a annuity under the plan.id.at quoting berger xerox.ret.income guar.plan,cir emphasis added.the fair estimate is critical because,if the participant future interest rate exceeds the discount rate,the participant distribution will be greater than her hypothetical account balance at the time of the distribution.ak steel,at.
that fair estimate is precisely what durand contends the plan methodology did not include.under the plan,participants selected investment options from a k style menu.the market rate of return on the options selected determined the participant interest credits and those credits thus varied among participants.
but the plan did not attempt to make individualized estimates of departing participants future interest credits.instead,the plan used a uniform projection treasury bill performing every such participant whipsaw calculation.the plan then used that same rate to discount the projected balances back to their present values.the result in every case was a wash as in ak steel,the payout would always equal the participant hypothetical account balance at the time of distribution.id.at.
this aspect of the plan did not pass unnoticed.in march,the department of labor examined the calculation methodologies of several plans,and specifically concluded that,given the variable nature of interest credits under the allmerica plan,the plan use of a uniform projection rate violated erisa.see complaint.in response,the plan issued a press release stating that w e are very confident that we have been calculating benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.see id.ex.meanwhile,during the years,three circuit second,seventh,and that a departing participant future interest credits must be included in determining the amount of any distribution for the participant.see ak steel,at discussing cases.no circuit court has ever held the contrary.at no time relevant to durand claim,however,did the plan or its administrators depart from the plan stated methodology for calculating distributions.
jennifer durand worked for the first allmerica financial life insurance company the company,a subsidiary of defendant the hanover insurance group,hanover,from october to april.when durand left the company at age,she elected to take her pension benefit in the form of a distribution.her hypothetical account balance on the date of her distribution was.pursuant to the plan terms,its administrators projected her balance forward using the treasury bill rate,and then discounted the projected amount back to its present value using that same rate.the calculation was thus a wash and,in august,the allmerica plan paid durand.
on march,durand filed a putative complaint against hanover and the allmerica plan,alleging that the plan methodology for calculating distributions violated erisa.defendants moved to dismiss on exhaustion grounds,arguing that durand should have first presented her claim to the plan administrators.the district court agreed,and granted the motion.
this appeal followed.
we review the district court application of the requirement in an erisa case for abuse of discretion.fallick nationwide mut.ins,cir.however,a court is obliged to exercise its discretion to excuse nonexhaustion where resorting to the plan administrative procedure would simply be futile or the remedy inadequate.id.at.
we routinely enforce the exhaustion requirement when an erisa plaintiff contends that his benefits were improperly calculated under the terms of a plan.see,weiner klais and,cir.erisa plans are often complicated things,and the question whether a plan methodology was properly applied in a particular case is usually one best left to the plan administrator in the first instance.administrators,not courts,are the experts in plan administration.
but the same is not true of an challenge to the legality of a plan methodology.in those cases,the claimant typically concedes that her benefit was properly calculated under the terms of the plan as written,but argues that the plan itself is illegal in some respect.see,ak steel,at.and that one within the expertise of the courts.sending such a claimant back to the administrative process,to recalculate a benefit she concedes was already properly calculated under the terms of the plan as written,misses the point of the dispute.in that situation,exhaustion wastes resources rather than conserves them.consequently,we have held that,in an erisa case,when the plaintiff suit i s directed to the legality of a plan,not to a mere interpretation of it,exhaustion of the plan administrative remedies would be futile.costantino trw,cir emphasis in original.
this case is governed by that simple rule.durand has no quarrel with allmerica calculation of her distribution under the terms of the plan as written instead,her claim is that the plan methodology for calculating such distributions is illegal.see complaint the plan violates erisa in the way it calculates lump sum distributions emphasis added.her claim is thus directed to the plan legality and forcing her to resort to her administrative remedies,rather than her legal ones,would be futile.
we do recognize that,in the somewhat different context of judicial review of action,exhaustion is not excused mere
