background 
the district court presented a thorough factual and procedural background,and we only briefly summarize the relevant facts here.see clark ii,d at.on july,clark was a pedestrian at an intersection in pueblo,colorado,when a vehicle driven by monica madrid struck him.the driver grandmother,hortencia madrid,owned the vehicle and insured it with state farm basic level of pip coverage.according to the madrid policy schedule,coverage provides payments for medical expenses up to payments for rehabilitation expenses up to payments for loss of income up to a weekly rate of,for weeks payments for essential services up to a daily rate of,for days and death compensation up to.see b i,c i,d i aplt app.vol.ii,doc,at.essential services include reasonable expenses incurred during the insured lifetime for ordinary and needed services the insured would have performed without pay but for bodily injury.aplt app.vol.ii,doc,at emphasis omitted.
under the madrid policy,clark received pip payments for in medical expenses,in essential services,and for weeks of benefits.after timely paying benefits for one year,state farm discontinued those payments pursuant to coverage limits.only clark benefits are at issue on appeal.he remains unable to work in any capacity and now seeks benefits for an indefinite period of time.
the madrid policy contains a distended pedestrian limitation that limits pip benefits to the lowest level,for pedestrians 
the most we pay for each insured who sustains bodily injury and the period of time from the date of the accident in which the services must be furnished or the loss of income incurred shall not exceed 
the amount and period of time shown in the schedule applicable to each benefit under coverage symbol if the insured is a pedestrian.this does not apply to you,your spouse,or any relative.
the amount and period of time shown in the schedule applicable to each benefit under your coverage symbol for any other insured.
id.at emphasis in original.
hortencia madrid son,roger,first purchased automobile liability insurance from state farm in and chose extended pip benefits coverage at the level.see id.at detailing the higher allowance for medical expenses and a higher death compensation under coverage.the next year,he reduced coverage from to,basic coverage at the lowest level.madrid purchased a second policy in,also at the level.in,the madrids changed the named insured on their insurance policy to hortencia madrid,with monica madrid as the primary driver.at that time,state farm did not offer hortencia madrid the option to purchase extended pip benefits that included extended pedestrian coverage.
colorado auto accident reparation act 
in,the colorado legislature passed the colorado auto accident reparations act.in clark i,we discussed the relevant statutory framework of caara 
the stated statutory purpose of caara is to avoid inadequate compensation to victims of automobile accidents.colorado courts construe caara liberally to further its remedial and beneficial purposes.caara requires that a policy include a minimum level of pip benefits.specifically,sub section requires a carrier to provide,without regard to fault,payments for medical expenses,rehabilitation expenses,and lost wages.section sets dollar and time limits for each category of expense.section defines the categories of people who receive coverage under section to include the named insured,resident relatives of the named insured,passengers occupying the insured vehicle with the consent of the insured,and pedestrians who are injured by the covered vehicle.brennan,at.caara also requires every insurer to offer the named insured extended pip benefits in exchange for higher premiums.these extended pip benefits do not place time or dollar limitations on medical expense claims and offer the possibility of greater wage loss reimbursements the version of section effective at the time of clark accident,which applie s to policies issued on or after july,does not list or refer to persons eligible for extended coverage.moreover,section,which sets out the four categories of pip benefits recipients,refers only to the minimum pip benefits available under section and does not reference the enhanced benefits set out in section.
at footnote and internal citations omitted.
brennan farmers alliance mutual insurance.
subsequent to caara passage,the colorado court of appeals decided brennan.in clark i,we summarized the relevant holding of brennan 
approximately nineteen months after clark accident,the colorado court of appeals decided brennan,at.in brennan,a pedestrian injured in a car accident sued farmers alliance,seeking enhanced pip benefits under section.farmers alliance did not offer extended pip benefits to cover pedestrians.the trial court reformed the policy to incorporate the extended benefits.
in agreeing with the trial court,the colorado court of appeals explained that although section a does not specify the persons entitled to extended benefits,caara statutory scheme indicated that section describes an option to purchase coverage,but at higher limits,for the same persons and under the same conditions applicable to mandatory basic pip coverage outlined in section.id.at.the court also relied on the fact that section covers injured person s and not merely insured s,which suggests that section covered pedestrians.see id.at.because farmers alliance did not offer extended pip benefits to cover pedestrians in conformity with caara,the court read the additional coverage into the policy and affirmed the reformation of the policy.the court also affirmed the trial court judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the difference between the minimum pip benefit levels and the maximum pip aggregate amount provided under the policy.
the colorado court of appeals proceeded,however,to affirm the dismissal of the plaintiffs breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,fraudulent misrepresentation,and willful and wanton breach of contract claims.in addressing the breach of contract claim,the brennan court concluded that until the contract was reformed,there was no policy in existence which granted plaintiffs rights for additional pip benefits.id.at.
clark i,at internal citations omitted.
in august,clark brought a suit in federal district court on behalf of all injured persons,covered under a state farm policy,who were not paid extended benefits under caara.he maintained that reformation of the madrid policy should include extended pip benefits under section.clark brought additional claims for breach of contract for failure to pay extended pip benefits,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,willful and wanton breach of contract,and deceptive trade practices.the district court reasoned that brennan could not be applied retroactively and granted state farm motion to dismiss all claims.
on appeal,this court reversed,concluding that the district court erred in its interpretation of brennan.id.at.we applied the state retroactivity standards to conclude that the colorado court of appeals did not announce a new principle of law b ecause brennan involved the interpretation of a statute enacted prior to the time the madrid policy was issued.id.at.on remand,we ordered the district court to determine,through the exercise of its equitable powers,the effective date of reformation and the amount of extended pip benefits,if any,to which clark is entitled.id.at.finally,we affirmed the dismissal of clark claim of deceptive trade practice and recognized that the remaining contract,tort,and statutory claims would remain viable only if the district court effective date of reformation preceded its order of reformation.
on remand,the district court held that the effective date of reformation of the madrid policy was the date on which the order was entered,december,clark was entitled to the level of extended pip benefits the madrid policy is subject to a aggregate limit in benefits coverage and clark remaining claims of breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and willful and wanton breach of contract were not viable in light of the effective date of reformation.clark ii,d at.on february,we denied state farm motion to certify a question of law,regarding reformation of the madrid policy,to the colorado supreme court.
on appeal,state farm and clark present four issues.state farm argues that the district court erred when it reformed the madrid policy to provide clark with benefits.clark contends that the district court erred when it applied a aggregate cap to the madrid policy selected the date of the district court order as the policy effective reformation date and reformed the madrid policy to include only pedestrians and not all eligible insured persons under coverage.we affirm the district court order.
ii.discussion 
we first address the standard of review for challenges to the terms of the madrid policy reformation and then proceed to the merits of each claim.
standard of review 
we review the district court exercise of its equitable powers for abuse of discretion.davoll webb,cir.equitable remedies include contract reformation.clark i,at.a district court abuses its discretion where it commits a legal error or relies on clearly erroneous factual findings,or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for its ruling.davis mineta,cir internal citation omitted.we examine the district court underlying factual findings for clear error,and its legal determinations de novo.id.italics omitted.
this court applies the substantive law of the forum state when,as here,we exercise diversity jurisdiction.see blanke alexander,cir.the parties agree that colorado law governs our interpretation of the insurance policies,and we apply the most recent statement of state law by the colorado supreme court.see wood eli lilly,cir.furthermore,decisions of a state intermediate appellate courts are some evidence of how the state supreme court would decide the issue,and we can consider them as such,even if they are not the binding precedent under state law.fransen conoco,cir.
reformation to provide extended pip benefits at the level 
the district court concluded that in light of our decision in clark i,clark was entitled to extended pip benefits beginning on the day of reformation.d at.it determined that the appropriate remedy is to include coverage that should have been offered and later specified that reformation should include extended pip benefits under coverage.id.at.this level of coverage provides payments up to an aggregate limit of.id.at.
state farm now contends that the district court erred in its reading of clark i.the insurer argues that the proper reformation remedy is simply to strike the pedestrian limitation from the madrid policy and permit clark to receive the same level of coverage,that the madrids purchased for themselves.
generally,the purpose of reformation of an insurance contract is to make the policy express the true intent of the parties.however,when a policy is violative of a statute,reformation is also required to assure that coverage will meet the statutory minimums.thompson budget.the colorado court of appeals held in brennan that when an insurer fails to offer the insured optional coverage that satisfied caara,additional coverage in conformity with the offer mandated by statute will be incorporated into the policy.at.we stated in clark i that under brennan,clark is entitled as a matter of law to reformation of the madrid policy to include extended pip benefits.at.
the district court decision comports with our decision in clark i and the colorado law regarding reformation of insurance policies.the district court noted that it is undisputed that state farm did not offer madrid the option of purchasing extended pip benefits which included extended coverage for pedestrians.clark ii,d at.as in brennan,the insurer here offered extended coverage that excluded pedestrians.see clark i,at before hortencia madrid purchased the policy,state farm offered her extended pip benefits for herself,her resident relatives,and passengers in her insured vehicle with her consent,but not for pedestrians.emphasis added.brennan clearly held that the type of policy offered to madrid does not satisfy subsection a of caara.see at.
further,as the district court noted,brennan and thompson reformed those insurance policies to include extended pedestrian coverage that insurers should have offered under section.when an insurance policy is reformed to conform to a statutory minimum,such term is deemed to be incorporated by reference into the policy.brennan,at see also thompson,at incorporating unlimited pip benefits because the insurer failed to offer supplemental pedestrian coverage to the driver.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it reformed the madrid policy to provide clark with extended pip benefits under the level of coverage.
application of a aggregate cap 
the district court referenced state farm policy coverage chart and found that,like the policy in brennan,the madrid policy includes a limit.clark ii,d at.the district court further determined that applying the aggregate cap is consistent with the admonition that a reformed insurance policy express the parties true intent.id.at.clark now argues that the district court erred in applying the limit.
subsection b of caara states that a complying policy may include a aggregate limit for all benefits set forth in subsections b to e on account of injury to or death of any one person from a vehicle accident.the policy in brennan included an endorsement specifically providing an aggregate limit for medical expenses,rehabilitation expenses,work loss,essential services,and death compensation.at.the colorado court of appeals in brennan relied on the policy plain terms and imposed a limit on total pip benefits payable.id.thompson makes clear,however,that when an insurer does not include an aggregate cap in the policy agreement,the insurer can not take advantage of the possible cap.at.
the parties agree that the madrid policy declarations page indicates selection of coverage.aplt app.vol.ii,doc,at.clark disputes application of the aggregate cap to coverage and contends that such a cap applies only to coverage options that the madrids did not select.he further maintains that state farm expressly chose not to include an aggregate cap for coverage even though it easily could have.according to state farm,it would be meaningless to note such an explicit limit to coverage because benefits can never exceed.state farm maintains that the madrid policy evidences an inte
