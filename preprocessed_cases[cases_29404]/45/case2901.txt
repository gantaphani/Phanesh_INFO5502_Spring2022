factual and procedural background 
on april,plaintiff filed his complaint in this matter alleging a single cause of action against state farm in which he sought injunctive,restitutionary and other equitable relief under california unfair competition law bus,et.plaintiff alleged that state farm had,within the previous four years,engaged in unfair business practices in this state in the context of the adjustment of property loss claims including,without limitation,property loss claims arising out of the northridge earthquake.
in his complaint paragraph,plaintiff alleged that the california department of insurance doi had conducted an investigation of state farm in which it had examined claim files and found violations by state farm in nearly of them.the doi investigators had recommended a repayment fund for policyholders of million and fines against state farm of billion.plaintiff further alleged that the insurance commissioner had failed and refused to follow or adopt such recommendations and it was therefore imperative that the alleged violations and misconduct be addressed in plaintiff action under business and professions code,sections et.
based upon these allegations,plaintiff,acting as a private attorney general,requested,on behalf of the general public,an injunction to prevent state farm from engaging in such conduct in the future,appropriate restitutionary relief,disgorgement of illegally obtained profits and other appropriate relief and reasonable attorney fees.
state farm responded on august,with a special motion to strike plaintiff complaint under section,subdivision b state farm argued that it had responded to the doi investigative inquiries and the confidential market conduct examination that doi had conducted and that state farm written and oral communications were successful in persuading the commissioner that no violations or other misconduct had occurred.in spite of this,plaintiff and his attorneys had gained access to such confidential information and had based plaintiff entire complaint thereon.to permit plaintiff action to go forward,according to state farm,would interfere with state farm ability to respond to an official doi proceeding,a market conduct examination and state farm first amendment right to communicate freely and confidentially with its state regulator in response to an official inquiry.these circumstances were sufficient,state farm argued,to bring plaintiff complaint within the suit provisions set out in section,subdivisions b and e.further,since his complaint was alleged on information and belief,and all of the evidentiary matters described in the complaint were either founded on confidential material or constituted rank hearsay,plaintiff could not demonstrate,by competent and admissible evidence,the required probability of success in the action.therefore,state farm urged the trial court that plaintiff complaint be stricken.
plaintiff responded that a motion to strike under section was inappropriate because the allegations of his complaint were based on state farm claims handling activities and practices,as well as violations and evasions of relevant statutory and regulatory mandates,not upon state farm affirmative communicative acts in responding to a doi investigation.in other words,there was no basis for state farm claim that it was being sued for some act done in furtherance of its constitutional right of petition or free speech.
the trial court rejected plaintiff contention and accepted state farm argument and granted its special motion to strike on december,thereafter,on november,the trial court,pursuant to the authority contained in section,subdivision c,awarded state farm in attorney fees for its successful prosecution of its special motion to strike plaintiff complaint.
plaintiff filed timely appeals from both the judgment of dismissal no.and the order awarding attorney fees to state farm no.as we note below,in view of our ruling on the judgment of dismissal,we will have no need to reach or discuss the attorney fee order beyond the recognition of the fact that,upon reversal of the judgment,it is left without any legal basis.
issue presented 
the critical and dispositive issue presented in these appeals is whether,under the undisputed facts presented by this record,section has any application.or,to phrase the issue in the language of the statutory predicate,has plaintiff filed a cause of action against state farm arising from any act of state farm in furtherance of state farm right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b italics added.as we explain,we think the answer to that question is clearly no.
discussion 
general principles and standard of review 
in,the legislature enacted section in an effort to curtail lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of freedom of speech and petition for redress of grievances and to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,subd.a.the section authorizes a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.the goal is to eliminate meritless or retaliatory litigation at an early stage of the proceedings.liu moore th,d macias hartwell th,d.the statute directs the trial court to grant the special motion to strike unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.
the statutory language establishes a test.first,it must be determined whether plaintiff cause of action arose from acts by defendant in furtherance of defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.wilcox superior court th,d,disapproved on another ground in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,fn,d.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e.braun chronicle publishing th,d italics added.assuming this threshold condition is satisfied,it must then be determined that plaintiff has established a reasonable probability of success on his or her claims at trial.the defendant has the burden on the first issue the plaintiff has the burden on the second wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d plaintiff,however,has no obligation to demonstrate such probability of success if the defendant fails to meet the threshold burden.paul for council hanyecz th,d,disapproved on another ground in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,fn,d.
it is only when the defendant has met that threshold burden and then plaintiff fails to make a prima facie showing of facts,which,if proved at trial,would support a judgment in plaintiff favor,that the motion to strike must be granted.church of scientology wollersheim th,d,disapproved on another ground in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th,fn,d.whether section applies and whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing are both legal questions which we review independently on appeal.computerxpress,jackson th,d damon ocean hills journalism club th,d.as both parties recognize,an order granting a motion to strike under section is appealable,subd.j and is subject to our independent de novo review.
state farm had the burden of demonstrating that plaintiff action was subject to section 
section applies to any cause of action arising from an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subds.b,e.as used in section,an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
as already indicated,a defendant seeking to strike a plaintiff complaint under section has the burden of making a prima facie showing that the plaintiff allegations are subject to that section.braun chronicle publishing,supra,th at,d.only if the defendant satisfies that burden,will it then fall to plaintiff to establish the required probability of success.kyle carmon th,d.the defendant burden requires that it demonstrate that the plaintiff cause of action arose from some act of the defendant that was taken in furtherance of the defendant constitutional rights of petition or free speech.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,chavez mendoza th,d.
state farm did not meet its burden 
the phrase arising from in section,subdivision b,has been interpreted to refer to the act underlying the plaintiff cause or the act which forms the basis for the plaintiff cause of action and that such act must have been one done in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.in short,the statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.in the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citation.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,italics in original.in deciding whether the arising from requirement is met,a court considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.id.at,d.
the mere fact that a plaintiff has filed an action after a defendant has engaged in some protected activity does not mean that the plaintiff action arose from that activity.the statute can not be read to mean that any claim asserted in an action which arguably was filed in retaliation for the exercise of speech or petition rights falls under section,whether or not the claim is based on conduct in exercise of those rights.citations.city of cotati,supra,cal th at,d,italics in the original a city state court action for declaratory relief to determine the validity of an ordinance did not constitute a slapp suit merely because it followed a suit in federal court by a mobilehome park owner attacking that same ordinance the city action arose not from the owner prior federal suit,but rather from the controversy underlying both constitutionality of the city ordinance.as the supreme court put it in another case,the mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the statute.citation.moreover,that a cause of action arguably may have been triggered by protected activity does not entail it is one arising from such.citation.in the context,the critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant protected free speech or petitioning activity.citations.navellier sletten cal th,d,italics in original see also equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d.
it has been recognized,for example,that a defendant submission of contractual claims for payment prior to commencement of litigation or an insurer complaint alleging the submission of false and fraudulent damage reports and repair estimates prior to the commencement of litigation do not constitute acts done in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech within the meaning of statute.see kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles th,d.
in another recent decision,a court held that an insurer filing of a declaratory relief action to determine coverage under its policy did not constitute a slapp suit intended to chill the petition rights of the third party claimants who had sued the insurer insured.state farm general ins.majorino th,d.similarly to the position state farm has taken here,the appellants in majorino argued that the insurer declaratory relief action had arisen from the appellants personal injury action against the insured.the court in majorino rejected this analysis.appellants personal injury suit against the insured did trigger the chain of events that caused the insurer to seek a judicial declaration of its coverage obligations.and the nature of the claims in the underlying personal injury case frames the scope of coverage under the policy.but the action for declaratory relief arose from the tender of defense and the terms of an insurance policy issued well before the underlying litigation commenced,not from the litigation process itself.citation.id.at,d italics in original see also city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at,d.in the case before us,the doi report may have similarly triggered plaintiff action,but that action did not arise from such report nor from any communication by state farm to the doi in connection therewith.
as plaintiff exhaustively argues,his complaint alleges that state farm engaged in certain claims handling misconduct and violated a number of statutory and regulatory rules.he seeks,on behalf of the general public,to call state farm to task for that conduct.plaintiff seeks no recovery from state farm for state farm activity in communicating information to doi,nor does he allege that any such communication was wrongful or the cause of any injury to him.the allegations that state farm engaged in claims handling misconduct do not charge an act that state farm could or would argue was done by it in furtherance of its petition or free speech rights.
we thus conclude that the alleged wrongful acts of state farm were not done in furtherance of any claimed right of petition or free speech.indeed,state farm does not really claim otherwise.it argues instead that plaintiff is alleging that state farm communications to doi which allegedly contain or constitute evidence of such wrongdoing were protected communications,and to allow plaintiff to rely on them to prosecute this action would effectively interfere with state farm right to freely communicate with its regulatory agency.we reject this argument out of hand.this contention confuses state farm allegedly wrongful acts with the evidence that plaintiff will need to prove such misconduct.plaintiff seeks no relief from state farm for its communicative acts,but rather for its alleged mistreatment of
