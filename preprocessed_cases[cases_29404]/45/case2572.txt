in this insurance coverage action,plaintiff and respondent royal indemnity company royal sued its former insured,defendant and respondent united enterprises,for declaratory relief to establish that royal should not be obligated to provide liability insurance coverage under its era policy purchased by united for its business that was operated on certain real property that united formerly owned the subject property.during that period of time,united owned a trap and skeet shooting range located on the subject property,and environmental contaminants remain there.other named defendants in the coverage action,and respondents in this case,are numerous other insurers that also provided liability policies at various times to united 
this appeal stems from the trial court order denying a motion to intervene in the insurance coverage action,that was brought by appellant flat rock land company and its predecessor,otay land company collectively flat rock,who are the current owners of the subject property.code civ,all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless noted.in separate federal and state actions,flat rock has sued united and several other parties to seek recovery of environmental cleanup costs at the subject property,along with other relief in the federal action,flat rock has appealed an unfavorable summary judgment,and that appeal is pending.the related state action by flat rock against united has been stayed pending the outcome of that appeal.
on appeal,flat rock contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying its motion to intervene in the coverage action,because flat rock has a legitimate interest in making coverage arguments that may affect its possibilities of recovering damages and environmental cleanup costs from united.flat rock candidly explained to the trial court that it is interested in obtaining a settlement among all the insurers because a lot of the issues in this case center around who got coverage and what coverage is available.the trial court responded that neither public policy nor any existing authority would allow for such intervention at this time,because the proposed complaint in intervention addressed different issues and interests than were pursued in the underlying coverage action.
we conclude the trial court did not err in denying intervention because flat rock has not shown that it meets the applicable criteria under section,and its reliance upon cases such as thompson mercury casualty th,d thompson and haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th,d,haynes is inapposite.thompson and haynes were declaratory relief actions that each arose out of separate personal injury claims,and those declaratory relief actions were brought by injured third parties who sought policy interpretation rulings about vehicle permissive user coverage provisions.in those cases,all issues could be resolved through the participation of the existing parties,and the courts were not there required to address any issues regarding any proposed rights to intervene.those cases are factually and procedurally distinguishable,and they do not represent authority for extending their rationale into the arena of liability policy interpretation,in the current factual and procedural context of a proposed intervention of a claimant into an existing declaratory relief action that deals with coverage disputes between insurer and insured.that is particularly the case here,in which the insurer and the insured are united in opposition to such proposed intervention,and where the insured does not appear to require any assistance in framing or presenting the subject coverage issues.accordingly,we affirm the order denying intervention,since it does not represent an abuse of discretion nor an incorrect interpretation of case law.
factual and procedural background 
current action arising from earlier actions 
royal filed this lawsuit in april against united and the previous united insurers.it sought declaratory relief,reimbursement,and contribution,and attached as an exhibit to the complaint its own insurance policy.royal believes there is no potential for coverage for united due to the lack of an occurrence in the nature of an accident.also,the policy has certain exclusions,including one for property damage to property owned or occupied by or rented to the insured.
royal declaratory relief complaint also included an attachment,a copy of flat rock federal complaint against united and others,for recovery of environmental response costs,damages,and other relief.declaratory relief was sought by royal that it had no duty to defend or indemnify united under its policy,and that it was entitled to reimbursement from united of defense costs,and it sought declaratory relief regarding the limits of liability.as against the fellow insurers,it sought equitable contribution and indemnity.
in response,united and the other named defendants the former insurers of united answered the complaint and a case management conference was set.at the same time,flat rock motion to intervene was set for hearing in march of.at that time,mediation was being pursued,but there is no indication in the record whether it was successful.
motion to intervene,arguments and opposition 
flat rock sought leave to intervene in the royal coverage action on the basis that it has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation,justifying permissive intervention under section,subdivision a.flat rock interest in the litigation stemmed from its status as a party allegedly injured by the negligence of royal insured,united.flat rock contended that rulings without intervention could be made in its absence,regarding coverage,that would affect its rights to pursue royal as a potential judgment creditor of united.further,flat rock argued that its presence was necessary to raise all arguments bearing upon the proper interpretation of the royal policy,to avoid any loss of a valuable source of funds,any future policy proceeds to compensate it for damage caused by united.although flat rock stated that it did not intend to litigate the merits of royal coverage position at the intervention stage,it nevertheless argued that it had meritorious arguments regarding coverage for the insured united.
in support of its motion,flat rock supplied a copy of its own first amended complaint in the related state action against united,in which it sought to have united and other defendants contribute to the environmental cleanup efforts expenses,together with other relief under the california hazardous substances account act.health,et unfair business practices allegations were also made.bus.a copy of the proposed complaint in intervention was also submitted,describing flat rock previous federal action and the related separate state action,which remains pending.an adverse summary judgment ruling in the federal action is being appealed by flat rock,and the related state action has been stayed pending that appeal.the proposed pleading asserts that certain policy exclusions do not apply,and insurable occurrences took place on the subject property.
in response,royal and all the other insurer defendants opposed the motion,essentially arguing this intervention request amounted to an end run around the no direct action rule established by insurance code section,subdivision b.royal contended that although an insurer could affirmatively confer standing upon a third party claimant by suing it in the insurer own declaratory relief action,that was not the case here.state farm mutual ins.crane d.crane.further,royal contended that without attaining judgment creditor status an exception to the no direct action rule,flat rock could not participate in this action.fireman fund ins.gerlach d.fireman fund.finally,royal made policy arguments that the purposes which intervention is meant to serve,such as avoiding a multiplicity of actions or delay,operated in favor of denying intervention.in particular,the existing parties are engaged in extensive preliminary disputes about the duty to defend and pay defense costs,as between royal and united,such that the issues about indemnification are not yet being addressed,and the underlying federal action and the related state action remain pending.
united likewise opposed the motion,arguing that flat rock had no sufficiently direct interest in the lawsuit,because it had not yet obtained any judgment against united in the underlying federal or related state environmental actions.united stated that the current issues that were being addressed involved only the carriers alleged duties to defend pay united defense costs incurred in the underlying action,and argued that flat rock had no right to participate in the resolution of those issues.therefore,united contended it was premature for flat rock to try to litigate indemnity issues among the various insurers,since there was no judgment against united as yet,for which indemnity might be required,and flat rock should not be allowed to try to force a settlement.as noted,mediation has been pursued at various times,but whether it has been successful is not stated.
in reply,flat rock brought up as a new argument that thompson,supra,th,d and haynes,supra,cal th,d,should support its application to intervene.flat rock contends it is similarly situated to the plaintiffs in those cases,as an innocent third party claimant injured by negligence of the insured united.flat rock represents that it is seeking to conserve valuable judicial resources by pursuing this intervention in the royal declaratory relief action against united to determine coverage.as a potential judgment creditor,flat rock is vitally interested in the coverage issues.
on march,the trial court heard argument and confirmed its tentative ruling denying the motion.the court provided the following rationale for its ruling.first,it found that flat rock did not have a legally protectable interest in participating in the action,nor any such interest in the success of the insured,united.instead,flat rock was merely a potential beneficiary of the insurance policy.
second,royal had not chosen to name flat rock as a party defendant,as was done by the insurer in one of the cases cited,crane,supra,d,so that flat rock reliance on that case,in which an injured third party was allowed to litigate coverage issues,was inappropriate.
third,the authorities of thompson,supra,th,d and haynes,supra,cal th,d,were factually distinguishable,because those were personal injury actions in which an injured third party was allowed to sue the insured liability carrier for declaratory relief to determine coverage issues that directly affected the subject claim.the court noted that the case before it,however,did not involve such injured third parties who can pinpoint specific coverage issues affecting their claim without addressing the merits of the underlying action.to extend these cases to apply herein would inappropriately open a door for all potential judgment creditors to sue an insurer directly for declaratory relief before the merits of their claim against the insured have been adjudicated.
the court further distinguished cases in which third party judgment creditors were allowed to intervene in actions between an insurer and its insured.fireman fund,supra,d.flat rock did not yet qualify as a judgment creditor of the insured,and further as a potential judgment creditor these parties flat do not have a right to intervene because they do not yet have an interest to protect,a claim against the insurer.moreover,no evidence has been provided to the court to establish that the insured in this action united will not adequately represent and defend its interests under its policies.the court therefore denied leave to intervene in the coverage action 
notice of the ruling was given and we may properly construe the order denying the motion to intervene as a judgment of dismissal.flat rock appeals.
discussion 
flat rock asserts the trial court abused its discretion in denying it leave to intervene,and argues that it has a sufficiently direct interest in participating in this action to qualify for intervention under section.such an order denying intervention is appealable because it operates as a final determination against the intervenor and is appealable as a final judgment against him.citations.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,bame city of del mar th,d.we review the trial court ruling under an abuse of discretion standard.reliance insurance superior court th,d reliance.
at the outset,we note that flat rock motion cited only to section,subdivision a,and it mainly argued the issues regarding permissive intervention.on appeal,it contends its presentation to the trial court was broad enough to justify an order allowing mandatory intervention as well,subd.b intervention as of right is allowed if particular provisions of law permit it,or if the requesting persons are so situated that their interests in the subject property or transaction may be impaired or impeded unless they are allowed to participate in the litigation.
theoretically,this court could address as a matter of law whether the criteria for mandatory intervention were met,such that the trial court might have exercised its discretion to allow it.however,as a practical matter,we note that if permissive intervention is not appropriate in this context,most likely,mandatory intervention would also not be proper.we accordingly first address the permissive intervention criteria,and will not address in detail the mandatory intervention issues,unless permissive intervention would have been justified.as we will show,it was not.
applicable standards regarding intervention 
in city and county of san francisco state th,d san francisco,the court outlined general guidelines for allowing permissive intervention.under section,subdivision a,the trial court in its discretion may allow a third party to intervene in litigation pending between other parties if the proper procedures have been followed the nonparty has a direct and immediate interest in the action the intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation and the reasons for the intervention outweigh any opposition by the parties presently in the action.citation.citation.the permissive intervention statute balances the interests of others who will be affected by the judgment against the interests of the original parties in pursuing their litigation unburdened by others.citation.san francisco,supra,at,d.
to support permissive intervention,it is well settled that the proposed intervener interest in the litigation must be direct rather than consequential,and it must be an interest that is capable of determination in the action.citations.the requirement of a direct and immediate interest means that the interest must be of such a direct and immediate nature that the moving party will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.citation.citations.a person has a direct interest justifying intervention in litigation where the judgment in the action of itself adds to or detracts from his legal rights without reference to rights and duties not involved in the litigation.citation.citation.san francisco,supra,th,d.
under california precedents,an abstract interest is not an appropriate basis for intervention.san francisco,supra,th,d.in witkin,california procedure,supra,pleading,section at page,the authors explain that intervention is often denied on the ground that the asserted interest is indirect,consequential,or remote,the threatened injury will not inevitably result from the judgment but rather from something done afterwards,pursuant to or as a consequence of the judgment.it is often said also that one can not be permitted by intervention to enlarge the scope of the action or broaden the issues so as to litigate matters not raised by the original parties.citation.the witkin authors go on to say 
all of these general declarations appear to have about the same meaning the court must exercise its discretion in determining,in each case,whether the original action between the existing parties should be allowed to proceed undisturbed by an intervenor claim and the more indirect the connection of that claim with the issues raised in the original action,the less likelihood there is of the court permitting intervention.the decisions furnish illustrations but it is difficult to derive any principles from the opinions.citation.witkin,cal.procedure,supra.
the federal rules allowing permissive intervention are comparable.permissive intervention under federal rules of civil procedure,rule b is appropriate where a party claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common and the intervention will not unduly prejudice or delay the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.citation.hawley ins.sandy lake properties,cir,hawley.flat rock contends this alternative federal rule should not be considered here.as we will explain in part iib,post,federal case law in this area is instructive,even when we utilize california criteria for permissive intervention.
the correct approach to applying intervention rules requires us to take into account the factual and procedural context of the underlying action that would be joined by the intervener,to determine if that party has demonstrated it has a sufficiently direct interest in the subject matter of the action.in this insurance coverage context,flat rock characterizes itself as a potential judgment creditor of united,and a potential beneficiary of the royal policy,and it argues those are sufficiently direct interests to justify intervention.the nature of the underlying coverage dispute between royal and united requires us to examine the rules governing the ability of a third party claimant,such as flat rock,to sue an insurer,in the first instance,to resolve coverage issues regarding an insured.
applicable standards regarding a claimant standing to sue under a liability insurance policya.background california law in insurance context,regarding standing 
flat rock acknowledges that g enerally an insurer may not be joined as a in the underlying action against the insured by the injured third party.the fact that an insurer has agreed to indemnify the insured for any judgment rendered in the action does not make the insurer a proper party.liability insurance is not a contract for the benefit of the injured party so as to allow it to sue the insurer directly.citation.royal surplus lines ins,ranger ins.th,d see shaolian safeco ins.th,d the insurer duties flow to its insured alone.in croskey et,california practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,paragraph,page insurance litigation,the authors cite that authority and then state that this rule is the same in federal practice.citations.
thus,as a third party who is not in privity of contract with the liability insurer nor named as an express beneficiary of the policy,flat rock would normally lack standing to sue the insurer to resolve coverage questions about a tortfeasor,such as where there has been a failure to settle a claim under the policy.insurance litigation,supra.there are exceptions to this rule,and flat rock seeks to bring itself within those categories.the main exception is where the injured third party is a judgment creditor,who has standing as such to seek payment under the insurance policy,subd.b insurance litigation,supra.
another exception to these kinds of limitations on a third party claimant standing to sue a liability insurer exists,where the claimant is an assignee of the insured claims.hamilton maryland casualty cal th,d,insurance litigation,supra.
another recognized exception to the limitations on standing of a third party claimant against an insurer is found where the liability insurance also provides medical payments coverage for anyone injured by the insured,the injured party may have a direct claim against the insurer for his or her medical expenses,the injured party is treated as an additional insured as to the medical payments coverage.insurance litigation,supra.
next,where the insurer itself is seeking to obtain declaratory relief against a third party claimant,courts may allow coverage issues to be resolved in that format.similarly,if a liability insurer joins the injured third party as codefendant in a declaratory relief action to determine coverage,the third party may raise coverage issues in that action rather than waiting until after a judgment is obtained and suing as judgment creditor.insurance litigation,supra,see also crane,supra,d.
intervention may also be allowed in the insurance context,where third party claimants are involved,when the insurer is allowed to take over in litigation if its insured is not defending an action,to avoid harm to the insurer.for example,in truck ins.exchange superior court th,d truck,the plaintiffs were two liability insurers who sued their insured,a contractor,to seek rescission of their insurance policies due to its fraud.the insured was a suspended corporation and could not defend itself in this rescission action.meanwhile,the insured was being separately sued by third parties for defective work,and was being defended by a third insurer,truck.in order to protect its own interests,truck moved to intervene in the first action,on behalf of the insured,so that it could defend against the rescission claims,in the hope that it could obtain contribution from the other insurers.the appellate court allowed such intervention by truck,because it had independent standing to preserve its right to seek contribution.id.at,d.truck had a direct interest in the outcome of the rescission litigation,and the other insurers had not shown any prejudice,other than being required to prove their case.id.at,d,cited in witkin,cal.procedure,supra,pleading supp,also see reliance,supra,th,d insurance litigation,supra.
flat rock mainly relies on the authors of the practice guide,insurance litigation,for their description of thompson,supra,th,d,as representing a statement about a newly created and additional exception to the general rule that disallows direct third party claimant actions against liability insurers.we now quote that description,which is based on thompson interpretation of policy language by way of declaratory relief an injured third party may sue the insured liability insurer for declaratory relief to determine coverage issues affecting the claim.citation.insurance litigation,supra.
however,the authors of insurance litigation limit the above statement by noting that in shaolian safeco,supra,th,d,it was held that an injured third party can not sue an insurer,under medical payments coverage that is limited to injuries caused by activities of an insured,until the injured party has obtained a judicial determination that the insured was at fault.insurance litigation,supra.also in that treatise,the procedural context and holding of shaolian,supra,at pages through,d,are set forth medical expense coverage may extend to injuries caused by the insured away from the insured premises.the causative restriction is interpreted to mean the insured is liable for such injuries.therefore,the injured party can not sue the insurer directly until there has been a judicial determination that the insured was at fault.citation.insurance litigation,supra.
we next outline flat rock contentions for why it should fall within some of these exceptions to the general rules against allowing claimants to sue a liability insurer directly,and why it might be allowed to intervene.first,however,we address the united argument that we should follow federal precedent denying a party in appellants position the right to intervene.
