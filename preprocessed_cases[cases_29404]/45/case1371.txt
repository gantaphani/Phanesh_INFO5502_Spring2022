this appeal presents the question whether an underinsured motorist uim reducing clause contained in the insurance policies held by the defendants is enforceable under wisconsin law,and if so,how the clause applies.a severe automobile collision involving an underinsured motorist and donna keca keca,trisha bontempo bontempo and miranda bontempo,a minor,led to this action.in dispute is the amount of uim benefits keca and bontempo collectively defendants are owed by their insurer,allstate insurance company allstate.before the district court,allstate sought a declaratory judgment that it owes no more than the in uim benefits that it has already tendered to keca and bontempo under the policies issued to them.the defendants appeal the district court ruling allowing an offset from allstate coverage for the payment received by the defendants from the tortfeasor insurance company.allstate the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the basis that the benefits allstate paid to bontempo may not be offset from other coverage owed to keca by allstate.for the reasons stated in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
on november,trisha bontempo was driving her car in which her mother,donna keca,and daughter,miranda bontempo,were passengers.the bontempo vehicle was struck by a car driven by an intoxicated and underinsured motorist,tina cogley.the bontempos and keca sustained serious injuries as a result of the collision.it is undisputed that collectively their medical bills are in excess of.as too often is the case with reckless drivers,cogley did not carry enough insurance to cover the defendants injuries.the defendants received only under cogley bodily injury liability.
at the time of the accident,both keca and bontempo were holders of allstate automobile insurance policies the keca policy and the bontempo policy or generally the allstate policy which included uim coverage.the keca policy has applicable uim limits of for each accident and the bontempo policy has applicable uim limits of for each accident.keca resides at the same address as the bontempos,making them resident relatives covered under each other insurance policies.it is undisputed that for the accident at issue the bontempo uim coverage was primary and the keca uim coverage was excess.allstate has tendered to the defendants in uim benefits under the bontempo policy and in uim benefits under the keca policy.
except as to coverage amounts,the keca and bontempo policies are virtually identical.the policies are pages in length,including the main policy jacket and the added endorsements.the auto policy declarations declarations page,containing a chart that reflects the amounts of coverage,types of coverage,premiums,and deductibles,appears at the beginning of each policy.the declarations page sets forth the amount of uim limits and lists the documents that comprise the policy,including amendatory endorsement form au au.au is a standalone document located at the end of each policy that contains changes,amendments,and additions to the provisions contained within the main policy jacket.the heading at the top of page of au states,this endorsement changes your it with your policy.au five the provisions.the following basic uim coverage provisions are set forth on page of au 
underinsured motorists coveragecoverage su 
if your policy declarations indicates that you have this coverage,we will pay those damages that an insured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an underinsured auto because of bodily injury sustained by an insured person.
the uim limits of liability provision,set forth three pages later,states that the coverage limit shown on the policy declarations for each accident is the maximum we will pay for damages arising out of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident.the uim reducing clause,which appears immediately below the limits of liability provision,states in part as follows 
the limit of underinsured motorists coverage shall be reduced by 
all amounts paid by or on behalf of any person or organization that may be legally responsible for the bodily injury for which the payment is made,including,but not limited to,any amounts paid under the bodily injury liability coverage of this or any other insurance policy 
based on these provisions,allstate calculates the amount it owes to the defendants as follows the received from the tortfeasor,cogley,was offset against the uim limits of both policies,leaving in uim benefits under the bontempo policy,which allstate tendered,and in uim benefits under the keca policy.the in uim benefits allstate tendered under the bontempo policy was offset against the uim coverage under the keca policy,leaving in uim benefits under that policy,which allstate also tendered.it is allstate position that it has fulfilled its uim coverage obligations under the plain language of both insurance policies.the defendants contend that the reduction clause is unenforceable and they are entitled to in uim benefits under the bontempo policy and in uim benefits under the keca policy,for a combined total of in allstate uim benefits.
allstate commenced this action seeking a declaratory judgment that the uim reducing clauses in the keca and bontempo policies are enforceable,and therefore,no benefits beyond the already tendered is owed to the defendants by allstate.the district court had jurisdiction over the action,pursuant to a,because there was complete diversity of citizenship between the parties,and the amount in controversy was in excess of.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.in its order denying summary judgment to allstate and granting judgment in part to the defendants,the district court rejected allstate bid to reduce keca uim benefits by the paid under the bontempo policy.however,the district court also found that allstate reducing clause was not ambiguous in the context of the policy as a whole and therefore approved the reduction allstate made to each policy as a result of the payment tendered by cogley liability carrier.allstate now appeals the former decision,and the defendants appeal the latter.
ii.discussion 
a federal court sitting in diversity has the obligation to apply the law of the state as it believes the highest court of the state would apply it if presented with the issue.see lexington ins.rugg knopp,cir.in this case,interpretation of allstate insurance policy is governed by the substantive law of wisconsin,the forum state.in wisconsin,the interpretation of an insurance contract and the conclusion as to whether coverage exists are questions of law.see ledman state farm mut.auto.ins.we review grants of summary judgment de novo to determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see williams anderson,cir.
enforceability of reducing clause 
prior to,a number of wisconsin courts found reducing clauses void because they rendered purported uim coverage illusory.see,kuhn allstate ins.courts deemed uim coverage subject to a reducing clause illusory because the full coverage amount would never actually be paid by the insurer as the underinsured motorist would always be contributing some portion of the payment.see,id.at.in,the wisconsin legislature passed a statute.stat.i,specifically allowing for uim reducing clauses that operate to decrease the amount of the insured total damages subject to uim coverage from the insurer by any amounts received from the underinsured tortfeasor.since the statute passage,considerable litigation relating to the validity and enforceability of reducing clauses has continued to occur in wisconsin courts.the wisconsin supreme court itself described uim coverage as a legal iceberg,a seemingly straightforward area of the law,which in fact can prove to be nettlesome to analyze.badger mut.ins.schmitz,quoting dowhower bend mut.ins.
in dowhower,the wisconsin supreme court concluded that.stat.i does not violate substantive due process under the state or federal constitutions.id.at.it also held that the type of reducing clauses authorized by
