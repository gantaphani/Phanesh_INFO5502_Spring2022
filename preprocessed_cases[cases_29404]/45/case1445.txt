with respect to the information and network technology errors or omissions coverage,federal acknowledged that sefton had complied with the requirement of claiming financial injury during the policy period.however,federal claimed that sefton had not alleged that eyeblaster committed a wrongful act as defined by the policy in connection with a product failure or in performing or failing to perform its service.federal also pointed to general exclusionary language in the policy and to three specific exclusions.
