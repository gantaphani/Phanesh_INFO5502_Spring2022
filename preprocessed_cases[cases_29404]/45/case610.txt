republic franklin insurance company commenced this action against its insured,the albemarle county virginia school board,for a declaratory judgment that franklin insurance owed no duty to defend the school board in an action commenced by school board employees for violations of the fair labor standards act flsa or the act nor any duty to indemnify the school board for any judgment that might be entered in the action.the employees alleged that the school board had failed to pay them for all the work they had done and failed to pay them the overtime rate when they worked over hours in a week.franklin insurance asserted that the flsa violations were not wrongful acts as covered by the commercial insurance policy it issued to the school board and that any judgment that might be entered against the school board would not impose losses on the school board,as loss is defined in the policy.
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of franklin insurance,holding that the school board failures to pay its employees in accordance with the flsa were not wrongful acts covered by the policy because the school board had a preexisting duty to pay its employees in compliance with the act.the court also concluded that any judgment that might be entered against the school board for failure to comply with the flsa would not cause the school board to sustain a loss as defined in the policy.
we reverse,concluding that the failure to comply with the flsa was a wrongful act and that,while a judgment awarding unpaid wages would not be a covered loss under the policy because payment of those wages was a preexisting duty,any obligation to pay liquidated damages and attorneys fees would cause the school board a loss from a wrongful act,covered by the policy.
in january,six employees of the school board,who were either bus drivers or transportation assistants hired to maintain and clean buses,commenced an action against the school board under the flsa on behalf of themselves and other employees similarly situated for unpaid wages and overtime pay.they asserted that they were not paid for all of the time that they worked and that they were not paid at the premium overtime rate when they worked for more than hours in a week.they demanded,among other things,unpaid wages and overtime pay,liquidated damages as authorized by the flsa,and attorneys fees.as of july,approximately present and former employees had opted into the action,pursuant to b.
the school board promptly tendered the defense of the action to republic franklin insurance company,which had issued a commercial package insurance policy to the school board.franklin insurance agreed to defend the action with a reservation of rights to challenge coverage.it also commenced this action,requesting a declaratory judgment that it did not have the obligation either to defend the underlying flsa action or to indemnify the school board for any judgment that the school board might be required to pay.in its answer,the school board filed a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that franklin insurance had a duty to defend the action and to indemnify it for the amount of any judgment that might be entered.
on the parties for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment,dated july,in favor of franklin insurance,declaring that franklin insurance owed no duty to defend or to indemnify the school board.in its opinion,the court concluded that the insured negligent,willful,or intentional failure to honor a obligation to pay money is not a wrongful act as that term is used in the policy to find otherwise could encourage parties to routinely circumvent the requirements of the flsa whether negligently,willfully,or intentionally because they have nothing to lose.the court also concluded that the school board had not demonstrated its potential liability for a loss falling within the policy definition of loss.it noted that the definition of loss expressly excludes penalties imposed by law.t he statute clearly designates liquidated damages and attorneys fees as penalties,and the policy unambiguously excludes such amounts from the definition of loss.the court also found that because the claim for back wages was not a claim for damages,as required by the definition of loss,but rather an existing operating cost,so too was a claim for the liquidated damages and attorneys fees not a loss because that claim did not exist independently of the claim for back wages.finally,the court concluded,if the failure to pay wages does not constitute a wrongful act under the policy,it follows that the statutory remedies allowable in connection with any failure to pay those wages do not result from a claim for a wrongful act.
from the judgment declaring that franklin insurance policy does not cover the claims made in the underlying flsa action,the school board appeals,arguing only that the claims for liquidated damages and attorneys fees were covered by the policy because liquidated damages and attorneys fees were not preexisting obligations but damages resulting specifically from its wrongful acts in not paying the wages required by the flsa.
the parties agree that virginia law applies in this diversity action,see resource bankshares paul mercury ins,cir,and that under virginia law,the interpretation of an insurance policy follows the same principles as the interpretation of any other contract and is a question of law for the court,see seabulk offshore,am.home assurance,cir state farm fire cas.walton.while the initial burden of proving coverage falls on the insured,resource bankshares,at,doubts over coverage are typically to be resolved in favor of the insured and against a limitation of coverage.caci,int l,paul fire marine ins,cir.
under the terms of the commercial policy issued by franklin insurance to the school board,franklin insurance agreed to pay for all loss resulting from a claim for a wrongful act to which this insurance applies.the policy defines loss as any amount which an insured is legally obligated to pay as damages,and the term includes coverage for punitive damages where insurable by law.loss,however,does not include fines or penalties imposed by law or operating costs of the insured institution such as would be included in the insured educational institution budget.the policy defines wrongful act as any breach of duty,neglect,error,omission,misstatement,or misleading statement in the discharge of educational institution duties.
the school board contends that the district court erred in its conclusion that the underlying flsa complaint did not allege a wrongful act.it argues that the complaint clearly alleges numerous wrongful acts committed by the school board in failing to pay its employees the wages and overtime pay required by the flsa.the school board contends further that the district court erred in holding that because back wages are not covered loss,liquidated damages and attorneys fees,similarly,can not be covered loss since all three remedies arise from the same act or event defendant failure to pay the appropriate wages.the school board asserts that the policy contains no such limitation and,indeed,contemplates that some remedies for a wrongful act will be covered while others are not.finally,the school board contends that the district court erred in concluding that liquidated damages and attorneys fees are excluded as fines and penalties imposed by law or by their close linkage to a claim for back wages,which is not covered.it argues that liquidated damages and attorneys fees are damages resulting from a wrongful act,independent of the obligation to pay back wages.
franklin insurance,urging that we affirm the district court judgment,argues that the alleged failure to pay wages and premium overtime pay pursuant to the requirements of the flsa is not a wrongful act because the failure to comply with a legal obligation is not a wrongful act.it also contends that a judgment obligating the school board to pay liquidated damages and attorneys fees would not be a covered loss within the policy definition.according to franklin insurance,i f the back pay that was owed is not covered,any liquidated damages or attorneys
