an explosion in a natural liquid gas pipeline operated by markwest caught the attention of the office of pipeline safety.that office ordered markwest to conduct a series of tests on its pipeline,and to repair integrity threatening conditions discovered in the course of those tests.markwest filed a claim with its insurance carriers seeking to recoup certain loses it incurred as a result of the explosion and its compliance with the government mandated tests and repairs.the insurers denied coverage,and markwest filed this suit,seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract and bad faith breach of insurance contract.the district court eventually granted summary judgment to the insurers,and markwest now appeals.we affirm the district court decision because the insurance policy in dispute does not cover costs incurred to maintain the pipeline.
markwest leases and operates a stretch of natural gas liquids ngl pipeline running between maytown,kentucky,and ranger,west virginia the pipeline,which is one segment of a larger system of pipelines operated by markwest and known as the appalachian liquids pipeline system,was originally built in.it is constructed of and diameter steel pipe,and is separated by flow stations containing a bypass pipe and valve and raised stem inlet and outlet valves.
on the morning of november,a bypass valve failed at flow station four,located near the rolling acres subdivision in ivel,kentucky.the failure meant that the valve remained closed,despite its hand wheel showing it to be open,and pressure built up inside the pipeline behind the valve.eventually,this increased pressure caused a release of ngl through a small hole in the pipeline where the wall had been thinned by corrosion.the escaped ngl caught fire,resulting in explosions,the destruction of five homes in the subdivision,and a number of injuries but no fatalities.
the office of pipeline safety ops,a division of the department of transportation charged with ensuring the safe and reliable operation of pipelines,launched an investigation.ten days after the accident,on november,the ops issued an initial corrective action order cao,requiring markwest to take the necessary corrective action to protect the public,property,and the environment from potential hazards associated with a failure involving the four and maytown station to ranger junction segment the affected segment of markwest appalachian liquid pipeline system running from near langley,kentucky to near south shore,kentucky.app.at.the cao stated that t he cause of the failure has not yet been determined,but went on to list several preliminary findings,including these 
preliminary visual inspection indicated the presence of localized external corrosion around the failure site.inspectors identified a small hole in the pipeline at the position when examining the failure site.
the affected segment was hydrostatically tested in to a pressure of psig,according to markwest.records supporting the test could not be located.
the pipeline has not been subject to internal inspection.however,markwest has indicated its intent to perform internal inspection on the pipeline.
the cao continued with a section entitled determination of necessity for corrective action order and right to hearing.in it,the ops described its reason for issuing the cao 
after evaluating the foregoing preliminary findings of fact,i find that the continued operation of the affected segment without corrective measures would be hazardous to life,property and the environment.additionally,after considering the age of the pipe,the proximity of the pipeline to highways,drinking water sources,and populated areas,the combustible nature of the products the pipeline transports,the pressure required for transporting the material,the history of leaks attributed to corrosion on the pipeline,and the ongoing investigation to determine the cause of the failure,i find that a failure to expeditiously issue this order requiring immediate corrective action would likely result in serious harm to life,property,or the environment.
after receiving and analyzing additional data in the course of this investigation,ops may identify other corrective measures that need to be taken.in that event,markwest will be notified of any additional measures required and amendment of this order will be considered.
the cao then detailed various corrective actions markwest had to take.these included hydrostatic pressure testing of the affected pipeline segment to of the existing maximum operating pressure id.at.in addition,markwest had to prepare a plan to address all known or suspected factors that caused or contributed to the accident.id.at.the plan had to include t he performance of appropriate field testing,inspections,and evaluations to determine whether and to what extent the condition s associated with the failure,or other integrity threatening trends,are present along the remainder of the affected segment or elsewhere on any portion of the appalachian liquid pipeline system constructed with similar methods and material as the affected segment.id.markwest was also required to perform appropriate repairs,pipe replacement,or other corrective measures fully remediating the integrity threatening condition s associated with the failure everywhere along the pipeline where such conditions are identified by the evaluation process.id.
the ops issued an amendment to the cao one day later,in which it made supplemental comments.an additional finding of fact noted that t he ongoing investigation of the november,failure has identified a raised stem valve that may have played a role in the pipeline failure.id.at.in a paragraph entitled determination of necessity for corrective action order and right to hearing,the ops added a phrase observing that the circumstances surrounding the way the valve functioned at the time of the failure was a factor that led the ops to expeditiously issue the cao and amendment.id.at.a discussion of amendment section described in detail preliminary findings related to the valve failure,and discussed the need for an independent investigation of the valve to determine if the valve may not have functioned as specified and may have been a contributing factor in the failure that resulted in fires,explosions,nine injuries and the destruction of five homes.id.at.a later section of the amendment ordered markwest to arrange for such an investigation.id.
after the ops issued its cao and amendment,markwest sought a hearing in order to clarify and discuss the requirements for a return to operation.id.at.at the hearing,markwest was further amendment to the cao that allowed for alternative equivalent methods of pipeline integrity testing other than hydrostatic pressure testing.id.at.in addition,markwest asked for clarification about the meaning of the phrase integrity threatening condition.id.ops responded that markwest should not view integrity threatening condition in an overbroad manner.for instance,corrosion on the pipeline would be an integrity threatening condition,but the consideration of this condition need not extend to soil conditions which might be conducive to corrosion.id.
at the time of the accident,markwest carried an property insurance policy with four insurance companies.the policy indemnified markwest against all risks of direct physical loss or damage occurring during the period of this policy from any external cause,except as hereinafter excluded.app.at.relevant to this lawsuit,the policy explicitly stated that it does not insure corrosion.id.at.it further provided that the insurance companies shall not be liable for any increase in loss resulting from e nforcement of any ordinance or law regulating the use,construction,repair or demolition of any property.id.at.it did,however,have a provision,the demolition and cost of construction endorsement dicc endorsement,providing up to million in coverage for specific losses resulting from the enforcement of laws and ordinances regulating the construction or repair of damaged property 
demolition and increased cost of construction endorsement 
liability for loss under this endorsement arising out of one occurrence shall not exceed.
in the event of loss or damage by an insured peril under this policy that causes the enforcement of any law or ordinance regulating the construction or repair of damaged facilities,underwriters shall be liable for 
increased cost of repair or reconstruction of the damaged and undamaged facility on the same or another site and limited to the minimum requirements of such law or ordinance regulating the repair or reconstruction of the damaged property on the same site.however,the company shall not be liable for any increased cost of construction loss unless the damaged facility is actually rebuilt or replaced.
any increase in the business interruption and extra expense loss arising out of the additional time required to comply with state law or ordinance.
markwest promptly reported the november,accident to its insurers,and submitted claims for direct losses to property sustained as a result of the accident,as well as for expenses sustained as a result of compliance with the caos.markwest took the position that the latter costs were covered by the dicc endorsement.the insurers disagreed and issued a position letter denying coverage.regarding markwest losses caused by the explosion,the insurers argued that the principal cause of the accident was corrosion and accordingly markwest losses were not covered by the policy.id.at.regarding the expenses markwest sustained in complying with the caos,the insurers contended,among other things,that 
e ven assuming that the ops corrective action order is a law or ordinance,there would be coverage only if it is regulating the construction or repair of the damaged pipeline.while the exclusion applies to increased time element losses resulting from a law or ordinance regulating the use,construction,repair or demolition of any property,the endorsement adds back coverage only for increased time element losses resulting from a law or ordinance regulating the construction or repair of damaged property.thus,absent from the endorsement is coverage for increased time element losses resulting from a law or ordinance regulating the use of any property.
while the corrective action order may have regulated the use of the entire pipeline,it does not appear to have regulated the repair of the damaged portion of pipeline.
id.at emphasis in original.the insurers added another reason for denying coverage.for coverage to apply under the dicc,they noted,an insured peril must cause the enforcement of a law or ordinance.here however,they argued,the ops acted out of concern for corrosion in the pipeline,and corrosion is a peril expressly excluded,not insured,by the terms of markwest policy.id.at.
in response to the insurer position letter,markwest filed suit in state court.the company sought a declaratory judgment against its insurers,as well as damages for breach of contract and bad faith breach of an insurance contract.the insurance companies removed the suit to federal court and filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss the suit on all claims.in due course,the district court granted the motion.
with respect to markwest claim for losses arising from the explosion,the district court disagreed with the insurance companies claim that the undisputed evidence here proves that the cause of the ivel incident was corrosion.id.at dist.op.at,wl.the court noted markwest contrary evidence that the precipitating cause was the valve failure,not corrosion,and stressed that t here are conflicting expert opinions submitted on this point.id.the court concluded that markwest has shown a triable issue of fact as to whether this loss would have occurred without the valve failure.id.yet,this did not end the matter.the district court continued by noting that the covered property losses from the accident were small in fact,markwest conceded that they were substantially less than the deductible under the policy id.at.in light of this concession and its grant of summary judgment to the insurers on markwest remaining claim for coverage,the district court concluded that it had no choice but to grant summary judgment to the insurance defendants.
the district court next granted summary judgment to the insurers on markwest claim for its costs in complying with the ops various directives.while the accident itself may have been caused by a valve failure,the district court reasoned,t he ivel incident was the cause of the ops order only in the sense that it gave notice to the ops that the pipeline had a history of leaks resulting from corrosion the only reasonable inference from reading the three ops orders is that the investigation and remediation of the mile segment was caused by the evidence of corrosion.the possibility of a valve failure was not a relevant factor.id.at.because the court found the cause of the ops directives to be the product of concerns about corrosion,an excluded peril under the terms of the policy,the district court held that the insurance companies had no duty to reimburse markwest for its compliance costs.the district court also granted summary judgment to the insurers on markwest claim that they denied coverage in bad faith.this appeal followed.
before us,markwest does not seek to disturb the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to its claims for property losses caused by the explosion.instead,markwest argues that a reasonable jury could conclude that the cao and its amendments were not issued solely out of concern for corrosion,but rather were issued for a variety of reasons,including concern about potentially faulty valves elsewhere along the pipeline.accordingly,markwest continues,its costs of complying with the government mandates are compensable under the terms of its insurance policy.markwest also seeks to resuscitate its bad faith denial claim.
as with any other appeal from a summary judgment disposition,we review markwest arguments de novo,viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences those facts support in the light most favorable to markwest.hinds mgmt,cir.we will affirm a grant of summary judgment if but only if the evidence reveals no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the construction of an insurance policy is a matter of law.joint sch.dist.continental ins,cir.we assess the policy under colorado law,which the parties agree governs their diversity contract dispute.
the parties dispute centers on the meaning of the dicc endorsement.the endorsement specifies that in the event of loss or damage by an insured peril under this policy that causes the enforcement of any law or ordinance regulating the construction or repair of damaged facilities,underwriters shall be liable for app.at.as a prerequisite for liability,then,two conditions must be met an insured peril must cause the enforcement of a law or ordinance regulating the construction or repair of damaged facilities.to be sure,if both of these conditions are satisfied,the dicc endorsement renders the insurers liable for i ncreased cost of repair or reconstruction of the damaged and undamaged facility on the same or another site.id.but to reach this recovery markwest must clear both contractual hurdles placed in its way.
the district court granted summary judgment because,in its view,markwest stumbled at the first hurdle.while valve failure may have caused the accident,the court reasoned,it was beyond cavil that the ops issued the caos and its amendments out of concern with corrosion in the pipeline.on appeal,markwest replies that these conclusions are logically incongruous.it reasons that,if a reasonable jury could find that the explosion was caused by valve failure,and the ops intervened and issued its cao and amendments because of the explosion,surely a reasonable jury could also conclude that the ops acted out of concern for valve failures and not simply corrosion.
whatever the merits of markwest chain of we do not pass on fails to get the company home.for markwest losses to be covered by the endorsement,the ops directives at issue still must regulat e the construction or repair of damaged facilities.they do not.
under colorado law an insurance policy must be given effect
