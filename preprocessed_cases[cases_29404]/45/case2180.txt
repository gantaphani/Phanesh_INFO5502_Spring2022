the defendants,a church and the victims of a episode that commenced on church property,appeal a district court award of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff insurer.the insurer initiated this diversity action seeking a declaratory judgment adjudicating the meaning,interpretation and application of a sexual misconduct exclusion contained in the church general commercial liability policy.the district court found that the underlying crimes at the hands of a third party criminal all arose out of an act of sexual misconduct,and found the sexual misconduct exclusion applicable,thereby limiting coverage to that afforded to acts of sexual misconduct under a separate liability coverage form.we disagree,finding that the underlying crimes are not excluded by virtue of the sexual misconduct exclusion,and reverse the district court judgment with instructions.
the incident 
the tragic facts of this case are undisputed and though disturbing,the explicit details are,unfortunately,essential to our analysis.at around noon on october,the victim,a year old mother,was picking up her old daughter,the daughter,from the little disciples preschool at old cutler presbyterian church,the church the victim was also accompanied by her old baby boy,the son.as she was securing her children in her,a man came up behind her and tackled her while screaming,if you want to live and you do want to see your children die,get in the car,bitch.the perpetrator then struck her on the head,threw her into her van,and closed the door.
once in the van,the perpetrator told the victim that he had a knife,made her close her eyes,and stuck her with a very sharp object in the upper arm or neck before he headed into the back seat to sit next to the daughter.the daughter was screaming and attempted to get out of her seat and out of the van when the perpetrator pushed her back and forced her back into the seat,resulting in a bruise on her lower back.he then ordered the victim into the passenger seat,sat himself in the driver seat,the volume on the radio to try to mask the screams of the victim and her children,and drove off in the van.
as they were driving,the perpetrator began engaging the victim in conversation.he told her,give me your money,give me your rings,give me your pin number to your atm card,and i also want something else from you,there are a few other things you going to have to do for me.the perpetrator then had the victim crouch down on the floor of the van to perform oral sex on him while he was driving.while the victim was performing oral sex,the perpetrator began striking her in the back of the head because he was angry that he could not maintain an erection while the children were screaming and,thus,could not ejaculate.
after driving for about thirty minutes,the perpetrator stopped the van in a grassy area near a canal.he told the victim to remove her pants,pulled his own pants down to his ankles,and asked her to perform more oral sex before climbing on top of her and having intercourse with her.during intercourse,the perpetrator asked the victim to turn over,removed his penis,and began spanking her on the buttocks.he asked her if she liked to be hit during sex,she responded that she did not.despite her response,he continued to hit her,asking her if it hurt.the victim responded that it did not hurt because she thought that was what he wanted her to say,and he repeatedly hit her harder,stopping after three or four times.intercourse then resumed and the perpetrator ejaculated,putting his penis in the victim mouth and saying,you better swallow it all,you better swallow everything or i will kill you and your children.you do not want your children to die.
the perpetrator next had the victim crouch down on the passenger side of the vehicle and told her that he needed money and needed to find a bank.he told her that he was unsure how to go about getting the money because he did not want to be seen on the cameras,nor did he want to send her into the bank,for fear that she would ask someone for help.thinking out loud,the perpetrator named the different banks in the area,dismissing them for various reasons,until he remembered that there was a bank of america with a atm.he then instructed the victim to drive and told her,i going to sit in the back seat with your daughter and remember i have a knife.at that point,the perpetrator stuck the victim with the knife and continued,i not kidding around,i getting in the back with your children and you going to withdraw the money,whatever you able to withdraw and i want to see the receipt when you done,i need to know how much money is in all your accounts.
the perpetrator drove to the bank of america in homestead,where he and the victim switched places in the.the victim was only able to withdraw from the atm and handed the receipt and money to the perpetrator.the victim husband paycheck had just been deposited and,upon looking at the receipt,the perpetrator said he could believe how much money the victim had in the bank he could believe how he had gotten so lucky.he said he had to find a way to get the rest of it and that he could come back for the victim if he needed to,because he was going to get all of the money.
the perpetrator again had the victim switch places with him,so that he was again driving.he then told her that they were driving to a first union bank.at first union,he had the victim get out of the car to withdraw money from a atm,as this bank did not have a.after attempting to withdraw cash from her various accounts,the victim returned to the car empty handed,explaining to the perpetrator that the atm would not allow her to withdraw any more money.the perpetrator responded by screaming at her that he had to have this money but if you know your children are in the car with me you going to be too hysterical going into the bank,i do know.the perpetrator then decided against sending the victim into the bank to withdraw the money,said,this is almost over for you,and began driving back towards the church.
on their way back to the church,the perpetrator decided that he was aroused once again,and made the victim crouch down on the floor of the van to perform oral sex on him.the perpetrator was unable to ejaculate because the victim children were screaming too much.instead,the perpetrator had her use her hands,and when that did not work,he ordered her to kiss his penis.he then drove into the church parking lot but could not find a secluded area,so he drove into a wooded area opposite the church and parked the van.the perpetrator told the victim that he had been nice to her and that he had intended to kill her and her children but had decided against it.he told her that she should be grateful and that she did a good job pleasing him.
before he parted,the perpetrator returned the victim wedding rings,stating that he did not want to arouse her husband suspicions by having her rings missing and making her promise not to tell her husband.he then told her to go home and take a shower,left the victim and her children in the,and walked away.
the policy 
on the date of the incident,the church was covered by a primary liability insurance policy the primary policy issued by guideone elite insurance company the insurer.the primary policy contains a commercial general liability coverage form the cgl providing limits of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate,with the following exclusion 
any personal and advertising injury,bodily injury and mental or emotional pain or anguish,sustained by any person arising out of or resulting from any actual or alleged act of sexual misconduct of any kind.the insurer shall have no duty to investigate,settle,defend or pay any claim or suit asserting any act of sexual misconduct or any breach of duty contributing to such act.
the sexual misconduct exclusion.neither the primary policy nor the cgl define sexual misconduct.because of the sexual misconduct exclusion in the cgl,the church also purchased sexual misconduct liability coverage the sml,which applies to certain delineated acts of sexual misconduct and provides for per occurrence and in the aggregate.though part of the primary policy,the sml is a separate coverage requiring a separate premium.the sml defines sexual misconduct or sexual molestation as 
any activity which is sexual in nature whether permitted or unpermitted,including but not limited to sexual assault,sexual battery,sexual relations,sexual acts,sexual activity,sexual handling,sexual massage,sexual exploitation,sexual exhibition,photographic,video or other reproduction of sexual activity,sexual stimulation,fondling,intimacy,exposure of sexual organs,lewd,or lascivious behavior or indecent exposure,fornication,undue familiarity,or unauthorized touching.
in addition to the primary policy,which encompasses the cgl and the sml,the church was also covered by an umbrella policy,which covers bodily injury and also contains the sexual misconduct exclusion found in the cgl the limits of the umbrella policy are million per occurrence and million in the aggregate.
the lawsuit 
upon learning of the incident,the church notified its insurer,and on may,anticipating a lawsuit against the church by the victim and her,the insurer filed this declaratory judgment action the federal action,seeking an adjudication of the meaning,interpretation and application of the sexual misconduct exclusion.after this action was filed by the insurer,the church was sued for money damages in state court by the victims the state court action.that suit alleges that the victim and her children were kidnapped while leaving the premises of the church and subsequently assaulted and battered.it further alleges that the church was negligent in failing to provide adequate security despite its knowledge of criminal activity in the area and in failing to warn patrons of that criminal activity.there is no specific mention of sexual activity or rape.
the church then tendered the claim to the insurer for defense and indemnity,pursuant to its cgl policy.the insurer made a unilateral determination that the perpetrator subjective intent was sexual,and denied coverage under the cgl.instead,the insurer asserted that all the claims made by the victims were covered only by the sml,which is subject to substantially less coverage than the cgl.
in a motion to amend and dismiss,the church sought to implead its insurance broker as a party to the federal action,in order to bind it to the coverage ruling the district court was being asked to make.because the church insurance broker was a florida corporation,the church argued that such a joinder would destroy diversity and that the district court should,accordingly,dismiss the federal action pursuant to the doctrine of procedural fencing.prior to the district court ruling on the motion to amend and dismiss,the church filed a second motion to dismiss seeking to dismiss or stay the federal action in favor of a parallel state court declaratory action filed by the church,which included the insurance broker as a defendant.
while these motions to dismiss were pending,the insurer eventually moved for summary judgment in the federal action,contending that the incident arose purely from an act of sexual misconduct,and thus,was excluded from the coverage afforded by the cgl,and subject only to the lower limits of liability provided by the sml.the insurer argued that the negligence claims against the church were within the scope of the exclusion,and that the exclusion applied even though the perpetrator was a third party and not an employee of the church.
the church and the victims collectively,the defendants responded and filed for summary judgment.the victims argued that the injuries were not only a result of the sexual assault,but also as a result of the robbery and kidnapping,and,therefore,the exclusion should not apply.they further argued that an exclusion for injuries arising out of a specific act does not exclude coverage for a person whose negligent acts contributed to the commission of that act,and requested a declaration that there were multiple occurrences under the cgl,triggering the million aggregate limit.
the defendants both argued that the sexual misconduct exclusion was meant to apply to abuse by employees of the church,not to attacks by criminals,and that the undefined term sexual misconduct in the cgl form did not,under the common understanding of that term,encompass the violent abuse and rape involved in the incident.
the district court disagreed with the defendants and ultimately denied the motions to dismiss and granted the insurer motion for summary judgment,entering a final declaratory decree and judgment in favor of the insurer and disposing of the federal action.
discussion 
motions to dismiss 
we begin our discussion with the church contention that the district court erred in accepting jurisdiction over the insurer request for declaratory relief by denying the church motions to amend and dismiss.first,the church argues that the district court should have abstained from deciding this federal action because the meaning and interpretation of the insurance contract in this case is governed by an unresolved issue of florida state law.the church accurately points out that neither the florida supreme court,nor any of florida intermediate appellate courts,have considered the applicability or interpretation of the sexual misconduct exclusion at issue in this case.
in support of its argument,the church urges us to follow the sixth circuit opinion in scottsdale ins.roumph,cir.in scottsdale,the insurer sought a declaration that the underlying tort claim,based on an apparent rape,was excluded from the insured general liability policy and,instead,subject to the lower policy limits of a sexual misconduct limitation endorsement similar to the sml at issue here.rather than decide on the meaning of the sexual misconduct exclusion,which was an unresolved issue of state law,the district court abstained in favor of the state court action,and the sixth circuit affirmed.
although we agree with the reasoning in scottsdale,we must review the district court exercise of authority to proceed with a declaratory judgment action for abuse of discretion.wilton seven falls,d.when we say that a decision is discretionary,or that a district court has discretion to grant or deny a motion,we do not mean that the district court may do whatever pleases it.the phrase means instead that the court has a range of choice,and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.ameritas variable life ins.roach,cir per curiam citing kern txo prod,cir.the very concept of discretion presupposes a zone of choice within which the trial courts may go either way.kern,at.thus,when employing an abuse of discretion standard,we will leave undisturbed a district court ruling unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment,or has applied the wrong legal standard.
in cases such as this,the supreme court has expressed that it would be uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit is pending in a state court presenting the same issues,not governed by federal law,between the same parties.brillhart excess ins.of america.here,as in scottsdale,we would have affirmed the district court had it reached a different result,and if we were reviewing this matter de novo,we probably would have decided it differently.by definition,however,under the abuse of discretion standard of review there will be occasions in which we affirm the district court even though we would have gone the other way had it been our call.that is how an abuse of discretion differs from a de novo standard of review.in re rasbury,cir.though we feel that florida state court was better suited to construe its own unresolved issue of state law,we can not go so far as to say that the district court decision to exercise jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action amounted to an abuse of discretion.but it is certainly close to the extreme limits of such discretion.
the church also argues that the district court should have allowed it to amend its counterclaim to add its insurance broker as a party and then should have dismissed the federal action based on.b and the doctrine of procedural fencing.however,the district court denial of the church motion for leave to amend its counterclaim to join additional parties is also reviewed for abuse of discretion.spanish broadcasting system of,clear channel communications,cir leave to amend dean barber,cir joinder of additional parties.
in denying the church motion,the district court explained 
the church asks the court to join two additional parties to this action and then dismiss the action for the resulting lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the motion is untimely because the church waited until eight months after this suit was first filed in order to add these parties.however,the court has considered the merits of the church motion and finds that the parties the church seeks to add are not indispensable to this suit.therefore,the court will not prolong these proceedings by adding two new parties.
because of the deference afforded to the district courts the abuse of discretion standard,we find no clear error of judgment,and,therefore,can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the church motion to amend and then dismiss.therefore,we do not disturb the district court ruling.
ii.summary judgment 
we now turn to the district court summary judgment in favor of the insurer.we review de novo a summary judgment ruling,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.williamson oil,philip morris usa,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.when deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate,all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are reviewed in a light most favorable to the party.witter delta air lines,cir citations and quotations omitted.an issue of fact is genuine,thus barring the entry of summary judgment,unless the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.piamba cortes american airlines,cir citations and quotations omitted.
in granting summary judgment in favor of the insurer,the district court found that the sexual misconduct exclusion clause,which stated that the insurer shall have no duty to investigate,settle,defend or pay any claim or suit asserting any act of sexual misconduct or any breach of duty contributing to such act,clearly and unambiguously denied coverage for a negligence suit arising out of injuries sustained as a result of sexual misconduct.the court further interpreted any act of sexual misconduct to apply to the sexual misconduct of third parties.it,therefore,reasoned that,to the extent that the victims sustained injuries that arose out of sexual misconduct,the church cgl did not apply.
the district court then went on to find that all of the perpetrator acts were incidental to and arose from his sexual acts,thus,finding that all of the underlying criminal acts of the perpetrator amounted to sexual misconduct.as a result,the district court concluded that the cgl did not apply to any of the third actions,thus,triggering the coverage limits of the sml.
with regard to the sml,the district court concluded that because the criminal acts of the perpetrator were committed by a single individual,his conduct constituted a single occurrence for purposes of determining the church coverage.
the primary issue in this case is whether allegations of the incident in the underlying state action against the church constitute acts arising out of sexual misconduct within the meaning of the cgl,such that they trigger the sexual misconduct exclusion of the policy.thus,we are now called upon to interpret a church cgl sexual misconduct exclusion in a case involving multiple crimes by a third party.as the florida supreme court has not yet had occasion to construe arising out of sexual misconduct as it is used in the standard cgl,we approach this question as one of first impression to be resolved in a manner consistent with established general precepts of policy construction in place in the state of florida 
exclusionary clauses,generally considered contrary to the protective purpose of insurance,are construed narrowly against the insurer.see,deni assocs.of florida,state farm fire cas.ins,so d.in the absence of ambiguity in the policy language,however,rules of construction are unnecessary and courts will apply the plain language of the policy.see riveroll winterthur intern,so d,dca where no ambiguity exists in the policy,we will not impose a construction contrary to its plain language.
sexual misconduct,though not defined in the cgl,has a single clearly defined meaning it is impossible to categorize the rape of the victim as other than an act of sexual misconduct.therefore,the rape of the victim unambiguously falls within the sexual misconduct exclusion.
the florida courts have already defined and applied the term arising out of as broader in meaning than the term caused by and mean ing originating from,having its origin in,growing out of,flowing from,incident to,or having connection with.hagen aetna casualty surety,so d,dca citing national indemnity corbo,so d dca.the florida courts have held that use of the phrase arising out of indicates a causal relationship to the incident.see,almayor state farm fire casualty,so d dca finding that exclusion did not apply because injuries did not arise out of particular excluded act,but rather,arose out of a coincidental and legally remote source.this is consistent with the general consensus of other jurisdictions that the phrase arising out of requires some causal connection to the injuries suffered,but does not require proximate cause in the legal sense.see,federal ins.ins,cir collecting cases from various jurisdictions that discuss arising out of in the insurance context citations omitted.indeed,cases interpreting the phrase arising out of in insurance exclusionary provisions suggest a causation more analogous to but for causation,in which the court examining the exclusion inquires whether there would have been personal injuries,and a basis for the plaintiff suit,in the absence of the objectionable underlying conduct.bagley monticello ins.
florida law cautions that courts must not add meaning to the terms of an insurance policy to create an ambiguity where none exists.ajax building hartford fire ins,cir citations omitted.we find nothing about the sexual misconduct exclusion ambiguous.consequently,the rule concerning ambiguities is not applicable.the defendants,correctly,do not contend that the sexual misconduct exclusion is ambiguous.moreover,though no florida court has specifically examined such an exclusion,we find the sexual misconduct exclusion here unambiguous,and,therefore apply its plain meaning.
arising out of 
it is now our chore to apply the admitted facts to the policy provision excluding injuries arising out of acts of sexual misconduct.the plain meaning of the exclusion begs the simple question did the acts of the perpetrator arise out of the sexual acts we find that they did not.
the sexual misconduct exclusion here excludes coverage for injuries arising out of or resulting from any actual or alleged act of sexual misconduct of any kind.the record,however,is replete with acts committed by the perpetrator before and after the rape had taken place during the course of the incident.each act,independent of the sexual acts,would constitute a distinct crime under florida law.in particular,the incident began when the perpetrator hit the victim on the head and threatened to kill her constituting an assault under section,florida statutes,and a battery under section.in the initial minutes of the incident,the perpetrator also battered the daughter when he pushed her into her car seat,bruising her back.the perpetrator committed aggravated assault under section by threatening the victim and her children with a knife first entering the van and again when he forced the victim to withdraw money from the bank.the victim was again battered when the perpetrator hit her on the head because the children were screaming while she performed oral sex on him.the perpetrator committed robbery under section when h
