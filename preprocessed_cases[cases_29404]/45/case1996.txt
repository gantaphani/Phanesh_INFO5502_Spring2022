christina pacheco appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of shelter mutual insurance company shelter mutual and shelter general insurance company shelter general.we reverse and hold that shelter general policy exclusion of resident relatives who own a vehicle from uninsured motorist coverage violates colorado public policy.in so doing,we agree with the district court that issues of fact remain regarding whether shelter general properly advised and offered coverage in an amount equal to the bodily injury limits for that policy.finally,we decline to address pacheco argument that her own shelter mutual policy coverage can be stacked with the shelter general policies issued to her parents,leaving this issue to be addressed in the first instance by the district court on remand.
on august,pacheco was injured in an automobile accident caused by an underinsured motorist she settled with the tortfeasor insurer for,the maximum amount recoverable under his policy limits.at the time of the accident,pacheco was the named insured on shelter mutual policy policy,which covered the vehicle she was operating at the time of the accident.pacheco parents,bernice and tino pacheco,with whom she resided,were the named insureds on shelter general policies policy and policy.seeking compensation for her remaining damages,pacheco submitted a claim for benefits to her insurer,shelter mutual,and to her parents insurer,shelter general.both insurance companies denied coverage,and pacheco instituted an arbitration action against shelter mutual.the arbitration panel determined she sustained in bodily injury damages and awarded her interest on the unpaid amount pursuant to and costs.finding coverage under her policy,the arbitration panel awarded her the policy limit of less received from the tortfeasor settlement for a total of.the arbitration panel held that it did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the limits on policy should be increased or whether pacheco could stack coverage from her parents policies.shelter mutual paid pacheco the but not the costs award.
pacheco brought suit in colorado state court against shelter mutual and shelter general seeking a reformation of policy by asking the court to declare that the policy should be construed to provide a limit for coverage because shelter general failed to properly offer coverage in an amount equal to the bodily injury limits and to obtain rejection of such coverage in writing in accordance with.she also asserted that the language in the two policies issued to her parents was not applicable to her situation and that she was therefore entitled to damages resulting from the stacked policies.
defendants removed the case to federal court and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the court denied pacheco motion,concluding that there were issues of fact as to whether shelter general met its obligation to pacheco parents to properly advise and offer them coverage in an amount equal to the bodily injury coverage of that policy.the court then granted summary judgment to defendants,holding that pacheco was not an insured under her parents policies.the court relied on the relevant policy provision which provides we will pay damages for bodily injury which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle insured means a you and any relative.at the policy defines relative as a person related to you by blood,marriage,or adoption and who is a resident of and actually living in your household,provided neither the relative nor the relative spouse owns,in whole or in part,an auto.id.at,emphasis added.the policies definition of relative applies to both bodily injury liability coverage and coverage.the district court noted that although pacheco was a relative residing in the home,the condition limiting the policy definition of a relative effectively excluded her from coverage.
because the district court determined pacheco was not an insured under her parents policies,it did not reach the issue of whether those policies could be stacked with hers to allow her to recover the remaining in damages.moreover,the determination that pacheco was not an insured effectively mooted the question whether shelter general had met its obligation to properly advise pacheco parents regarding coverage in an amount equal to bodily injury coverage.
this appeal involves the body of law surrounding uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage in the state of colorado this action arises under a prior version of the statute,colorado revised statute,and the former colorado auto accident reparation act act,colorado revised statute to.the act was repealed effective july,pursuant to a sunset provision.see,amended by.sess.laws,ch.and.sess.laws,ch.
the act and the statute worked in tandem to require motor vehicle owners to obtain liability insurance while ensuring that individuals purchasing such coverage had the option of protecting themselves against uninsured and underinsured motorists.as declared by the general assembly,the purpose of the act was to avoid inadequate compensation to victims of automobile accidents and to require registrants of motor vehicles in this state to procure insurance covering legal liability arising out of ownership or use of such vehicles and also providing benefits to persons occupying such vehicles and to persons injured in accidents involving such vehicles.the purpose of the statute was to assure the widespread availability to the insuring public of insurance protection against financial loss caused by negligent financially irresponsible motorists.aetna cas.sur.mcmichael,en banc quoting.sess.laws declaration of purpose see also deherrera sentry ins,coverage replaces the benefits an innocent injured insured would have recovered from an uninsured or underinsured tortfeasor,if the tortfeasor had been insured for liability coverage to the same extent that the injured insured was covered for benefits.
the first question we address on appeal is whether a colorado insurance policy could,in,exclude resident relatives who own a car from coverage.pacheco argues that the policy exclusion violates public policy.we agree.for the reasons that follow,we hold that where colorado statutory law defined insured to include relatives of the named insured who reside in the same household as the named insured,a policy that attempted to exclude from coverage relatives meeting that definition is void and unenforceable.
pacheco filed a motion with this court to certify this question to the colorado supreme court.she did not request certification in the district court,however,and w e generally will not certify questions to a state supreme court when the requesting party seeks certification only after having received an adverse decision from the district court.in re midpoint,cir quotation marks omitted.furthermore,we are not convinced the issue is so novel that its resolution requires further guidance from the colorado supreme court.see pino united states,cir.after the district court decision in this case,the colorado court of appeals issued an unpublished opinion directly on point.see state farm mut.auto.ins.am.family mut.ins,wl.july,unpublished decision hereinafter the meza case although the decision does not have precedential value,in re title and ballot title and submission clause for,opinions not selected for publication have no value as precedent welby gardens adams county bd.of equalization,en banc same,we consider its reasoning persuasive and in accord with colorado law.
