introduction 
a workers compensation insurer,republic indemnity company of america republic,appeals after a jury awarded million in compensatory and punitive damages in an insurance bad faith and breach of contract action brought by an insured employer,lance camper manufacturing corporation lance camper.
contrary to republic contentions,the award of contract damages is supported by substantial evidence,and no instructional error occurred regarding the concept of bad faith.there is no requirement that lance camper establish republic conduct in setting reserves was inconsistent with what another reasonable insurer might do.rather,the standard as to reserves is that they must be set at the reasonable expectation of the claim value.nor is there any merit to republic invitation essentially to judicially legislate a new theory limiting the tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing only to violations of a public duty independent of the contract.and the jury was properly instructed on punitive damages,which were supported by clear and convincing evidence.
we also find largely unavailing lance camper seeking prejudgment interest on certain attorney fees and recovery of several additional cost items.the trial court properly denied the requested prejudgment interest and did not abuse its discretion as to costs,except as to court reporter fees that are mandated by statute.
in the published portion of this opinion,we address only breach of contract and tort damages issues.
factual and procedural summary 
discussion 
republic appeali.the award of contract damagesa.breach of contract 
republic urges that the award of contract damages should be reversed because the jury finding of breach of contract is not supported by substantial evidence.but the substantial evidence contention is novel because of republic theory that lance camper was required but failed to prove conduct inconsistent with what a reasonable insurer might do.
we start from the undisputed premise that an insurer pattern of failing to pay claims promptly,defend them diligently,or assign them reasonable reserves,followed by improperly failing to pay dividends to the insured,may constitute breach of the express and implied contractual terms in a workers compensation insurance policy.lance camper manufacturing republic indemnity th,d hereinafter lance camper i tricor california,state compensation ins.fund th,d security officers service,state compensation ins.fund th,d.as we stated in lance camper i,supra,th at page,d,a failure to reasonably evaluate claims prior to setting reserves,inadequate monitoring of claims by the insurer,failure to minimize claims,failure to communicate with the insured,hiring of inadequate and incompetent legal and medical counsel,and unnecessary delays in closing claims constitute claims handling practices that are actionable.
we also acknowledge that,as to the major issue of the setting of reserves,it is a task that requires the exercise of judgment and is not an exact science.insurers have discretion in setting reserves,and there is an acceptable range of reserves a carrier could set without incurring liability.a particular reserve amount may be substantially more or less than the amount ultimately paid on a particular claim.macgregor yacht state comp.ins.fund th,d,hereinafter,macgregor.
republic theory of the lack of substantial evidence of its breach of contract,however,goes where no case has gone before.republic argument is that lance camper should have been required to establish that the reserves republic set and the incurred but not reported ibnr fee it imposed as a present charge for potential future claims were outside the range of permissible decisions that other carriers could have made.this notion,for which there is no legal support directly on point,is without merit for several reasons.
republic proposed rule would permit insurers deliberately to set reserves at the highest end of the spectrum,thus resetting the range of typical reserves and skewing it to the high end.insurers could also conveniently put a legal rubber stamp of approval on their prevailing practices.insurers could establish and their own prevailing practices of setting high reserves,without regard for the need to act in good faith and contrary to the insurer obligat ion to give the interests of the insured at least as much consideration as it gives to its own interests.silberg california life ins.cal d,see macgregor,supra,th at,d.
for example,if the prevailing custom among insurers were to set reserves with a scenario analysis,those improperly high reserves would,according to republic reasoning,become reasonable and proper.that can not be.simply put,as a mother might say to her child,just because other insurers do it,does not necessarily make it right.we adhere to the current standard requiring that reserves be set at the reasonable expectation of the claim value and decline the invitation to create by judicial fiat a new rule.
even assuming arguendo that republic proposed new rule applied,the evidence in the present case actually meets even the greater burden that republic seeks to impose.lance camper expert witness frank raab testified that under the insurance industry standards,as a rule of thumb,reserves on a claim more than one year old should be no more than approximately percent higher than the amount actually paid at the time of closing.even republic own expert witness,robert hollingshead,stated it was the industry standard that at the time of closing,reserves should not exceed the actual closing cost by more than percent.but,as explained by raab,republic lance camper claims by approximately percent at the time of closing.taking into consideration republic fee,which applied in of the files for which records existed,the situation was even more egregious.republic by approximately percent.though hollingshead came to a different conclusion using different figures,the jury was entitled to find that portion of his testimony not credible.
moreover,it is reasonable to infer that other insurers generally adhered to raab description of the insurance industry standard and rule of thumb on the range of typical reserves,otherwise it would not be a standard or rule of thumb.accordingly,republic of approximately or percent were far beyond any acceptable range,far beyond the range of percent above actual cost or percent according to hollingshead,which other carriers would have set.it is thus apparent not just that lance camper experts may have set reserves differently,but that substantial evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom established that republic set reserves beyond the range generally acceptable in the industry.
lance camper expert witness robert drake also specifically testified that republic increases in reserves,on the claims that resulted in the substantial reduction in dividends payable to lance camper,were timed to eliminate or reduce those dividends,and based upon a scenario analysis rather than the required reasonable expectation of the claim value.republic also ignores its improprieties that contributed to higher reserve settings over a longer period of time,and thus reduced dividends payable to lance camper.for example,republic ignores substantial evidence that as to some claims it did not properly develop evidence in defense of claims,that it delayed for unreasonable periods of time taking action on claims with claims sometimes open for years longer than they should have been,and that it unreasonably imposed charges such as the ibnr.all of these tactics contributed to reductions in the dividends to lance camper.
republic also inappropriately relies upon several statutory provisions.republic urges that drake improperly disregarded the medical opinion of the workers doctors,contrary to california public policy,as codified in labor code section,which requires carriers to presume the medical reports prepared by the workers treating physicians are correct unless those reports are rebutted by the preponderance of medical opinion from other qualified examiners first,this argument ignores the evidence that,in many cases where republic should have obt
