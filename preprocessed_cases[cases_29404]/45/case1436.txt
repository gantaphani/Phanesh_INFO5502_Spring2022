jacqueline and alan avritt appeal from the district court order denying class certification for a group of california residents who purchased fixed deferred retirement annuities from northern life insurance company northern between and.the avritts maintain that northern engaged in unfair and deceptive practices by systematically crediting higher interest to the most recent deposits in its customers annuity accounts and crediting lower interest to older deposits.the district court determined that class certification was not appropriate because the plaintiffs claims involved a number of individual issues that could not be resolved on a basis,including whether northern misled the plaintiffs about its practices and whether the plaintiffs relied upon any such misrepresentations.because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to certify the class,we affirm.
factual background 
fixed deferred annuities are investment products that allow individuals to make deposits into an account for a given period of time,earn interest on the accruing balance,and later receive regular payments based on the money that has accumulated in the account.the policies are structured so that the annuitant receives a guaranteed minimum interest rate and the company issuing the policy retains discretion to credit interest above that rate.the annuities present a tax advantage in that the money invested is not taxed as income until it is withdrawn.because of the tax advantage and relative safety of the investment,some individuals use fixed deferred annuities to augment their retirement savings.
the avritts are california residents who purchased fixed deferred annuities from northern.the gravamen of their complaint is that northern engaged in a misleading practice,wherein the interest that it credited on recent deposits was consistently higher than that which it credited on older deposits.they essentially allege a scheme which encouraged individuals to purchase northern annuities based on the false assumption that the initial,favorable interest rate would be maintained over time.they also argue that northern breached its contract by failing to credit interest in the manner indicated in its policies.
northern method 
the relevant language in the annuity policies at issue here read as follows 
we guarantee an effective yearly interest rate of three percent.
from time to time,interest greater than the guaranteed rate may be credited in a way set by our board of directors.there may be more than one interest rate in effect at any time.
the contracts also included two hypothetical illustrations that assume the annuitant will receive only the minimum three percent interest.
northern obtained its profit by maintaining a spread between the interest that it earned on the money invested in its annuities and the interest,above the guaranteed minimum,that it paid to its policyholders.northern method of establishing the spread involved distinguishing between recent deposits and older deposits.for newer deposits,the spread between what northern made on its investments and what it paid to a policyholder was typically to other words,northern made less profit.
one way to understand this practice is to consider that each new deposit is initially credited at an introductory rate and earns higher interest.over time,however,the introductory rate is eliminated so that the interest paid on the deposit reflects the average spread differential targeted by northern.the underlying practice at issue of paying a higher introductory rate on more recent common throughout the industry,and annuity buyers guides caution against purchasing an annuity based solely on its introductory rate.the plaintiffs own expert testified that there are plenty of companies that initially credit higher interest on deposits than they can afford,and i f the policyholder knows that going in,that fine.rather,as the plaintiffs expert sees it,the problem is whether there is full disclosure.the record suggests that northern had some concern about its obligation to disclose its method to its customers,noting in a internal memo that o ur current approach of saying nothing is not acceptable in the long run.
northern annuities were marketed by a sales force that included thousands of independent insurance agents who were aware of the various interest rates that northern credited on deposits.these agents were not required to follow any particular sales script when they sold northern annuities and were free to answer any questions that customers had about the product.although the internal memo suggests that the sales agents initially may not have known that the different interest rates reflected northern practice of offering higher rates on more recent deposits,northern vice president of sales,steve barron,testified that the practice was disclosed in sales meetings at some point.baron also testified that the sales agents were told that they might want to consider discussing northern methods with customers.brad corbin,who began as an independent agent with northern in and eventually became head of the company sales department,testified that in discussions with customers,sales agents would sometimes compare northern approach of subsidizing new money rates to another company use of an explicit first year bonus.according to corbin,prospective customers would frequently ask about bonuses,and sales agents would explain that northern implicit bonus was advantageous because it was eliminated over a longer period of time.
there is some evidence that northern practice was inadequately disclosed in the mandatory filings that the company was required to submit to regulatory agencies.northern was obligated to inform state regulators of the method through which it determined the interest payable to its policyholders.according to the plaintiffs experts,northern inaccurately characterized its method as being entirely dependent on the performance of the underlying investments,omitting the fact that it lowered interest rates on old funds to recoup its initial subsidy of newer deposits.in,state regulators began an investigation of northern practices,but no final determination has yet been made about the legality of the company conduct.
b.the avritts annuity purchases 
alan avritt purchased his annuity in with the help of a financial advisor.he did not receive any sales materials from northern and he did not compare northern interest rates with those of other annuity providers or the market in general.the financial advisor who spoke with alan avritt told him that northern was a good company and that the annuity would provide a good rate of return.alan avritt did not undertake any independent investigation before making the decision to purchase the product.after his purchase,he made monthly deposits into the annuity for the next fourteen years.
the interest that northern paid on alan avritt deposits varied over the life of the policy but was at all times greater than three percent,often ranging between five and six percent.from until,alan avritt received account statements indicating the interest that was being credited to his account.the statements showed that he was receiving different interest rates on recent deposits than he was on older deposits,with deposits made during the current year generally credited a higher rate than those made in previous years.the reason for the difference,however,was not explained.beginning in,northern changed the format of its account statements so that the different rates were not apparent to policyholders.
jacqueline avritt periodically reviewed alan avritt account statements to see how the investment was performing.in,she purchased her own fixed deferred annuity from northern through a financial advisor.she did not receive any brochures or sales materials and did not compare northern interest rates with those of other annuity providers.jacqueline avritt could not remember the interest rate quoted to her at the time of her purchase but remembered thinking that it was good,and she believed her financial advisor advice that northern would pay a good rate.following her purchase of the annuity,jacqueline avritt made monthly deposits for a number of years.the interest credited to her deposits varied but was at all times greater than the guaranteed minimum of three percent.
procedural history 
the avritts sued reliastar in,alleging,among other things,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unjust enrichment,violation of the washington consumer protection act,and violation of the california unfair competition law.after denying reliastar motion to dismiss,the district court considered the avritts motion for class certification.the district court assumed without deciding that the avritts could satisfy the initial requirements for class certification in federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court,however,rejected the avritts contention that they could satisfy the additional requirements in rule b or b.the court concluded that the avritts focus on monetary damages precluded rule b certification on the basis that injunctive or declaratory relief was appropriate to the class as a whole.it then considered the nature of each of the avritts claims and determined that they had failed to establish that common questions predominated over individual issues,as required for certification under rule b.in particular,the court found that the express terms of the annuity contract did not obligate northern to credit interest in any particular manner and that establishing reliastar liability would thus require evidence of how its product was marketed to each purchaser.
after class certification was denied,the avritts conceded that they could not meet the amount in controversy requirement to sustain diversity jurisdiction,whereupon the district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court denial of class certification for abuse of discretion.petrovic amoco oil,cir.federal rule of civil procedure a sets out four threshold requirements that must be met before a plaintiff may file a lawsuit on behalf of a class of persons.once those prerequisites have been met,the plaintiff must also establish that the class fits within one of three types of class actions listed in rule b.like the district court,we will assume that the avritts could satisfy the prerequisites of rule a and will focus our attention on their arguments that the class should be certified under rule b or b.
rule b requirement of common questions of law or fact 
under rule b,the district court may certify a class action if it finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.the rule b predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.amchem,windsor.at the core of rule b predominance requirement is the issue of whether the defendant liability to all plaintiffs may be established with common evidence.see blades monsanto,cir.if,to make a prima facie showing on a given question,the members of a proposed class will need to present evidence that varies from member to member,then it is an individual question.id.if the same evidence will suffice for each member to make a prima facie showing,then it becomes a common question.id.in making its determination,the district court must undertake a rigorous analysis that includes examination of what the parties would be required to prove at trial.see elizabeth montenez,cir.the court may also be called upon to resolve disputes concerning the factual setting of the case.blades,at.as explained below,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the avritts theories of liability could not be supported solely with reference to proof 
breach of contract 
the avritts first claim that northern breached the express terms of its annuity contracts by failing to adhere to its promise to credit interest in a way set by our board of directors.the avritts argue that northern violated this contractual language in two respects first,by failing to credit interest in a single way and instead treating newer deposits differently than older deposits and second,by failing to have its board of directors set the way that interest would be credited.in support of the latter argument,the avritts cite portions of the record in which a witness for northern testified that the board reviewed and approved interest rate recommendations made by the company actuaries.the avritts apparently conclude that this description of the board actions does not amount to setting the interest rate.they further contend that northern express breach of contract establishes its liability to the entire class,and they fault the district court for giving their breach of contract claims minimal consideration in its order denying class certification.
the district court skepticism toward the avritts breach of contract claims was well founded.as an initial matter,it is not clear that any members of the putative class,let alone a substantial number of them,originally understood the contract language in the manner that the avritts now propose.the record indicates that the avritts themselves attached little significance to the phrase at issue.their current interpretation of northern obligation to credit interest in a way set by our board of directors is at least subject to reasonable dispute.one reasonable reading of that language is simply that northern retained discretion over how it credited interest,not that it was required to use a single,uniform formula for calculating all interest payments.indeed,the very next sentence in the contract notifies purchasers that t here may be more than one interest rate in effect at any time.it is likewise unclear that the contract dictated any particular role for the board of directors other than to ratify the company interest crediting method in some manner.
assuming that the avritts interpretation of the contract is plausible,however,the existence of two or more reasonable interpretations opens the door for extrinsic evidence about what each party intended when it entered the contract.see brogan anensen llc lamphiear,per curiam holding that extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine the contracting parties intent with respect to ambiguous contract terms see also schnall v.at t wireless,observing that washington courts permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to interpret standardized contracts in addition to extrinsic evidence about northern intent,reliastar would be entitled to introduce evidence about how the contract was explained in various sales discussions and whether each purchaser understanding of the contract was consistent with the theory the avritts now advance.thus,reliastar liability to the entire class for breach of contract can not be established with common evidence.
as the district court recognized,an additional problem with the avritts breach of contract claim is the relationship between the alleged breach and the avritts theory of damages.the court determined that the avritts articulation of damages rested upon their belief that northern should have adopted a particular approach to crediting example,maintaining the initial,higher interest rate for all deposits.even if the avritts interpretation of the contract language is correct,however,it does not follow that northern was contractually obligated to credit interest in the manner that they have suggested.the avritts insist that northern board was required to set interest in a single way for all deposits.but according to this interpretation,the board still retained discretion to fix the interest rate for all funds at three percent or slightly above,which would have actually been significantly lower than the rate that the avritts received.to establish any damages,the avritts must additionally allege either a duty not expressly delineated in the terms of the contract or some type of misrepresentation upon which they relied.the district court thus properly concluded that the true focus of the contract claims was not on the policy language itself but on the avritts allegation of an implied duty for northern to act honestly and fairly in establishing its rates.
accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the avritts were not entitled to class certification on their breach of contract claims.
implied covenant claims 
the avritts next contend that northern practices breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and that the breach can be established with evidence common to the entire class.they argue that although northern may have had discretion in determining how to credit interest,it was obligated to exercise that discretion honestly and fairly.the avritts maintain that northern breached its duty by setting rates in a manner that discriminated against older customers and misled prospective purchasers about the nature of the product.
all parties to a contract have duties of good faith and fair dealing.city of woodinville northshore united church of christ.the duty of good faith and fair dealing,however,arises only in connection with terms agreed to by the parties,and therefore does not create a duty of good faith unattached to the underlying legal document.badgett security state bank.applying these principles,the district court correctly determined that evidence of the representations made to each purchaser and the understanding that they attached to the contract would be essential to establishing liability.
as discussed above,the contract itself does not expressly guarantee any amount of interest above the three percent minimum.whether northern acted in bad faith by emphasizing its interest rate for new deposits and encouraging purchasers to believe that the introductory rate was indicative of future rates is a question closely tied to the circumstances of each individual plaintiff.if,for example,a prospective purchaser had discussed the issue of bonuses with a sales agent and had heard about northern implicit bonus structure,the subsequent use of that practice could hardly be considered bad faith with respect to that purchaser.liability might similarly be precluded in a scenario in which northern had made no representations about its rates other than what appeared in the contract,and a purchaser like jacqueline avritt bought an annuity with full knowledge of the rates that northern had credited over an extended period of time.as we explained in our discussion of the avritts breach of contract claims,analyzing contractual duties arising from an ambiguous document would likely require extrinsic evidence about the individual intent of each policyholder.
the avritts cite several cases for the proposition that the extent of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is defined by objectively reasonable conduct,but their argument misses the point that what is objectively reasonable depends on the nature and context of the parties bargain.for this reason,we are unpersuaded by the holding of the washington court of appeals in curtis northern life insurance,wl,unpublished,a parallel class action in washington state court.the curtis court held that a class action could be certified on the plaintiffs identical claim that northern breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing,based on common evidence that northern failed adequately to disclose its practices in its regulatory filings.this holding conflicts with established washington law that identifies the contract itself as the source of the duty.see badgett,at the duty of good faith implied in every contract does not exist apart from the terms of the agreement.although northern compliance with regulatory requirements might be relevant to the issue of whether the company conduct was objectively reasonable,the analysis of northern good faith duties can not be divorced from the underlying contract and the company relationship with each purchaser.the district court properly concluded that evidence of the parties justified expectations would be required to establish a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.and those expectations are likely to vary among members of the putative class based on,among other things,each purchaser individual interaction with sales agents.thus,the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that common questions did not predominate with respect to the plaintiffs implied covenant claims and refusing to certify a class on this issue 
washington consumer protection act 
the district court also denied certification for the avritts claim that northern actions violated the washington consumer protection act wcpa.ann,which declares unlawful any u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.we conclude that the avritts wcpa arguments are foreclosed by the washington supreme court recent holding in schnall v.at t wireless services,a case that was decided while the present case was on appeal.
in schnall,the washington supreme court considered the extraterritorial application of the wcpa and determined that t o state a wcpa claim a person must show that the unfair or deceptive act affected the people of the state of washington.id.at.the court explained that wcpa actions,whether they are pursued by the washington attorney general or a private citizen,may be brought only on behalf of persons residing within the state.id.at.the court analysis was unaltered by the fact that the defendant corporation was based in washington and engaged in the disputed transactions within the state.see id.at sanders,dissenting observing that the defendant was a washington corporation and that s ignificant portions of each transaction occurred in washington.
the avritts seek certification for a class of california residents who were allegedly injured by the activities of a company that was then based in washington.schnall makes clear that a wcpa claim can not succeed in this context.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification on this claim.see irving dormire,cir noting that we may affirm the district court rulings on any basis supported by the record.
california unfair competition law 
the avritts contend that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to certify a class action based upon violations of california unfair competition law ucl,which prohibits any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.cal.bus.the ucl is a broad statute that empowers california citizens to act as private attorneys general and seek restitution from businesses that engage in a wide range of improper or illegal activities.see id.as originally drafted,the ucl did not limit the filing of such lawsuits to individuals who had actually been harmed by the disputed business practice,and consequently the law became a font for abusive litigation.see in re tobacco ii cases tobacco ii,cal.in order to curb the filing of frivolous lawsuits,the ucl was amended by ballot measure in,and the statute now provides that a litigant has standing to file a lawsuit only if he or she has suffered injury as a result of the disputed business practice.see id.at.
the california supreme court recently considered the amendment and held that the new statutory standing requirement applies solely to the class representatives and not to all other class members.id.at.in reaching its conclusion,the court noted that prior to the amendment,california courts had repeatedly and consistently held that relief under the ucl is available without individualized proof of deception,reliance,and injury.id.at.the avritts argue that they are entitled to class certification on their ucl claim because they can establish that northern practice was unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent,and they maintain that in light of tobacco ii they are not required to produce evidence of individual class members reliance or injury.
we are unpersuaded,however,for several reasons.as an initial matter,it is not clear that the california supreme court discussion of standing in tobacco ii was meant to have any bearing on whether a plaintiff can satisfy the class certification requirement that common quest
