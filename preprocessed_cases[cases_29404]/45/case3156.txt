in this case,we must decide whether an insured failure to timely notify its insurer of a claim defeats coverage under the policy if the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay.we hold,as we did in hernandez gulf group lloyds,that an immaterial breach does not deprive the insurer of the benefit of the bargain and thus can not relieve the insurer of the contractual coverage obligation.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment,render judgment that the insurer could not deny coverage because of untimely notice,and remand the remaining issues to the trial court.
paj,a jewelry manufacturer and distributor,purchased a commercial general liability cgl policy from hanover insurance company that covered,among other things,liability for advertising injury.the policy required paj to notify hanover of any claim or suit brought against paj as soon as practicable.in,yurman designs,demanded that paj cease marketing a particular jewelry line,and a month later sued paj for copyright infringement.initially unaware that the cgl policy covered the dispute,paj did not notify hanover of the suit until four to six months after litigation commenced.
paj brought this suit against hanover seeking a declaration that hanover was contractually obligated to defend and indemnify paj in the copyright suit,and asserting several extracontractual claims.the parties stipulated that paj failed to notify hanover of the yurman claim as soon as practicable and that hanover was not prejudiced by the untimely notice.both parties moved for summary judgment on the notice issue based on these undisputed facts.the trial court granted hanover motion and denied paj,holding that hanover was not required to demonstrate prejudice to avoid coverage under the policy.the court of appeals affirmed.we granted paj petition for review to determine the effect on coverage when an insured fails to timely notify its insurer of a claim but the insurer suffers no harm as a result.
the hanover policies issued to paj provide coverage for advertising injury,which the policy defines to include injury arising out of copyright infringement.the policy contains a provision that requires paj to notify hanover of an occurrence or an offense that may result in a claim as soon as practicable.the parties dispute whether the policy requirement constitutes a condition precedent or merely a covenant.hanover contends the policy language creates a condition precedent,the failure of which defeats coverage under the policy irrespective of prejudice to the insurer.see hohenberg.george gibbons.paj,on the other hand,contends the language creates a covenant,the breach of which excuses performance only if the breach is material.see centex dalton.paj further asserts that even if the policy language creates a condition precedent to coverage,texas law nonetheless requires an insurer to demonstrate prejudice before it may avoid coverage based on untimely notice.we agree with paj that only a material breach of the timely notice provision will excuse hanover performance under the policy.
hanover pins its analysis on our decision in members mutual insurance cutaia,and that is where we will begin.the policy at issue in cutaia required the insured to forward any suit papers immediately to the insurer and provided that no action shall lie against the insurer unless,as a condition precedent thereto,there shall have been full compliance with all of the terms of this policy.id.at emphasis added.the insured failed to forward the suit papers to his insurer until five months after the occurrence in question.id.at.stipulating that it had suffered no harm,the insurer denied liability,contending a condition precedent to coverage had not been met.id.at.we agreed that the insured failure to timely comply with the policy forwarding condition precluded the insurer liability whether or not prejudice resulted.id.at.but we emphasized the apparent injustice which results in this particular case,and deferred consideration of the issue to the state board of insurance or the legislature.id.
the state board of insurance responded the very next year by issuing board order,which requires a mandatory endorsement to all texas cgl policies that precludes forfeiture of coverage for an insured failure to comply with notice or forwarding conditions unless the insurer is prejudiced thereby.see state board of insurance,revision of texas standard provision for general liability,order.
the endorsement provides 
as respects bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage,unless the company is prejudiced by the insured failure to comply with the requirement,any provision of this policy requiring the insured to give notice of action,occurrence or loss,or requiring the insured to forward demands,notices,summons or other legal process,shall not bar liability under this policy.
id.it is important to note that,at the time the state board of insurance created this endorsement,there was no standard coverage for advertising injury 
two decades after board order became effective,we decided hernandez.there,the insured sought recovery under the motorist provision of an automobile policy.the insurer denied liability because the insured had settled the underlying claim without the insurer consent in violation of the policy settlement without consent exclusion.applying fundamental principle s of contract law,we held that when one party to a contract commits a material breach,the other party performance is excused.id.at.in determining the materiality of a breach,we said,courts must consider,among other things,the extent to which the nonbreaching party will be deprived of the benefit that it could have reasonably anticipated from full performance.id.at citing restatement second of contracts a.without distinguishing between covenants and conditions or classifying the exclusion as one or the other,we concluded that the insured breach of the provision was immaterial and thus the insurer could not avoid liability under the policy.id.at.notably,we recognized that m ost other jurisdictions presented with this issue have likewise imposed a prejudice requirement,primarily on public policy grounds.id.at.the sole dissenting justice in hernandez posited,as hanover does here,that cutaia likewise involved a coverage condition and thus precluded liability irrespective of harm.id.at enoch,dissenting.the court apparently rejected this position.
since our decision in hernandez,courts and several major treatises have acknowledged texas as a state that has adopted a rule.see,ridglea estate condo.ass lexington ins,cir relying on hernandez and stating that texas requires a showing of prejudice for insurer to avoid coverage because of untimely notice under an occurrence policy,even for types of insurance not covered by board order booking star mgmt,cir citing hernandez and stating texas courts allow an insurer to deny coverage only for a material breach of its insurance contract hanson prod.ams.ins,cir same eric mills holmes,holmes appleman on insurance law and practice ed.in hanson,for example,the fifth circuit read hernandez to require a demonstration of harm for an insurer to avoid its coverage obligation when the insured fails to comply with a policy provision.at.summarizing our holding as a material breach by one contracting party excuses performance by the other party,and an immaterial breach does not,the fifth circuit concluded this fundamental principle of contract law applied with equal or greater force to notice clauses 
if anything,we believe that the failure to give notice of a claim poses a smaller risk of prejudice than failure to obtain consent to a settlement.in many instances of untimely notice of a claim,the insurer is not prejudiced at all,and ultimately may not face any coverage obligation.conversely,in many if not most cases where an insured settles a case without the insurer consent,the insurer faces at least some liability.if the texas supreme court does not presume prejudice in a case,we are persuaded that it would not presume prejudice in a case.
id.at.the fifth circuit noted a modern trend in favor of requiring proof of prejudice in this context and emphasized that in hernandez,our court considered the law of other jurisdictions and that our analysis is entirely consistent with this modern trend.see paul guardian ins.centrum,d,rejecting traditional view that an insurer need not prove prejudice to prevail in a case as inconsistent with hernandez and the modern trend that considers prejudice to an insurer a relevant factor in determining whether to enforce a condition precedent to insurance coverage see also prince george county local gov t ins.trust,counting states,including texas,as having adopted a rule in some form,with only six states and the district of columbia identified as adhering to the traditional rule 
the dissent today attempts to distinguish hernandez by characterizing the clause at issue in that case as a covenant rather than a condition,even though in hernandez we made no distinction between the two.they arrive at that conclusion only through reasoning,backwards,that because we required a showing of prejudice in hernandez,the policy language at issue must have been a covenant.in truth,the policy language we construed in hernandez is indistinguishable from that presented here.as under paj policy,the language before the court in hernandez provided 
this insurance does not apply a to bodily injury or property damage with respect to which the insured,without written consent of the company,makes any settlement with any person who may be legally liable therefor.
at policy language quoted by enoch,dissenting.the dissenting justice in hernandez,like the dissenting justices today,saw this language as rather clearly indicating a condition to coverage.see id.t his case is not about a breach of contract.this case is about coverage.nevertheless,we made no distinction between the two in deciding that the insurer had to show prejudice before it could avoid its coverage obligation.
the fact that hernandez involved a policy exclusion rather than a policy provision does not supply a valid ground for distinguishing its application here.exclusions and conditions are in effect two sides of the same coin exclusions avoid coverage if the insured does something,and conditions avoid coverage unless an insured does something.the dissent construction would have the absurd consequence that identical policy language creates a condition precedent as to one type of coverage advertising injury but a covenant as to the other bodily injury and property damage.we have said unequivocally that when a condition would impose an absurd or impossible result,the agreement will be interpreted as creating a covenant rather than a condition.criswell european crossroads shopping.
moreover,we question the dissent fundamental premise that the timely notice provision before us creates a condition precedent rather than a covenant.the policy language in cutaia specifically provided that no action shall lie against the company unless,as a condition precedent thereto,the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this policy.at emphasis added.the as a condition precedent language was deleted from the standard cgl policy following our decision in cutaia,and it does not appear in paj policy.while section iv is entitled commercial general liability conditions,the requirement appears in a subsection entitled duties in the event of occurrence,claim or suit and speaks in terms of what the insured must do if a claim is made against it,language that more closely resembles a covenant.see catherine mccauliff,corbin on contracts joseph perillo,landscape design,harold thomas excavating,writ ref.conditions are not favored in the law thus,when another reasonable reading that would avoid a forfeiture is available,we must construe contract language as a covenant rather than a condition.see criswell,at see also atofina petrochemicals,cont l cas.
in addition,the timely notice provision was not an essential part of the exchange under paj policy.the fifth circuit,applying texas insurance law,aptly describes the critical distinction between occurrence polices and policies as follows 
in the case of an occurrence policy,any notice requirement is subsidiary to the event that triggers coverage.courts have not permitted insurance companies to deny coverage on the basis of untimely notice under an occurrence policy unless the company shows actual prejudice from the delay.
matador petroleum paul surplus lines ins,cir citations omitted see also fdic booth,cir centrum,d at hirsch.lawyers ins,paso,writ denied.the dissent,by focusing on the type of coverage rather than the type of policy,entirely disregards this important distinction.
finally,and perhaps most disturbingly,the dissent analysis of the policy language would impose draconian consequences for even de minimis deviations from the duties the policy places on insureds.the policy in this case requires,in the same section at issue,not only notice of suit as soon as practicable,but also that paj immediately send copies of any demands,summonses or legal papers.thus,under the dissent construction,an insured failure to promptly forward a deposition notice or a certificate of conference would work a forfeiture of coverage,even when the insurer is not at all harmed.this is precisely the result that board order attempted to avoid and we rejected in hernandez.
we hold that an insured failure to timely notify its insurer of a claim or suit does not defeat coverage if the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment,render judgment that the insurer could not deny coverage because of untimely notice,and remand the remaining issues to the trial court.
i respectfully dissent.i would follow members mutual insurance and hold that a policy unambiguous language,a condition precedent to coverage,constitutes a defense to liability and must be enforced as written,unless positive law dictates otherwise because positive law does not dictate otherwise,i would affirm the court of appeals.
discussion 
paj argues that under hernandez gulf group and harwell state farm mutual automobile insurance the policy notice provisions are covenants,not conditions precedent to coverage,and therefore hanover must demonstrate prejudice before denying coverage for untimely notice.i disagree.settled texas precedent construes notice provisions as conditions precedent that impose no prejudice requirement,unless the policy literal text,a statute,or an agency directive demands it.
a.the timely notice provision is a condition precedent,not a covenant 
the parties dispute whether the policy language constitutes a condition precedent as hanover argues,the failure of which defeats coverage or a covenant as paj argues,the breach of which,if immaterial,does not defeat coverage paj concedes that f or years,texas courts have held that timely notice of suit provisions in liability insurance policies are conditions to coverage and that a long line of texas cases hold s that the notice requirements of policies similar to the policies in this case are conditions precedent to liability,but contends that those cases involved materially different policy language.
this court has indeed repeatedly described insurance policy notice provisions as conditions precedent to coverage in,we held in cutaia that when a notice provision requiring the immediate forwarding of suit papers is breached,liability on the claim was discharged,and harm or lack of it resulting from the breach is immaterial.the policy in cutaia provided that no action shall lie against the company unless,as a condition precedent thereto,the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this policy,including the notice requirement in issue 
paj insists the notice requirement in hanover cgl policy is necessarily a covenant because it omits the as a condition precedent thereto clause present in the cutaia policy.i disagree.magic words are not controlling labeling something a condition precedent does not make it so,and the absence of such a label does not make it not so.whether a notice provision constitutes a condition precedent turns on what the provision actually does,its nature and purpose,not merely on what it is called or because it appears under a heading,as here,that includes the word conditions.a condition precedent may be either a condition to the formation of a contract or to an obligation to perform an existing agreement.a condition precedent to an obligation to perform is an act or event that must occur before there is a right to immediate performance and before there is a breach of contractual duty failure to comply with such a condition forfeits coverage and releases the insurer from any duty to defend or indemnify by contrast,a covenant is an agreement to act or refrain from acting in a certain way,and only a material breach will forfeit coverage while no mantra or magic words are necessary,an intent to create a condition precedent is sometimes indicated by the use of conditional terms such as if,provided that,on condition that,or some similar limiting phrase that conditions performance as the court has explained,such terms usually connote an intent for a condition rather than a promise.
the notice provision at issue is a condition precedent,as coverage is expressly conditioned on compliance with the notice requirement.section iv of the policy,entitled commercial general liability conditions,contains a list of duties in the event of occurrence,offense,claim or suit,one of which states if a claim is made or suit is brought against any insured,you must n otify us as soon as practicable.section iv also specifies that n o person or organization has a right under this coverage part to sue us on this coverage part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with emphasis added.the requirement,expressly identified in the policy as a condition and,more importantly,providing that no suit may take place absent full compliance,is plainly a condition that precedes the insurer obligations to perform under the policy.
paj reliance on hernandez is misplaced.hernandez involved an insured breach of a exclusion in an automobile policy,which said that the insurance did not apply to bodily injury or property damage with respect to which the insured shall,without written consent of the company,make any settlement with any person or organization who may be legally liable therefor.rather than treat the exclusion as a condition precedent,the court viewed it as a covenant,an ordinary contractual obligation,the performance of which was excused only if the breach were material as such,we found it unenforceable absent a showing by the insurer that it has been prejudiced by an insured failure to obtain consent before settling.the court recognized a prejudice requirement in hernandez consistent with the basic contract law principle that one party breach of a covenant must be material in order to excuse performance by the other party 
hernandez analysis is inapposite here because paj did not breach a covenant.rather,it failed to comply with a condition precedent,a strict requirement that precedes any obligation on the part of hanover under the policy.as noted above,and as paj concedes,the court has long and consistently treated notice requirements as conditions precedent to coverage rather than covenants such treatment flows naturally from the fact that performance of an obligation to defend or indemnify can not ordinarily be expected of an insurer until it first receives notice of a claim existence.breach of a exclusion,on the other hand,might occur long after the insurer has learned of a suit and assumed its duty to defend.hence,i agree with the court of appeals in this case in recognizing a significant difference between a policy condition performance of which is necessary to trigger any obligation for coverage and a policy exclusion which operates only after the obligation for coverage is in place.further,treating every breach of a clause as automatically ending the insurer obligations not only makes little sense from a timing standpoint but also disserves the interests of both parties to the insurance contract.it is easy to conceive of instances where a resourceful insured succeeds through its own efforts in obtaining a favorable settlement that the insurer is only too happy to fund.considering the prejudice,if any,to the insurer of a breach of the consent requirement is therefore warranted.on the other hand,it is hard to conceive of an instance where a failure to give notice of a suit or claim at the outset of litigation would ever operate to the insurer benefit.in short,hernandez is distinguishable.
b.a defense should require no showing of prejudice unless the policy or positive law specifically provides otherwise 
paj reliance on our decision in harwell likewise falls short.in harwell,prejudice was expressly required by the policy itself if we show that your failure to provide notice prejudices our defense,there is no liability coverage under the policy.given this unambiguous requirement,we enforced the contract literal text and examined whether the insurer had in fact demonstrated actual prejudice paj policy,by contrast,does not require the insurer to show prejudice with respect to advertising injury claims.
in cutaia,we held that a defense requires no showing of prejudice,refusing to insert a provision that violations of conditions precedent will be excused if no harm results from their violation.the board of insurance now the texas department of insurance tdi responded the following year,issuing two board orders mandating a prejudice requirement for bodily injury and property damage coverage in automobile and general liability policies 
as respects bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage,unless the company is prejudiced by the insured failure to comply with the requirement,any provision of this policy requiring the insured to give notice of action,occurrence or loss,or requiring the insured to forward demands,notices,summons or other legal process,shall not bar liability under this policy 
paj casts this board action as a regulatory rejection of cutaia rule.as concerns the dispositive issue before us,i disagree.this policy language,while clearly applicable to the automobile policy in harwell,was not an abrogation of cutaia rule by its terms,the board endorsement reaches only certain lines of insurance and a defined subset of claims for bodily injury and property damage.
paj policy provided for three kinds of coverage coverage a,for bodily injury and property damage coverage b,for personal and advertising injury and coverage c,for medical payments.the agency required endorsement is targeted solely at coverage a.the endorsement imposes no prejudice requirement for any other types of coverages.
my construction of the policy is consistent with the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,meaning that the naming of one implies the exclusion of others this maxim,while not conclusive,is useful and applies perfectly here,where tdi prejudice requirement,by its terms,covers only a specified subset of claims.my construction also honors stare decisis as explained recently in fiess state farm lloyds in fiess,the court discussed one of our prior decisions and observed that if tdi disputed our construction of the insurance policy in that case,it is strange that insurance regulators did nothing to change the policy for a quarter century.in the instant case,the board acted following cutaia,but in a circumscribed manner.
the court points out that the prejudice requirement tdi imposed in predated the availability of cgl coverage for advertising injury.true enough,but as the court also acknowledges,such coverage has now been available through standard cgl policies for nearly three decades during which tdi declined to broaden its order even as new coverages,like advertising injury,were added to the standard cgl policy.given this lengthy inaction by the agency charged with mandating changes in policy forms,fiess counsels us to decline the invitation to overrule our earlier precedent if anything,the argument for deference to state regulators in the instant case is even stronger than it was in cutaia.the board responded swiftly following cutaia,to be sure,but also surgically,overriding cutaia as to some coverages but not others.the implication from this targeted response followed by decades of subsequent executive and legislative inaction is plain hanover must show prejudice from late notice of bodily injury and property damage claims but not from late notice of advertising injury claims.
i would reaffirm cutaia recognition that the legislature and the state agency overseeing the insurance industry are better suited to decide whether an insurer must show prejudice to deny coverage based on late notice.tdi and legislators are free to supplant cutaia rule with a more liberal rule if they believe,on public policy grounds,that the latter is preferable.i would not fault them for doing so.but when interpreting a contract,regulatory edict,statute,or matters,and key to formalism is consistency in entrusting policy matters to policymakers.
in any event,i find it understandable that an insurer would insist on a strict notice requirement.an insured failure to provide prompt notice of a suit or claim to an insurer,who has the resources and experience to handle such claims,can obviously work a substantial hardship on both the insurer and the insured.the insurer understandably wishes to discourage late notice and to avoid ancillary litigation devoted to whether or not it was prejudiced by a failure to provide prompt notice litigation could have the effect of raising premiums on all insured parties,thus forcing punctual insured parties to subsidize those who flout the policy notice requirements.
regardless of which side makes the superior public policy argument as to what an insurance policy should provide,i would decline to insert nonexistent language into the parties agreement.the court is construing a contract,not editing it,and just six months ago,in fortis benefits cantu,this court unanimously stressed that contract rights generally arise from contract language they do not derive their validity from principles of equity but directly from the parties agreement.fortis benefits directs courts in contractual interpretation cases to follow a modest,approach anchored in the parties agreed contract rather than imposing external,rules.indeed,fortis benefits cited cutaia,which should control today,for the sound principle that balancing policy concerns is best left to nonjudicial bodies the court affirmed that view last year in fiess when it concluded if the political branches of texas government decide that mold should be covered in texas insurance policies,they have tools at their disposal to do so texas courts must stick to what those policies say cutaia core holding remains valid.o n balance it is better policy for the contracts of insurance to be changed by the public body charged with their supervision or by the legislature,rather than for this court to insert a provision that violations of conditions precedent will be excused if no harm results from their violation.
in a brief,hanover points out that since october a texas changes endorsement,designated endorsement cg and published by the insurance services office iso,has included a prejudice requirement for personal and advertising injury claims as well as bodily injury and property damage claims.hanover alternatively describes this endorsement as approved or required by tdi.under current and prior law,tdi has been authorized to approve standardized policy forms the iso is a national organization that publishes standard policy forms.the record and briefing before us are inconclusive as to whether tdi has merely approved the use of this endorsement as one which may be used in texas cgl policies or has in effect required the use of the endorsement in all cgl policies by approving this form or otherwise mandating its use through some other mechanism.even if tdi now mandates a prejudice requirement for advertising injury claims in all texas cgl policies,that requirement,as hanover notes,was not imposed until some time in at the earliest and does not apply to the policy in the pending case.the parties stipulated that the hanover policies covered the period from july through june.it is undisputed that the iso endorsement used in the hanover policy in issue did not contain a prejudice requirement for advertising injury claims.for the reasons described above,i would not impose a prejudice requirement where the policy contains no such language and where tdi did not require such an endorsement at the time the policy was in if tdi has since changed the endorsement language that must be used.
today the court treats cutaia as a dead letter,overruled by hernandez,reasoning that the court in hernandez declined to draw any distinction between covenants and conditions and apparently rejected cutaia holding that failure to comply with a coverage condition precluded liability irrespective of harm i disagree.this court has never expressly equated covenants with conditions or abolished the sometimes fine but sometimes significant distinction between them texas law has traditionally viewed covenants and conditions differently.hernandez may not have classified the exclusion in that case as one or the other,but other decisions from this court have certainly done so.indeed,just one year after hernandez,in harwell,we retained the distinction,deeming the requirement in that case a condition precedent and not a covenant 
put simply,hernandez concerned a policy a policy this court has restated the distinction repeatedly since hernandez was decided in any event,hernandez did not overrule or modify cutaia,expressly or by implication the hernandez majority never even mentions cutaia.nor has any subsequent case from this court,until today,limited cutaia or remotely criticized it.for the reasons discussed above cutaia and hernandez can be reconciled,with today notice case falling squarely under cutaia,a case this court recently cited and unanimously reaffirmed for the core teaching regarding policy 
the court finds my reading of the policy unreasonable because identical policy language creates a condition precedent as to one type of coverage advertising injury,but a covenant as to the other bodily injury and property damage.i think my reading of the policy is exactly what is expected when a national insurance company uses a standard cgl form but modifies it only to the extent necessary to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the policy is sold,in this case texas.the policy generally provides that notice of an occurrence or claim is a condition precedent to coverage and that n o person has a right t o sue the insurer absent compliance with this requirement,as discussed more fully above,but modifies these standard provisions as needed to comply with texas law.hence,the policy includes an endorsement,titled texas requiring notice and providing that prejudice must be shown to deny coverage w ith regard to bodily injury and property damage liability only.the absence of a similar endorsement for advertising injury claims is unsurprising since texas law did not require such an endorsement.i see nothing odd or abhorrent in allowing an insurer to sell a policy using a nationally standardized form that is modified only to the extent necessary to comply with a unique texas requirement.
finally,the court views my approach as imposing draconian consequences for even de minimis deviations from the duties the policy places on insureds.in this case,paj failure to comply with the policy requirements can not be described as de minimis.the record shows that several months passed before paj notified hanover of the lawsuit,notification that paj admits was not as soon as practicable.paj was not merely facing an occurrence or a potential claim under the policy it had actually been sued.i do not intend to suggest that even the most trivial missteps in complying with notice or other policy requirements will justify total forfeiture of coverage.texas law,for example,has long recognized that substantial compliance with a policy notice or provisions will suffice and that trivial missteps in complying with notice or other policy requirements are excused i would leave intact the substantial compliance doctrine as to an insured myriad policy obligations,but there was no substantial comp
