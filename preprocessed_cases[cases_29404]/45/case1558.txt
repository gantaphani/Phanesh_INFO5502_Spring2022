donald sofonia appeals an order of the district court dismissing his claims for fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and unjust enrichment against principal life insurance company,principal financial group,and principal financial services,collectively,appellees in connection with the demutualization of principal life insurance company.the district court denied sofonia motion to remand the action to iowa state court and dismissed sofonia complaint based on application of the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa or the act,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.we affirm.
in march,the board of directors of principal mutual holding company pmhc,an iowa mutual insurance holding company,adopted a plan to demutualize,to convert from a mutual company into a stock company.as a mutual insurance holding company,pmhc had no stockholders.instead,pmhc was governed by the policyholders of its wholly owned subsidiary,principal life insurance company principal life,a stock life insurance company.principal life policyholders held membership interests in pmhc entitling them to,inter alia,vote on the election of pmhc directors and receive proceeds in the improbable event of pmhc liquidation.pursuant to the demutualization plan,all eligible principal life policyholders would receive shares of common stock of principal financial group,pfg,a publicly traded company,in exchange for their membership interests in pmhc the demutualization plan was submitted for approval to eligible principal life policyholders,each of whom received a notice package containing a policyholder information booklet explaining the demutualization,a proxy card for voting on the plan,and other related materials collectively,the pib.the iowa commissioner of insurance reviewed and authorized the demutualization plan and the pib,the required number of principal life policyholders voted in favor of the transaction,and the demutualization became effective in october.
in april,principal life policyholders settled a class action lawsuit alleging that principal life had engaged in deceptive sales practices.see grove principal mut.life ins,the grove class action.sofonia estimates that appellees paid approximately attorney settle the grove class action.
after the demutualization was completed,donald sofonia,a member of the grove class and the putative class representative in this appeal,filed a complaint in iowa state court alleging that appellees made deceptive statements in the pib that induced principal life policyholders to vote in favor of the demutualization.according to sofonia,this fraudulent conduct enabled appellees to improperly shift the economic costs of the grove settlement back to the grove class members because the grove class members received fewer shares of pfg common stock in the demutualization than they would have received absent appellees misconduct.
asserting application of slusa,appellees removed the action to federal court and moved for dismissal,arguing that sofonia complaint alleged misrepresentations or omissions in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities under the act.sofonia moved to remand the case to iowa state court,disputing appellees contention that slusa applied to preempt jurisdiction.
the district court denied sofonia motion to remand and granted appellees motion to dismiss.sofonia now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in concluding that the exchange of pmhc membership interests for shares of pfg common stock in the demutualization was a purchase of covered securities under slusa.sofonia also contends that the district court erred in concluding that his complaint asserts misrepresentations or omissions of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities under slusa.we review de novo both the district court denial of sofonia motion to remand,see nichols harbor venture,cir,and its dismissal of sofonia action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,see in re acceptance ins.sec,cir.
slusa,which amended the securities act of and the securities and exchange act of,expressly preempts all state law class actions based upon alleged untrue statements or omissions of a material fact,or use of a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.dudek prudential,cir.the act was intended to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to evade the protections that federal law provides against abusive litigation by filing suit in state,rather than in federal,court.an action is subject to removal and dismissal under slusa if the party seeking to invoke slusa application shows that the action is a covered class action as defined in the act the action purports to be based on state law,the action alleges that the defendant misrepresented or omitted a material fact or used or employed a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,and the action alleges that the defendant misrepresentations or omissions of material fact were made in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.b c,f see also green ameritrade,cir.sofonia concedes that appellees have satisfied the first and second lawsuit is a covered class action based on iowa state law.sofonia also concedes that appellees have satisfied the third lawsuit alleges that appellees misrepresented or omitted material facts in documents disseminated in connection with the demutualization.sofonia disputes,however,that appellees have satisfied the fourth his action alleges misrepresentations or omissions made by appellees in connection with a purchase or sale of a covered security.therefore,the critical question is whether the complaint can reasonably be read as alleging a sale or purchase of a covered security made in reliance on the allegedly faulty information provided to sofonia and to putative class members by appellees.green,at.
sofonia first argues that the district court erred in concluding that the demutualization involved covered securities as required for application of slusa.according to sofonia,t his case involves insurance products,not covered securities,and is therefore outside the scope of slusa.brief of appellant at.this argument is unavailing.
slusa defines a covered security as,inter alia,a security listed,or authorized for listing,on the new york stock exchange.b a see also merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d.while this definition excludes the pmhc membership interests surrendered by principal life policyholders in the demutualization,it includes the shares of pfg common stock received by the policyholders in exchange for their membership interests.because pfg common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange,it falls precisely within slusa definition of a covered security.the district court did not err in reaching this conclusion.
sofonia next argues that the district court erred in determining that his complaint asserted a claim that appellees misrepresented or omitted material facts in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.after concluding that the receipt of shares of pfg common stock by principal life policyholders in the demutualization was a purchase within the scope of slusa,the district court went on to conclude that sofonia claim that appellees made fraudulent statements in the pib in order to induce policyholders to approve the demutualization amounted to a claim that appellees misrepresented or omitted material facts in connection with the purchase of pfg common stock.the district court ultimately concluded that all requirements for application of slusa were satisfied.we agree.
we construe the phrase in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security as used in slusa by looking to interpretations of identical language used in b of the securities exchange act of,b,and in securities and exchange commission sec rule.see dabit.at confirming that reference to b and rule to interpret this phrase is appropriate green at to interpret the phrase in connection with a purchase or sale of a covered security,we look to cases interpreting identical language found in sec rule and b of the securities exchange act of
