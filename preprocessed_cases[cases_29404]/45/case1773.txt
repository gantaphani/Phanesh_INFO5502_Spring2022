appellant meritage homes of nevada,meritage appeals from the district court judgment and challenges orders denying its motion to strike or,in the alternative,issue a summons to certain third parties to this action and denying its motion for reconsideration.the crux of the dispute is whether the district court abused its discretion when it allowed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to satisfy a judgment against it with a receiver certificate rather than with cash.the district court had jurisdiction under b,we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
this case began in,when meritage submitted an administrative claim to the fdic in its capacity as receiver for the first national bank of nevada first national.in its administrative claim,meritage asserted that it had provided certain services to inca capital fund,llc inca pursuant to agreements that also involved first national predecessor bank,which had agreed to timely perform and cure all unfulfilled obligations of inca under the agreements.as a result of these agreements,meritage stated that first national was justly indebted to it.
the fdic disallowed meritage administrative claim.it explained its decision by stating that the documentation for the claim had not provided proof of a guarantee or promise to fulfill the obligations of the borrower.in response,meritage filed this action in the district of nevada.in its complaint,meritage brought various claims against both inca and the fdic.in particular,meritage alleged that it had been damaged by first national breach of the agreements discussed above that the fdic,as receiver for first national,was liable for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing due to first national failure to satisfy all obligations of inca under one of the agreements and that the fdic had been unjustly enriched by meritage valuable,uncompensated work as a result of by first national for which the fdic is now liable.
when neither the fdic nor inca responded to the complaint,meritage moved for default judgment,which the district court granted.the judgment entered by the district court stated that meritage had performed on its agreements with inca and first national,and that payment to meritage had become due for this work no later than june.the judgment went on to state that o n or about july,the fdic was appointed receiver of first national,thereby assuming all assets and liabilities of first national,including the obligation to pay meritage for the breach of the agreements.accordingly,judgment was entered in favor of meritage and against the fdic and inca,jointly and severally,in the principal amount of,along with interest.the judgment did not specify how it should be satisfied.
subsequently,the fdic provided meritage with a receiver certificate in the amount of the judgment.the fdic also filed with the district court a satisfaction of judgment,in which it stated that it had satisfied the judgment entered against it by delivering a receiver certificate to meritage.in response,meritage filed a motion styled as a motion to strike satisfaction of judgment,impose cash payment liability,or,in the alternative issue summons for joint obligors motion to strike.in its motion to strike,meritage sought to have the district court strike the fdic satisfaction of judgment and instead direct the fdic to pay the judgment in cash.in the alternative,meritage requested that the district court issue a summons to a pair of third parties to this action rescon and stearns.meritage made this request on the basis of its assertion that rescon and stearns were joint obligors on the judgment.thus,meritage contended that it was entitled to pursue its remedies against rescon and stearns pursuant to the execution provisions of the nevada revised statutes,and requested that a summons be issued to rescon and stearns accordingly.
the district court denied meritage motion to strike and found that the receiver certificate had effectively satisfie d the judgment.meritage then moved for reconsideration,which the district court also denied.this appeal followed.
we begin our analysis by considering the appropriate standards of review.the present appeal is from the district court denial of meritage motion for reconsideration,which we would normally review for abuse of discretion.see shalit coppe,cir.in that motion for reconsideration,meritage sought to have the district court reconsider its ruling on the motion to strike discussed above.our precedent does not make clear the standard of review for a district court ruling on such a motion.moreover,the legal basis for the motion to strike is unclear.the motion itself does not identify the legal authority under which it was brought,and the district court denied the motion in a terse order that offers no explanation of its ruling.
without reaching the abstract question of the standard of review for any motion to strike the satisfaction of a judgment,we conclude that the appropriate standard of review for the district court ruling on the particular motion before us is abuse of discretion.regardless of how it was captioned,the motion brought by meritage was effectively a motion to amend the judgment.we construe the motion in that light because it sought to require the fdic to satisfy the judgment with cash rather than a receiver certificate,even though the judgment itself did not state such a requirement.because a district court decision regarding a motion to amend the judgment is reviewed for abuse of discretion,barber state of,cir,we conclude that the proper standard of review for the ruling on the motion to strike in this case is abuse of discretion.
meritage motion to strike in the alternative also requested the district court to issue a summons to rescon and stearns pursuant to the execution provisions of the nevada revised statutes.again,our precedent does not make clear the standard of review under which we are to consider a district court ruling on such a request.indeed,in the motion to strike,meritage acknowledged that there has been no case law interpreting the relevant provisions of the nevada revised statutes.
in the absence of any such case law,we conclude that the proper standard of review for the district court ruling here is clear error.we reach this conclusion by analogizing to our precedent dealing with summonses issued by the internal revenue service irs.see,united states jose,cir en banc discussing generally the summons power of the irs.the irs is authorized by statute to inquire into tax liabilities by issuing summonses to third parties in connection with a tax liability investigation,but must bring an action in district court to enforce such a summons.united states richey,cir citation omitted.likewise,meritage motion to strike was based on the premise that meritage was authorized by a statute here,section of the nevada revised statutes to seek to have a summons issued against third parties to this action.in the irs context,we review the district court decisions for clear error.id.at citation omitted.thus,analogously,we hold that the district court denial of meritage request for a summons is to be reviewed for clear error.
having established the standards of review,we turn to the merits.we first consider whether the district court abused its discretion by declining to strike the fdic satisfaction of judgment and instead finding that the receiver certificate had satisfied the judgment against the fdic.we then consider whether the district court clearly erred when it declined to issue a summons to rescon and stearns.
as discussed above,we review the district court denial of meritage motion to strike for abuse of discretion.in deciding whether the district court abused its discretion,we employ a test.pimentel dreyfus,cir.first,we determine de novo whether the trial court identified the correct legal rule to apply to the relief requested.id.citation omitted.second,we determine whether the district court application of the correct legal standard was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.id.citation omitted.a decision based on an erroneous legal standard or a cl
