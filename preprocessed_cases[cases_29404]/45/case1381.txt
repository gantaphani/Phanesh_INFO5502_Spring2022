this is a procedurally complex case involving the arbitrability of subsidiary coverage in a liability insurance policy.the insurer,aislic,issued a liability policy to mci and its subsidiaries,the collectivity being designated on the first page of the policy as the named insured.a provision on subsidiary coverage extends the protection of the policy to any past subsidiary of the named insured.the policy insures against claims of liability that are first made against the insureds during the policy period arising out of wrongful acts committed by the insureds and insureds are defined redundantly as the named insured plus any subsidiary of the named insured,but only with respect to wrongful acts which occur while it is a subsidiary and are otherwise covered by this policy.disputes under the policy shall be subject to the alternate dispute resolution process adr set forth in the policy,and the named insured shall act on behalf of all insureds in selection of the adr in accordance with this clause.
a subsidiary of mci named mcis did a project for the new york police department that gave rise to a claim by the department against mcis for damages caused by alleged wrongful acts within the meaning of the policy.between the time the work was done and the claim for damages was made,mcis was sold to eds.because the claim was made while the policy that aislic had issued to mci was in force and arose from acts committed before mci sale of the subsidiary,eds believed that the subsidiary,the former mcis,retained coverage under the policy.aislic conceded as it must that the sale of a subsidiary does not eliminate coverage for wrongful acts committed before the sale,but denied that mcis new name after the sale had a valid claim under the policy,because,among other things,it had failed to give aislic timely notice of the police department claim or to obtain aislic consent to million settlement with the department.
invoked the adr clause of the policy,demanding arbitration the clause authorizes a choice between arbitration and mediation of its dispute with aislic,which responded by bringing this diversity suit against to enjoin arbitration and declare that claim has no merit.aislic joined eds as an additional defendant,doubtless to bolster its contention,discussed at the end of this opinion,that is not a real subsidiary but an indistinguishable commingled pile of eds assets.the defendants moved the district court under section of the federal arbitration act,for an order directing aislic to arbitrate the parties dispute.the court granted the motion and arbitration was then conducted that resulted in an award to of some million,which the district court confirmed and which aislic,appealing the confirmation under a d,challenges on the sole ground that had no right to arbitration.that is,aislic is not questioning the merits of the arbitration award in effect it is saying,the insured is right,but we want another tribunal to say so.
seeks to block aislic at the threshold by arguing that aislic willingly participated in the arbitration even to the extent of arguing nonarbitrability to the arbitrators and by doing so forfeited any challenge to arbitrability.now it is true that aislic could not be permitted to play heads i win tails you lose,by failing to challenge arbitrability until it had seen whether it had won or lost the arbitration.jones dairy farm local no,united food commercial workers int l union,cir jci communications,international brotherhood of electrical workers,local,cir.but it did do that it challenged arbitrability at the outset and participated in the arbitration only because the district court ordered it to do so.and the order may have been unappealable,in which event aislic could not have avoided participating in the arbitration by appealing to this court from the order to arbitrate.as a matter of fact,it tried to appeal from that order,and we dismissed the appeal,though,as we shall explain,not because it was unappealable.
the law relating to the appealability of judicial orders to arbitrate is intricate,as this case illustrates.an order directing as distinct from one denying,a b arbitration is nonfinal,and is expressly made nonappealable by b unless with the important qualification discussed next it is issued in a case brought to obtain that relief and nothing else.a.nazianz,cir perera siegel trading,cir university life ins.unimarc,cir stedor enterprises armtex,cir.this suit,in which the order to arbitrate was issued,was filed by the party desiring arbitration,which is,but by aislic,which was seeking an injunction against arbitration.it might seem to follow that the order to arbitrate was merely an interlocutory order in aislic suit.but and this is the qualification to which we alluded if the district judge dismissed aislic claim at the same time that it ordered arbitration,there would be nothing left of the case in the district court and so aislic could have appealed an order that terminates proceedings in the district court is final and appealable,whatever it is called.green tree financial randolph,d smith steinkamp,cir mccaskill sci management,cir amgen,kidney center of delaware county,cir in re chicago,milwaukee,paul pacific,cir university life ins.unimarc,supra,at.as the supreme court put it in green tree,an order to arbitrate is appealable,even if entered in a case in which other relief besides the order was sought,if the district court plainly disposed of the entire case on the merits and left no part of it pending before the court,even though the winner of the arbitration might later seek a judicial order confirming the award.green tree financial randolph,supra,at.cases which suggest that an order to arbitrate is either never final and appealable,such as perera siegel trading,supra,at,or that it is never final and appealable in a case in which other relief is sought,such as.nazianz,supra,at,can not survive green tree.
but did the judge in our case dispose of the entire case his order is ambiguous.on the one hand it says that the defendant be defendants motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss is granted emphasis added,but on the other hand it says that the action is dismissed pending resolution of the arbitration proceedings as outlined in open court.this the suggestion is reinforced both by the court not entering a judgment consistent with.terminating the case and by the court later action in confirming the arbitration award without requiring to file a separate the action was being stayed to await the outcome of the arbitration,at which point further relief might be sought from the court,for happened order to confirm the arbitration.yet we have suggested,in the amgen and unimarc cases cited earlier,that if all the judge is retaining jurisdiction for is to allow the arbitrator award to be confirmed without need for the filing of a separate lawsuit,the order to arbitrate is final final enough might be the better way to put it and therefore immediately appealable.if this is right it does seem sensible,since whether the winner of the arbitration sues to confirm his award or moves to confirm it is an unimportant detail,unaffected by green tree,the district judge order to arbitrate in this case was appealable.
nor did we suggest otherwise in dismissing appeal.we dismissed it as untimely,adding that since no rule is,a final judgment so denoted on a separate been entered,could refile its appeal after obtaining such a judgment.the absence of a rule judgment is evidence that the judge decision is not a final,appealable order,but it is not conclusive evidence.if there is nothing left in the district court,his decision is final and appealable even if he has failed to enter a rule judgment.bankers trust mallis,d per curiam tmf tool muller,cir.even so,the time within which the appeal must be filed does not begin to run until the rule judgment is entered.united states indrelunas,d per curiam in re kilgus,cir.wanting to have the issue of arbitrability settled as soon as possible,aislic and jointly moved the district judge to enter a rule judgment.he did not act on the motion,and so they went to arbitration.his failure to act was further evidence tha
