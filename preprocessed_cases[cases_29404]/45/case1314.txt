the defendant,life insurance company of north america lina,terminated the payment of long term disability benefits to the plaintiff,kathleen semien.in response,semien filed suit against her benefit plan,bp long term disability plan,and lina seeking an order compelling lina to continue payment of her disability benefits.
additionally,semien sought to compel discovery in order to gather evidence about the relationship between the physicians lina consulted and the insurer.the district court denied semien motion to compel discovery and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.semien appeals the district court denial of her discovery requests as well as the district court grant of summary judgment to lina.
for the following reasons,we now affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
kathleen semien is a old woman who began working for in february as an environmental remediation manager.on may,when semien left,she was employed as a chemical engineer.her occupation required significant travel,concentration,teamwork,and quick reactions.upon leaving her job,semien filed a disability claim with bp long term disability plan.
bp established its consolidated welfare benefit plan plan to provide disability benefits to eligible employees.bp adopted a plan governance amendment on january.the amendment defined an administrative named fiduciary as any entity that entered into an administrative services agreement with the plan administrator.administrative named fiduciaries were granted the authority to exercise such discretion as may be required to construe and apply the provisions of the plan,subject only to the terms and conditions of the plan.on april,lina entered into an administrative services agreement with semien employer covering disability claims arising out of the plan.as part of this administrative services agreement,lina would screen benefits and determine whether claims were payable under the plan.in addition,lina insured the benefits of employees under the plan.
semien asserts that she suffers from a variety of medical conditions back pain,a herniated lumbar disk,bone spurs in her neck,carpal tunnel syndrome,other problems in her joints and extremities,fibromyalgia a disease with no known causes or cure,but with symptoms including chronic pain all over,fatigue,disturbed sleep,and other problems,and past sickness as a result of hepatitis c.in addition to her alleged physical ailments,semien also claims to suffer from chronic depression and mental confusion.she has been described as having suicidal thoughts and masochistic,schizoid,and narcissistic features.semien is currently taking several medications for pain,sleeping problems,and depressive disorders.
lina received semien initial claim on september.this initial claim was approved on november.the bases for lina approval of benefits were side effects from hepatitis c,medication,fatigue,and pain.in its initial approval,lina stated its intent to monitor semien condition and reserved the right to request additional records.to receive benefits for the first months of disability insurance,semien only needed to show that she could not perform her regular occupation or a qualified alternative at bp.after the initial period,a more stringent standard applied.
during the initial disability period,semien submitted many medical records to lina.semien physicians also completed assessments on her behalf.some of these assessments indicated that semien was capable of performing moderate work,but cautioned that her abilities were limited.semien received fusion surgery on her back in january.
on may,lina sent semien a letter stating that she would remain eligible for benefits only if illness prevented her from performing any qualified work or earning or more of earnings.additionally,during this time period,semien disability payments were reduced in part to offset the money she received from social security disability payments.
in a letter dated november,lina notified semien that the information we have on file to date does not establish that you meet the policy definition of disabled.accordingly,long term disability benefits are not payable beyond november,under this policy.lina further explained,y our file was reviewed by a nurse care manager and a behavior care specialist.it was noted that the medical documentation does not support your inability to perform your occupation as an environmental business manager.accordingly no additional benefits are payable under the policy.
the language of the disability plan states 
after disability benefits have been payable for months,the employee is considered disabled if,solely because of injury or sickness,he or she is either 
unable to perform all the material duties of any occupation for which he or she is,or may reasonably become,qualified based on education,training or experience or 
unable to earn or more of his or her indexed covered earnings.
on march,semien appealed lina termination decision.she submitted a great deal of medical evidence to support her appeal.lina hired an independent psychiatric consultant,jack greener,to review the medical history in semien file.greener did not personally examine semien.
greener report concluded that semien depression was severe enough to prevent her from functioning in a work setting from january,to february.he stated that,the psychiatric documentation demonstrates a degree of depression of moderate severity and then of severe degree,which would preclude the client from performing her regular job according to the job description supplied.in an addendum to his original report,greener wrote,after careful review it is evident that the client is capable of performing a sedentary to light job,which does not require irregular and unplanned hours,evening meetings,responses hours a day,and emergency responses,which would require immediate attention and travel.
eddie sassoon,a physician retained by lina,also concluded from a review of semien medical records that she was capable of performing a sedentary or light duty occupation.semien contends that sassoon did not assess her psychiatric impairments or consider records from liu or nagle.it is unclear from sassoon evaluation,which consisted of only two pages,exactly what information he reviewed.sassoon stated that the report was completed in the interest of time constraints,based on the documentation provided,which was extensive in nature.
lynne lonberg,an independent senior rehabilitation counselor and vocational expert retained by lina,conducted a transferable skills analysis based on the physicians appraisals.in this analysis,lonberg listed several potential occupations semien could perform within her skills,education,abilities and wage requirement of of indexed covered earnings.potential suitable occupations included employment as a chemical engineer,chemical research engineer,or absorption and adsorption engineer.
in a letter dated june,lina affirmed its determination that semien was not disabled under the terms of the plan and therefore did not qualify for benefits after november.on july,semien filed suit under the employee retirement income security act erisa,a b,seeking an order forcing lina to award her disability benefits under the plan.
during the course of this litigation,lina refused to comply with five discovery requests one interrogatory and four document production requests related to the relationship between lina and the physicians consulted.semien filed a motion to compel discovery with the district court.this motion to compel discovery was denied in an opinion dated april.
on october,the district court entered summary judgment for lina,holding that lina decision on semien claim for benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.the district court also added in a footnote that the denial of benefits would survive even if we applied the de novo standard.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment using a de novo standard.see,grun pneumo abex,cir.that is,we review without deference for the view of the district judge and hence almost as if the motion had been made to us directly.id.quoting tobey,cir.
appropriate standard of review under erisa 
the initial question in this appeal is whether the district court used the proper standard of review when evaluating the plan administrator denial of benefits.the standard of judicial review in civil actions under a b depends upon the discretion granted to the plan administrator in the plan documents.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d consistent with established principles of trust law,we hold that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.
t he presumption of plenary review is not rebutted by the plan stating merely that benefits will be paid only if the plan administrator determines they are due,or only if the applicant submits satisfactory proof of his entitlement to them.herzberger standard ins,cir.in order to lower the level of judicial review from de novo to arbitrary and capricious,the plan should clearly and unequivocally state that it grants discretionary authority to the administrator.homestead mortgage,cir.
the district court found that the bp long term disability plan granted discretionary authority to lina.therefore,the plan administrator decision had to be examined under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.the district court provided two bases for its decision.in an april,opinion denying semien motion to compel discovery,the district court cited the plan employee benefits handbook for authority to use an arbitrary and capricious standard of review.in the october,opinion granting summary judgment,the district court cited the bp disability plan and a subsequent administrative services agreement between bp and lina as mandating an arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
semien challenges the validity of the employee benefits handbook.she claims that because the handbook was not published as part of the plan until after the initial denial of benefits,it may not be considered in evaluating her claim.see hackett xerox.disability income plan,cir but see daill sheet metal workers local pension fund,cir.we need not reach the question of the handbook validity.regardless of whether the was properly considered,the bp disability plan,coupled with the administrative services agreement between bp and lina,established lina authority and requires that decisions by the plan administrator be reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.
the bp disability plan explicitly provides for arbitrary and capricious review of plan administrator determinations 
plan administration 
the administration of the disability plan is the shared responsibility of the claims administrator and the plan administrator.the claims administrator receives,processes and pays all claims for benefits.the claims administrator for the plan is 
prudential life insurance 
the plan administrator and the claims administrator have the sole discretion and authority to apply,construe and interpret all plan provisions,to grant or deny all claims for benefits and to determine all benefit eligibility issues.
all decisions or determinations made by the claims administrator and the plan administrator will be final and binding on all parties unless such party has acted in an arbitrary and capricious nature.
the plan administrator is an officer of the company with responsibility for employee benefits,as designated by the board of directors 
emphasis added.
while there is no dispute that the quoted language provides for arbitrary and capricious review,semien claims that bp never properly delegated its discretionary authority to lina,the new plan administrator.unlike several of our sister circuits,this court has not addressed the question of whether the delegation of a plan administrator discretionary authority need be express.see,nelson eg g energy measurements group,cir benefit decision by an employee not explicitly given discretion is reviewed de novo sanford harvard,cir when a decision is made by a body other than the one authorized by the procedures set forth in a benefits plan,the standard of review is de novo see also mckeehan cigna life ins,cir i nsurers are accustomed to de novo judicial review of their decisions,and therefore we do not infer discretionary authority when an employer or plan sponsor has funded its obligations under an erisa plan by purchasing a group insurance policy.rather,we require explicit language in the policy or in other plan documents to trigger the erisa deferential standard of review.citations omitted.because we find that bp provided lina with an express delegation of discretionary authority to act as plan administrator,we need not reach the question of whether an implied delegation of authority would be sufficient to shift discretionary authority from the original plan administrator to an insurer.
semien contends that only the original plan may be considered in determining if lina is a fiduciary entitled to deference.that contention has been rejected by this court.health cost controls of illinois,washington,cir o ften the terms of an erisa plan must be inferred from a series of documents none clearly labeled as the plan.see also ruiz cont l cas,cir.under erisa,fiduciaries are allowed to designate other individuals to carry out fiduciary responsibilities under the plan.c b.
in a plan governance amendment,bp sets out procedures for identification of an administrative named fiduciary.an administrative named fiduciary may be identified by entering into an administrative services agreement with the plan.lina entered into an administrative services agreement with the plan in april.the administrative services agreement states that lina will provide the initial and ongoing screening of claims to determine whether benefits are payable in accordance with the terms of the plan.thus,by the terms of the administrative services agreement,lina agreed to exercise authority over the plan and was granted the same discretionary authority as the original plan administrator.
additionally,this court recently stated that the question of whether an administrator is a fiduciary should be viewed in functional terms of control and authority over the plan.ruiz,at quoting mertens hewitt,d.as in ruiz,this court must determine whether the delegated entity,in this case lina,was a fiduciary.a iii a fiduciary is a person who has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.based upon the language of the administrative services agreement,the district court correctly found that lina was a fiduciary and had discretionary authority over the administration of the plan.thus,lina decisions as plan administrator are entitled to review under an arbitrary and capricious standard.
lina denial of benefits 
on a motion for summary judgment,the moving party must show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.in addition,at the summary judgment stage,all inferences are drawn in favor of the party.see,estate of moreland dieter,cir.in this case,to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment,we must find that when taken in the light most favorable to semien,there is no evidence lina denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious.
the arbitrary and capricious standard is the least demanding form of judicial review of administrative action,and any questions of judgment are left to the administrator of the plan.absent special circumstances such as fraud or bad faith,the plan administrator decision may not be deemed arbitrary and capricious so long as it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for that decision.trombetta cragin fed.bank for savings employee stock ownership plan,cir internal citations omitted.
