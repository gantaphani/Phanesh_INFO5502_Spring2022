the indiana bell telephone company employed sylvia dougherty as a telephone operator.during her employment,she participated in an disability plan providing sickness benefits and accident benefits.under this plan,accident benefits are generally more desirable than sickness benefits.after a disabling neck strain in,the plan awarded dougherty accident benefits.the benefits continued until when the plan determined that dougherty was no longer disabled.dougherty returned to work but soon experienced pain in her right shoulder and elsewhere.this pain led her again to seek disability benefits.this time,the plan granted her sickness benefits,not accident benefits.dougherty sued,challenging the plan termination of accident benefits from her claim as well as the plan classification of her subsequent benefits as sickness benefits.the district court granted the plan summary judgment.dougherty appeals.we affirm.
sylvia dougherty began working at the indiana bell telephone company as a telephone operator in.at times relevant to this action,indiana bell and its parents,first ameritech corporation and later sbc communications,sponsored what is currently known as the ameritech sickness and accident disability benefits plan the plan.dougherty participated in the plan during her employment.
as is evident from its name,the plan administers two types of disability benefits.see sisto ameritech sickness accident disability benefit plan,cir explaining the same plan.sickness benefits cover disabilities caused by illnesses or injuries suffered outside the course of employment,and sickness benefits are capped at weeks.accident benefits,by contrast,are for disabling illnesses or injuries suffered during the course of employment.unlike sickness benefits,there is no automatic time limitation.accident benefits continue for the duration of the disability.
in september,indiana bell increased dougherty work week from five to six days.dougherty responded by obtaining a doctor note recommending that she work only five days per week.the doctor justified the recommendation by stating that dougherty had back and neck pain related to work stress and that her problem is aggrevated sic by working more than five days in a row.to verify this medical complaint,indiana bell had dougherty undergo a functional capacity evaluation in january.the exam included lifting items weighing more than ten pounds.during the testing,dougherty strained muscles in her neck.as a result,she then claimed that she was unable to work at all.
dougherty then applied for disability benefits under the plan,and the plan agreed that she was disabled.because the strain occurred during the functional capacity evaluation and because indiana bell directed dougherty to participate in that evaluation,the injury occurred in the course of employment according to the terms of the plan.consequently,the plan awarded dougherty accident benefits.separately,she received worker compensation as a result of this neck strain.
dougherty accident benefits continued largely uninterrupted for the next twelve years.although accident benefits only last as long as the disability lasts,the plan,for several years,did not monitor the status of dougherty disability.that changed in september,when a claims representative reviewed dougherty file and discovered the absence of a recent medical evaluation.to avoid any malingering,the plan first checked dougherty status by hiring a private investigator.the investigator spoke with dougherty neighbors,who reported that dougherty was very active and exhibited no signs of obvious disability.while surveilling dougherty home,the investigator reported seeing dougherty running outside to close a convertible roof due to a sudden rainstorm.also,on a videotape,the investigator indisputably recorded dougherty operating her vehicle and carrying several shopping bags out of a store to her vehicle.the tape possibly caught her performing yard work,but the identity of the woman on that portion of the tape is disputed.
the plan then had norman moskowitz,conduct a medical examination of dougherty in january.in evaluating dougherty cervical spine neck,moskowitz found that she had lost some ability to bend and extend her neck but noted no neurological deficits.he further observed that,when he had tested her range of motion,dougherty was not credible,cooperative or compliant.besides his exam,moskowitz reviewed her medical file and the investigator surveillance report and tape.moskowitz concluded that dougherty was not disabled from any type of employment.the plan then terminated her accident benefits as of january.
in response,dougherty obtained a medical evaluation of her own dated february,which was performed by roland kaplan,kaplan found that,among other problems,dougherty had inflamed nerves in her cervical spine,and,although she had good cervical motion,he found her cervical spine to be less than fully functional.kaplan concluded that,with respect to work,dougherty could not sit for more than ten minutes at a time and recommended maintaining the status quo,not working and staying on disability leave.in march,dougherty submitted kaplan report to the plan and appealed the termination of benefits.thereafter,dougherty submitted additional reports from kaplan,which essentially confirmed his earlier conclusions.
the plan then had david trotter,review dougherty updated medical file.trotter acknowledged that the file indicated some cervical spine trouble,but he believed,based upon the file,that those troubles were associated with a significant amount of symptom magnification.he concluded that dougherty was not disabled,stating that there was no medical justification for any alteration in the plan determination that she was no longer disabled as of january.trotter added that the plan was quite liberal in using that date because,in his opinion,it appeared that dougherty could have returned to work at a much earlier point in time.trotter also reviewed kaplan supplemental reports,but trotter opinion did not change.the plan denied dougherty appeal on may and informed her that its decision was final.dougherty took no further action on this accident claim at that juncture.
dougherty returned to work on june,worked about three weeks,and lodged a claim for disability benefits on july.this claim followed a july visit with one of dougherty numerous doctors in this case.among other findings,this doctor noted neck,wrist,and spinal problems as well as weakness in dougherty rotator cuff shoulder.
as the claim was no longer active,the plan treated this claim as a new claim.in addition,the plan classified the claim as one for sickness benefits,not accident benefits.the plan did so because there was no injury presented to the plan in conjunction with this claim.further,dougherty did not submit the proper form for accident benefits an form or some equivalent and did not instruct the plan to treat this claim as being related to her accident claim.moreover,the plan immediately informed dougherty that it was treating this claim as a sickness claim,which it plainly defined as a claim based upon an injury.dougherty took no action at that time to dispute the classification.the importance of these details will become apparent below.the plan awarded dougherty sickness benefits for the period of july to july.
dougherty returned to work on july but stopped working again on august on account of continued pain.she again sought disability benefits,but,as before,she did not present an injury as the basis for an accident claim or otherwise instruct the plan to link this claim to her claim.the plan treated this august claim as a relapse of the july sickness claim and so informed dougherty.on august,dougherty called the plan and asked why the claim was not being treated as an accident claim.a plan representative responded to dougherty inquiry by leaving her a cryptic voicemail along the lines of accident benefits being linked to worker compensation,and the representative invited dougherty to call back if dougherty had additional questions.dougherty did not pursue her inquiry further nor did she appeal or otherwise dispute the sickness versus accident classification at that time.in september,dougherty underwent shoulder surgery and was treated for carpal tunnel syndrome.as to her august claim,dougherty received sickness benefits from august to december.the plan selected the end date after consulting with dougherty doctors.dougherty did not appeal that decision nor any other aspect of this claim.she returned to work on december.
in march,dougherty ceased working,complaining of neck and upper back pain,and made another disability claim in a similar fashion as before.the plan again immediately informed her that the claim was being treated as a sickness claim,and she did not challenge that classification at the time.the plan denied the claim in april,citing a lack of documentation.dougherty appealed the denial but not the sickness classification.after several rounds of medical evaluations,document submissions,and general back and forth between the parties,the plan reversed its denial and awarded dougherty sickness benefits from march,to march.
nevertheless,because sickness benefits,as discussed above,can not exceed weeks,the plan later determined that the march date was erroneous dougherty exhausted her weeks well before that date.between dougherty july and august claims,she received approximately twenty weeks of benefits.thus,she had roughly weeks left for the march claim,and those weeks ran out on october.the plan reached this determination because the benefit periods associated with the three and claims were successive periods of disability under the terms of the plan,meaning that they had to be grouped together as one period for purposes of the clock.pursuant to the plan text,a new clock starts to run only when the employee has been back to work for more than thirteen continuous weeks.dougherty did not satisfy that requirement.the plan notified dougherty of this correction in march.
dougherty took no further action until june,when represented by a letter to the plan seeking to appeal the plan denial of accident benefits,not sickness benefits.in august,the plan advised dougherty,through her counsel,that the plan terminated her accident benefits from the claim in january,that she had already appealed that termination in march,and that the plan had already issued its final decision in may.viewing the claim as being closed for more than two years,the plan rejected the june appeal,standing on its final determination from may.
in january,dougherty filed a state court lawsuit challenging the plan actions under employee retirement income security act,specifically,a b,solely claiming wrongful denials of benefits.the case was then removed based upon a federal question.besides the plan,other entities related to plan were named as defendants in the action,but there is no need to detail them here.the plan and the other defendants moved for summary judgment.the central issues were the plan january termination of accident benefits from the claim and the plan classification of the and claims as sickness claims rather than accident claims.the district court granted the summary judgment motion,and dougherty appeals.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see sisto,at.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.on appeal,dougherty puts forth a morass of disjointed arguments that can be distilled down to three issues the standard by which to review the plan decisions,the plan termination of accident benefits from the,and the plan handling of the and claims 
when the terms of an employee benefit plan afford the plan administrator broad discretion to interpret the plan and determine benefit eligibility,the administrator benefit decisions are reviewed under the standard.see sisto,at.in granting summary judgment,the district court applied this standard.dougherty argues for less deferential review,but she does not dispute the plan language.rather,she argues that the plan was biased against her and,therefore,that the plan should be afforded no deference or very little deference.see,manny cent.states,se.sw.areas pension health welfare funds,cir mers marriott int l group accidental death dismemberment plan,cir.this is an uphill battle for dougherty because the existence of potential bias,a potential conflict of interest,is not enough to dislodge our ordinary and level of review.see ruiz cont l cas,cir mers,at see also rud liberty life assur.of boston,cir claimant must demonstrate the existence of a real and not merely notional conflict of interest.we presume a plan is acting neutrally unless a claimant shows by providing specific evidence of actual bias that there is a significant conflict.kobs united.ins,cir quoting mers,at.
in an attempt to show actual bias,dougherty relies on three documents from the voluminous record.first,she cites a internal memorandum reviewing her benefits file.this memo,dougherty contends,shows that the plan was wrongfully trying to get rid of her,and she therefore reasons that the plan was biased against her.the memo raises the possibility of offering dougherty a settlement to amicably close out her accident claim,which,at that juncture,had been running for five years.the memo contains a sinister our company would gain from her no longer being on the active payroll.however,in context,there is nothing sinister about this memo.the memo recommended offering dougherty a lump sum so as to conserve assets over the long run for the benefit of all the plan participants and beneficiaries.see ameritech benefit plan comm.commc workers of,cir fagan stabilization agreement of the sheet metal indus.trust fund,cir.lump sum settlements are authorized under the terms of the plan,and the recommendation was not an attempt to shortchange dougherty.the memo explicitly expressed the belief that dougherty would be receptive to the preferring a sizeable amount of cash up front rather than receiving small installments over many years.the recommendation,moreover,was not a decree forced upon dougherty.rather,the recommendation was to make an offer to see if she found the idea desirable.she had the option to reject the offer.it is unclear if the plan made this offer,but,if it did,it was unquestionably refused as the plan continued paying dougherty benefits until.furthermore,this memo was not drafted in a context of the plan having insufficient assets,which,if the case,might alter the analysis.hess mach.tool,cir actions taken in the face of insufficient assets gave more teeth to plaintiff claim of bias.in sum,the plan conduct here constitutes fair and responsible management of resources on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries.the memo does not show that the plan held some bias against dougherty.this conclusion holds especially true here when some seven or more years lapsed between the time of this memo and the to disability decisions at issue in this appeal.
second,dougherty complains about a internal email concerning a mistaken stop in payments of her accident benefits.one agent of the plan sent an email to another agent to correct this erroneous stoppage and to pay her for all missed payments.siding with dougherty,the email referred to the stoppage as a definite and correctly stated that benefits continue for as long as the employee remains disabled.the email then suggested putting together a settlement offer.dougherty takes issue with the mere existence of settlement talk in this context,arguing that any thought of settlement shows that the plan was biased against her.however,we again see no evidence of bias here.the email was intended for dougherty benefit.it promptly corrected a mistake in favor of dougherty.as for the settlement reference,it follows the discussion in the preceding paragraph.
third,dougherty contends that internal staff notes concerning the decision to initiate an investigation of her disability status in exhibits bias.this is dougherty weakest point.since eligibility for accident benefits lasts only as long as the disability las
