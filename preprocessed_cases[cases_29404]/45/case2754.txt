this case involves the interplay between code of civil procedure section section,which revives certain claims against insurers for policy benefits for losses caused by the january,northridge earthquake,and the responsibilities of the california insurance guarantee association ciga,which is obligated under insurance code section et to pay the covered claims of insolvent insurers.specifically,does an insured state a cause of action against ciga for violation of insurance code section et by alleging he or she has a northridge earthquake claim against an insolvent insurer,revived by section,that has been denied by ciga 
based on the purpose of ciga to protect the insured public from insolvent insurers by paying covered claims,as defined by insurance code section,subdivision c industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,and the legislature intent in enacting section to bring needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake by providing a window for insureds with otherwise claims to file suit against their insurance company century ins.superior court th,d,the answer is yes,at least with respect to claims against insurers declared insolvent after the effective date of section.we,therefore,reverse the order of dismissal,finding the trial court erred by concluding ciga could have no obligations with respect to an otherwise claim for policy benefits revived by section.because the operative complaint in this case is wholly deficient in its allegations of revival of the insureds claim under section and of ciga actions,if any,on the claim,however,we remand with directions for the trial court to enter an order sustaining ciga demurrer with leave to amend.
factual and procedural background 
the original complaint and ciga demurrer 
on december,wolfram and renata berger and jerry and celia kayle filed a complaint against their insurer,reliance insurance company,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and negligent misrepresentation based on reliance failure to pay policy benefits for damage to their properties caused by the northridge earthquake although the complaint was filed on december,the last day of the revival period under section,it does not mention the statute the complaint alleges,plaintiffs gave timely and adequate notice of claim.apparently realizing reliance was insolvent,on october,the bergers and the kayles amended their complaint,substituting ciga for doe,which included it in the allegations as to each cause of action 
ciga demurred to the complaint.the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and negligent misrepresentation on the ground those causes of action against ciga were the trial court granted the bergers and the kayles leave to amend to assert a cause of action against ciga based on its statutory duties under insurance code section et,invoked as a result of reliance insolvency.
the first amended complaint and ciga demurrer 
the bergers and the kayles filed a first amended complaint on february,disregarding the trial court order sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer to the causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and negligent misrepresentation in the original complaint and alleging those same causes of action against reliance and ciga,and adding a cause of action against ciga for violation of insurance code section et the first amended complaint alleges reliance is in liquidation and t he state of pennsylvania has issued an order requiring proof of claim on or before december.plaintiffs have will be submitting that claim and accordingly said claim has been timely submitted.
as to ciga,the first amended complaint alleges,plaintiffs are further informed and believe that ciga will administrate the claim in accordance with california insurance code.plaintiffs are informed and believe that ciga will act in accordance with its standard to adjust valid claims.plaintiffs therefor e affirmatively allege that ciga has already denied plaintiffs valid claim giving rise to a cause of action for breach of its statutory obligations.with respect to insurance code section et,the first amended complaint alleges,in the alternative to the preceding causes of action asserted directly against national auto sic,plaintiff s are now informed and believe and based thereon allege that ciga is the entity now responsible for handling adjustment of plaintiff s claim against national auto sic.plaintiff s are now informed and believe and based thereon allege that ciga accepted responsibility to adjust the claim pursuant to insurance code.the first amended complaint continues,as of the filing of this document,ciga refuses to adjust the claim of plaintiff.ciga has done nothing relative to the adjustment.by this complaint,plaintiff once against urges ciga to conduct itself in a manner consistent with the public trust and in accordance with the law.in the event ciga notifies plaintiff of an intent to adjust as opposed to completely ignoring the claim plaintiff would be inclined to dismiss the present action against ciga without prejudice on the condition that ciga stipulate that any necessary refiling will be deemed to relate back to the filing of this action.
ciga filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint,contending it was uncertain and,in any event,failed to state a cause of action for violation of insurance code section et.ciga asserted the claims for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and negligent misrepresentation should be stricken based on the trial court prior order sustaining without leave to amend a demurrer to those causes of action.
the trial court ruling and dismissal of the case 
the trial court sustained the demurrer to the first amended complaint,finding the bergers and the kayles had failed to state a cause of action against ciga for violation of insurance code section et because their claim for policy benefits was and section did not revive claims against ciga.the court granted the bergers and the kayles leave to amend to allege facts demonstrating their claims were timely under principles of equitable tolling.the court struck the remaining causes of action in the first amended complaint based on its ruling on ciga demurrer to the original complaint.
the bergers and the kayles declined to amend the first amended complaint.on that basis ciga filed a motion to dismiss,which was unopposed.the trial court dismissed the action 
contentions 
the bergers and the kayles contend the trial court erred by sustaining ciga demurrer to the first amended complaint because they have stated a cause of action against ciga for violation of insurance code section et.they also contend the first amended complaint states a claim for unfair business practices under business and professions code section

although section does not directly apply to ciga,the statute affects ciga statutory obligations 
ciga creation and its statutory obligations 
ciga was created by legislation in,et known as the guarantee act to establish a fund from which insureds could obtain financial and legal assistance in the event their insurers become insolvent,to provide insurance against loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies,citations.isaacson california ins.guarantee cal d,isaacson.its purpose is to protect members of the public from the insolvency of insurers by spreading throughout the industry a loss suffered by an insured as the result of the insolvency of an insurer.citations.black diamond asphalt,superior court th,d see.all insurers transacting insurance business in california are involuntary members of ciga,unless specifically exempted by statute,subd.a,subd.a.isaacson,at.
ciga is not,and was not created to act as,an ordinary insurance company.citation.it is a statutory entity that depends on the guarantee act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers,duties,and protections.citation.ciga issues no policies,collects no premiums,makes no profits,and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.citation.ciga duties are not with the duties owed by the insolvent insurer under its policy.citation.instead,ciga authority and liability in discharging its statutorily circumscribed duties are limited to paying the amount of covered claims.citations.ciga is authorized by statute to pay only covered claims of an insolvent insurer,those determined by the legislature to be in keeping with the goal of providing protection for the insured public.citation.citation.ciga has the statutory authority to deny a noncovered claim.citation.citation.california insurance guarantee workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
based on its statutory duties,ciga first responsibility in a case is to determine whether a claim submitted by an insured of an insolvent insurer is a covered claim within the scope of the guarantee act.california insurance guarantee workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.as relevant to this case,the statutory definition of covered claims is the obligations of an insolvent insurer i imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer ii which were unpaid by the insolvent insurer iii which are presented as a claim to the liquidator in this state or to the association on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims in the domiciliary liquidating proceedings iv which were incurred prior to the date coverage under the policy terminated and prior to,on,or within days after the date the liquidator was appointed v for which the assets of the insolvent insurer are insufficient to discharge in full,subd.c.ciga liability on a covered claim is statutorily capped at,subd.c.
because ciga obligations are not coextensive with the insolvent insurer,it is not responsible for the tortious conduct of the insolvent insurer,subd.g covered claims shall not include any judgments against or obligations or liabilities of the insolvent insurer or the commissioner,as liquidator,or otherwise resulting from alleged or proven torts,nor shall any default judgment or stipulated judgment against the insolvent insurer,or against the insured of the insolvent insurer,be binding against the association.ciga also has been held immune from tort liability for its own conduct in fulfilling its duties to pay covered claims.isaacson,supra,cal d at ciga immune from liability for unfair practices under,and for intentional infliction of emotional distress,and can not be sued for common law bad faith because it has no contractual relationship with the insured see,subd.a ciga shall under no circumstances be liable for any sum in excess of the amount of covered claims of the insolvent insurer.nevertheless,if ciga improperly denies coverage or refuses to defend an insured on a covered claim arising under an insolvent insurer policy,it breaches its statutory duties under the guarantee act.isaacson,supra,cal d at.
although the limitations period in california for actions on contracts is four years code civ,the legislature has permitted insurers providing homeowners coverage to shorten this period to one year from the inception of the insured loss,see com.insurance superior court cal d,inception of the loss means that point in time when appreciable damage occurs and is or should be known to the insured,such that a reasonable insured would be aware that his notification duty under the policy has been triggered.
on january,section became effective,specifically to obviate the adverse impact the limitations period was having on the ability of many insureds to obtain compensation from their insurance companies for property damage caused by the northridge earthquake.the statute revives northridge earthquake claims that otherwise would be in cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurer representative prior to january,regarding potential earthquake damage and allows a cause of action based on the revived claim to be filed within one year of the effective date of the statute,subd.a claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake that is barred solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of january,see newell state farm general ins.th,d legislature expressly directed that section operate to revive certain earthquake claims for a period of one year only.
the legislative history of the statute indicates the author introduced the bill because the limitations period has unfairly barred victims of the northridge earthquake from being compensated for their losses because many were tragically misled by their insurers or representatives thereof about the extent of damage suffered as a result of the earthquake.hellinger farmers group,th,d.according to the statute proponents,t housands of people who suffered damage to their homes did not receive the benefit of their insurance contracts because of the insurance companies conduct a mple evidence exists to show that insurers handling northridge earthquake claims engaged in a systematic program of misleading consumers about the nature and extent of damage to their homes.later,when it became clear that the problems were indeed significant,the insurers simply refused to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become.century ins.superior court,supra,th at,d.
section has been held to revive claims against insurers for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which are based on the contract of insurance,but not claims for fraud,which do not rest on the insurers failure to perform under the insurance policy.century ins.superior court,supra,th at,d hellinger farmers group,supra,th at,d.
ciga is responsible for at least some claims revived by section 
ciga contends it is not responsible for paying any otherwise claims against an insolvent insurer that are revived by section because the statute applies only to insurers and ciga is not an insurer.according to ciga,unless an insured can demonstrate that his or her claim for policy benefits against an insolvent insurer is timely under the policy limitations period,ciga has no statutory liability on the claim.
although we agree section does not directly apply to ciga,we disagree that ciga can rely on the contractual limitations period in an insurance policy to deny any responsibility for a revived claim against an insurer declared insolvent after the statute effective date section overrides the contractual language in a policy limiting the period in which an insured may file suit against its insurer.bialo western mutual ins.th,d statute itself precludes contractual provisions from limiting its applicability see century ins.superior court,supra,th at,d by reviving claims beyond the limitations provision,section does not impermissibly impair the contract of coverage or violate vested due process rights hellinger farmers group,supra,th at,d same.it creates a new limitations period for claims that fall within its terms by giving insureds one year from its effective date of january,to file an action against an insurer based on a revived claim.rosenblum safeco ins.th,d section did nothing more than reopen the filing window,for a one year period,to those otherwise viable cases that had become time barred.thus,for a claim revived by section,the limitations period in the policy has been effectively replaced,at least as to insurers who were not declared insolvent prior to january.ciga,therefore,can not refuse a claim revived by section based on the superseded limitations provision in the policy issued by those insurers.
this result comports with both the purpose of ciga and the reason for the enactment of section.although it is not an insurer,nor are its duties coextensive with those of an insurance company,ciga was created to protect the insured public by paying covered claims in the event of insurer insolvency.california insurance guarantee wokers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d see also isaacson,supra,cal d at.in enacting section,the legislature determined a claim that otherwise would be barred solely because the applicable limitations period had expired will now be within the coverage of the insurance policy.a revived claim under section against an insurer declared insolvent after the statute effective date,therefore,is a covered claim imposed by law and within the coverage of the insurance policy,subd.c.
to support its contention that it should be able to rely on the limitations period in the policy despite section,ciga cites aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee th,d aloha pacific,in which division four of this court held ciga may contest whether a claim is covered by the insurance policy of an insolvent insurer,even though a third party claimant had previously obtained a judicial determination that the insurer ha d no present basis for denying coverage and that its failure to reserve its right to contest coverage under the policy exclusions of coverage for willful acts or trademark infringement waived its right to assert those exclusions as a basis for denying coverage in the federal action against its insured for trademark infringement.citation.id.at,d.when the third party attempted to collect on the claim from ciga after the insurer became insolvent,ciga declined,contending it could litigate whether the insolvent insurer policy covered the claim despite the prior judgment.id.at,d.division four agreed with ciga,reasoning that,although the prior judgment had concluded the insurer did not have the right to deny coverage based on its limited reservation of rights,it did not determine whether the claim was within the risks of loss protected against by the insolvent insurer policy.id.at,d.in fact,notwithstanding the faulty reservation of rights,the claim was not covered by the policy and,therefore,did not come within the limited definition of covered claims in insurance code section,subdivision c,by which ciga obligation to pay must be measured.aloha pacific,at,d.
aloha pacific is distinguishable from the situation presented here,both as a factual matter and in terms of the policy considerations involved.in aloha pacific division four concluded ciga was entitled to look to the policy itself to determine whether the claim was covered within the meaning of insurance code section,subdivision c,without regard to the insurer failure to properly assert all grounds for denying or limiting coverage.in contrast,with section the legislature has overridden policy language to afford qualifying insureds an extended limitations period,in effect amending the policy to provide an additional benefit.just as ciga was entitled to look to the policy itself to determine its obligations in aloha pacific,in this case ciga is required to look to the policy itself,as now revised by the legislature,to determine whether a northridge earthquake victim property damage claim is covered under insurance code section,subdivision c 
ciga also contends that,because it is not responsible for the wrongful acts of an insolvent insurer,it should not be obligated to pay claims revived by section,which was enacted because insurers in many cases had wrongfully denied policy benefits for earthquake damage.the legislature in enacting section,however,was clear the purpose of the statute was to provide insureds with another chance to seek compensation for northridge earthquake damage,not to punish insurers for any wrongful conduct.century ins.superior court,supra,th at,fn,d statute intended to provide these individuals who were victimized twice,once by the earthquake and a second time by their insurance companies with a reasonable second chance to seek redress for their damages.citation.see also century ins.superior court th,fn,d purpose of section is compensation,not to punish insurers it is clear that the statute was tailored to restore to earthquake victims any lost civil causes of action,not to punish insurers.thus,ciga responsibility to administer claims revived by section does not make it liable,directly or indirectly,for the wrongful acts of insurers and in no way undermines its statutory immunity from liability for the torts of the insolvent insurer,subd.g.
ciga also maintains,hayward,tilton rolapp ins.associates,th,d,a case in which division one of our court found section did not revive a claim against an insurance broker for malpractice,supports its argument it is not responsible for any revived claims.but our holding that ciga must administer revived claims,at least as to insurers declared insolvent after the effective date of section,is not predicated on a finding that section directly applies to ciga,a conclusion that would conflict with division one analysis.rather,it is premised on the fact that section alters the limitations provision in the insurance policy.ciga,therefore,can not rely on that superseded provision to maintain a claim is not covered within the meaning of insurance code section,subdivision c.in sum,although section does not directly apply to ciga,it plainly affects ciga responsibility to pay the covered claims of insolvent insurers.
although the first amended complaint is factually deficient,the bergers and the kayles are entitled to leave to amend to assert a cause of action pursuant to insurance code section et.
the trial court sustained ciga demurrer to the first amended complaint on the ground the bergers and the kayles could not rely on section to demonstrate the timeliness of their claims for policy benefits this was error.nevertheless,as it stands the first amended complaint is wholly deficient in its allegations that the bergers and the kayles have a claim for benefits that has been revived by section and that ciga has not fulfilled its responsibilities under insurance code section et.
with respect to section,the bergers and the kayles do not allege their claims satisfy the statute requirements for revival.although the bergers and the kayles state in their opening brief that they contacted reliance between january,and january,and contacted representatives of the insurer before january,no similar allegations appear in the first amended complaint.instead,they simply allege,plaintiffs gave timely and adequate notice of claim.this allegation states only a legal conclusion,rather than pleading facts,and,as such,is inadequate.kenneth mebane ranches superior court th,d allegations constituting legal conclusions are not provisionally admitted for the purposes of a demurrer see code civ,subd.e weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,f ailure to plead ultimate facts subjects the complaint to demurrer for failure to state facts constituting the cause of action.nor does the first amended complaint make any allegations with respect to the administration of the claims by reliance to demonstrate the claims asserted are covered by the insurance policies and to satisfy all the requirements of insurance code section,subdivision c 
the first amended complaint also fails to demonstrate the bergers and the kayles claims against ciga are ripe.they do not specifically allege they filed claims in the insolvency proceedings against reliance but merely state they have will be submitting claim s in the insolvency proceedings on or before december.in addition,they do not allege ciga has denied their claims but merely assert that ciga will refuse or has refused to act on them.the bergers an
