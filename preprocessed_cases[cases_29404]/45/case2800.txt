in general,if a trial judge enters judgment in a civil action,and the judgment is reversed on appeal,resulting in a remand to the trial judge for a new trial,any party can disqualify the judge by way of a peremptory challenge.see code civ,subd.a,par.
in the present case,after the pleading stage,defendant filed a motion in the trial court to resolve a conflict of laws issue whether california law or illinois law applied to plaintiffs causes of action.defendant argued that illinois law applied and that the case had to be dismissed.plaintiffs argued that california law governed and that dismissal would be improper.the trial court agreed with plaintiffs.
defendant petitioned this court for a writ of mandate.after briefing and oral argument,we granted the petition,concluding that illinois law applied but that the trial court had correctly declined to dismiss the case.on remand,the parties appeared before the same trial judge.defendant moved to disqualify him,filing a peremptory challenge.the judge denied the motion.
defendant then filed another petition for writ of is now before that the trial judge should have granted the motion to disqualify.we conclude that,given the limited nature of the prior writ determine which state law is peremptory challenge does not lie because the trial judge did not try the case,nor will the prior writ proceeding result in a new trial.rather,the trial judge will simply continue on with the case,applying illinois law.
background 
defendant state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm was created under the laws of the state of illinois in.it is incorporated there and is headquartered in bloomington,illinois.the board of directors meets in bloomington.
on june,state farm policyholders filed this action,alleging that state farm had retained an excessive amount of its surplus funds and,instead,should have returned the excess surplus to the policyholders in the form of higher dividends.the complaint contained causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,among others.
after the pleading stage,state farm brought a motion to determine applicable law,contending that,under the internal affairs doctrine,illinois law governed plaintiffs causes of action state farm also argued that the business judgment rule applied to plaintiffs claims in a separate motion to dismiss,state farm argued that the internal affairs doctrine required dismissal of the case in favor of an illinois plaintiffs had to file the case in illinois.plaintiffs filed opposition papers,arguing that the internal affairs doctrine did not apply,california law governed,the business judgment rule was not applicable,and dismissal would be improper.
in a statement of decision dated may,the trial court ruled that the internal affairs doctrine did not apply,california law was controlling,the business judgment rule was not applicable,and the case would not be dismissed.
state farm filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,seeking to overturn the trial court decision.we issued an order to show cause,instructed the parties to submit briefs,and heard oral argument.
in a published opinion,state farm,supra,th,d,we held that,with respect to the motion to determine applicable law,the internal affairs doctrine governed,the law of illinois was controlling,and the business judgment rule applied to plaintiffs claims.as for the motion to dismiss,we concluded,as had the trial court,that the internal affairs requiring the application of illinois not require dismissal of the suit.the case could be tried here.id.at,d.
in addition,f or guidance,we set forth in the opinion the principles under current illinois law state farm,supra,th at,d,stating that illinois recognized a cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing only where an insurer has failed to settle a third party claim against its insured and that,in other circumstances,a plaintiff is required to raise covenant principles as part of a breach of contract claim id.at,d.we further explained that if state farm dividend decisions were proper under the business judgment rule,then the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can not be used as an to impose liability here.id.at,d.
on remand after the granting of the petition,the case returned to the same trial judge.state farm moved to disqualify the judge under section,subdivision a,second paragraph,of the code of civil procedure,which states in part a motion to disqualify may be made following reversal on appeal of a trial court decision,or following reversal on appeal of a trial court final judgment,if the trial judge in the prior proceeding is assigned to conduct a new trial on the matter.italics added hereafter section a all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure.
the trial court denied the motion on the ground that w hile section a permits a peremptory challenge following reversal on appeal,it does not afford the same right on issuance of a writ by a court of appeal directing a trial court to apply different law to an interlocutory legal determination made by the trial court.
state farm then filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,challenging the trial court ruling on the motion to disqualify.we issued an order to show cause why the trial court decision should not be vacated.we also established a briefing schedule and calendared the matter for oral argument.having considered the parties written and oral presentations,we now consider the merits of the petition.
discussion 
as our supreme court recently explained a party may secure the disqualification of a judge on the basis of an affidavit asserting that the party believes the judge is biased.this constitutes the peremptory challenge of a judge set forth in section 
the statute provides in substance that any party or attorney to a civil or criminal action may make an oral or written motion to disqualify the assigned judge,supported by an affidavit that the judge is prejudiced against such party or attorney or the interest thereof so that the affiant can not or believes he can not have an impartial trial t here are strict limits on the timing and number of such motions but if the motion is timely and in proper form,the judge must recuse himself without further proof and the case must be reassigned to another judge.t he statute reasonably serves the legislature evident purpose of maintaining the appearance as well as the fact of impartiality in the judicial system the business of the courts must be conducted in such a manner as will avoid even the suspicion of unfairness.
but the peremptory challenge created by section presents the potential for abuse and the part of either or both parties.in response to this danger,we have pointed out,the courts of this state have been vigilant to enforce the statutory restrictions on the number and timing of the motions permitted we can not permit a device intended for spare and protective use to be converted into a weapon of offense and thereby to become an obstruction to efficient judicial administration.peracchi superior court cal th,d,citations omitted.
in determining the applicability of section a here,we apply the rules of statutory construction and seek to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.as always,we begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary meaning if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,then we need go no further if,however,the language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,then we look to extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d,citations omitted.
before,section did not expressly provide for a peremptory challenge in a new trial following reversal on appeal.prior to the enactment of the amendment,a matter remanded by an appellate court for full or partial retrial was normally assigned to the same trial judge who heard the case at the trial level.this policy was based on the premise that the trial judge who presided over the first trial was familiar with the issues in the case and was in a better position to expeditiously resolve the matter pursuant to the appellate decision.
the concern expressed by the proponents of the amendment was that a judge who had been reversed might prove to be biased against the party who successfully appealed the judge erroneous ruling at the original trial.the amendment was intended to permit a party to challenge a judge who had been assigned to conduct the new trial of the case in which his or her decision was reversed on appeal.the term new trial is intended to cover situations where the case is to be and not merely remanded with instructions to perform some specific task,recalculate interest.stegs investments superior court d.stegs,italics added,quoting assem.com.on,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
as several courts of appeal have recognized the legislative history of the amendment suggests that the applicability of section a does not turn on whether the issue s to be resolved on remand are limited,but what the court must do to resolve them.if the court function is merely a ministerial act such as the recalculation of interest,the amendment does not apply.if,however,the court must conduct an actual retrial,even if that trial involves only one issue,the court may be disqualified upon a timely affidavit filed pursuant to section.stegs,supra,d at,italics added accord,hendershot superior court th,d hendershot overton superior court th,d overton stubblefield construction superior court th,d stubblefield pfeiffer,supra,th at,d.
thus,the courts have held that section a was applicable where after a bench trial in a civil action,the judgment was reversed on appeal,and the case was remanded for an evidentiary hearing and the determination of an issue of fact stegs,supra,d at.hendershot,supra,th at,d summary judgment was reversed in part on appeal,and the case was remanded for further proceedings stubblefield,supra,th at,d the dismissal of a civil action at the pleading stage was reversed on appeal and remanded with directions to make factual findings on the merits of the defendants motion to strike the complaint in order to determine whether the defendants were entitled to attorneys fees in a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp pfeiffer,supra,th at,d the dismissal of a criminal complaint on statute of limitations grounds was reversed on appeal people superior court maloy th,d and the trial court in a criminal case,after refusing to declare a mistrial,was instructed to do so by a writ of mandate from the court of appeal overton,supra,th at,d.
although section a does not provide a definition of new trial,section defines new trial as the of an issue of fact in the same court after a trial and decision by a jury,court,or referee.this definition,as applied by the courts in ruling on motions for a new trial,is helpful in determining when a peremptory challenge is permitted.see peracchi superior court,supra,cal th at,d,hendershot,supra,th at,d.
in carney simmonds cal d,carney,the supreme court held that section definition of new trial must be read in conjunction with section,which describes the grounds for granting a new trial.the court noted t here may be a trial and hence a situation proper for a new trial motion where only issues of law are determined as a matter of orderly procedure there is no less reason why the trial court should have a second chance to reexamine its judgment where issues of fact are involved than where issues of law or law and fact are decided.carney,supra,cal d at,citation omitted.
the court in carney concluded that a motion for new trial would be proper where judgment had been entered in a number of situations,including judgment on the pleadings,judgment for failure to state a cause of action,judgment after a plaintiff opening statement or at the close of a plaintiff evidence,judgment on a directed verdict,judgment after a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,and judgment on an agreed statement of ultimate facts.carney,supra,cal d at,see witkin,cal.procedure ed.attack on judgment in trial court.carney interpreted the definition of new trial,as set forth in section,quite broadly.see peracchi superior court,supra,cal th at,d,hendershot,supra,th at,d.
that is not to say that section a should be liberally construed.as the supreme court recently stated w ith respect to the assertion that section must be given a liberal construction,our own cases have observed that because of the dangers presented by either limits on the number and timing of challenges pursuant to this statute are vigorously enforced we do not believe that the amendment of section,subdivision was intended to eliminate all restrictions on the challenge or to counter every possible situation in which it might be speculated that a court could react negatively to a reversal on appeal.peracchi superior court,supra,cal th at,d,citation omitted.this is especially so given that a reviewing court has the statutory authority,either on its own motion or at the request of a party,to order that further proceedings in the trial court take place before a different judge when the interests of justice so require,subd.c see peracchi superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
further,the supreme court has rejected the notion that a section challenge should be permitted at any hearing in which there is any potential for bias.peracchi superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.nor does the high court agree that the legislature intended to protect,in all circumstances,parties who have prevailed on appeal from the presumed ire or potential bias of trial judges whose rulings have been reversed.id.at,d,italics in original.as the court explained there is no indication that the legislature intended section,subdivision to permit a peremptory challenge whenever there exists even a potential for bias arising out of a judge reaction to being reversed on appeal w e can not agree with petitioner that a section challenge will lie whenever the potential exists that a judge who is called upon to exercise discretion might react adversely to a reversal.peracchi superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.
the amendment of section,as originally drafted,provided that a peremptory challenge could be made after reversal on appeal where the trial judge in the prior proceedings was assigned to rehear the matter.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.a subsequent version of the bill replaced to rehear the matter with for a new trial,thus limiting the scope of peremptory challenges to new trials that follow reversal on appeal.see assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
as in the case here,the trial court in a writ of mandate proceeding,though a nominal respondent,is nonetheless a neutral party in the underlying controversy between the parties,and as such,has a duty to remain impartial.t he real party in interest,not the respondent court,has a beneficial interest in the litigation and is the aggrieved party,the adverse party in whose favor the act complained of has been done.as the aggrieved party,the real party in interest is the party with sufficient interest in the subject matter of the dispute to press its case with vigor.james superior court th,d.the supreme court agrees with this view.see municipal court superior court gonzalez cal th,d.
there are some types of mandate like the one which the trial court is the real adverse party,as where a writ proceeding directly affects the operations and procedures of the trial court or may impose financial obligations that would directly affect the court operations.see james superior court,supra,th at,d fns.
finally,as the statutory language indicates,section a applies to reversals after an appeal.one court has held that the statute also applies to reversals after a writ of mandate proceeding.see overton,supra,th at,d.we assume,without deciding,that the statute so applies.
based on the foregoing authorities,we conclude that a peremptory challenge is permitted under section a where a trial court decision or final judgment is made in conjunction with a
