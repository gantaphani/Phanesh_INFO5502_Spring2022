cast steel products,cast steel appeals an adverse summary judgment granted to admiral insurance company admiral on cast steel action for a declaration that either or both of its and professional liability policies with admiral covered a defective product claim that accrued at the conclusion of the policy period but was not reported until the start of the policy period.the district court found that neither policy provided coverage for the claim because the claim had not both accrued and been reported to admiral during the same policy period.cast steel argues on appeal that the professional liability policy policy is ambiguous with respect to coverage of the claim upon renewal of the policy in.specifically,cast steel contends that because the policy automatically extends the claims reporting period upon cancellation or of the policy,but is silent as to whether renewal of the policy would provide the same reporting extension,an unresolved ambiguity exists in the policy that precluded the district court from granting summary judgment.
we agree that the policy is ambiguous.we further find that,because under florida law an ambiguity in an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured so as not to deny coverage,summary judgment should have been granted to cast steel.swire pacific holdings,zurich,so d.accordingly,we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment in admiral favor,and remand to the district court with instruction to enter summary judgment in cast steel favor as to the policy.
cast steel is a florida corporation in the business of supplying castings and components to the mining and waste energy industries.in early,it purchased professional liability insurance from admiral,a surplus lines insurer headquartered in delaware,through admiral designated surplus lines broker in the state of florida,gary markel the policy had a retroactive effective date of january,and an expiration date of january,at cast steel subsequently renewed the policy,and the renewal policy had an effective date of january,and expiration date of january,policy both policies,by their terms,were policies,which meant that each policy purported to cover only those claims which had both accrued and were reported to admiral during the policy period indicated on the face of the policy.
sometime in early,cast steel was awarded a contract to provide pallet cars to hibbing taconite hibbing,an iron ore mine located in hibbing,minnesota,for the purchase price of million.cast steel delivered the cars in june.soon thereafter,in august,hibbing reported significant problems with the wheels of the cars,which,after some investigation,cast steel determined to be caused by defective design of the bearings.on october,hibbing prepared an incident report and formally reported its claim to cast steel.cast steel immediately advised of the hibbing claim and asked that the proper claim paperwork be prepared.in an unfortunate twist of fate,failed to submit the hibbing claim to admiral until january,hours after the policy had expired.
on february,admiral sent cast steel a reservation of rights letter and began investigating the hibbing claim after four months of investigation by an independent claims adjuster,admiral sent cast steel a letter denying coverage under all policies.
this suit followed on july.cast steel originally brought the action in florida state court,seeking,inter alia,a declaration that at least one of the various policies obligated admiral to cover the hibbing claim.admiral removed the action to the middle district of florida on diversity grounds and,in july,cast steel moved for summary judgment on the policy.admiral own summary judgment motion followed.on october,the district court entertained oral argument and in november granted summary judgment to admiral,finding that none of the policies provided coverage to cast steel.
specifically,the district court determined that cast steel failed to comply with the policy notice requirement when it failed to report the hibbing claim during the policy period.as to the policy,the court held that because the hibbing claim accrued during,and cast steel was undisputedly aware of the claim when it renewed the policy,the plain language of the policy precluded coverage with respect to cast steel argument that admiral was on notice of its claim because admiral or admiral surplus lines broker markel cloaked with apparent authority to receive claims on admiral behalf,the district court found that cast steel failed to show that admiral ever represented to cast steel that was its agent in this regard and,moreover,the record showed that itself adamantly denied being admiral agent or ever making a representation to cast steel that it was admiral agent.
cast steel asserts on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to admiral because issues of fact remained as to whether was cloaked with apparent authority to receive claims on behalf of admiral.cast steel also argues that an unresolved ambiguity as to whether renewal of the policy extended the period in which it could report claims precluded summary judgment on admiral behalf.

the district court decision presents a somewhat alarming scenario.faced with two consecutive insurance policies that created apparently seamless coverage over two policy periods,the court nevertheless found that a claim accruing within the two periods was somehow not covered by either policy.on the face of the and policies,there appears to be no gap in coverage.indeed,the policy was effective until on january,and the policy was retroactively effective beginning on january,presumably at.at a glance,one would be hard pressed to imagine how a claim accruing in the middle of the two policy periods would not be covered by one of the policies.but because a policy is designed to cover only claims both accruing and reported during the specified policy period,the district court held that a claim which accrued late in the first policy period but was not reported until early in the second was covered by neither policy.
cast steel challenges the district court conclusion,and argues that because the policy automatically extends by thirty days the period in which to report claims if the insured elects to cancel or the policy,there remains an ambiguity as to whether renewal provides a similar reporting extension.subsection b of the extended discovery period provision section iv of the policy provides as follows 
if the policy is cancelled or not renewed by the named insured an automatic thirty day claims extension period shall apply to claims,provided such claims are not covered under any subsequent insurance purchased by the named insured,or that would be covered but for the exhaustion of the amount of insurance applicable to such claims.
policy,sect.iv b.cast steel chose neither of the two options above,but rather renewed the policy in the following year.neither this section,nor any section of the policy,however,discusses whether a similar reporting extension accompanies renewal of the policy.accordingly,admiral counters that the policy silence can only mean that the same reporting extension does not accompany renewal.
the district court,siding with admiral,did not find any ambiguity in the policy.granting summary judgment in admiral favor,the district court relied on the southern district of florida pantropic decision in finding that renewal of the policy did not extend the time in which cast steel could report its claim.pantropic power,fireman fund ins,d.in pantropic,which was affirmed by this court in an unpublished per curiam opinion,the plaintiff offered,and the district court rejected,the identical argument to cast steel here.the court in pantropic,in granting insurer
