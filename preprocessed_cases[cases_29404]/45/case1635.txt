capitol indemnity corp capitol appeals the district court dismissal of this contract action for capitol failure to demonstrate diversity of citizenship.we reverse.
capitol sued russellville steel company,et collectively russellville,to collect over pursuant to a general indemnity agreement.defendants were citizens of arkansas.in the complaint,capitol alleged that it was a wisconsin corporation,but did not allege that it maintained its primary place of business somewhere outside of arkansas.russellville moved to dismiss under b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,claiming that capitol failed to plead diversity jurisdiction.capitol responded to the motions and moved for leave to amend its complaint to specifically allege that capitol is an insurance corporation organized pursuant to the laws of the state of wisconsin,with its principal place of business in madison,wisconsin 
the district court granted capitol leave to amend.in addition,the district court set forth a procedure to address the outstanding rule b motions.the district court instructed capitol to provide proof of wisconsin citizenship with the amended complaint.the district court further stated that russellville would have ten days after the filing of the amended complaint to submit evidence to the contrary and that,at that time the court will resolve the diversity issue and,if necessary,the other issues raised in the defendants motions to dismiss.
with its amended complaint,capitol submitted a certified copy of its wisconsin articles of incorporation as well as the affidavit of andy anderson,senior claims examiner for capitol.anderson averred as fact that capitol was incorporated in wisconsin,maintained its principal place of business in madison,wisconsin,did not maintain a place of business in arkansas,and conducted its business of writing insurance policies and surety bonds in arkansas exclusively through the use of independent agents who were not employees of capitol.
within ten days of capitol filing of the amended complaint,russellville submitted affidavits.these affidavits averred that russellville had conducted business with capitol for over twenty years exclusively through one particular for capitol,charles allen,who maintained an office in arkansas.
capitol did not request an evidentiary hearing nor object to the procedure set out by the district court in the order granting leave to amend.three weeks after russellville submitted its affidavits,the district court ruled that capitol failed to prove that it maintained its principal place of business in wisconsin.the district court held that,because capitol failed to prove that its principal place of business was somewhere other than arkansas,arkansas had to be considered the principal place of business.accordingly,the district court found diversity of citizenship lacking and granted the defendants rule b motions.the district court stated 
the only assertion in anderson affidavit that somewhere other than arkansas is capitol principal place of business is the bald assertion that wisconsin is.in fact,capitol has not submitted any proof that it writes insurance policies and surety bonds in any state other than arkansas.
it is not enough that capitol might be able to easily prove that wisconsin is its principal place of business it has not done so.neither is it enough that the court could discover the information on its own through capitol website or by other means the court,limited to reviewing the evidence submitted by the parties,may not do so.in short,capitol has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its principal place of business is in wisconsin.although diversity jurisdiction is often easily proven and frequently is a bump in the road on the way to more substantive and,some may believe,more interesting issues,this court refuses to shirk its duty of protecting the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
in a motion to reconsider filed under rule e,capitol challenged the district court findings and,for the first time,challenged the district court procedure for submitting evidence on the diversity issue.because capitol had not previously challenged the procedure,and because capitol and the defendants all complied with the procedure without objection,the district court rejected this challenge as an impermissible attempt to raise new issues after judgment and denied capitol motion.
on appeal,capitol raises two issues.first,capitol argues that the procedure used by the district court was not a rational mode of inquiry and therefore failed to afford capitol adequate due process protection.see osborn united states,cir as no statute or rule prescribes a format for evidentiary hearings on jurisdiction,any rational mode of inquiry will do.quoting crawford united states,cir.second,capitol argues that the district court clearly erred when it determined that capitol principal place of business was in arkansas.
as to the first issue,russellville argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied capitol rule e motion to reconsider.further,russellville argues that capitol is entirely foreclosed from presenting its procedural challenge argument to the appellate court due the fact that capitol did not raise this issue until the motion for reconsideration.as to the second issue,russellville argues that capitol failure to provide evidence of business activities outside arkansas mandates a finding that arkansas is the principal place of business.
the district court did not abuse its broad discretion when it denied capitol rule e motion to reconsider.district courts enjoy broad discretion in ruling on such motions.see concordia college grace,cir the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in concluding that concordia was improperly attempting to raise,via a motion to alter or amend,arguments that it could have raised in response to grace motion for summary judgment.we have repeatedly held that rule e motions are not proper vehicles for raising new arguments.see id.nor should a motion for reconsideration serve as the occasion to tender new legal theories for the first time.quoting hagerman yukon energy,cir innovative home health care,assocs.of the black hills,cir rule e motions serve a limited function of correcting manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.citations omitted.capitol impermissibly attempted to raise its procedural challenge for the first time in its rule motion.we therefore affirm the district court judgment regarding dismissal of the rule e motion.
we find,however,that the underlying decision regarding diversity of citizenship was clear error.see blakemore missouri pac,cir applying clear error standard to a diversity of citizenship determination and stating a determination of citizenship for the purpose of diversity is a mixed question of law and fact,but mainly fact.capitol was not required to prove specifically that its principal place of business was in wisconsin.rather,to establish complete diversity of citizenship with the defendants,all that capitol was required to prove was that it was not a citizen of arkansas.because the evidence before the district court,and all the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from that evidence,precluded a finding that capitol was a citizen of arkansas,capitol met its burden.
diversity jurisdiction exists where the amount in controversy is greater than and where there is complete diversity of citizenship.a.complete diversity of citizenship exists where no defendants hold citizenship in a state where any plaintiff holds citizenship.owen equipment erection kroger,d.for diversity purposes,a corporation may be the citizen of two states.first,a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated.c.second a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it maintains its principal place of business.id.a corporation can have only one principal place of business for the purposes of diversity citizenship.see c a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of the state where it has its principal place of business emphasis added gafford,cir by common sense and by law,a corporation can have only one principa
