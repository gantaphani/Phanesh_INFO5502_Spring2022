archer daniels midland company adm filed suit against aon risk services,of minnesota aon,its insurance broker,alleging breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and negligence due to aon failure to obtain contingent business interruption and extra expense insurance coverage as requested by the jury returned a verdict in favor of aon appeals,asserting several errors.we affirm.
background 
adm,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in illinois,processes and markets a variety of agricultural commodities such as corn,wheat,and soybeans.adm uses corn to make such products as corn syrup hfcs and ethanol.aon,a minnesota corporation with its principal place of business in minnesota,is an insurance broker who acts as an intermediary between insurance companies and its clients in trying to place insurance coverage for those clients.
beginning in,adm established a program known as the dic program.the dic program was a layered program covering all risks of property loss that were not specifically excluded.under this program,multiple insurers provided different layers of coverage totaling million.the first five layers of coverage were in the amount of or million each.the final layer was a million excess layer that would be penetrated only if the underlying insurers had to pay their million in coverage.
each insurer in the dic program provided coverage under the same terms,which were found in the dic policy specifically drafted for the policy provided traditional coverages and also included coverages for contingent business interruption and extra expense 
aon became adm insurance broker for the dic program in.for the policy period,adm instructed aon to renew coverage in the dic program under the terms of the dic policy but to obtain coverage for the million excess layer from a new insurer because the previous insurer premium increase was unacceptable.aon procured coverage for the million excess layer from hartford fire insurance company hartford.however,aon failed to include contingent business interruption and extra expense insurance coverage in the hartford policy,an omission that forms the basis of the case leading up to this appeal.
in,flooding occurred in many parts of the mississippi river system,which negatively impacted the midwestern corn crop for that year and hampered the ability to move products by barge on the river.adm claimed the flood caused it to incur extra expense in order to procure sufficient quantities of corn for its processing.adm also claimed prolonged closures of parts of the mississippi and illinois rivers caused it to lose income and incur additional expense as it sought alternative means of transportation.adm ultimately submitted claims to its insurers for losses from the flood totaling more than million.adm believed the contingent business interruption and extra expense coverages applied to a substantial amount of these losses since midwestern farmers,who were unable to provide sufficient corn,and the government,which operated the mississippi river system,were two of adm suppliers.
adm insurers,other than hartford,paid approximately million to adm for damage to its property and certain other losses caused by the flood.the insurers denied payment on adm claims for contingent business interruption and extra expense,concluding those coverages did not apply because midwestern farmers and the government were not any supplier.
adm filed suit against the dic program insurers,including hartford,in federal court in illinois alleging the contingent business interruption and extra expense coverages provided under their policies extended to adm lost income and extra expense incurred as a result of the flood damage to midwestern farmers and the government.adm and the insurers other than hartford eventually settled for million the district court granted hartford motion for partial summary judgment on september,finding that hartford policy insured only against direct physical damage to adm insured property.
thereafter,adm filed suit against aon on september,alleging breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and negligence,and seeking million in damages for aon failure to secure contingent business interruption and extra expense coverages in the hartford policy.aon moved to dismiss on the grounds that adm could not seek to recover from hartford or,therefore,aon in the million excess layer because it had not exhausted the underlying million layers.the district court denied the motion,holding that adm had exhausted the lower layers by agreeing to settle with the underlying insurers for a partial sum and absorbing the balance of the million.
prior to trial,the district court entered orders excluding evidence that adm passed on its extra corn expense to its consumers by raising prices and that adm continued to produce ethanol during the period following the flood even though it was losing money on this production.the district court also excluded evidence proffered by one of aon expert witnesses that adm could have maximized profit and minimized loss by switching production from ethanol to hfcs.in addition,the district court prohibited aon from introducing evidence concerning allegations of by adm in the hfcs market.
a jury trial began on march.since aon admitted negligence during its opening statement,the trial primarily focused on damages.adm introduced evidence of the extra expense it incurred in obtaining suitable corn for production of ethanol and hfcs.aon offered expert testimony to refute adm evidence and argued that adm alleged losses were offset by adm use of hedging,a program by which adm would buy and sell commodity futures in order to minimize loss due to price fluctuation.according to aon,the expert adm used to present evidence of its increased corn costs did not take hedging into account in his analysis of adm total corn costs.on april,the jury returned a million verdict in favor of the district court entered judgment in favor of adm on april.
aon then moved for a new trial,judgment as a matter of law,and a stay of execution of judgment.the district court denied aon motions and awarded adm million in prejudgment interest.on appeal,aon argues that the district court erred in denying its motions for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial and in awarding adm million in prejudgment interest.
ii.discussion 
choice of law 
we first address aon contention that the district court should have construed the dic policy under illinois law rather than minnesota law.in a diversity case,a federal court applies the choice of law rules of the forum state.northwest airlines,astraea aviation,cir.the first consideration under minnesota choice of law rules is whether an actual conflict exists between the laws of the different states.jepson cas.of.if the choice of one state laws over the other does not create an actual conflict,there is no choice of law issue to be decided.vetter sec.cont l ins.
in concluding that it correctly applied minnesota law,the district court pointed out that aon failed to demonstrate that a conflict exists between the legal principles and standards applicable to contract interpretation,negligence,or breach of contract and fiduciary duty under minnesota and illinois law.thus,there was no choice of law issue for the district court to decide.id.at.we conclude the relevant legal principles concerning the district court interpretation of the dic policy are the same in both states.
business interruption 
on appeal,aon argues that adm can not recover contingent extra expense under section because it did not suffer any business interruption as a result of the flood.aon asserts that under section,adm was required to establish that it actually ceased production at its plants in order for the extra expense coverage to apply.because adm failed to prove this element of its case,aon claims it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
although aon couches its argument in terms of a failure of proof,the crux of its argument is that the district court incorrectly interpreted the meaning of the phrase interruption of business as used in section.because the district court provided the meaning of interruption of business in a jury instruction,adm argues we must review the issue for an abuse of discretion.see warren prejean,cir stating that a district court jury instructions are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.however,the district court fashioned its jury instruction based on an interpretation of the dic policy.all issues related to the district court interpretation of an insurance policy present questions of law,which we review de novo.united fire cas.fid.title ins,cir.

the district court interpreted the phrase interruption of business as applied to the extra expense coverage in section as follows 
the phrase interruption of business,as used in section of the dic policy,does not require adm to show that its corn processing plants stopped or slowed production.an interruption of business means some harm to the insured business,including the payment of extra expense,that would not have been incurred but for damage that an insured peril has caused to the property of any supplier.
in our view,the district court interpretation of the phrase interruption of business as applied to the extra expense coverage of section is based on the language of the policy as a whole and correctly embodies the parties intent.
section of the dic policy insures against loss of earnings and extra expense incurred as a result of a necessary interruption of business.the loss of earnings and extra expense coverages provided by section are separate and distinct,and,as discussed below,they mirror the coverages provided in other sections of the policy.
the dic policy sets forth the terms of coverage for extra expense in section.section defines extra expense as the excess,if any,of the total cost chargeable to the conduct of the insured business over and above the total cost that would normally have been incurred to conduct the business during the same period had no peril insured against and not excluded occurred.section specifically excludes from the definition any extra expense in excess of that necessary to continue as nearly as practicable the normal conduct of the insured business.because the definition of extra expense contained in section applies wherever the term is used in the dic policy,it applies to the extra expense coverage provided by section.
as defined in section,extra expense clearly includes those expenses necessary to carry on business operations section would not make any sense if the dic policy were interpreted as covering only the extra expense incurred as a result of a complete cessation of business.accordingly,aon argument that the policy only covers extra expense if business operations were stopped is inconsistent with the terms of the policy.
the district court determination that adm need not have stopped or slowed production in order to recover extra expense under section is further supported by the policy terms of coverage for loss of earnings,which are set forth in section of the dic policy under the title loss of income.under this section,the dic policy provides loss of income coverage in the event the insured is wholly or partially prevented from producing goods or from continuing business operations or services and can not make up lost production within a reasonable period of time or continue business operations or services through the use of other property or service or by working extra time or overtime.in this situation,the policy covers the actual loss of gross earnings sustained during the period of interruption of production or suspension of business operations.
with respect to loss of earnings coverage under section,the district court ruled that a shutdown or cessation of business was required.aon contends there is no justification for the district court interpretation of interruption of business under section as requiring a shutdown for loss of earnings coverage but not requiring one for extra expense coverage.however,contrary to aon argument,the district court interpretation of interruption of business for loss of earnings coverage under section is consistent with the dic policy.unlike section,section specifically requires a suspension of operations before loss of earnings coverage can apply.the absence of a similar limitation in section is evidence of the parties intent not to limit extra expense coverage in that manner.
to support its position that the phrase interruption of business requires a cessation of business,aon relies primarily on butwin sportswear paul fire marine insurance.we find butwin inapposite because the policy at issue there specifically required a suspension of operations before the insured could recover extra expenses.id.at.likewise,other cases aon cites are not persuasive for the same reason or because they do not involve extra expense coverage.see winters state farm fire cas,cir policy required a suspension of operations ramada inn ramogreen,travelers indem.of,cir involving loss of earnings coverage am.states ins.creative walking,d,policy required a suspension of operations and covered extra expense to avoid or minimize a suspension rothenberg liberty mut.ins,involving loss of earnings coverage great oil paul fire marine ins,same quality oilfield,michigan mut.ins,involving loss of income coverage keetch mut.of enumclaw ins,involving loss of earnings coverage.
the cases cited by both parties demonstrate that parties to an insurance contract can require a slowdown or cessation of business before extra expense coverage applies.the dic policy,however,does not include such a requirement with respect to the extra expense coverage of section,and we are not at liberty to rewrite the policy to include one.see polychron crum forster ins,cir.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not err in its interpretation of the phrase interruption of business as applied to the extra expense coverage of section.
evidentiary rulings 
aon challenges three of the district court evidentiary rulings.we review each ruling for an abuse of discretion,bearing in mind that the district court has substantial discretion in admitting or excluding evidence and its decision will not be overturned unless it affects the substantial rights of the challenging party.bennett hidden valley golf ski,cir.
exclusion of evidence that adm passed on its extra corn expense 
aon argues the district court erred by excluding all evidence that adm passed on its extra corn expense to its customers in the form of higher prices.aon claims exclusion of this evidence prevented it from showing that adm did not suffer any net shortfall as a result of the extra corn expense incurred in the production of hfcs.to the contrary,aon claims that adm actually made a million profit on hfcs sales in the year of the flood.aon also claims the district court ruling allowed adm to recover a windfall,which is inconsistent with the district court jury instruction that any damages awarded should make adm whole but not provide it with a windfall profit.
adm argues the district court correctly excluded evidence related to aon pass on theory because the dic policy covers extra expenses without offset for profits or sales revenues.adm claims that because the loss of earnings and extra expense coverages in section are separate coverages,there is no basis for aon argument that contingent extra expense is tied to lost earnings or limited by lost earnings avoided.we agree.
the dic policy does not state that adm extra expense recovery must be limited by or measured against its profits or sales.in fact,the formula for measuring extra expense u
