angeline applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income based on a back injury that she allegedly suffered in a automobile accident.the social security administration ssa denied her application initially and on reconsideration.after a hearing,an administrative law judge ruled that was not disabled.appealed to the district court,which remanded the case to the alj with instructions for an additional hearing.following the second hearing,the alj discounted subjective complaints of pain and ruled that she was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act because she retained the residual functional capacity to perform work in the national economy.the appeals council denied her request for review.when appealed to the district it upheld the administrative decision.
now appeals to this court,arguing that her case should be remanded to the alj for consideration under a recently revised listing of impairments.she also argues that the alj improperly discounted her subjective complaints of pain in determining whether she could perform work in the national economy.
when considering whether the alj properly denied social security benefits,we review matters of law de novo and determine whether the alj findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.see lowe apfel,cir.because we find that the alj committed no legal error and that her findings were supported by substantial evidence,we affirm.
after the second evidentiary hearing,an alj evaluated claim according to the familiar analysis prescribed by ssa regulations.see,bowen yuckert,d.the alj resolved the first and second steps in favor by finding that she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity and that she had a medically severe combination of impairments.the dispute between the parties began at the third step.see d.before the alj and the district court argued that she met listing c concerning d isorders of the spine.see part,subpt.p,app,c the alj found,however,and the district court agreed,that did not meet all of the requirements of c and thus was not conclusively presumed to be disabled under that section.the alj concluded that there was no medical evidence in the record that suffered muscle spasm,reflex loss,or sensory loss,all of which were required under 
having lost before the alj and the district court on the issue of whether she met the requirements of c,has now shifted direction somewhat and argues that c is inapplicable to her situation she urges us instead to apply new musculoskeletal listings that went into effect on february,more than two years after the ssa final disposition of her case.as part of the updated musculoskeletal listings,c was replaced by a new listing applicable to disorders of the spine.see fed.reg,part,subpt.p,app.this new listing relaxes some of the requirements of c,making it easier for a person to show disability resulting from a spine disorder.urges us to remand to the alj for consideration of whether she meets the requirements of.
we feel obligated to reject this latest request by.even if she would have met the requirements of,a question we need not decide here,it would be improper to apply retroactively to her claim.in publishing the new listings,the ssa stated that w ith respect to claims in which we have made a final decision,and that are pending judicial review in federal court,we expect that the court review of the commissioner final decision would be made in accordance with the listings in effect at the time of the final decision.fed.reg.the ssa further stated,we will continue to apply the current listings until february.when the new listings become effective,we will apply them to new applications filed on or after february.id.
despite these rather explicit pronouncements authorizing only a prospective application of the new listings,argues that remand is dictated by the line of cases that require us to apply the law in effect at the time we render our decision.seniors united for action ray,cir.while we agree with this general legal principle,is mistaken in suggesting that it dictates the application of the new listings.the ssa clearly and unambiguously explained when the new listings were issued that they apply to only those cases that have not resulted in a final administrative decision by february.that is the law in effect at this time,and its application requires us to reject request.
for to have been conclusively presumed disabled,she must have met the requirements of c.the alj and the district court found that did not meet those requirements,and does not dispute this finding or point to any medical evidence that she suffered muscle spasm,reflex loss,or sensory loss as c requires.we therefore conclude that does not have a listed impairment.
since does not have an impairment that is conclusively presumed to be disabling,the evaluation proceeds to the fourth step,where the question is whether her impairment prevents her from performing work that she has performed in the past.see e.on the strength of a vocational expert testimony,the alj gave the benefit of the doubt and assumed that she could not perform her past relevant work.the alj then turned to the fifth and final step of the process to determine whether had the functional capacity to perform other work in the national economy.see f.in making this determination,the alj heard testimony from a vocational expert who was asked two questions.
in the first instance,the alj instructed the vocational expert to assume that a person could lift no more than ten pounds occasionally and five pounds frequently could stand,walk,and sit without a problem,for one to two hours at a time could no more than occasionally stoop or climb could do no kneeling or crawling and could not work in cold and damp environmental conditions.these instructions reflect condition that the medical records documented and subjective complaints to the extent that the alj considered her complaints credible.some of subjective complaints were omitted from this hypothetical,however,as the alj deemed them to be inconsistent with the evidence as a whole.the vocational expert testified that the person who the alj hypothesized could perform work in the national economy as a statistical clerk,night desk clerk,checker,sorter,or collection records clerk.
in the second instance,the alj instructed the vocational expert to consider those subjective complaints of that the alj had discredited and omitted in the first instance.of these omissions,the most significant concerned testimony that she needed to lie down and rest frequently throughout the day.the vocational expert testified that such a person would not be able to perform work in the national economy.
complaint,simply stated,is that the alj erred by discrediting her subjective testimony concerning her functional capacity for working in the national economy.as we have already said,we review the alj decision to determine whether the commissioner factual findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.see singh apfel,cir.in determining whether substantial evidence exists for the alj decision,we consider evidence that detracts from the commissioner decision as well as evidence that supports it.woolf shalala,cir.if,after review,we find it possible to draw two inconsistent positions from the evidence and one of those positions represents the commissioner findings,we must affirm the denial of benefits.mapes chater,cir.
in evaluating a claimant subjective allegations of pain and disability,we follow the principles outlined in polaski heckler,cir.an alj may not discount subjective complaints of pain solely because they are not fully supported by the objective medical evidence,but such complaints may be discounted based on inconsistencies in the record as a whole.id.the lack of supporting objective medical evidence may be used as one factor to be considered in evaluating the credibility of the testimony and complaints.id.in addition to the medical evidence,the alj is required to assess a claimant subjective complaints in light of her prior work record and in light of observations by third parties and physici
