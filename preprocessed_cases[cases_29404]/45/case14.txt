in this massachusetts diversity case,plaintiff pacific indemnity company pacific seeks to recover damages from john deming as a result of damages deming caused to a condominium insured by pacific.deming,a tenant,not an owner,of unit at huntington avenue in boston,massachusetts,caused flooding that damaged unit in that building.pacific,which insured unit,paid unit owners as a result of the incident and,as unit subrogee,sought to recover damages in this amount as well as prejudgment interest and costs from deming.
the district court,on for summary judgment,granted judgment in favor of deming and dismissed the case.pac.indem.deming,supp.the district court concluded that pacific rights to subrogation were waived based on a clause in the bylaws of huntington avenue condominium trust bylaws that unit owners shall carry insurance,and that all such policies shall contain waivers of subrogation.id.at.
we disagree.we think the best reading of the plain language of the bylaws,master deed,and declaration of trust collectively condominium documents,is that the required waivers of subrogation do not apply to tenants.however,in any event,deming presented no evidence that unit owners actually waived their insurer subrogation rights against tenants.and so,even if the bylaws did require unit owners to purchase insurance that contains waivers of subrogation as to claims against tenants,pacific can pursue its claims against deming.we reverse the district court order and remand.
the parties have stipulated to the following facts in,deming rented unit at huntington avenue in boston under a lease with that unit owner.on may,he fell asleep after turning on the bathtub faucets in the master bathroom.the water from the bathtub overflowed and leaked into the condominium units below,causing considerable damage.pacific,which insured unit,paid to that unit owners as a result of the incident.the parties stipulate that deming was negligent in turning on the bathtub faucets and then falling asleep while they were running.
on august,pacific brought a diversity action in the massachusetts federal district court seeking to recover the amount it had paid to the owners of unit pacific pled that under its policy and otherwise by operation of law,pacific is duly subrogated to unit owners rights against deming for the damages.
deming filed an answer on january,demanding a jury trial and raising several affirmative defenses.on june,deming filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that t he waiver of subrogation contained in the plaintiff insurance policy is enforceable and prohibits the plaintiff claims against the defendant.
deming,in support of his motion for summary judgment,took the position that the obligation to secure insurance policies with such waivers is a requirement of the condominium association and pointed to the declaration of trust of the condominium association,trinity place condominium.the declaration of trust provided in paragraph.e of its bylaws 
each unit owner shall carry insurance at his own expense for his own benefit insuring,inter alia,his carpeting,wallcoverings other than paint,drapes and other window treatments,furniture,furnishings and other personal property owned by the unit owner,and personal liability,and loss assessment coverage,provided that all such policies shall contain waivers of subrogation,and further provided,that the liability of the carriers issuing insurance obtained by the trustees shall not be affected or diminished by reason of any such additional insurance carried by a unit owner.
deming argued that b y agreeing to the requirements of the condominium association,pacific insured purchased an insurance policy that permitted waiving the right of subrogation.
on july,pacific opposed deming motion for summary judgment and filed a for summary judgment.it argued,inter alia,that b ecause defendant,who admits that he is a mere tenant of a unit owner of the trinity place condominium can not establish that there is any contractual impediment to plaintiff pursuit of this subrogation claim against him,plaintiff is entitled to judgment against defendant.pacific claimed that its policy language,which provided that the insured may waive any rights of recovery from another person or organization for a covered loss in writing before the loss occurs,was not but rather merely authorized plaintiff to enter into separate agreements which waive subrogation against particular persons or organizations.pacific said that deming can point to no document indicating that he is such a person who received a waiver.pacific maintained that the only possibly pertinent language would have to be that contained in section of the bylaws,which pacific contended could not be interpreted to apply to tenants.deming opposed the on july,and pacific replied on august,
the district court entered a memorandum and order on october,in which it allowed deming motion for summary judgment and denied pacific.pac.indem,supp.at.the district court noted that trinity place bylaws required unit owners to obtain an insurance policy that shall contain a waiver of subrogation and concluded that this provision applies to tenants.id.at.it held,inter alia,that the bylaws in the case were covenants that ran with the land,id.at,and so deming is both bound by and benefits from the waiver of subrogation provision because that provision is one that runs with the land,id.at that the plain meaning of the bylaws subjects deming to the insurance and subrogation waiver imposed on unit owners,and that allowing pacific to recover from another unit owner or in this case a tenant,because its insured breached his or her obligation to obtain insurance containing a waiver of subrogation,would frustrate the clear intent of the condominium and allow pacific to benefit from its insured breach,an untenable result,id.at.this appeal followed.

u nder our precedent,in certain,somewhat unusual cases,the plenary summary judgment standard does not apply.in a nonjury case,when the basic dispute between the parties concerns only the factual inferences that one might draw from the more basic facts to which the parties have agreed,and where neither party has sought to introduce additional factual evidence or asked to present witnesses,the parties are,in effect,submitting their dispute to the court as a case stated.id.in such cases,the district court may engage in a certain amount of factfinding,including the drawing of inferences,and we review these factual inferences for clear error.id.
