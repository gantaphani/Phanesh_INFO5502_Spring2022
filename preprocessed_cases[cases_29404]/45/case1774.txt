background 
in march,congress passed and the president signed into law the affordable care act.the act establishes a comprehensive regulatory system intended to increase the number of americans covered by medical insurance and to decrease the cost of medical care.two of its provisions are at issue in this appeal the provision commonly known as the individual mandate,and the provision establishing ipab.
the individual mandate is codified in title of the internal revenue code.the mandate requires all applicable individuals,id.d,and their dependents to maintain minimum essential coverage,id.f,for every month beginning in january,id.a.if an individual fails to meet that requirement and does not qualify for an exemption,id.e,the individual must pay a penalty,termed the shared responsibility payment,with his or her annual income tax return,id.b.
ipab is a new member administrative board that will monitor the growth of medicare spending and,if actual growth exceeds projected growth,will develop and submit recommendations to reduce the growth rate to the savings target set by the chief actuary of the centers for medicare medicaid services.the requirement that ipab issue recommendations for a given year is triggered only if the chief actuary determines that actual growth will exceed projected growth in a particular year.id.b.if the chief actuary makes that determination,then ipab is required to recommend measures to reduce growth that the secretary of health and human services secretary must implement in the absence of an affirmative veto by congress id.if ipab fails to make the required recommendations for a given year,for lack of membership or otherwise,its duties fall to the secretary.id.c.once ipab completes its recommendations,it must submit them to congress and the president.id.c.if instead the secretary completes the recommendations,the secretary must submit them to the president,who must in turn submit the proposal to congress within two days.id.c.the scheme then provides,through congressional rulemaking power,id.d,detailed procedures by which congress must either consider and vote on the recommendations or pass superseding legislation,id.d.in the absence of superseding legislation,id.e a i,the secretary must implement the recommendations as submitted to congress and the president,id.e.
in august of,coons and novack,along with two members of congress filed an omnibus facial challenge to the affordable care act in the united states district court for the district of arizona.coons is a citizen of arizona,is not exempt from the affordable care act,does not have private medical insurance,and does not want to purchase private medical insurance or share his private medical history with third parties.novack is a citizen of arizona and a physician who manages a surgery practice that cares for patients,of whom receive care funded by medicare reimbursements.plaintiffs challenge the individual mandate and the establishment of ipab on several theories,including claims that those provisions violate their constitutional rights exceed article i legislative power under the commerce clause,necessary and proper clause,spending clause,and taxation power and violate article i principle.plaintiffs also seek a declaration that the arizona act is not preempted by the affordable care act.
plaintiffs challenge was one of many similar cases filed nationwide.one such case reached the united states supreme court.the court reviewed the individual mandate and two other provisions expanding medicaid coverage,a a i viii,to decide whether the provisions exceeded article i legislative power under the commerce clause,the spending clause,or congress taxation power.while the supreme court decision was pending,defendants moved to dismiss all of plaintiffs claims,and the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court stayed this action pending the supreme court disposition.
in national federation of independent business,the supreme court upheld the individual mandate as a proper exercise of congress taxation power.at,but struck,as exceeding spending clause power,the portion of the medicare expansion provision that withdrew all federal medicare funding,including funding provided for programs predating the expansion,from states that refused to adopt the expansion,id.at.following that decision,the district court lifted the stay in plaintiffs case and granted defendants motion to dismiss all claims that challenged the individual mandate for exceeding article i lawmaking power.the district court also held that the establishment of ipab did not violate article i principle.after receiving further briefing,the district court dismissed the remaining and entered final judgment for defendants.plaintiffs coons and novack timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred by dismissing their challenge to the establishment of ipab and their challenge to the individual mandate as violative of coons substantive due process rights to medical autonomy and informational privacy and by holding that the affordable care act preempts the arizona act.we disagree with their arguments for the reasons that follow.
article i non delegation challenge 
novack challenges the establishment of ipab on the ground that it violates article i principle.but we first must address the threshold question whether novack satisfies the demands of article iii for ripeness.the framers of article iii designed the federal courts to act retrospectively and to avoid encroaching,through the issuance of advisory opinions,on the prospective lawmaking role of the legislature.united pub.workers of am.mitchell.for adjudication of constitutional issues,concrete legal issues,presented in actual cases,not abstractions,are requisite.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this requirement has led to the doctrine of ripeness,which contains both a constitutional and a prudential component.portman county of santa clara,cir.the constitutional component derives from article iii and,if it is not satisfied,we lack jurisdiction to reach the merits of a dispute.thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.
the constitutional component of the ripeness inquiry is often treated under the rubric of standing and,in many cases,ripeness coincides squarely with standing injury in fact prong.id.at.when addressing the sufficiency of a showing of grounded in potential future harms,article iii standing and ripeness issues often boil down to the same question.susan anthony list driehaus,internal quotation marks omitted.in that context,ripeness can be characterized as standing on a timeline,and the analysis for both standing and ripeness is essentially the same.thomas,at.
in assuring that this jurisdictional prerequisite is satisfied,we consider whether the plaintiffs face a realistic danger of sustaining direct injury as a result of th
