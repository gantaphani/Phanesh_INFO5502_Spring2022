appellant alleged that respondents violated section,subdivision b in three ways using arbitrary discounts from list prices of comparable replacement vehicles,based on the unsubstantiated assumption that the insurance claimants would be able to negotiate a discounted price for replacement vehicles collecting price quotations for comparable vehicles but selecting only those from the low end of the price spectrum of the comparables in determining the fair market value of a comparable vehicle and making statements containing false or misleading information about facts material to insurance claims,while concealing respondents unlawful valuation methods,during the marketing of their insurance policies,during the claims process and prior to claims settlement

discussion 
the trial court properly granted respondents judgment on the.qui tam action unavailable for insurer marketing and claims handling practices 
as noted,unumprovident held that an insurer is not subject to a qui tam action under section based on its marketing and claims handling practices.unumprovident,supra,th at,d.unumprovident reasoned that by its terms an action under section may be brought on behalf of the state against every person who violates penal code sections and,and those statutes in turn criminalize the making of false or fraudulent claims to insurers.unumprovident,at,d.after noting that section is found within article of the insurance fraud prevention act,the court explained that section of the act presents the legislature relevant findings and declarations.the court indicated there is no mention in that section of any problem with insurance claims handling practices and concluded that t he clear import of the legislation is to reduce fraud against insurers in order to benefit policyholders.unumprovident,at,d,italics added.the court further noted that section et,taken as a whole,is specifically tailored toward preventing and punishing the making of fraudulent claims to insurance companies.unumprovident,at,d,italics added.
unumprovident rejected appellant argument that section,subdivision b must be interpreted to apply to insurers because the statute states it applies to any person and because section defines person to include a corporation.unumprovident,supra,th at,d.the court stated,the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.section,subdivision b is directed at every person who violates any provision of this section or section or of the penal code,not simply to e very person,and a straightforward reading of these statutes makes clear that the class of persons who violate these sections are those who submit false or fraudulent claims to insurers.id.at,d,italics added.in a footnote,unumprovident commented,w e note as well that section,subd.e reads any interested persons,including an insurer,may bring a civil action for a violation of this section thus,we can surmise that when the legislature wanted to ensure that insurance companies were to be included in the definition of the term person,it explicitly said so.id.at,fn,d.
the court in unumprovident further observed that penal code section,subdivisions a through and b and specifically refer to the presentation of false or fraudulent claims for compensation or benefits.the court concluded that because appellant allegations of insurer misconduct in that case did not include the presentation of false or fraudulent claims,such sections by their terms did not apply to the defendant insurer.unumprovident,supra,th at,d.
