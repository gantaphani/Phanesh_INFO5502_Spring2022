donald heavrin appeals from the judgment of the district court,which affirmed a decision of the bankruptcy court permitting baxter schilling,the trustee for triple s restaurants tsr,to avoid the fraudulent transfer of a life insurance policy and to recover the value of the transfer on behalf of tsr creditors.the policy on the life of heavrin stepfather,robert harrod,was transferred from tsr to a trust benefitting heavrin and his stepsister,bobbie bridges,shortly before tsr filed for bankruptcy.when the bankruptcy court determined that the transfer could be avoided,heavrin and bridges were ordered to pay the tsr trustee the that they had received from the insurance carrier,plus interest.the district court affirmed this decision,as well as the bankruptcy court denial of the motion that heavrin filed seeking to recuse the bankruptcy court judge.
on appeal,heavrin argues that the transfer was not fraudulent because all of the proceeds from the life insurance policy had previously been assigned by tsr to the mcdonnell douglas finance corporation mdfc,one of tsr creditors,and therefore the policy was of no value to either tsr or the trust.he also claims that the payment from mdfc,which he received through the trust,was in settlement of unrelated claims that harrod estate had against mdfc.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
in,michael macatee and robert harrod formed tsr to obtain a franchise for the operation of sizzler restaurants in louisville,kentucky.each of them owned of tsr stock.heavrin,a kentucky lawyer who was harrod stepson,served as tsr attorney.
prior to the formation of tsr,negotiations regarding a loan had taken place between mdfc and s b of indiana,a predecessor in interest of tsr.the terms of a december commitment letter issued to s b by mdfc required robert harrod and michael macatee to obtain key man life insurance in the minimum amount of naming mdfc equipment leasing corporation as beneficiary.when the loan agreement was actually executed three months later,in march of,tsr was substituted for s harrod,macatee,and tsr were all on the million loan from mdfc,for which all three were jointly and severally liable.
three days after securing the loan from mdfc,s b purchased an insurance policy on harrod life from transamerica occidental life in the amount of million.s b then transferred all of its interest in the harrod policy to tsr.four policies were also obtained on the life of macatee,each in the amount of,although the details regarding these policies are not reflected in the record.in november of,the harrod policy from transamerica was replaced by a million policy issued by jackson national.tsr made this substitution in order to save money on the premium payments for the harrod policy.shortly after the transamerica policy was replaced by the jackson national policy,michael forrester,an insurance agent and friend of heavrin,completed a collateral assignment of the harrod policy proceeds from tsr to mdfc.
harrod and macatee informed heavrin in august of that tsr was in dire financial straits and that they wanted tsr to file a chapter bankruptcy petition.heavrin advised them against filing for bankruptcy,instead counseling them to attempt to reach an arrangement with tsr creditors that would enable tsr to remain in business.less than a month later,a lawyer who shared office space with heavrin drafted an irrevocable trust agreement the trust in which harrod was the grantor and trustee.the beneficiaries of the trust were heavrin and bridges.harrod transferred his shares of tsr stock to the trust in september of.
tsr financial condition continued to deteriorate,and,by november of,it did not have the resources to make the quarterly premium payments on the harrod policy.as a result,mdfc began to pay the premiums to ensure that the policy would not lapse.making certain that the premium payments were submitted promptly became even more crucial in march of,when mdfc was informed that harrod had been diagnosed with lung cancer.
in june of,heavrin told mdfc that harrod cancer was terminal.shortly thereafter,tsr transferred its ownership of the harrod policy to the trust without receiving any financial consideration.this transfer was executed on tsr behalf by macatee.at the time of the transfer,tsr owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding unsecured debts and was insolvent.
three days after the trust became the owner of the harrod policy,heavrin began negotiating with mdfc for a settlement on behalf of the trust.on september,while these negotiations were ongoing,harrod died.mdfc and heavrin signed a settlement agreement a month later,on november.in accordance with this agreement,mdfc,as the beneficiary of the policy,instructed jackson national to pay of the proceeds to the trust.jackson national subsequently paid the trust the plus a small amount of interest as required by the policy.although heavrin and bridges were equal beneficiaries of the trust,they apparently agreed that bridges would receive and that heavrin would keep the remainder.
bankruptcy court proceedings 
in september of,tsr filed for bankruptcy protection.mdfc filed a proof of claim against tsr for two months later.no mention is made in this document of the million in life insurance proceeds that were paid as a result of harrod death.at oral argument,however,counsel for heavrin acknowledged that mdfc eventually credited tsr for the million payment that mdfc received from the proceeds of the harrod policy.but mdfc did not credit tsr for the entire million of the policy proceeds,presumably because it subtracted the payment that it directed jackson national to pay to the trust.
in july of,the trustee for tsr filed suit in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of kentucky,seeking to avoid the transfer of the harrod policy to the trust under b and a,and to recover the plus interest paid to the trust by jackson national.the tsr trustee alleged that the payment directed by mdfc to the harrod trust was facilitated by the trust ownership of the harrod policy.heavrin insisted,however,that the payment was in settlement of certain claims that he had considered bringing against mdfc on behalf of harrod estate.
the bankruptcy court ordered the avoidance of the transfer under b and a on the grounds that the transfer was made without valuable consideration and with the intent to defraud tsr creditors.pursuant to a,which permits a trustee to recover the property or the value of the property whose transfer was avoided under or,the bankruptcy court held that the payment from jackson national to the trust was recoverable by the trustee for the benefit of tsr and its creditors.heavrin and bridges were therefore ordered to pay the tsr trustee the money that they had received through the harrod trust,together with interest at per annum.
the bankruptcy court also directed heavrin to disgorge approximately of the roughly in attorney fees that he was paid by tsr during the year preceding tsr bankruptcy because heavrin had failed to report these payments to the bankruptcy court as required by the federal bankruptcy rules.see fed.finally,the bankruptcy court denied heavrin petition requesting that bankruptcy judge david stosberg recuse himself on the grounds of his alleged bias against heavrin.
district court proceedings 
heavrin appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the united states district court for the western district of kentucky.the district court upheld the decision of the bankruptcy court with respect to the avoidance of the transfer,but did so under a different theory.it held that the transfer was avoidable under a on the basis of constructive fraud rather than actual fraud.the district court also upheld the denial by the bankruptcy court of heavrin recusal motion,but concluded that the bankruptcy court had erred in requiring heavrin to disgorge approximately of the attorney fees that he had received from tsr prior to the bankruptcy.
heavrin timely appealed to this court,claiming that the district court had erred in affirming the avoidance of the transfer to the trust and in upholding the bankruptcy court denial of his recusal motion.he also argues,apparently for the first time,that the bankruptcy court erred in requiring him to pay prejudgment interest at a rate of per annum on the attorney fees that he was ordered to disgorge.
d.other appeals 
two previous appeals have been heard by this court in connection with the tsr bankruptcy.in schilling heavrin in re triple s restaurants,wl cir.may,unpublished per curiam hereinafter tsr i,we affirmed the bankruptcy court denials of motions submitted by heavrin,bridges,and the trust to recuse bankruptcy judge stosberg,to extend the time to appeal,and to permit amendment of the notice of appeal to include the trust and bridges as appellants.we also affirmed the district court finding that the bankruptcy court order was a final judgment.in schilling heavrin in re triple s restaurants,wl cir.may,unpublished per curiam hereinafter tsr ii,we reinstated the bankruptcy court judgment requiring heavrin to disgorge a portion of the attorney fees that he received from tsr prior to the bankruptcy.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
when we review bankruptcy decisions,our standard of review is slightly different from our normal standard of review because district courts are not the triers of fact of bankruptcy cases.investors credit batie in re batie,cir.because the bankruptcy court makes the initial findings of fact,the district court is bound by these findings unless they are clearly erroneous.id.if the district court decision is appealed to this court,then we review the district court conclusions of law de novo,and we accord no deference to the district court findings of fact.id.stating that we do not review the district court assessment of the bankruptcy court factual findings,but instead follow the bankruptcy court factual findings unless we consider them to be clearly erroneous emphasis in original.
avoidance of the transfer 
the bankruptcy court determined that the transfer of the harrod policy from tsr to the trust could be avoided by the tsr trustee in accordance with either b or a.pursuant to section b,a trustee may avoid a transfer if the transferor was insolvent at the time and if the transfer is voidable under applicable state law.there is no dispute in the present case that tsr was insolvent at the time of the transfer.thus,the dispositive question under b is whether the transfer is voidable under kentucky law.the bankruptcy court held that the transfer of the harrod policy is voidable under kentucky revised statutes,which provides that transfers shall be void as to creditors if made with the intent to delay,hinder or defraud creditors,purchasers or other persons,and under kentucky revised statutes,which provides that transfers of a debtor shall be void against existing creditors if made without valuable consideration.
in an alternative holding,the bankruptcy court also determined that the transfer of the harrod policy could be avoided by the tsr trustee pursuant to a.this section permits the avoidance of a transfer made within one year of the filing of the bankruptcy petition if the transfer was made with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud the transferor existing or future creditors,or if the transferor was insolvent at the time of the transfer and did not receive consideration that was reasonably equivalent in value to the transferred asset.
heavrin argues that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that the transfer was avoidable under either b or a because,he asserts,the ownership of the harrod policy had no value for tsr.as a result,transferring the policy to the trust purportedly did not diminish the bankruptcy estate.he insists that the harrod policy proceeds were not the property of tsr because they were fully assigned to mdfc,and the payment directed by mdfc to the trust was in settlement of certain claims possessed by harrod that were completely unrelated to the trust ownership of the harrod policy.
heavrin has not established that mdfc was unconditionally entitled to all of the policy proceeds 
if heavrin is correct,and tsr did not lose anything of value when it transferred the harrod policy to the trust,then tsr unsecured creditors were not defrauded and the transfer can not be avoided.see houston edgeworth in re edgeworth,cir when a payment by the insurer can not inure to the debtor pecuniary benefit,then that payment should neither enhance nor decrease the bankruptcy estate.the fact that the trust was able to secure a payment from mdfc by virtue of its ownership of the harrod policy,in other words,does not make the transfer avoidable if tsr would have been unable to extract a similar benefit had it retained ownership of the policy.
heavrin first no transfer of tsr property occurred because the harrod policy proceeds were fully assigned to not borne out by the evidence.heavrin insists that,because tsr had assigned the proceeds of the harrod policy to mdfc,the entire million from jackson national belonged to mdfc regardless of whether tsr retained ownership of the policy or transferred ownership to the trust.see edgeworth,at acknowledging that the debtor owns the policy,however,does not end the inquiry.the question is not who owns the polic y,but who owns the liability proceeds.citation and quotation marks omitted.
whether mdfc was unconditionally entitled to the full proceeds of the harrod policy,however,is far from clear.the tsr trustee points to the fact that there are no documents demonstrating that the assignment of the harrod policy was collateral for the loan from mdfc.in the absence of such proof,the trustee asserts that the issue was ripe for negotiation and that could have resulted in tsr retaining at least a part of the harrod policy proceeds.see demczyk mut.life ins.of in re graham square,cir stating that property of the estate includes the debtor interest in a cause of action.
circumstantial evidence,admittedly,supports heavrin contention that all of the harrod policy proceeds belonged to mdfc as collateral for the loan to tsr.for instance,three days after securing the loan from mdfc,tsr predecessor in interest,s b,purchased the original policy on harrod life from transamerica.an internal mdfc memorandum also states that mdfc loan to tsr was secured by a lien on the equipment in the stores it financed,a letter of credit in the amount of,and a key man insurance policy on the partners in the amount of 
on the other hand,there is no direct evidence to establish that mdfc was entitled to all of the proceeds from the harrod policy.the policy is not mentioned in any of the loan documents between mdfc and tsr.and,although the policy on harrod life was purchased three days after the loan was made,the assignment of the policy proceeds to mdfc did not take place until november of,more than three years later.
there is also evidence that tsr had intended another use for at least some of the harrod policy proceeds.a stock purchase agreement entered into by harrod and tsr in states that,upon harrod death,the proceeds of the life insurance policy s pertaining to this agreement shall be used for the purpose of redemption.the insurance policy referenced in the agreement is the jackson national policy on harrod life.this potential dual use of the both loan repayment and stock an obvious ambiguity.
finally,the facts support another theory under which tsr would be entitled to some of the insurance proceeds without resorting to extortionate litigation tactics.tsr million loan was secured by million worth of life insurance million on the life of harrod and million on the life of macatee.thus,although mdfc was theoretically entitled to collect up to million upon the death of either man,a proportional division of liability would result in approximately million being applied to mdfc loan and leave roughly to the owner of the policy.this is precisely the amount that heavrin gained through the transfer of the policy from tsr to the trust,an amount that presumably would have redounded to tsr in the absence of the transfer.
although the record is ambiguous as to why mdfc ceded to the trust,there is no question that the settlement agreement between the trust and mdfc acknowledges that s ubsequent to the trust becoming the beneficiary of the policy,a dispute ha d arisen between the trust and mdfc as to the amount of the policy proceeds payable to mdfc.in order to settle the dispute in a manner which would expedite payment of the policy proceeds,mdfc agreed to pay the trust plus interest.this evidence severely weakens heavrin assertion that the entire proceeds of the harrod policy undisputably belonged to mdfc and consequently were of no value to tsr.we therefore can not say that the bankruptcy court erred when it rejected heavrin claim on this basis.
heavrin contention that all of the harrod policy proceeds belonged to mdfc is further undercut by an argument in heavrin appellate brief.he contends that,regardless of whether tsr retained ownership of the harrod policy or transferred it to the trust,tsr was entitled to in debt reduction upon payment of all the policy proceeds to mdfc.but heavrin counsel acknowledged at oral argument that,in the documents that mdfc filed in the tsr bankruptcy proceedings,mdfc credited tsr with only million in debt reduction after receiving that amount from the proceeds from the harrod policy.this amount is shy of the full million in policy proceeds payable on harrod death,and corresponds to the allocation of the proceeds that heavrin negotiated on behalf of the trust.the fact that mdfc credited tsr for only a portion of the proceeds of the harrod policy is an indication that mdfc did not consider all of the proceeds to be its property.
furthermore,even if the primary effect of avoidance would be to send the back to mdfc,that money would offset tsr outstanding debt to mdfc,thereby freeing up funds in that amount to pay the unsecured creditors.avoiding the transfer,in other words,decreases the amount of secured debt and increases the trustee ability to pay the remaining creditors.because such avoidance establishes a benefit to tsr unsecured creditors,we heavrin argument that avoiding the transfer would benefit only mdfc.
heavrin has not established that the payment from mdfc was in settlement of claims 
heavrin also advances the argument that the transfer of the harrod policy to the trust did not harm tsr unsecured creditors because the payment that the trust received from mdfc was in settlement of certain claims possessed by harrod that were completely unrelated to the trust ownership of the harrod policy.he contends that mdfc had the settlement to the trust paid from the proceeds of the harrod policy merely as a matter of convenience,not because the policy proceeds were in any way related to the payment.
the circumstances surrounding the payment from mdfc,however,do not support heavrin contention on this ground either.as the bankruptcy court noted,a letter written to heavrin by mdfc states that t he disbursement of the would represent the full settlement of all matters relating to this insurance policy.this letter alone constitutes persuasive evidence that the payment authorized by mdfc was related to the trust ownership of the harrod policy.moreover,the settlement was paid to the trust,not to harrod estate.if the payment authorized by mdfc was in settlement of claims that harrod possessed personally,as heavrin argues,then mdfc would presumably have directed the payment to harrod estate.the fact that this was not done suggests that ownership of the harrod policy,which the trust possessed but harrod estate did not,was an important consideration for mdfc in authorizing the payment to the trust.
also problematic for heavrin is the fact that the payment by mdfc came directly out of the harrod policy proceeds as a transfer of funds from jackson national to the trust.heavrin explains that he arranged for this payment to be made in this manner in response to his fear that mdfc would renege on the settlement after it received the policy proceeds.but this admission suggests that the owner of the harrod policy had at least some additional leverage when negotiating with mdfc,which is contrary to heavrin argument that ownership of the policy was essentially meaningless and absolutely worthless.
the core of heavrin argument is that he asserted claims on behalf of harrod estate and that he collected the as a result of those claims.the bankruptcy court rejected this argument,observing that the trust did not stand in a relationship with mdfc and finding that heavrin had not pointed to any egregious conduct by mdfc that could have formed the basis for such claims.although we agree with the bankruptcy court observation that the trust did not stand in a relationship with mdfc,heavrin has a legitimate argument to the extent that he was negotiating on behalf of harrod estate rather than the trust.nevertheless,heavrin consistent failure to explain the legal basis for the alleged claims is fatal to his defense.
heavrin does not insist that he is prevented from making such a disclosure by any confidentiality agreement with mdfc.and the disclosure of any grounds possessed by harrod for such a suit could not possibly harm mdfc because the litigation between the trustee and mdfc has already been settled.see schilling mdfc equip.leasing,ap,unpublished stating that the order was entered in settlement and compromise of any and all causes of action of plaintiff this bankruptcy estate against defendant.heavrin inability to provide a description of the alleged claims suggests that there were no such claims.instead,the trust ownership of the harrod policy appears to have been the key factor that caused mfdc to have the paid to the trust.we therefore agree with the bankruptcy court that heavrin has failed to establish that the policy proceeds paid to the trust were in settlement of any claims.
in agreeing with the courts below regarding heavrin inability to explain the nature of the alleged claims,we also affirm those courts decision to shift the burden of proof to heavrin on this point.indeed,heavrin does not argue that he presented evidence that justified a contrary finding as to the claims,but instead maintains that the bankruptcy court erred in shifting the burden of proof to him to do so.he contends that the tsr trustee had the burden to demonstrate that the policy proceeds paid to the trust were made to settle claims that would have rightfully belonged to tsr had it retained ownership of the harrod policy.this is the contention to which we now turn.
heavrin position as an insider and his status as a close relative constitute badges of fraud that justify shifting the burden of proof 
heavrin is correct in pointing out that a trustee attempting to avoid an allegedly fraudulent transfer normally bears the burden of proof on that issue,but the bankruptcy court in the present case found that the transfer of the harrod policy from tsr to the trust displayed several badges of fraud that justified shifting the burden of proof to heavrin to demonstrate that the transfer did not harm tsr unsecured creditors.see united states westley,wl,at cir,unpublished i f there are badges of fraud which cast suspicion on the transaction,the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to explain the transaction and show that it was not fraudulent.badges of fraud are circumstances so frequently attending fraudulent transfers that an inference of fraud arises from them.united states isaac,wl,at cir.july,unpublished citation and quotation marks omitted.
one badge of fraud identified by the bankruptcy court with respect to the transfer of the harrod policy was that the beneficiaries of the and the children of one the of tsr.see isaac,wl,at stating that kentucky courts treat transfers between close family members or people in confidential relationships,in the context of impending financial difficulties,as a badge of fraud cooper osbourne in re osbourne,listing transfers made to a family member or close relation as a badge of fraud.
another badge of fraud identified by the bankruptcy court was heavrin position as corporate counsel for tsr,which made him an insider with respect to tsr transfer of the harrod policy to the trust.because he benefitted from the transfer,the court found that heavrin insider status was a badge of fraud that jus
