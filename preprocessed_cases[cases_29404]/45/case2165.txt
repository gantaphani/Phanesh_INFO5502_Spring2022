in this diversity case,plaintiff allen giddens giddens sued defendant the equitable life assurance society of the united states equitable for disability benefits under two policies.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of equitable and partial summary judgment in favor of giddens,concluding that giddens was entitled to payment under the policies for one of his claims.equitable appeals the grant of summary judgment to giddens and the denial of its summary judgment motion.
background 
in and,equitable issued two disability income insurance policies the policies to giddens.the policies did not require giddens to be disabled from any occupation but only from his regular occupation.specifically,the policies defined the term your regular occupation as the occupation or occupations,if more than one in which you are regularly engaged for gain or profit at the time you become disabled.
the policies provided for certain benefits to be paid to giddens in the event of total disability,defined as follows 
total disability means your inability due to injury or sickness to engage in the substantial and material duties of your regular occupation.it will not be considered to exist for any time you are not under the regular care and attendance of a doctor.
the policies each also contained a rider providing additional coverage for residual disability defined as follows 
residual disability means your inability due to injury or sickness to perform 
one or more of the substantial and material duties of your occupation or 
the substantial and material duties of your occupation for as much time as is usually required to perform them 
this appeal primarily concerns whether giddens is totally or only partially disabled from his regular occupation.we first review the undisputed evidence.
giddens dental practice 
giddens practiced general dentistry from until in hawkinsville,georgia.in,he sold his practice to another dentist and cancelled his dental malpractice liability insurance policies.according to giddens,it was his intention to open another dental office in macon,georgia in a building he had previously acquired.however,giddens became ill in,and his health did not permit him to open the practice in macon.nevertheless,he remained a licensed dentist until december,and continued to subscribe to certain professional journals in the field of dentistry.at some point following the sale of his practice,giddens applied for a position as a dentist with the state merit system.furthermore,giddens testified that he continues to perceive his primary profession as that of dentistry,and that it was his intention to open a dental office in macon until the time he became disabled in.
giddens real estate 
while practicing dentistry and following the sale of his dental practice,giddens also engaged for profit in real estate development and investment.giddens and his wife owned two companies,giddens construction,and oak land development,through which giddens participated in the development of real estate.through these companies,giddens bought real estate and developed a subdivision.the record shows that residential lots were developed and sold by giddens companies,and indicates the address of each lot and when each lot was sold.giddens also developed commercial property and was involved with residential rental properties.
giddens principal duties in his real estate business were entrepreneurial,financial,planning,coordinating,and other administrative duties.although giddens had a construction company and developed projects,he performed no physical labor on the job sites,but subcontracted out all the physical labor to independent subcontractors.giddens was able to engage in the real estate business with his wife assistance until,when his health no longer permitted his doing so.
in an affidavit,giddens described the functional requirements and tasks for the occupation of construction management and real estate development as follows 
entrepreneurial vision and energy planning real estate projects selection of house plans and materials selection of contractors supervision of construction superintendent s periodic inspection of contractors work quality financial management of development and construction projects supervise compliance with building and other regulatory codes project scheduling pay bills pay contractors work with banks,government agencies,and financial consultants as needed calculating the feasibility of projects,reviewing sites,and planning for contingencies and coordination of dealings with realtors and agents.
giddens two claims 
giddens submitted two claims to equitable under the policies,one in february the claim and one in february the claim.giddens claim asserted that he was disabled due to pain in his left hip however,he failed to respond to equitable requests for information pursuant to the policies.as a result,the district court granted equitable summary judgment as to the claim.giddens does not challenge the district court conclusions on this issue on appeal.thus,this appeal concerns only his claim.
in october,giddens began suffering from symptoms such as fatigue and abdominal pain.he sought treatment at the mayo clinic in jacksonville,florida,where rolland dickson diagnosed him with cryogenic cirrhosis,a condition of the liver.after being diagnosed,giddens submitted the claim,asserting that he was on a waiting list for a liver transplant,was disabled,and was unable to pursue his professions of dentistry and real estate development.in may,giddens underwent surgery.since the transplant,his liver test and renal functions have returned to normal,but giddens still has numerous health problems.
as to his health problems,giddens produced testimony and rule reports of two treating physicians,who both supported giddens disability claims james richard spivey,a gastroenterologist,treated giddens during his recovery at the mayo clinic.spivey testified that notwithstanding giddens initially positive liver function following the implantation of the allograft,giddens continues to experience numerous adverse symptoms,including numbness in his fingers,hand tremors,gastrointestinal difficulties,chronic sleep disturbances and fatigue,anxiety,depression,and memory loss.spivey opined that those symptoms were the result of both giddens disorder and the effects of his medication.based on his review of the enumerated functional requirements and tasks of dentistry and real estate development discussed above,spivey further opined that giddens is unable to perform substantial portions of the duties of a dentist or real estate developer,or any other employment known to spivey approximating the same livelihood as those professions,given his personal circumstances,including his experience,education,and physical and mental capabilities.in his deposition,spivey clarified that by substantial portions of the duties,he meant most of the duties.spivey also explained how giddens health conditions and medications could affect cognitive functioning,including entrepreneurial vision,as well as energy and physical capabilities.
giddens also presented testimony of a second treating physician,mary patrice webster,who has served as giddens psychiatrist since,treating his depression associated with his liver failure,transplant,and complications.webster affidavit presents essentially the same conclusions as that of spivey with regard to giddens disability.in her deposition,webster further testified that,in her opinion,giddens could not perform the duties of either dentistry or real estate development on a consistent basis.webster clarified that in her affidavit,when she said giddens was unable to perform substantial portions of his duties,she meant the vast majority of the duties.she further stated it could potentially mean all the duties,but tend not to speak in absolutes.webster noted that giddens primary problems,in her view,were his depression and cognitive problems.
in addition to his doctors reports and testimony,giddens also submitted his affidavit stating that he continues to be unable to work as a dentist or real estate developer,as follows 
since my liver failure and liver transplant,i have been unable to perform most of the duties of either of my occupations,as a dentist or in residential real estate development.while i am not totally helpless,i am unable to resume either of these occupations,or any work of which i am aware approximating the same livelihood,in keeping with my background,circumstances,and physical and mental capabilities.
equitable payments 
when it received the claim,equitable began paying total disability benefits while investigating the claim.after an medical review in august,however,equitable concluded that there was no current significant impairment that would preclude giddens from performing most of the duties of his occupational description,and equitable continued to make benefit payments only pursuant to a reservation of rights equitable disbursed a total of in benefits to giddens under the reservation of rights.
in september,equitable reportedly learned that giddens had not actively practiced dentistry for four years before he became disabled and that his real estate pursuit was essentially passive in nature.equitable requested clarification from giddens.in march,equitable terminated the payment of benefits to giddens.
litigation 
in june,giddens filed suit in state court seeking benefits under the policies,plus interest and enhanced damages for bad faith failure to pay pursuant to.equitable filed a counterclaim seeking recovery of the paid to giddens under a reservation of rights.in july,equitable removed the case to federal district court.after the discovery period expired,giddens filed a motion for partial summary judgment and equitable filed a for summary judgment as to all claims 
on november,the district court entered an order granting summary judgment to equitable as to all claims except the claim,and granting giddens motion for summary judgment as to the claim based on his being totally disabled from his real estate occupation.giddens v.the equitable life assurance soc y of united states,d.the district court determined that giddens was engaged in the regular occupation of real estate developer at the time he became disabled in and that giddens was totally disabled with regard to that occupation.id.at.
as to dentistry,the district court agreed with giddens that dentistry could also be considered his regular occupation,but that fact issues existed as to whether giddens had permanently abandoned dentistry or only temporarily ceased dentistry due to circumstances beyond his control.id.at.the district court determined that those fact issues,however,did not preclude summary judgment on giddens dentistry claim because if giddens was engaged in his dentistry occupation at the time of his disability,the evidence shows he is unable to perform the substantial and material duties of a dentist and is disabled from that occupation as well.id.at.
giddens then filed a motion for summary judgment as to damages,which the district court granted in part and denied in part.the district court entered judgment for giddens in the amount of for unpaid benefits and interest and as a refund of premium payments,for a total judgment of.the district court denied relief on giddens bad faith claim.
equitable now appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment to giddens on the claim and denial of its summary judgment motion as to that claim 
ii.discussion 
we address the issues equitable raises about giddens dentistry occupation and then his real estate occupation.
giddens dentistry practice 
in the district court and on appeal,giddens claims he had dual and real estate is totally disabled from both.equitable contends that giddens had abandoned his dentistry practice years prior to his liver transplant,that as a matter of law dentistry was not his regular occupation at the time of his disability,and that thus the district court erred in denying equitable summary judgment on his dentistry claim.
the policies define regular occupation as the occupation or occupations,if more than one in which you are regularly engaged for gain or profit at the time you become disabled,not over the course of the insured life.emphasis added.the ordinary meaning of regular,as used in this context,is c ustomary,usual,or normal.american heritage dictionary of the english language fourth ed at at the time giddens became disabled,he had not practiced dentistry in over four years.we thus readily conclude that giddens was not regularly engaged in dentistry at the time he became disabled,even if he intended to return to dentistry at some point if his health permitted.accordingly,the district court erred in denying equitable summary judgment on the dentistry issue.
real estate occupation 
this conclusion,however,does not prevent giddens from recovering benefits if he was totally disabled from his real estate occupation.in the district court,equitable asserted that giddens real estate endeavor was merely a passive investment and not an occupation.the district court rejected that argument,and concluded that giddens had a real estate occupation,stating that 
the only evidence now in the record as it relates to giddens involvement in real estate development shows that his activities went well beyond that of a casual investor who simply places money in a given commodity with hopes of an appreciation in value.rather,it shows that he had significant administrative duties in connection with that enterprise.
giddens,d at.the district court also explained that equitable had failed to cite any authority holding that an enterprise engaged in for profit can not constitute one regular occupation when it is subjectively perceived by the insured or his agents as an investment.id.
on appeal,equitable does not challenge the district court determination that giddens had a real estate occupation and was involved in that occupation at the time of his disability.rather,in the district court and on appeal equitable argues that issues of fact exist as to what the substantial and material duties of giddens real estate occupation actually were,that the policies require that giddens must be unable to perform all of those substantial and material duties in order to be totally disabled,and that giddens failed to prove he was disabled from all such duties.we turn to those issues.
substantial and material duties of real estate occupation 
as noted above,the policies provide that total disability means the insured inability due to injury or sickness to engage in the substantial and material duties of the insured regular occupation.in his affidavit,giddens described the functional requirements and tasks for the occupation of construction management and real estate development as follows 
entrepreneurial vision and energy planning real estate projects selection of house plans and materials selection of contractors supervision of construction superintendent s periodic inspection of contractors work quality financial management of development and construction projects supervise compliance with building and other regulatory codes project scheduling pay bills pay contractors work with banks,government agencies,and financial consultants as needed calculating the feasibility of projects,reviewing sites,and planning for contingencies and coordination of dealings with realtors and agents.
giddens,d at.the duties listed in giddens affidavit are basically entrepreneurial,financial,planning,coordinating,and administrative duties.thus,the record showed what giddens substantial and material duties were in his real estate occupation 
because equitable does not now dispute that giddens was engaged in the occupation of real estate development,the question we must answer for summary judgment purposes is whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to equitable,any genuine issue of material fact precludes a finding that giddens was unable to perform the substantial and material duties of his real estate development occupation.equitable did not present expert evidence about the substantial and material duties of giddens real estate venture.rather,equitable primarily asserts that two items in the record contradict giddens testimony and create fact issues as to what his real estate duties were.equitable brief points to giddens representation to the social security administration in his may work history report that the development work was all s ubcontracted to independent contractors rather than performed by giddens himself,and his attorney representation in a letter,dated september,that the real estate business was a passive investment managed primarily by his wife.the district court properly rejected this argument.
as for giddens representations,in the social security report he identified his job title as real estate development and listed his rate of pay as per year and his hours as two to five per day,five days per week giddens described his development job by completing the social security report as follows 
on the next page under remarks,giddens stated real estate development was mainly an investment.we had no employees all work was subcontracted out.giddens also responded no to the question of whether he supervised people in the development job.
as for the representations of giddens former attorney,randall harrison,this is what he stated in a september,letter to equitable 
the real estate development was a passive investment for giddens that was managed primarily by his wife.it required little physical activity as he did none of the physical work.the real estate development consisted of rental property and development of a subdivision.these investment activities occurred during a period from june,until october.as a result of the family relocating,his wife was not able to continue with the management of these investments which resulted in the sale of many of the assets.
during his deposition,harrison explained that the phrase passive investment,as used in that letter,means a real estate investment where you own property but you not managing it actively from day to day an example of that is when you have acreage real estate that you holding for investment purposes.
harrison relied on giddens social security report as well as other communications from giddens in devising the term passive investment.harrison referenced that report and attached a copy of it to the september,letter.as we have already shown,in the report,giddens indicated that he did not perform physical work,and he also characterized the occupation as mainly an investment.giddens stated in the report,however,that he developed land for commercial and residential use,and he indicated that he use d technical knowledge or skills to do so.giddens also said that he had to write reports or complete forms as part of his occupation.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to equitable,there is no evidentiary basis for concluding that the substantial and material duties of giddens real estate development occupation included any active management or physical work.harrison letter and the report to the social security administration,however,show that his duties in this passive investment required him to use technical knowledge or skills.thus,the type of passive investment in real estate development that had been his occupation requires expertise and knowledge in investing.it requires,at a minimum,the business savvy,brain power,and research skills to be able to distinguish a good investment from a bad one.giddens owned his own real estate company,oak land development,and equitable does not dispute that he was the brain,although not the brawn,behind that operation.
this definition of passive investment is consistent with giddens description during his deposition of his duties as including,in part entrepreneurial vision and energy planning real estate projects selection of house plans and materials selection of contractors supervis ing compliance with building and other regulatory codes project scheduling work ing with banks,government agencies,and financial consultants as needed calculating the feasibility of projects,reviewing sites,and planning for contingencies and coordinat ing dealings with realtors and agents.
giddens uncontroverted medical evidence shows that he suffers from a host of physical conditions as well as mental impairments.spivey identified giddens impairments as including chronic sleep disturbances which lead to chronic fatigue,poor coping abilities,chronic anxiety and depression,and short term memory loss.his medications cause cognitive problems including memory loss,inability to concentrate or function,inability to sleep,and ongoing depression.webster testified in her deposition that in addition to depression,giddens has auditory and visual hallucinations and side effects to his medicine including forgetfulness and confusion.equitable did not perform an independent medical evaluation of giddens.the testimony of spivey and webster stands unrefuted.
the heart of giddens claim is that given his cognitive problems and physical ailments,he can not perform the entrepreneurial,financial,planning,coordinating,and administrative duties of his real estate occupation.giddens medical evidence and his doctors testimony established that he can not perform most or the majority of those duties and thus can not engage in his real estate occupation.we also agree with the district court following assessment of equitable position 
while placing inordinate emphasis on testimony that giddens engagement in real estate development did not involve physical labor,equitable fails to appreciate the uncontradicted testimony of giddens physicians that his chronic fatigue,depression,anxiety,and memory loss preclude giddens from performing even the administrative duties attendant to that enterprise.
giddens,d at.the doctors testified that giddens suffers from hallucinations,memory loss,forgetfulness,inability to concentrate and confusion,and equitable did not present any medical evidence to the contrary.these symptoms obviously result in a diminished intellectual capacity,greatly hindering giddens ability to think and reason on a daily basis.as a result,he is no longer able to exercise the technical knowledge and skills that he identified as job duties in his sworn statement to the social security administration.accordingly,the district court did not err in this regard.
total disability from real estate occupation 
while there is a lot of discussion in the briefs about giddens duties,it is but a prelude to equitable main defense,which is based on the policy language.equitable argues the policies require that giddens be unable to perform all of the substantial and material duties of his real estate occupation in order to be totally disabled.equitable stresses that giddens is unable to perform only most or a majority of his substantial,material duties.equitable contends that if giddens is able to perform even one of his substantial,material duties,he is not totally disabled,but only partially or residually disabled.equitable thus contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of giddens 
because this defense is based on the policy language,we first review the georgia law regarding construction of insurance contracts and then the policies 
georgia law 
under georgia law,the rights of the parties to an insurance policy should not be expanded beyond the terms of the policy.baldwin state farm fire cas.in applying the rules of construction to an insurance contract,the test is not what the insurer intended its words to mean,but rather what a reasonable person in the insured position would understand them to mean.pac.mut.ins.davies,quotation marks and citation omitted.
where the language of the contract is unambiguous and only one reasonable interpretation is possible,the contract must be enforced as written.sapp state farm fire cas.however,when a policy is ambiguous,or is capable of two reasonable interpretations,it is construed in the light most favorable to the insured and against the insurer.davies,at erie indem.lascala.indeed,p olicies of insurance will be liberally construed in favor of the object to be accomplished,and conditions and provisions therein will be strictly construed against the insurer,as they are issued upon printed forms,prepared by experts at the insurer instance,in the preparation of which the insured has no voice.davis united am.life ins,quotation marks and citation omitted.georgia courts instruct that disability provisions should be given a practical and reasonable construction and not a strict and literal one.john hancock mut.life ins.poss,citation omitted.
in addition,the interpretation of an insurance policy,including the determination and resolution of ambiguities,is a question of law for the court to decide.claussen aetna cas.sur,cir.we now turn to the policies.
the policy language 
as noted earlier,the policies define total disability as the inability to engage in the substantial and material duties of your regular occupation.giddens policies protect him against disability from his own regular occupation and do not require that giddens be disabled from any occupation or comparable occupations.thus,we look to the duties of his real estate occupation.
further,we agree with equitable that giddens did not prove that he could not perform all substantial,material duties but rather proved that he could not perform most or the majority of such duties.for example,giddens testified that he can not perform most of the duties of his real estate occupation and is unable to resume that occupation.further,spivey and webster testified that he was unable to perform substantial portions of the duties of his real estate development.by substantial portions,spivey meant most and webster meant the vast majority.among giddens substantial,material duties that he is unable to perform are his application of entrepreneurial vision and energy,planning of real estate development projects,financial management of development and construction projects,and determining the feasibility of projects.although giddens,according to the evidence,perhaps remains able to perform a few selecting house plans,materials,and testimony of giddens and spivey and webster indicates that he is unable to perform most or the vast majority of the substantial,material duties of real estate development,and thus is totally disabled from his real estate occupation.
equitable main argument on appeal is that giddens must be unable to perform all substantial and material duties of his occupation in order to be totally disabled.the problem for equitable is that the total disability clause in its policies does not identify what percentage of the duties the insured must be unable to perform.the clause does not say all substantial and material duties or most or any percentage.
further,the parties have not cited,and we can not locate,any decision by a georgia appellate court construing the same language in a disability policy.however,the eighth circuit has construed the same language in a disability policy and determined that it is ambiguous.dowdle life ins,cir applying minnesota law to policy defining total disability as inability to perform the material and substantial duties of an occupation and concluding that ambiguity existed because t he policies definitions of total disability are susceptible to differing interpretations,because the policies do not speak in terms of any,all,some,or the most important part of the insured duties we agree with the eighth circuit that the policy language here is ambiguous.we do not suggest that all is an unreasonable interpretation of the policy language,but we do say that most or the majority of the substantial and material duties is also a reasonable interpretation if an insured is unable to engage in his regular occupation as a result of his inability to perform most or the majority of those duties.
construing the policies in favor of giddens and against equitable,we conclude giddens may establish total disability if he can not engage in his real estate occupation because he is unable to perform most or the vast majority of the substantial and material duties of his occupation.as outlined above,giddens evidence established inability to perform most of his important duties and an inability to engage in his real estate occupation.
that giddens may be able to perform one or more of the substantial and material duties associated with that occupation simply does not preclude a showing of total disability under the terms of the policies,as equitable claims.even if giddens can perform a few substantial and material,for example,selecting house plans,materials,and ability to perform those tasks in isolation still would not allow giddens to continue in his real estate development occupation because he is unable to perform his entrepreneurial,financial,planning,coordinating,and administrative duties,which were the heart of his real estate occupation.see dowdle,at concluding that surgeon who could no longer stand long enough to perform orthopedic surgery but could conduct office visits,see patients,read,perform imes,interpret data,and promote referrals was because he could not perform the most important substantial and material duty 
equitable arguments 
equitable argues that georgia law compels the interpretation that total disability exists only where the insured is unable to perform all of the substantial,material duties of his occupation.equitable cites several georgia cases that it claims compel this definition of total disability.see,cloer life cas.ins.of tennessee,mut.life ins.of new york barron,metro.life ins.johnson,prudential ins.of am.south,cato aetna life ins.
those cases fail to support equitable position because the policy language interpreted in those cases was substantially different from the relevant language in this case.in those cases,the policies defined total disability as the inability to perform any occupation or any work.here,by contrast,the policies define total disability as the inability to perform the substantial and material duties of your regular occupation,without regard to whether the insured could do other kinds of work more importantly,none of the policies in these georgia cases contained the language at issue here the substantial and material duties.
if anything,equitable cases show how georgia courts liberally construe disability policies in favor of insureds and strictly against insurers.in the cases equitable cites,the georgia courts rejected the insurers claims that the requirement of inability to perform any occupation or any work meant any gainful employment.see barron,at johnson,at south,at.instead,the georgia courts construed the language of inability to perform any work or any occupation,in favor of the insured,to mean inability to perform substantial portions of the insured ordinary employment or any other employment approximating the insured same livelihood as he might fairly be expected to follow given his personal circumstances,including his experience,education,physical and mental capacities.see barron,at johnson,at south,at.in doing so,the georgia courts stressed that the word occupation must be construed according to the facts and circumstances of the execution of the contract,including the objects to be effectuated thereby.south,at see also cato,at construing total disability language and stating that p olicies of insurance will be liberally construed in favor of the object to be accomplished,and provisions therein will be strictly construed against the insurer.thus,in these cases the georgia courts construed any occupation as occupations approximating the insured livelihood the object to be accomplished in giddens policies is total disability coverage if he is unable to perform so many substantial and material duties that his regular occupation is reasonably closed to him.that point is clearly reached in giddens case.
equitable finally argues that total disability must mean the inability to perform all of the material and substantial duties because to interpret the term otherwise would nullify the residual disability clause.the policies define residual disability as the inability to perform one or more of the substantial and material duties of the insured occupation.this argument is unpersuasive.quite obviously,there is a continuum of disability.if the insured is unable to perform only one or more of many material occupational duties,then the insured would not be totally disabled.where the insured,such as gid
