background 
while driving a pontiac firebird,katherine romano was by a toyota camry driven by alex perez,who at the time was insured by a pennsylvania insurance company legion insurance company in financial trouble.the accident occurred in september and within six months a court in pennsylvania put the pennsylvania insurer into rehabilitation.while the court order of rehabilitation was expressly not a declaration of insolvency such as would activate pennsylvania or any other state insurance guaranty laws the order nevertheless made the payment of any claims a matter of the rehabilitator discretion 
on december,within four months of the accident,the pennsylvania insurer filed financial statements with the california department of insurance showing that its net worth was a negative million,and within another months after that in late april,a california court actually ordered the pennsylvania insurer into liquidation.within months of the accident,in late july,a pennsylvania court formally did the same thing.
needless to say,romano did not and has not received any money from the pennsylvania insurance company that insured the driver who hit her from behind.she did,however,have un insured motorist coverage from her own insurer,mercury insurance company,covering her injuries in cases where an driver has no insurance because of insolvency.mercury,however,denied romano uninsured motorist claim on the theory that the pennsylvania insurer legion was not an insolvent insurer within the meaning of certain california insurance code statutes because it was not formally ordered into liquidation by a court within one year of the accident.romano then instituted this litigation,and each side brought competing summary judgment motions,with the trial court granting romano 
the central issue in the appeal before us is whether mercury is obligated to pay for romano injuries under her uninsured motorist coverage given that there was no formal declaration of insolvency by either court or state insurance commissioner within one year of the accident.as we explain below,the operative phrase in both the insurance policy itself and in the insurance code is because of insolvency,which both common law and the insurance code would lead a reasonable insured to conclude meant actual insolvency precipitating of a claim within a year,regardless of whether any court or insurance commissioner took the formal step of ordering that insurer into liquidation.by this definition,the reason that romano was paid was indeed because of insolvency,thus she was owed coverage under her uninsured motorist coverage from mercury.accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment in romano favor.
the policy language 
here is the insuring clause of the policy as it relates to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage mercury is to pay all sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner,or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury,sustained by the insured,caused by accident and arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of such uninsured motor vehicles,provided,for the purpose of this coverage,determination as to whether the insured or such representative is legally entitled to recover such damages,and if so the amount thereof,shall be made by agreement,between the insured or such representative and the company or,if they fail to agree,by arbitration.
then comes the policy definition of uninsured motor vehicle.uninsured motor vehicle means a a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership,maintenance,or use of which there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident,or there is such applicable insurance or bond but the company writing the same denies coverage thereunder or refuses to admit coverage thereunder except conditionally or with reservation b an underinsured motor vehicle c an insured motor vehicle where the liability insurer thereof is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured within the limits specified therein,because of insolvency within one year of the accident d a motor vehicle used without the permission of the owner thereof if there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident with respect to the owner or operator thereof e a motor vehicle whose owner or operator is unknown.italics added.
statutes addressing the same subject 
there is,however,a statutory context in which insurers issue uninsured and underinsured coverage.under insurance code section,the legislature requires all auto policies to have uninsured motorist coverage here is what subdivision a of the statute requires of such policies 
uninsured motorists coverage insures the insured,his or her heirs,or legal representatives for all sums within the limits established by law,that the person or persons are legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury,including any resulting sickness,disease or death,to the insured from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle not owned or operated by the insured or a resident of the same household,subd.a.
a swath of language in subdivision b of section tracks categories a,b,d and e all quoted mercury policy as used in this section,the term uninsured motor vehicle means a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership,maintenance or use of which there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident,or there is applicable insurance or a bond but the company writing the insurance or bond denies coverage thereunder or refuses to admit coverage thereunder except conditionally or with reservation,or an underinsured motor vehicle as defined in subdivision p,or a motor vehicle used without the permission of the owner thereof if there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident with respect to the owner or operator thereof,or the owner or operator thereof be unknown 
two paragraphs later,the statute addresses the insolvency issue found in category c of mercury policy,using the same because of insolvency phrase used in the insurance policy as used in this section,the term uninsured motor vehicle also means an insured motor vehicle where the liability insurer thereof is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured within the limits specified therein because of insolvency.an insurer solvency protection shall be applicable only to accidents occurring during a policy period in which its insured motor vehicle coverage is in effect where the liability insurer of the tortfeasor becomes insolvent within one year of the accident.italics added.
finally,the statute adds a right of recoupment for the benefit of the paying insurer in the event of payment to any person under the coverage required by this section and subject to the terms and conditions of the coverage,the insurer making the payment,shall to the extent thereof,be entitled to any proceeds that may be recoverable from the assets of the insolvent insurer through any settlement or judgment of the person against the insolvent insurer.
section does not define insolvency.the word,however,is defined in section,subdivision a.that statute defines insolvency equitably,as not being able to pay obligations when they come due.the statute further defines insolvency independent of whether anybody particularly a court or california insurance commissioner has declared the insurer to be broke yet a s used in this article insolvency means either of the following any impairment of minimum capital or capital paid in or an inability of the insurer to meet its financial obligations when they are due.
however,the california insurance code also includes a set of statutes setting up a mechanism by which covered claims made against the policies of insolvent insurers can be paid.the mechanism is the establishment of the california insurance guaranty association known in the industry as ciga.the scheme contemplates that ciga will pay the covered claims of insolvent insurers,and part of the statutes establishing ciga define the phrase insolvent insurer.that definition,in contrast with section,makes specific reference to a formal declaration of insolvency.section,subdivision b states insolvent insurer means a member insurer against which an order of liquidation or receivership with a finding of insolvency has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.italics added.
the normal analysis 
mercury brief immediately frames the case as one of statutory construction,a choice between the definitions set forth in section,subdivision a and section,subdivision b.the idea is that because the insurance code addresses the general problem of insolvency in so many areas and specifically in those two statutes,the case before us is a matter of threading our way through a fairly complex statutory analysis rather than applying the usual common law rules that govern insurance contracts.
by way of illustration of the point,contrast the statutory analysis employed by our supreme court in com.insurance superior court cal d,with the common law analysis employed by the same court in mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,d.
in,the high court was dealing with language in a homeowner policy which was absolutely prescribed by statute,specifically section,which sets forth a standard form for all fire insurance policies in california.thus in analyzing the suit provision found in the homeowner policy because it was placed there by the statute,the court treated the case as one of statutory as distinct from wholly contractual construction,and said,the statute must be construed to implement the intent of the legislature and should not be construed strictly against the insurer unlike ambiguous or uncertain policy language,supra,cal d at,italics added.
by contrast,in mackinnon,the high court looked to traditional common law rules of interpretation in concluding that what is often thought of in the insurance industry as the absolute pollution exclusion does not include apartment pesticide spraying by a landlord.the question arose because,if the word pollution in the absolute exclusion included every definition found in a standard dictionary,one would conclude that apartment pesticide spraying is pollution one of the many dictionary definitions of pollution is a chemical that causes irritation,and pesticide spraying certainly fits that bill.the unanimous mackinnon court,however,looking to common law principles of interpretation demonstrated that such an approach would lead to some really silly,and therefore obviously unintended,applications of the pollution exclusion.the mackinnon court therefore rejected the idea that a landlord attempt to rid an apartment of yellowjackets through insecticide,a tenant died because the pesticide firm hired by the landlord failed to tell the tenant to vacate the not covered.see mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d,context of pollution exclusion,setting forth relevant common law principles and applying context and common law principles,and specifically noting absurdities in insurer proposed broad application of exclusion.
while we will ultimately conclude that the legislature did not intend uninsured motorist coverage triggered because of insolvency to require a formal declaration that an insurer is an insolvent insurer by way of court order,we should note preliminarily that mercury statutory construction approach is the only approach that can possibly win for mercury.if a court were to apply the standard common law approach to insurance contract interpretation as set out in,say,mackinnon or as generally set forth in bank of the west superior court cal th,d,see also croskey et,insurance litigation the rutter group,through giving the basic framework of interpretation of insurance policies,the only real issue would be whether mercury denial of the claim was so lacking in legal force as to be might be a bad faith case instead of a technical coverage case.
looking at just the policy language and applying the normal,contractual,common law rules,the analysis would go like this the phrase because of insolvency is not specifically defined in the policy,and therefore would either mean one of two things 
it might mean the failure to be paid when an insurer is substantially insolvent or unable to pay its obligations as they come due.alternatively,the phrase because of insolvency would be ambiguous,meaning either a substantive insolvency,or b formally declared insolvency.
if the first alternative were true,the insured would win directly,because the insured position would be supported by the plain language of the policy.american star ins.insurance of the west d.unambiguous language unambiguously favored the insured position.if,however,the second alternative prevailed that the phrase was ambiguous,the insured would still win,because a is an eminently reasonable meaning,and therefore it would be the meaning selected by the court under the usual rules of insurance contract interpretation.
it is only by appeal to a legislative intent that arguably differs from the result under the normal rules of common law interpretation that mercury is able to take its denial out of the murky realm of the borderline frivolousness and into the sunlight of a,good faith,and reasonable argument.even so,as we will now explain,it still loses.
the legislature meant what it said when it said because of insolvency and not because owed by an insolvent insurer 
language is language,and the plain meaning rule is the first step in not only common law insurance analysis,waller truck ins.exchange cal th,d,but also the first step in statutory analysis as well,california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d,our first step is scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.burden snowden cal th,d,we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent in determining intent,we look first to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.where the words of a statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.
in the present case,the controlling point is that the legislature prescribed the phrase because of insolvency in what it expected of uninsured motorist coverage,and used a different phrase,insolvent insurer in the scheme setting up ciga.as we have already seen,both insolvency and insolvent insurer have been specifically defined by the legislature,those meanings are different,and it is the former which the legislature used in specifying what was required of uninsured motorist coverage.
when the legislature uses different words as part of the same statutory scheme,those words are presumed to have different meanings.where a statute referring to one subject contains a critical word or phrase,omission of that word or phrase from a similar statute on the same subject generally shows a different legislative intent.craven crout d.
and,ordinarily,where the legislature uses a different word or phrase in one part of a statute than it does in other sections or in a similar statute concerning a related subject,it must be presumed that the legislature intended a different meaning.campbell zolin th,d.
and,when one part of a statute contains a term or provision,the omission of that term or provision from another part of the statute indicates the legislature intended to convey a different meaning.cornette department of transportation cal th,d,in re austin th,d we presume the legislature intended the word custody to have a different meaning from the words place and placement,people belmares th,d the fact that the legislature meant different things in using the words deter,prevent,delay,and obstruct in penal code provisions governing deterring and resisting officers.
mercury has thus founded its argument on a false dichotomy,namely that the trial court had a choice between competing definitions of insolvency as set forth in section and section.this argument ultimately fails because there are no competing definitions of insolvency.there is only one definition of insolvency and it is an equitable definit
