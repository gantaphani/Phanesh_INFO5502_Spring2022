century indemnity company century is an insurance company that has entered into reinsurance agreements with a number of reinsurers,including employers insurance company of wausau wausau.two of the reinsurance agreements between century and wausau are at issue in this appeal.century paid money to its insureds under certain reinsured policies and maintains that its reinsurers,including wausau,must reimburse it for those payments.century demanded that its reinsurers participate in a consolidated arbitration to determine liability for the payments.wausau acknowledges that its reinsurance agreements require it to arbitrate,but argues that it can not be required to participate in a consolidated arbitration.
wausau brought suit in federal district court,seeking declaratory judgment.wausau urged the district court to find that it was entitled to two separate arbitrations for the two reinsurance agreements it has with century.wausau also sought a declaration that it could not be required to participate in a consolidated arbitration with other reinsurers.the district court found for century.it held that the question whether century could be required to participate in a consolidated arbitration was a question for the arbitrator,not the court.the district court ordered wausau to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the terms of the agreements and proceed to arbitration with century.wausau appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
wausau and century are insurance companies.in this case,century is the insurer and wausau the reinsurer.century has issued an insurance policy to.century and wausau entered into two reinsurance agreements pertaining to the policy,the first excess agreement and the second excess agreement agreements.each of the agreements covers a different layer of the policy was subject to liability for asbestos bodily injury claims and presented the claims to century for payment.century paid the claims and billed its reinsurers for their alleged shares of claims.several reinsurers,including wausau,did not pay century.therefore,in october,century demanded that these reinsurers participate in a consolidated arbitration.century also demanded that wausau and the other reinsurers collectively name an arbitrator within days of the demand otherwise,century would name an arbitrator for them.
wausau acknowledges that it is required to arbitrate with century.the first excess agreement and the second excess agreement contain identical arbitration clauses.the arbitration clauses state,in relevant part 
arbitration 
as a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder,any dispute arising out of this agreement shall be submitted to the decision of a board of arbitration composed of two arbitrators and an umpire meeting in new york,new york,unless otherwise agreed.
the members of the board of arbitration shall be active or retired disinterested officials of insurance or reinsurance companies or underwriters at lloyd,london not under the control of either party to this agreement.each party shall appoint its arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall choose an umpire before instituting the hearing.if the respondent fails to appoint its arbitrator within days after being requested to do so by the claimant,the latter shall also appoint the second arbitrator.if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the appointment of an umpire within days after their nomination,each of them shall name three of whom the other shall decline two,and the decision shall be made by drawing lots.
the agreements do not contain any express provisions regarding consolidated arbitration.
while acknowledging that it must arbitrate,wausau objected to participating in a consolidated arbitration.wausau argued that the first and second excess agreements are separate contracts and contain no language expressing wausau consent to participate in one arbitration involving both contracts or any arbitration involving other reinsurers.
wausau filed suit in federal district court,seeking a declaration that it was entitled to separate arbitration proceedings for the first and second excess agreements and these proceedings must be independent of any arbitration between century and its other reinsurers.allstate,another reinsurer,intervened in the case as a plaintiff wausau and allstate filed for summary judgment.century filed a motion to dismiss and a for summary judgment.
the district court granted in part and denied in part wausau motion for summary judgment.it found that the arbitrator,not the court,should decide whether consolidation is permitted under the parties agreements,based on green tree financial bazzle,d.the district court explained that,absent evidence of the parties contrary agreement,procedural issues like consolidation are for the arbitrator to decide.the district court continued,however,that each agreement provides an unambiguous procedure for the creation of its own arbitration panel to resolve this and any other disputes that might later arise.the district court therefore ordered wausau and allstate to submit to separate arbitrations,where their arbitrators may consider the issue of consolidation once they have been seated.
wausau appealed.it also filed a motion with the district court to stay its order,pending exhaustion of wausau appeal.the district court denied the motion.wausau then filed a motion for a stay with this court,which was denied on october.
ii.discussion 
in this case,both parties admit that the agreements arbitration clauses are silent as to whether consolidated arbitration is permissible.the central question on appeal is who should decide whether the agreements forbid consolidated arbitration the district court,or the arbitrator this circuit and the supreme court have yet to resolve that exact question.
wausau argues that the issue of whether consolidation is allowed is a question of arbitrability that must be addressed by the court,unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended the arbitrator to decide.century argues the opposite,that the issue of consolidation is a procedural one that should be resolved by the arbitrator in the first instance,unless the parties arbitration agreement provides that the court must resolve it.
the supreme court has established a framework for analyzing the issue we are presented with.in first options of chicago,kaplan,d,the supreme court considered the question of who should determine whether a given dispute is court or the arbitrator.the court held that,unless the arbitration agreement is clear and unmistakable that the issue of arbitrability is for the arbitrator,it should be resolved by the court.id.at.wausau maintains that the dispute over consolidation is a dispute over arbitrability,and thus must be resolved by the court.
wausau incorrectly characterizes the consolidation question as a question of arbitrability.cases since first options have helped clarify which questions qualify as arbitrability questions.in howsam dean witter reynolds,d,the court explained 
linguistically speaking,one might call any potentially dispositive gateway question a question of arbitrability,for its answer will determine whether the underlying controversy will proceed to arbitration on the merits.the court case law,however,makes clear that,for purposes of applying the interpretive rule,the phrase question of arbitrability has a far more limited scope.the court has found the phrase applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter,where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so,and,consequently,where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate.
the howsam court provided two examples of a dispute that would raise a question of arbitrability and thus should be decided by a court a dispute regarding whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause and a disagreement about whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy.id.at.the court also explained that t he phrase question of arbitrability is not applicable in other kinds of general circumstances where parties would likely expect that an arbitrator would decide the gateway matter.id.for example,procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.id.quoting john wiley sons,livingston,d emphasis added.the howsam court decided that a question regarding the applicability of a national association of securities dealers rule was presumptively for the arbitrator.the court explained that such a dispute seems an aspec t of the controversy which called the grievance procedures into play.id.at.quoting john wiley sons,at.
we find based on howsam that the question of whether an arbitration agreement forbids consolidated arbitration is a procedural one,which the arbitrator should resolve.it does not involve whether wausau and century are bound by an arbitration clause or whether the arbitration clause covers the policies.instead,the consolidation question concerns grievance,whether century can be required to participate in one arbitration covering both the agreements,or in an arbitration with other reinsurers.
our holding is consistent with the decisions of our sister circuits in similar cases.for instance,in shaw supermarkets,united food and commercial workers union,local,the first circuit relied on howsam in deciding that the arbitrator,not a court,should determine if arbitrations can be consolidated.see id.at.the court found that consolidation is a procedural issue.id.at.shaw supermarkets involved three collective bargaining agreements cbas,each of which provided for arbitration as the fourth and final step of a grievance process.id.at.the court found that the parties agreed that their disputes were arbitrable,and therefore there was not a dispute over arbitrability,which would be decided by a court.since there was no evidence in the cbas here that the parties did not expect their disputes regarding matters such as consolidation to be resolved through arbitration,the arbitrator should decide whether consolidation was appropriate.id.at.the court also concluded that l eaving the decision whether to consolidate the three proceedings in the hands of the arbitrator comports with precedent resolving ambiguities regarding the scope of arbitration in favor of arbitrability.id.at.
similarly,in dockser schwartzberg,cir,the fourth circuit determined that the arbitrator,rather than the court,should determine whether one arbitrator,rather than three,should preside over the arbitration.id.at.dockser involved an arbitration provision,contained in a settlement agreement,that provided that one arbitrator should be appointed.id.at.the arbitration provision also provided that american arbitration association aaa rules and procedures should be applied in choosing the arbitrator.id.the aaa rules allow for the appointment of either or arbitrators.id.the defendant filed a demand for arbitration with the aaa,requesting arbitrators.id.at.the plaintiffs filed suit,alleging that the defendant request violated the parties arbitration provision.id.at.the court determined that the issue of how many arbitrators should be used fits squarely within the supreme court jurisprudence regarding what constitutes a procedural question.id.at.the court explained that the issue here concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties,but rather what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.id.quoting green tree,at.thus,the issue was a procedural one for the arbitrator.id.
we agree with the approach of the first and fourth circuits.using the same analysis,we find that consolidation is a procedural issue.wausau and century agree that their underlying dispute regarding the claims is subject to arbitration.thus,the only question is the kind of arbitration proceeding their agreements allow.this comes down to a matter of contract interpretation,which the arbitrator is well qualified to address.see we care hair,engen,cir once the court determines that an arbitration clause is enforceable,the status of the other contract terms is for the arbitrator to decide.corman derailment,llc int l union of operating eng rs,local union,cir a fter a court ascertains that the subject matter of a particular dispute is covered by the parties arbitration agreement,any procedural as whether the arbitration procedures were properly reserved for the arbitrator.george watts son,tiffany,cir t he arbitrator has considerable leeway so long as he respects the limits the parties contract and public law place on his discretion.see also green tree,at.stating that a rbitrators are well situated to answer questions related to what kind of arbitration proceedings the parties agreed to.additionally,our conclusion is consistent with longstanding federal policy favoring arbitration.see,buckeye check cashing,cardegna,continental cas.am.ins,cir james mcdonald,cir welborn clinic medquist,cir ck witco paper allied,cir.
although we reach our decision based on howsam,we recognize that the district court based its decision on green tree financial bazzle,d.in green tree,the supreme court addressed whether a court or an arbitrator should determine if the parties arbitration agreements allowed for class arbitration.see id.at.a plurality of the court decided that the issue was for the arbitrator.id.at.the plurality recognized that i n certain limited circumstances,courts assume that the parties intended courts,not arbitrators,to decide a particular matter.id.at.however,the plurality explained 
the question the contracts forbid class not fall into this narrow exception.it concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties.unlike first options,the question is not whether the parties wanted a judge or an arbitrator to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate a matter.rather the relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.that question concerns contract interpretation and arbitration procedures.arbitrators are well situated to answer that question.
likewise,in this case the question of whether wausau and century agreements forbid consolidated arbitration concerns the kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.thus,the parties disagreement is not one over arbitrability,as that term has been described by the supreme court.see howsam,at.
we acknowledge,however,that there is debate regarding the precedential the plurality opinion in green tree.we are therefore hesitant to base our decision on it.when,as in green tree,a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.marks united states,d internal citation omitted see also ben bar,vill.of somerset,cir.century argues that the narrowest holding in green tree is that issues regarding the number of arbitrations to be held are for the arbitrator to address.wausau argues that there is no holding that garnered a majority vote and,in the alternative,that the narrowest holding is that the parties contracts sent the class arbitration issue to the arbitrator.
identifying the narrowest holding in green tree requires us to consider the procedural history of that case.the case concerned contracts between green tree,a commercial lender,and its customers.green tree,at.each contract contained an arbitration clause governed by the federal arbitration act.id.customers of green tree filed two separate suits against the company in south carolina state court,alleging violations of the south carolina consumer protection code.id.at.in both cases,plaintiffs sought,and eventually were granted,class certification.id.at.also in both cases,plaintiffs were awarded class damages and attorney fees.id.the trial court affirmed the awards,and green tree appealed,arguing that cl
