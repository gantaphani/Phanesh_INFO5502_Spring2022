the tax court determined that the amount actually distributed when a couple received ownership of two life insurance policies after their employer wound down their employees benefit trust was the fair market value of what was actually distributed.schwab comm,wl.it further held that surrender charges associated with a variable universal life insurance policy may permissibly be considered as part of the general inquiry into a policy fair market value.id.at.we agree with the tax court on both determinations,and we affirm.
background 
michael schwab and kathryn kleinman,a married couple,are employees and the sole shareholders of angels cowboys.schwab works as a graphic designer and kleinman is a photographer.
on the advice of their accountant,schwab and kleinman each purchased a variable universal life insurance policy through angels cowboys.the policies were held in a welfare benefit trust administered by a third party company as part of a nonqualified employee benefit plan the plan was aimed at owners and was,according to its promotional materials,designed to allow qualified professionals,entrepreneurs,and business owners to obtain life insurance for themselves and for key employees on a basis.schwab,at.
the tax court provides a succinct description of the policies schwab and kleinman purchased 
the policies were of a type called variable universal life,a relatively new type of contract for this old industry.a key characteristic of universal policies is that they disconnect to some degree a feature,payment of money upon death from an investment feature,the use of premiums to acquire assets that fund the insurance payment.the insurer selling a policy typically segregates payments from its customers in separate investment accounts from which it makes deductions to pay for the insurance component of the policy.at death,the customer beneficiary gets what left in the separate account.under a variable universal contract,the customer typically can choose from a menu of different investments often set up to closely resemble mutual funds with varying returns and thus varying payouts upon death,though there is as was true under the contracts here a minimum guaranty.
id.at.two provisions of the insurance policies are particularly relevant to this case.first,the policies were subject to surrender charges the primary focus of the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner concern on appeal.the surrender charge in this case is the fee that schwab and kleinman would incur if they allowed their policies to lapse,or otherwise terminated them,prior to a contractually specified date.the surrender charges on schwab and kleinman policies lasted eleven years and would be reduced by percent a year only in years starting in.id.at.
another salient feature of the policies was the provision present in each of them.that provision specified that the policy would not lapse in the first three years of coverage,provided that the sum of all premiums paid was greater than the no lapse premium multiplied by the number of months the policy has been in force,even if the net cash surrender value is zero or less.id.at.
two values associated with the policies are also pertinent to this case.the first is the policy value,which the plan documents define as premiums less policy loads,plus net investment return,less policy charges,partial surrenders,and any indebtedness.id.at.the second is the net cash surrender value,which is a standard industry term,and is the stated policy value minus the applicable surrender charge.the net cash surrender value represents the sum of money the insurance company will pay to the policyholder should he allow the policy to lapse or voluntarily terminate the policy before his death.
angels cowboys paid the initial premiums on the policies,which were originally more than per year for schwab policy,and for kleinman.both schwab and kleinman elected to invest their premium payments in funds whose value was tied to the value of the standard poor index.had schwab and kleinman expectations been met,they would eventually have been able to stop paying premiums on their policies because the premiums would have been covered by the returns on their investments.unfortunately for schwab and kleinman,their investment hopes were dashed.during the period beginning in september t he s p index declined nearly percent,schwab,at,and their policy values dropped by a similar percentage.
meanwhile,the internal revenue service irs began more aggressively asserting its position that the type of plan in which angels cowboys was participating was not entitled to receive the favorable tax treatment that was the plan entire raison.by it became clear that the treasury department would adopt regulations with which that plan would be unable to comply.id.at.anticipating what would soon occur,the plan administrator terminated the plan,and in october,schwab and kleinman took ownership of their respective policies.
the relevant policy values at the time of their distribution are summarized below 
from the date of the distribution,schwab policy was set to lapse within days,and kleinman would lapse in days.accordingly,unless the standard poor index surged in that time period,the negative net cash surrender values of the policies made clear that schwab and kleinman would receive nothing if their policies lapsed.thus,schwab and kleinman had a choice they could continue paying premiums on their respective policies,and thus continue their coverage,or they could allow their respective policies to lapse,and potentially receive nothing.kleinman allowed her policy,which remained far in the red,to lapse rather than pay the premium.by contrast,the policy value of schwab policy rebounded modestly,and schwab decided for a time to continue paying the required premiums,and keep his policy in force.
the distribution of the policies from the trust to schwab and kleinman was a taxable event under b,which provides for the taxation of assets distributed from a nonqualified employees trust,such as the one in which angels cowboys participated.believing they were only required to pay taxes on the net cash surrender values of their policies which were negative at the time of the taxable event schwab and kleinman did not report any taxable income as result of the distribution of their policies the commissioner disagreed with schwab and kleinman tax treatment of their policy distributions,maintaining that the full stated policy values must be treated as income.he issued a notice of deficiency to schwab and kleinman.
schwab and kleinman petitioned the tax court,arguing that they actually received nothing of value and therefore should pay no taxes on the distribution.the commissioner asserted that surrender charges may never be considered under section b,and maintained that schwab and kleinman actually received the full stated policy values of their respective insurance policies.in a decision it later characterized as coming down in the middle,the tax court read section b to say that a court could consider surrender charges,but only as part of a more general inquiry into a policy fair market value.in schwab and kleinman case,the tax court accounted for surrender charges,and held that the only taxable value the policies had at the time of distribution was the small amount of the insurance coverage that was attributable to the single premium that angels cowboys had paid on each policy some three years earlier.id.at.the commissioner timely appealed to our court.we have jurisdiction under.
standard of review 
a tax court conclusions of law and construction of the internal revenue code are reviewed de novo.estate of rapp comm r,cir internal citation omitted.the facts of this case are undisputed,and the commissioner appeals only questions of law.
discussion 
schwab and kleinman received two insurance contracts from a nonqualified employees trust.the distribution from that trust is taxed according to section b of the tax code,which reads in relevant part 
the amount actually distributed or made available to any distributee by any trust described in paragraph shall be taxable to the distributee,in the taxable year in which so distributed or made available,under section relating to annuities 
the application of section b to schwab and kleinman policies presents a quandary.the word amount implies a quantifiable sum but schwab and kleinman did not receive an amount they received their respective life insurance policies.the tax court resolved the tension between the language of section b and its application to the schwab kleinman policies by holding that the amount actually distributed means the fair market value of what was actually distributed.schwab,at.that holding necessitates a analysis.first,the court had to determine the fair market value of schwab and kleinman life insurance policies,and then it was required to determine the appropriate tax on that amount under section.
the commissioner strenuously disagrees with the tax court conclusion.the gravamen of his argument is that surrender charges may never be considered when determining the amount actually received from an employees trust under section b.to evaluate the commissioner argument,we first ascertain whether the tax code and its accompanying regulations forbid the consideration of surrender charges under section b,as the commissioner contends.second,we determine whether the tax court correctly held that the amount actually received means the fair market value of what was actually received,and if so,whether surrender charges may ever affect the fair market value of a variable universal life insurance policy.
the commissioner commences his argument with the text of section b itself.he contends that because the amount actually distributed shall be taxable to the distributee under section relating to annuities,and because section contemplates the cash value of a without regard to any surrender charge,e a i,then section b must also apply without regard to any surrender charge.as the commissioner phrased it in his brief,under section b,life insurance policies are to be valued in the same manner as they would be under e a.the tax court,he urges,therefore erred by supplanting a fair market valuation standard in place of the methodology supplied by e a.
section e a reads as follows 
any amount to which this subsection applies shall be treated as allocable to income on the contract to the extent that such amount does not exceed the excess if any of 
i the cash value of the contract determined without regard to any surrender charge immediately before the amount is received,over 
ii the investment in the contract at the time.
the commissioner relies upon subsection i,which explains that for purposes of section,the cash value of the contract is to be determined without regard to any surrender charge.thus,the commissioner contends,schwab and kleinman must pay taxes on the stated policy values.but he misses a step.the commissioner offers no reason to believe that the cash value of the policy under section e a is the amount actually received under section b nor is section e a a freestanding method for valuing life insurance policies.rather,in this context it is a guide to allocating that value between taxable income and nontaxable return of the investment on the contract.the title of paragraph e is,after all,allocation of amounts to income and investment.and paragraph i simply sets forth the method for computing one of the two numbers in that formula.
the other problem with the commissioner interpretation of section b is that it reads the phrase amount actually distributed or made available entirely out of section b.see beisler comm,cir we should avoid an interpretation of a statute that renders any part of it superfluous and does not give effect to all of the words used by congress.the commissioner assertion that section e a i dictates how insurance policies distributed from nonqualified trusts should be taxed completely bypasses the reference in section b to the amount actually distributed.in contrast,the tax court interpretation of the interplay of sections b and e a i gives effect to all of the language in both statutory provisions.under that interpretation,the amount to which this subsection applies in subsection e a i is the amount actually distributed in section b.we thus conclude that the tax court advances the better interpretation of the plain text of section b.
this is not the end of our inquiry,however.section is the subject of a number of treasury regulations,and,as a general matter,we defer to the treasury interpretation of the statute if the applicable regulations prove dispositive.see pac.first fed.sav.bank comm r,cir citing muffler dealers ass n,united states,d.
as a result,the commissioner appeals for support beyond the text of section b.he first argues that the treasury regulation interpreting section b,reg.b,supports his interpretation of that section.the commissioner directs our attention to an example in that regulation,which reads as follows if,for example,the distribution from such a trust consists of an annuity contract,the amount of the distribution shall be considered to be the entire value of the contract at the time of distribution.reg.b c we first note,as did the tax court,that the example refers to annuity contracts,rather than life insurance policies.nonetheless,the commissioner focuses upon the phrase entire value of the contract,arguing that such language draws upon the supreme court reasoning in a trio of cases all delivered the same day,in which the court considered the proper method for valuation of a life insurance policy for gift tax purposes.see,guggenheim rasquin.in guggenheim,the court held that the fair market value of the was not its cash surrender value,but rather the purchase price,because c ost is cogent evidence of value when the purchaser assigned the policy to three of her children at substantially the same time as the purchase.id.at,see also powers comm r.affirming same.by contrast,in united states ryerson,five years had elapsed between the purchase of the policy and its assignment.the court therefore held that the replacement cost of the policy at that time of the assignment,rather than the policy original purchase price,was the correct valuation of the policy for gift tax purposes.id.at.
even if we assume that the regulation use of entire value is an oblique allusion to the reasoning of these gift tax cases,the three cases do not suggest,as the commissioner urges,that surrender charges may never be taken into account when valuing a life insurance policy.rather,when read together,they suggest that the fair market value of insurance contracts can be a slippery concept,schwab,at,and that a particular method for ascertaining value may be appropriate in one situation but inappropriate in another.we are therefore not persuaded that the example relating to annuities in treasury regulation section b c suggests that surrender charges may never be considered when valuing a life insurance policy distributed from an employees trust.
on the other hand,there is a different clause in section b c that proves useful to our analysis the regulation parrots nearly verbatim the text of section b,providing that a ny amount actually distributed or made available to any distributee shall be taxable under section.reg.b c.we have explained our interpretation of this language,and we conclude that it bears the same meaning in the treasury regulation that it does in the corresponding tax code provision.so rather than overriding what we understand to be the plain meaning of section b,as the commissioner believes it should,the regulation in fact reaffirms our interpretation of the tax code 
the commissioner next argues that we should reject the tax court treatment of distributions from qualified benefit plans because that approach creates unwarranted anomalies with the taxation of variable life insurance policies while they are held in trust,and with the tax treatment of distributions from qualified investment plans.we discuss each in turn.
an employer contributions to an employees trust are taxed according to a different subsection of section b section b than are distributions from the trust.under the regulations pertaining to section b,contributions to the employee trust are valued and
