centex alleges that it was a developer of residences in corona.in may,centex was sued by corona homeowners in riverside county superior court for construction defects.centex tendered the defense to travelers,which accepted the defense subject to a reservation of rights,including the right to choose defense counsel.the riverside litigation was stayed pending the corona plaintiffs compliance with the prelitigation procedures of the right to repair act,civil code section et.in april,the corona plaintiffs served centex with a notice of violations.
a.the complaint 
in june,centex filed the present action against subcontractors,alleging six causes of action for breach of contract to indemnify,defend,and obtain insurance,for equitable indemnity,and for contribution and repayment.the complaint specifically alleges that centex has incurred,is incurring,and will incur defense fees and costs to defend the corona plaintiffs claims,all of which are recoverable through defense and indemnity provisions in its agreements with its subcontractors and through various insurers who named centex as an additional insured under general liability policies issued to the subcontractors.
the seventh and eighth causes of action are for declaratory relief against travelers.in the seventh cause of action,centex alleges that the corona homeowners are suing for construction defects caused by subcontractors who were insured by travelers and that centex is a named additional insured.consequently,centex asserts travelers is obligated to defend and indemnify centex against the corona homeowners claims and travelers breached its duty to defend by requiring a reservation of rights,seeking to obtain full reimbursement from centex.centex articulates the dispute and controversy with travelers as follows allocation needs to be made regarding the costs and fees associated with centex homes defense in the underlying action declaratory judgment is both proper and necessary,so that the respective rights,duties,and obligations of the insurer defendants,centex homes,and subcontractor defendants as to the allocation of centex defense fees and costs related from the underlying action may be determined.
in the eighth cause of action,centex alleges that travelers breached its duty to provide centex with a full,complete,immediate,and conflict free defense,causing centex to incur defense costs.centex further alleges that,by defending centex under a reservation of rights and appointing its own panel defense counsel,travelers has created a conflict of interest with centex,triggering the right to independent counsel.in particular,centex contends travelers is trying to limit the scope of its coverage to the work of its named insured,oak leaf.furthermore,travelers denies there is any covered occurrence or property damage under its policy.centex argues travelers is also competing with centex by seeking recovery or reimbursement from other subcontractors and forcing centex to share counsel with the subcontractors,while disadvantageously controlling and manipulating centex defense,particularly the use of experts.for those reasons,centex alleges it has an immediate need for independent counsel.
b.the demurrer 
in its demurrer,travelers argued that centex had not alleged any specific facts to demonstrate travelers is manipulating the defense,thus entitling centex to independent counsel.furthermore,the allocation of defense costs and fees is premature because the amount of fees,the parties involved,and the relevant facts are still unknown.centex,of course,adopted a contrary position.the trial court found that the seventh cause of action is not ripe and therefore no cause of action is stated.as to the eighth cause of action,the court found no actual present conflict of interest requiring independent counsel.
discussion 
centex argues that,to the extent travelers controls the defense of both the subcontractors and centex,travelers can manipulate the litigation against centex interests,creating an ethical conflict requiring independent counsel there is a large block of authority recognizing what also seems relatively obvious when an insured is obligated to provide defenses for two or more insureds with adverse interests,there is a sufficient conflict of interest that the insurer must provide independent counsel for each insured at its own expense.couch on insurance ed.additionally,centex claims that,when travelers seeks reimbursement of defense fees,its right to reimbursement and the issue of allocation must be resolved as part of the action against the subcontractors.therefore,centex maintains the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer and finding that centex could not amend its complaint to state a cause of action against travelers.
