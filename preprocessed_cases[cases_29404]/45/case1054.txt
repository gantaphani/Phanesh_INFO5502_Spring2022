eugene loren loren and danielle hagemann hagemann collectively,plaintiffs appeal the district court order granting defendant blue cross blue shield of michigan bcbsm motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims brought pursuant to sections a and a of the employee retirement income security act erisa,codified in a and a,respectively plaintiffs allege that bcbsm violated its fiduciary duties under erisa,and they seek to represent a class of all participants and beneficiaries of erisa plans for which bcbsm administers claims handles plan assets.in granting bcbsm motion to dismiss,the district court concluded that,although loren had statutory standing when the complaint was filed,his claims were rendered moot after he withdrew from the coverage administered by bcbsm and,therefore,now lacks an interest in the remedies available to a participant under a and a.in addition,the district court concluded that,even before filing the suit,hagemann was covered as a beneficiary under a health care option for which bcbsm does not administer claims,and,therefore,she lacks statutory standing to bring claims against bcbsm.accordingly,the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.plaintiffs appeal,asserting that they both have statutory and constitutional standing to assert their claims against bcbsm.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
bcbsm is a health care corporation,organized under the state of michigan,that administers and processes claims for various erisa welfare benefit plans,including or health benefit plans sponsored and maintained by ford motor company ford and american axle manufacturing axle.in a plan,the employer elects to pay the health care costs of its covered employees using its own funds,rather than paying premiums to an insurer in exchange for the insurer assumption of the risk to pay the cost of health care.basically,ford and axel act as their own insurance companies with respect to their benefit plans,accepting the financial risk of coverage and obligation to pay claims using its own funds.insurance companies such as bcbsm often act as administrators to carry out the daily operations of employers plans,since insurance companies already have operations in place to process claims,collect employee premiums,and manage enrollment.in practice,health care providers bill the administrator for the health care services,and the administrator then collects the full payment from the employer,along with a processing fee.bcbsm negotiates rates for hospital services throughout the state,and these rates are reflected in the reimbursement rates and services fees that bcbsm collects from clients such as ford and axle after bcbsm administers their claims.
bcbsm is also the parent company of blue care network bcn,a health maintenance organization hmo,which issues its own insurance policies to groups and individuals.bcbsm negotiates hospital reimbursement rates on bcn behalf,and these rates are factored into the premiums bcn charges to its customer base.thus,bcbsm has negotiated agreements with various michigan hospitals with respect to the rates bcn will reimburse the hospitals for the medical services provided to bcn participants and beneficiaries and the rates that bcbsm will reimburse the hospitals for the medical services provided to participants and beneficiaries in plans administered by bcbsm,such as those offered by ford and axel.
plaintiffs claim that in its agreements with michigan hospitals,bcbsm negotiated rates more favorable to bcn than to the ford and axle plans that it administers.specifically,plaintiffs claim that bcbsm struck a deal with hospitals whereby the hospitals agreed to accept lower reimbursement payments from bcn in exchange for bcbsm promise to pay those hospitals increased amounts for the services provided under the plans that bcbsm administered,which include the ford and axle plans.
ford and axle sponsor several different health benefit coverage alternatives for their employees and retirees,including options administered by bcbsm.loren is a participant in,and hagemann a beneficiary of,heath care plan options sponsored by ford and axle,respectively.significantly,however,plaintiffs are not covered under the coverage options offered by their employers.loren was covered by the axle option administered by bcbsm at the time of the filing,but as of january,loren no longer receives coverage from the option serviced by bcbsm.loren,instead,switched to medicare benefits through another carrier that does not contract with bcbsm for its claims administration.hagemann has not been a beneficiary of ford coverage option since march,at which time hagemann spouse elected coverage for her under carechoices,a fully insured hmo offered by ford as an alternative benefit plan option.plaintiffs claim that all of the coverage alternatives sponsored by their the and coverage one erisa plan.specifically,loren asserts that the coverage that he currently receives is part of the same erisa plan as the option because axle reports both coverage options under the same erisa identification number.similarly,hagemann asserts that the coverage options offered through carechoices and bcbsm are part of the same erisa plan because ford reports both options under the same erisa identification number.conversely,bcbsm asserts that each coverage option offered by axle and ford is a separate and distinct erisa health care plan.as such,bcbsm argues that plaintiffs have no standing to bring claims against bcbsm because they are not participants in,or beneficiaries of,an erisa plan connected to bcbsm.
plaintiffs allege that bcbsm violated its fiduciary duties under erisa when it negotiated different rates for bcn and the ford and axle plans.plaintiffs assert that bcbsm inappropriately increased charges to the option in which they participated.plaintiffs claim that even though they were not covered by the options,because their employers operate under single erisa plans,the alleged increases caused by bcbsm breach affected the plans as a whole,and plaintiffs,therefore,had to pay excessive contributions,deductibles.
plaintiffs sought to bring their claims as a class action,individually and on behalf of a class of all erisa plans for which bcbsm administers claims,and the respective participants in and beneficiaries of those plans.pursuant to a and a,plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint complaint on march,asserting violations of the fiduciary duties as described in.specifically,plaintiffs seek declaratory,injunctive and other equitable relief,including a a declaration that bcbsm is a fiduciary under erisa and breached its fiduciary duties when it obtained more favorable terms for bcn than for the erisa plans b an order enjoining bcbsm from entering into or enforcing contracts with hospitals that grant more favorable terms to bcn than to the erisa plans c an order for bcbsm to reimburse the erisa plans for all excess charges it has imposed on such plans and to reimburse plaintiffs for all excess contributions they have been required to pay as a result of bcbsm illegal conduct d an order for bcbsm to account to the erisa plans for all plan assets retained by bcbsm for its own benefit and all profits earned through its breach of fiduciary duty e an order for bcbsm to account for all sums due to the erisa plans and to place such sums in a constructive trust for distribution to the erisa plans f an order to enjoin bcbsm from any further violation of their erisa fiduciary obligations and g an award of expenses,including costs,attorneys and experts fees.bcbsm moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for,among other reasons,lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court granted bcbsm motion.with respect to loren,the court found that although he was covered under axle option at the time of the filing,because he later switched to a option,his claims were moot.in essence,the court concluded without analysis,that the coverage and the coverage to which loren subscribed,are not part of one axle erisa plan,but are,instead,different erisa plans sponsored by axle.the court,therefore,found that once loren switched plans instead of merely switching coverage options he no longer had an interest in the remedies available under a and a.
as for hagemann,the court found that she was a beneficiary of carechoices,a benefit plan,even before filing the complaint.further,the court concluded that carechoices and the coverage options offered by ford are not part of a single ford erisa plan under which various coverage options are available,but are instead,different erisa plans.the court found,therefore,that hagemann lacks standing to assert claims against bcbsm because bcbsm does not act as a fiduciary with respect to hagemann health plan.plaintiffs now appeal,asserting that their employers each have only one erisa plan in which they are members,and they are not barred from maintaining suit against bcbsm merely because they elected coverage options other than the alternatives.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a district court decision to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is subject to a de novo standard of review.taveras taveraz,cir.
number of erisa plans 
though the main issue is one of standing,the crux of this case lies in the determination of whether the individual coverage options offered by axle and ford constitute one employee benefit plan for purposes of erisa,or multiple plans.plaintiffs assert that,assuming statutory standing,both have article iii standing because they each sue to recover as a result of injury to the single erisa plans sponsored by ford and axle,respectively,which simply include as one coverage option,the plans administered by bcbsm.defendant maintains that each coverage option offered by axle and ford is a separate erisa health care plan,and because plaintiffs are not members of plan,they can not establish any element of constitutional standing.therefore,we must first determine whether the multiple coverage options offered by ford and axle constitute one erisa plan or multiple plans.
determining whether multiple coverage options constitute one plan under erisa is a case of first impression for this court.to be sure,there have been numerous cases considering the issue of what is a plan,but those cases address whether an erisa plan exists at,whether the employee benefits arranged by employers constitute a plan for erisa purposes,thereby subjecting the administrator to fiduciary duties under erisa.see kolkowski goodrich,cir determining existence of an erisa plan hughes white,d.here,there is no doubt about whether there is an erisa plan.the question is how many.
because of the paucity of case law on the issue,we will look to administrative interpretation.the only guidance from this source comes from a proposed regulation governing the group health plan portability provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa,jointly issued by the department of labor and the department of health and human services.see notice of proposed rulemaking for health coverage portability.proposed,to be codified at pt.to address uncertainty regarding whether an individual who changed benefit elections was switching between benefit options under a single plan,or switching from one plan to another thereby triggering various provisions that apply when an individual commences or terminates coverage under a group health plan,the proposed regulations clarify that 
all medical care benefits made available by an employer or employee organization are generally considered to constitute one group health plan the default rule.however,the employer or employee organization can establish more than one group health plan if it is clear from the instruments governing the arrangements to provide medical care benefits that the benefits are being provided under separate plans and if the arrangements are operated pursuant to the instruments as separate plans.
these rules provide plan sponsors great flexibility while minimizing the burden of making decisions about how many plans to maintain.for example,many employers may wish to minimize the number of certificates of creditable coverage required to be furnished to continuing employees.under the default rule,because all health benefits provided by an employer are considered a single group health plan,there is no need to furnish a certificate of creditable coverage when an employee merely switches coverage among the options made available by the employer.this need would arise only if the employer designated separate benefit packages as separate plans in the plan documents and only if the benefit packages were also operated pursuant to the plan documents as separate plans.
id.emphasis added.
the tenth circuit is the only circuit to address this issue in the context of erisa litigation.see chiles ceridian,cir.in chiles,the tenth circuit faced the question of whether a particular employer erisa benefit plan,interpreted in light of the plan documents,included payment of health care premiums after termination of a disability plan.id.at.as a threshold matter,the chiles court had to decide whether the four plan documents established one erisa plan or four erisa plans.id.at.in concluding that these documents created four distinct erisa plans,the tenth circuit started with the assumption that separate plan documents create separate plans.id.the tenth circuit concluded that the plaintiffs failed to defeat the presumption that different plan documents create different plans.id.the court found that the plaintiffs did not proffer sufficient evidence to prove that the employer intended there to be only one plan or that it operated the plans as a single plan.id.in reaching its conclusion,the court considered three factors whether each plan had a different erisa identification number whether the language of the plan documents indicated that the employer intended to establish multiple plans and whether the plans shared the same administrator or trust.id.
given hippa default rule that all medical benefits offered by an employer are generally considered to be part of one erisa health plan,and the fact that if an employer intends to create multiple plans it has the ability to do so by filing multiple plan documents,we start with the strong presumption that the filing of only one erisa plan document indicates that the employer intended to create only one erisa plan.thus,the burden is on defendant to defeat this presumption by establishing through sufficient evidence that these plans were intended to operate as separate plans,or operated as such in practice.
defendant claims that the district court was correct in concluding that ford had multiple erisa plans because finding that ford had only a single plan comprised of multiple benefit options would expand the categories of individuals who may sue further than congress intended.loren blue cross blue shield of,wl,at.defendant states that the instruments governing ford option and ford option,of which hagemann is a beneficiary,make clear that they are intended to be separate plans the former is a ppo,designed and funded by ford and administered by bcbsm the latter is an hmo,designed and administered by carechoices,which ultimately assumes the payment risk.defendant asserts that just as there is a administrator agreement between ford and bcbsm governing bcbsm role,there is presumably a separate contract between ford and carechoices governing the insurance coverage carechoices will provide to ford employees who select it as an option.
defendant concedes that ford uses a single erisa identification number and filed a single form but asserts that these plan options have distinct claims processing administrators,different levels of benefits and different funding regimes,carechoices,as an hmo,bears the risk to pay the cost of health expenses,whereas bcbsm is a third party administrator for a plan for which ford bears the risk to pay the cost of health expenses.defendant contends that plaintiffs argument with respect to loren fails for the same reasons,and that the coverage options under axle are separate erisa plans.
we conclude that defendant has not overcome the presumption that the employe
