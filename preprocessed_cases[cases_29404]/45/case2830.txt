a company purchased earthquake insurance from a broker.the broker obtained insurance with less coverage than the company sought.after sustaining damage in the northridge earthquake,the company submitted a claim under the insurance policy and was paid benefits in accordance with the policy as written.
the company filed this action against the broker to recover the additional benefits that would have been paid under the coverage as requested,alleging causes of action for negligence,breach of oral contract,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty.the case was tried to the court,which found in the company favor on all causes of action and awarded compensatory damages,attorneys fees,prejudgment interest,and costs.
on appeal,the broker contends that the gravamen of this suit,regardless of how the causes of action are labeled,is a claim for professional negligence,and the suit is therefore barred by the statute of limitations applicable to malpractice claims against an insurance broker code civ,subd.we agree and reverse.
background 
plaintiff company,manufactures sophisticated aircraft parts for the united states military and private aircraft manufacturing companies.it operates facilities at three locations mason avenue,mason avenue,and plummer street in chatsworth,california.
on september,requested earthquake coverage from its broker,hayward,tilton and rolapp insurance associates,hayward.dan seymour,an officer of hayward,and george lodwick,an officer of,discussed the desired coverage with owner.hayward provided with a written tentative schedule of insurance,setting forth hayward recommendations as to coverage.the policy was to have an effective date of october.
requested earthquake coverage for all three of its locations,including coverage for damage to equipment and building contents,losses related to business interruption,and extra expenses.requested that the insurance not cover physical damage to the building structures at mason avenue and plummer avenue because leased those premises.the structure at mason,which owned,was to be covered for physical damage.also requested that some of the policy limits be reduced.seymour made handwritten notations on the schedule of insurance to reflect requested changes.
seymour did not procure the policy himself.he had another hayward employee,kathy crooymans,contact a wholesale insurance broker,sherwood insurance services,and she obtained a policy from scottsdale insurance company.as admitted by hayward,crooymans made a mistake in obtaining the policy.for the two leased locations,she did not simply omit coverage for damage to the buildings.she did not obtain coverage of any kind.the owned location was the only one insured.in addition,crooymans did not obtain extra expenses coverage for any of the locations.we use the term owned location to refer to the property at mason avenue and the term leased locations to refer to the properties at mason avenue and plummer street.
in october,seymour told lodwick that hayward had obtained a policy with all coverages requested.in late october,crooymans received a coverage binder indicating that the owned location was the only one insured.at some point,hayward received the scottsdale policy.hayward did not provide with the binder or the policy.
the business interruption provisions in the policy stated that was insured a gainst loss resulting directly from necessary interruption of business,or rental value caused by damage to or destruction of real or personal property,by the peril s insured against during the term of this policy,which property is on premises occupied by the insured and situated as covered herein.italics added.elsewhere,the policy stated that had earthquake coverage with a million l oss limit per occurrence on buildings,contents,electronic data and software,property of others and business interruption while situate loc.mason,chatsworth,ca italics added.the leased locations were not mentioned.
on january,the northridge earthquake damaged facilities,including its equipment and contents at the owned location and the leased locations.the damage caused interruptions in operations,a reduction in profits,and extra expenses.the work performed at one of the leased locations mason avenue,and the equipment there,had to be moved to the owned location.
two days after the earthquake,seymour,lodwick,and gene kopecky,scottsdale adjuster,met at.kopecky stated that there might be a problem with coverage because not all of locations were specified in the policy.upon hearing this,seymour left the meeting and called his office.upon his return,seymour stated that hayward had made an error by scheduling only the owned location.kopecky presented a nonwaiver agreement from scottsdale which stated a question exists between the parties hereto as to whether insurance coverage exists by reason of scottsdale alleging that it may not be liable because of no coverage.signed off on the agreement.lodwick left the meeting knowing there was a problem with coverage as to the leased locations.
later that same day,lodwick told robert perry,of operations,about the nonwaiver agreement and the unscheduled locations.perry threw up his arms and said,w e are not insured.lodwick and perry called seymour,who stated that hayward had screwed up by excluding the leased locations.two or three days after the earthquake,seymour advised to consider making a demand against hayward if scottsdale did not pay the claim in full 
lodwick was responsible for gathering information to support insurance claim.he worked closely with kopecky and richard azimov,an accountant retained by scottsdale to assist in adjusting the claim.in may or june,scottsdale informed lodwick not to submit any information related to the leased locations because they were not scheduled.nevertheless,lodwick provided information as to all three locations,omitting some items as to the leased locations.
on august,lodwick,kopecky,and azimov met at to look at the financial aspects of claim and discuss what kopecky would submit to scottsdale.as lodwick knew,the meeting would not have been necessary but for hayward failure to obtain coverage for the leased locations.that was the topic of conversation.
lodwick viewed the meeting as a kind of negotiation about the losses that would be considered for payment.he believed that was in a weak position because hayward had not obtained the coverage requested.lodwick was very upset over the whole situation and believed that kopecky was focusing on the insurance policy as written.
on december,kopecky called lodwick and,on behalf of scottsdale,offered to pay on claim.kopecky said the offer did not include the losses at the leased locations or any extra expenses regardless of location.lodwick concluded that scottsdale would not pay for those losses.but,based on kopecky statements,lodwick believed that scottsdale had not made a final decision on the issue.kopecky and lodwick orally agreed that scottsdale would pay in insurance proceeds in accordance with the policy as written,namely,to cover the losses related to the owned location only.after talking to kopecky,lodwick contemplated a suit against hayward.
on december,lodwick went to kopecky office and picked up the check for.lodwick signed a sworn statement in proof of loss stating that the whole loss caused by the earthquake was in that amount.the payment was intended to settle dispute with scottsdale as to the owned location.it did not resolve any other claims against anyone.
on october,lodwick sent a letter to hayward,stating that scottsdale had paid but had not fully compensated for its losses.lodwick asserted that hayward was liable for the unpaid sum.hayward responded by letter dated october,saying this will acknowledge receipt of your correspondence dated october,regarding earthquake coverage for your leased location at mason avenue.please be advised that we are in the process of reviewing the matter and anticipate being in a position to respond more fully to your letter shortly.
hayward contacted its errors and omissions insurer,which assigned an adjuster to the matter.on february,the adjuster wrote to,asking for information regarding hayward potential liability.complied.by letter to dated may,the adjuster stated that had been properly compensated with the exception of a payment for percent of the cost of a machine.
in,and hayward executed a stipulation extending time to file a complaint for one january,up to and including february.this action was filed on the last day of the period.
on august,filed a second amended complaint hereafter complaint naming hayward,scottsdale,seymour,and crooymans as defendants.alleged causes of action for negligence,breach of oral contract,breach of fiduciary duty,injunctive relief,and restitution.
in december,scottsdale filed a motion for summary judgment,claiming there was no coverage for the leased locations.filed opposition papers.the trial court granted the motion.filed an appeal,which was dismissed prior to briefing.
the case was tried to the court between january and march.the trial court permitted to amend the complaint according to proof,adding a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.
hayward,seymour,and crooymans collectively hayward moved for nonsuit on the ground that causes of action were barred by the statute of limitations.the trial court denied the motion,concluding that the limitations period had been tolled while scottsdale processed claim under the policy.
after the close of evidence and submission of the case,the court found in favor of.in a statement of decision,the trial court stated that hayward was liable for negligence,breach of oral contract,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty seymour was liable for negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty and crooymans was liable for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.judgment was entered against all defendants,jointly and severally,for in compensatory damages,plus prejudgment interest,attorneys fees,and costs.
hayward filed motions for a new trial and to vacate the judgment,which were denied.a timely appeal followed.
discussion 
at trial,successfully litigated four causes of action,all of which were premised on hayward failure to obtain the insurance coverage had requested.the causes of action were negligence,breach of oral contract,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty.
general principles of liability 
t he general rule is that an agent or broker who fails to procure insurance as requested will be liable for any resulting damage as a general proposition,an insurance agent will be liable to his client in tort where his intentional acts or failure to exercise reasonable care with regard to the obtaining or maintenance of insurance results in damage to the client.saunders cariss d,citation omitted.
insurance agents and brokers have been held liable to insureds or applicants for insurance on a number of theories including breach of contract and professional negligence some of the cases arise in the context of an agent who fails to obtain insurance for a client as promised in other cases,the agent obtains insurance but fails to obtain certain requested coverage or obtains the requested coverage in the wrong amount in any of these situations,contractual liability of the agent can be at least theoretically premised on the agents breach of an oral agreement to obtain insurance as requested by the client.saunders cariss,supra,d at,citations and fn.omitted.
applicable statute of limitations 
to determine the statute of limitations which applies to a cause of action it is necessary to identify the nature of the cause of action,the gravamen of the cause of action t he nature of the right sued upon and not the form of action nor the relief demanded determines the applicability of the statute of limitations under our code.marin healthcare dist.sutter health th,d accord,smyth usaa property casualty ins.th,d smyth.what is significant for statute of limitations purposes is the primary interest invaded by defendant wrongful conduct.barton new united motor manufacturing,th,d.
professional negligence 
the negligence claim alleges that hayward,a broker,did not obtain the insurance coverage requested by,the insured,and falsely represented to that the proper coverage had been obtained.as such,the negligence claim is one for professional negligence and is governed by the statute of limitations set forth in section,subdivision of the code of civil procedure hereafter section.see roger smith,shn consulting engineers geologists,th,d stark pioneer casualty,butcher truck ins.exchange th,fn,d croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,id.supp.by its own terms,section applies in a n action upon a contract,obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing 
breach of oral contract 
the cause of action for breach of an oral contract is governed by the same limitations period given that section expressly applies to a n action upon a contract not founded upon an instrument of writing 
negligent misrepresentation 
the elements of negligent misrepresentation are well established.a plaintiff must prove the following in order to recover.m isrepresentation of a past or existing material fact,without reasonable ground for believing it to be true,and with intent to induce another reliance on the fact misrepresented ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to whom it was directed and resulting damage shamsian atlantic richfield th,d.
california courts have recognized a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation,a duty to communicate accurate information,in two circumstances.the first situation arises where providing false information poses a risk of and results in physical harm to person or property.the second situation arises where information is conveyed in a commercial setting for a business purpose.friedman merck th,d.
with respect to the second situation,which is applicable here,liability for negligent misrepresentation is imposed only on those who supply information for business purposes in the course of a business or profession.m any familiar forms of negligent conduct may be said to involve an element of misrepresentation,in the generic sense of that word,but s o far as misrepresentation has been treated as giving rise in and of itself to a distinct cause of action in tort,it has been identified with the common law action of deceit,and has been confined very largely to the invasion of interests of a financial or commercial character,in the course of business dealings.friedman merck,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.t he basis for liability in misrepresentation by those in the business of providing information is negligence.williams wells bennett realtors th,d.
a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is barred by the statute of limitations where the allegations amount to a claim of professional negligence.see smyth,supra,th at,d ventura county nat.bank macker th,d witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions,id.supp.
in smyth,supra,th,d,the insured,theodore smyth,was sued in a third party action.smyth tendered the defense of the action to his homeowners insurer,but the insurer refused to defend,stating that he had no existing coverage.smyth filed suit against the insurer,alleging that it had falsely stated that no coverage was in effect.the complaint contained causes of action for bad faith refusal to defend and negligent misrepresentation.the trial court dismissed the action on demurrer,concluding that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.the court of appeal affirmed,explaining 
t he complaint alleges that the insurer denied the existence of these policies as of february or march,approximately two years and seven months before the insured filed the complaint.the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the bad faith cause of action because the complaint was deemed filed well over the statute of limitations for such torts set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision.
the facts sued upon in the cause for negligent misrepresentation are the same.the insured alleged that the insurer repeatedly denied the existence of current policies without exercising reasonable diligence to ascertain the truth of this assertion.the essence of such allegations is that the insurer tortiously invaded the insureds property right to be secure from the risk of financial loss.under the facts alleged,the applicable statute of limitations is,again,two years.smyth,supra,th at,d.
in ventura county nat.bank macker,supra,th,d,a bank sued a group of accountants for negligent misrepresentation,alleging they had made false representations in an audit report of a company financial statements,they knew the report would be used by the bank in offering the company a line of credit,they overstated the value of the company,they lacked sufficient information to make representations about the company financial condition,and the bank relied on the report to its detriment.
in concluding that the claim was,the court of appeal stated t he essence of this cause of action is negligence,not fraud.the allegations show a failure to meet a standard of reasonable care which results in the tortious invasion of a property right negligent misrepresentation is born of the union of negligence and fraud.if negligence is the mother and misrepresentation the father,it more closely resembles the mother.ventura county nat.bank macker,supra,th at,d.the court held that section barred the action.ventura county nat.bank macker,supra,th at,d.
here,during trial,moved to amend the complaint according to proof in order to add a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.the trial court granted the motion,stating that the allegations of negligent misrepresentation would be exactly the same as those of the complaint,but simply separating.the statement of decision indicates that liability on the misrepresentation claim was based on hayward failure to obtain the requested insurance and its false statement that the proper coverage had been same facts supporting liability on the claim for professional negligence.in these circumstances,the statute of limitations should apply to both claims.
breach of fiduciary duty 
contends that a limitations period applies to its cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty code civ,making that claim timely.we disagree.
for one thing,it is unclear whether a fiduciary relationship exists between an insurance broker and an insured.a fiduciary relationship has been defined as any relation existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties is duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.such a relation ordinarily arises where a confidence is reposed by one person in the integrity of another,and in such a relation the party in whom the confidence is reposed,if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the confidence,can take no advantage from his acts relating to the interest of the other party without the latter knowledge or consent.in re marriage of varner th,d.
in kotlar hartford fire ins.th,d,a commercial property owner,jack kotlar,was a named insured on his tenant commercial general liability policy.the tenant,who had purchased the policy through a broker,was to pay the premiums.the policy stated that the insurer would endeavor to give kotlar days notice of cancellation.without notice to kotlar,the insurer canceled the policy when the tenant failed to make payments.a customer sustained injuries on the property and sued kotlar.he tendered the defense of the action to the insurer,which refused the request on the ground that the policy had been canceled.kotlar filed suit against the insurer and the broker for failure to give notice of the cancellation.the trial court dismissed the action on demurrer,concluding that the defendants had no duty to give notice.
the court of appeal reversed the dismissal of the insurer,stating that notice was required by section of the insurance code,which provides that notice of cancellation of a commercial general liability policy shall be in writing and shall be delivered or mailed to the named insured the court affirmed the dismissal of the broker,stating 
kotlar cites no case holding an insurance broker owes a duty of care to a named insured to provide the named insured with notice of the insurer intent to cancel the policy for nonpayment of premiums.instead,he asks us to create such a duty.we decline to do so for several reasons.
in light of our holding section imposes a duty on the insurer to notify the named insureds of its intent to cancel the policy we see no purpose in judicially imposing such a duty on a broker.
furthermore,the relationship between an insurance broker and its client is not the kind which would logically give rise to such a duty.the duty of a broker,by and large,is to use reasonable care,diligence,and judgment in procuring the insurance requested by its client 
kotlar attempt to analogize the relationship to the relationship is wide of the mark.the relationship between an attorney and client is a fiduciary relationship of the very highest character,and attorneys have a duty of loyalty to their clients thus,while an attorney must represent his or her clients zealously within the bounds of the law,a broker only needs to use reasonable care to represent his or her client.kotlar hartford fire ins,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.
indeed,our supreme court has held that an insurer is not a fiduciary,stating the relationship is not a true fiduciary relationship in the same sense as the relationship between trustee and beneficiary,or attorney and client it is,rather,a relationship often characterized by unequal bargaining power in which the insured must depend on the good faith and performance of the insurer this characteristic has led the courts to impose special and heightened duties,but w hile these special duties are akin to,and often resemble,duties which are also owed by fiduciaries,the duties arise because of the unique nature of the insurance contract,not because the insurer is a fiduciary.vu prudential property casualty ins.cal th,d,italics in original see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,to,to.if an insurer is not a fiduciary,then arguably,neither is a broker.
but in eddy sharp d,the court commented in dicta that i f an insurance agent is the agent for several companies and selects the company with which to place the insurance or insures with one of them according to directions,the insurance agent is the agent of the insured where the agency relationship exists there is not only a fiduciary duty but an obligation to use due care.id.at,citations omitted.
whether or not the relationship is a fiduciary one,a broker still has certain fiduciary duties.for example,a ll funds received by any person acting as an insurance agent or broker as premium or return premium on or under any policy of insurance are received and held by that person in his or her fiduciary capacity.any such person who diverts or appropriates those fiduciary funds to his or her own use is guilty of theft and punishable for theft as provided by law,see also westrec marina management,jardine ins.brokers orange county,th,d brokers found liable for breach of fiduciary duty where they failed to obtain insurance at best available price.
as one leading treatise has observed it is not clear in what respect the fiduciary duty owed by an independent insurance agent differs from the duty of due reasonable care.as used in respect to an independent agent,fiduciary duty may refer merely to avoidance of conflict of interest,excessive compensation,croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
as stated,the applicable statute of limitations is determined variously nature of the right sued upon,the primary interest affected by the defendant wrongful conduct,or the gravamen of the action.marin healthcare dist.sutter health,supra,th at,d barton new united motor manufacturing,supra,th at,d.here,the complaint shows that the allegations of professional negligence subsume all of the allegations for breach of fiduciary duty.the statement of decision indicates that liability on both of those causes of action is based on the same findings hayward failed to obtain the requested insurance coverage and did not disclose that failure.in short,causes of action,regardless of appellation,amount to a claim of professional negligence.because a statute of limitations governs that type of claim,can not prolong the limitations period by invoking a fiduciary theory of liability.
our conclusion finds support in curtis kellogg andelson th,d.there,an accounting firm gave tax advice to a corporation about the amount of compensation to be paid to a particular employee and also prepared tax returns listing that information.the internal revenue service conducted an audit,determined that the compensation exceeded a reasonable allowance,and required the corporation to pay back taxes plus penalties and interest.
in an action against the accounting firm,the complaint alleged that the corporation was never advised that the employee compensation was excessive,nor did the firm inform the corporation of the erroneous nature of that advice.the complaint alleged causes of action for professional negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract.the trial court dismissed the action as untimely based on the statute of limitations.
in affirming the dismissal,the court of appeal first examined the professional negligence claim,concluding that it was barred by the limitations period.the court continued the same analysis renders the corporation claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract untimely.since the gravamen of the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims is the purported malpractice,the statute of limitations applies.curtis kellogg andelson,supra,th at,d see stoll superior court th,d in professional negligence action against attorney,plaintiff can not circumvent statute of limitations applicable to legal malpractice claim by alleging cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
in sum,because the gravamen of this lawsuit is hayward failure to execute its obligations as an insurance broker,the limitations period for professional negligence applies to the cause of action denominated breach of fiduciary duty,rendering it untimely 
commencement of the statute of limitations 
civil actions,without exception,can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in sections to of the code of civil procedure,after the cause of action shall have accrued on certain causes of action the law in california has evolved to a point where the limitations clock begins to run only when the injured party discovers or should have discovered the facts supporting liability.california generally now subscribe s to the view that the period can not run before plaintiff possesses a true cause of action,by which we mean that events have developed to a point where plaintiff is entitled to a legal remedy,not merely a symbolic judgment such as an award of nominal damages.butcher truck ins.exchange,supra,th at,d,italics added,citation omitted.
the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action sets the date as the time when,under the substantive law,the wrongful act is done,or the wrongful result occurs,and the consequent liability arises in other words,it sets the date as the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements the elements being generically referred to by sets of terms such as wrongdoing or wrongful conduct,cause or causation,and harm or injury norgart upjohn cal th,d,citations omitted accord,greenfield insurance d.walker pacific indem.d.
in a professional malpractice context,accrual of the cause of action does not await the plaintiff discovery that the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission constitute professional negligence,the plaintiff discovery that a particular legal theory is applicable based on the known facts.if one has suffered appreciable harm and knows or suspects that professional blundering is its cause,the fact that the professional has not yet advised the plaintiff of the mistake does not postpone commencement of the limitations period.witkin,cal.procedure supp.actions,accord,norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,fn,d,apple valley unified school dist.vavrinek,trine,day th,d curtis kellogg andelson,supra,th at,d.
a cause of action for professional negligence does not accrue until the plaintiff sustains damage and discovers,or should discover,the negligence.roger smith,shn consulting engineers geologists,supra,th at,d.it does not matter here that the damages or losses attributable to the earthquake may have increased over time.it is the fact of damage,rather than the amount,that is the relevant consideration consequently,the insured may suffer appreciable and actual harm before he or she sustains all,or even the greater part,of the damages occasioned by the professional negligence.van dyke dunker aced th,d,citation omitted.thus,the crucial question in this case is when did know,or when should it have known,about hayward wrongful conduct and the resulting harm.
the event giving rise to insurance sudden,brief,and of sufficient magnitude to raise immediate concerns about extensive property damage.as states in its appellate brief 
the earthquake caused significant damage to operating facilities and equipment at the owned location and one of the leased locations,including physical damage to equipment,contents,and other property belonging to at both locations 
the earthquake further caused crippling disruptions and interruptions in business operations the earthquake stopped operations at one of the leased locations,where the company had operated an extremely large,specialized equipment known as the super center,used to produce inner fan ducts for military aircraft had to abandon that location and move the super center to the owned facility that move not only entailed considerable expense,but also required to build a new foundation for the super center and to disconnect and remove several other machines that had been used for other,principally private contractor jobs at the owned facility.
those dislocated machines also ceased operations for a considerable period,costing significant revenues in short,knew about the damage to its equipment and operations within hours after the earthquake.
also learned fairly quickly that hayward mistake would result in harm.on january,two days after the earthquake,seymour admitted that hayward had screwed up by not insuring the leased locations,causing of operations to say,w e are not insured.
in may or june,scottsdale informed lodwick that hydro mill claim should exclude items related to the leased locations.on august,lodwick attended a meeting with scottsdale adjuster and accountant to discuss the problem created by hayward error in placing the insurance.it appeared to lodwick that the adjuster was focusing on the insurance policy as written,not the coverage requested.lodwick was very upset at the time.
on december,scottsdale offered to pay on claim,making clear that the losses related to the leased locations were being excluded.in response,lodwick thought about filing suit against hayward.on december,lodwick picked up the check at kopecky office and signed a sworn statement in proof of loss stating that the whole loss caused by the earthquake was in that amount.
the trial court concluded that the statute of limitations began to run on december.nevertheless,it ruled that the running of the limitations period as to hayward,the broker,was tolled until scottsdale,the insurer,denied claim in writing.that denial did not occur until scottsdale filed its answer to the complaint in this action.
we agree with the trial court that the limitations period began to run on december.but,as discussed below,we decide that the statute of limitations was not tolled as to hayward while scottsdale processed claim.
thus,had to file suit on or before december.it did not do so.this action was filed on february.and although the parties agreed to extend the limitations period for one january,up to and including february,agreement did not affect the earlier,december,deadline.taking the agreement into account,filed this action one month late,such that it is unless subject to tolling or some other equitable theory.
tolling the statute of limitations 
in an action by an insured against an insurer,the statute of limitations is tolled from the time the insured files a timel
