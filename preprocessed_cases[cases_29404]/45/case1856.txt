this case involves an interpleader action over the life insurance proceeds for an officer killed in the line of duty.although luis gerardo ortiz,gloria ortiz,was designated as beneficiary,graciela ortiz argues that divorce extinguished gloria ortiz expectancy interest.the district court awarded the life insurance proceeds to the estate for intestate division among graciela ortiz and the decedent two sons.we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural background 
on august,luis gerardo ortiz jerry designated his wife,gloria ortiz gloria,as the beneficiary of his life insurance policies with life insurance company of north america and reliance standard.jerry and gloria separated in march,and the superior court of california entered a judgment on reserved issues in their divorce on december.the judgment on reserved issues awarded a ll right,title and interest in any and all of petitioner,b plans,k plans or other deferred benefits in jerry name to jerry.the document also included a notice indicating that i t does not automatically cancel the rights of a spouse as beneficiary on the other spouse life insurance policy.
in february of,jerry divorce attorney sent an exit letter advising him to reaffirm change any beneficiaries on any insurance policies.the attorney also spoke with jerry after the divorce judgment issued and urged him to change the beneficiaries of his life insurance policies immediately.jerry indicated that he intended to go and look into those policies and again assured her that he would.despite these assurances,jerry did not attempt to change the written beneficiary designations on file with life insurance company of north america and reliance standard 
jerry married graciela ortiz graciela on may.jerry did not work may because of the marriage and the honeymoon.on june,jerry died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head while on duty.the term life insurance payment that funded jerry coverage at the time of death was withdrawn from his may paycheck.the life insurance companies deposited life insurance and accidental death benefits totaling with the clerk of the court.
the life insurance companies instituted an interpleader action naming gloria and graciela as defendants.the district court judge found that the life insurance policies became jerry separate property at the time of his divorce from gloria.the judge also found that jerry expressed an intent to name graciela as his beneficiary,but he died intestate before he could make that change.accordingly,the judge awarded the proceeds of the policies to the estate to be split equally between graciela and jerry two sons.the district court denied a motion to stay the judgment pending appeal,but this court granted an unopposed application for an emergency stay order.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court derived jurisdiction from because the parties are diverse and the amount in controversy exceeds exclusive of interest and costs.we find jurisdiction over this appeal of the final judgment pursuant to.
the interpretation of a divorce judgment is a matter of law,which we review de novo.lowenschuss selnick,cir.
discussion 
divorce judgment 
under california law,we look to the language of the property settlement agreement to determine whether the agreement extinguishes the expectancy interests of life insurance beneficiaries.life ins.of am.cassidy,cal d.g eneral language in a marital settlement agreement will not be construed to include an assignment or renunciation of the expectancy interest conferred on the named beneficiary of an insurance policy or a will unless it clearly appears that the agreement was intended to deprive either spouse of such a right.id.a property settlement covering all property and releasing all claims may be found to include a life insurance expectancy interest,but where the language is not broad enough to encompass such an expectancy the wife may still take as beneficiary if the policy so provides.thorp randazzo,cal d.
we find that the language of the divorce judgment between jerry and gloria ortiz did not extinguish gloria expectancy interest in jerry life insurance proceeds.the text of the relevant judgment on reserved issues did not contain a single direct reference to life insurance policies.although one could read the provision awarding a ll right,title and interest in any and all of petitioner,b plans,k plans or other deferred benefits to encompass life insurance policies,it was not clearly apparent that the provision encompassed beneficiary status.unlike in thorp,the judgment did not clearly indicate that the parties attention had been directed to the expectancy of the insurance proceeds,and that it was intended that plaintiff waive all interest therein,present and future.at.thus the divorce judgment was insufficient to waive beneficiary status because it is not clear from the text of the agreement that such status was contemplated and intentionally waived.
additionally,the context of the judgment on reserved issues suggests that the parties did not extinguish beneficiary status.the document contained a notice that i t does not automatically cancel the rights of a spouse as beneficiary on the other spouse life insurance policy.this notice,while not dispositive,provided information regarding the additional steps required to alter life insurance beneficiaries.we can infer that jerry and his attorney did not expect the judgment to terminate gloria beneficiary status because jerry attorney advised him to reaffirm change any beneficiaries on any insurance policies in her exit letter.jerry also indicated that he understood the necessity of changing his named beneficiary when he spoke with his attorney in february.the notice on the judgment form and the record evidence regarding jerry state of mind support our conclusion that the divorce judgment did not extinguish gloria expectancy interest.
we distinguish this case from meherin meherin,d.in meherin,a property settlement agreement terminated a wife expectancy interests by assigning all of her right,title and interest in and to said policy and further requiring her to execute any instrument or documents required by the husband or the insurance company to carry out the intention of this paragraph.id.at.unlike the ortiz divorce judgment,the agreement in meherin specifically referenced the insurance policy.id.the agreement also referenced the documentation required by the husband or the insurance company to change the beneficiary and the wife interests in recovery.id.finally,the agreement in meherin was a complete settlement whereas the ortiz document was only a judgment on reserved issues.the meherin agreement clearly indicated that the parties directed their attention to expectancy interests and intended to waive those interests the ortiz judgment did not.
for the foregoing reasons,we find that gloria expectancy interest survived the divorce.in light of this finding,we hold that the district court erred when it relied on jerry postdivorce intent to terminate gloria expectancy interests.in both cassidy and thorp,the court only looked to the decedent intent after it determined that the language of the divorce decree terminated the expectancy interest.in cassidy,the agreement waive d and relinquish ed any expectancy that was not thereafter reaffirmed,and the court looked to evidence of intent to determine whether the failure to change the beneficiary designation constituted a reaffirmation of the expectancy interest,at.in thorp,the waiver of future interests in life insurance policies and benefits was explicit,and the court considered intent for the limited question of whether the failure to change the beneficiary amounted to a confirmation of the designation.at.this case is distinguishable from both cassidy and thorp,thus the district court reliance on intent was misplaced.
ii.change of beneficiary 
as a general rule,california requires a change to a beneficiary designation to be made in accordance with the terms of the policy.i f it is not,no change is accomplished,unless whatever occurred in that respect comes within one of more of the three exceptions to the rule.cook cook,cal d.the three exceptions are when the insurer waives strict compliance with its own rules regarding the change when it is beyond the insured power to comply literally with the insurer requirement or when the insured has done all that he could to effect the change but dies before the change is actually made.id.
only the third exception is potentially applicable to this case.the supreme court of california interpreted this third exception,stating 
we think that where the insurer is not contesting the change the rule is not to be applied rigorously and where the insured makes every reasonable effort under the circumstances,complying as far as he is able with the rules,and there is a clear manifestation of intent to make the change,which the insured has put into execution as best he can,equity should regard the change as effected.
pimentel conselho supremo de uniao portugueza do estado da california,cal d.thus,one intent to change a beneficiary designation must be clearly manifested and put into motion as much as practicable.see manhattan life ins.barnes,cir california demands that substantial steps be taken to actually change a beneficiary before the formal requirements of the contract may be ignored.
in this case,both insurance companies required written notification of change of beneficiary and jerry took no steps toward providing such notification.jerry lawyer stressed the necessity of changing the designation in both her exit letter and an informal meeting.jerry indicated that he understood and intended to change the designation however,he took no action in the four months between the finalization of the divorce and his death.at any point following the finalization of his divorce,jerry could have named graciela,his two sons,or anyone else as the beneficiary of his policies.jerry inaction does not amount to substantial steps to change his beneficiary therefore we find that the original designation of gloria ortiz remained valid.thus the district court erred by relying on intent to circumvent a valid beneficiary designation.
iii.community property share 
although we find that the beneficiary designation naming gloria was valid,we note that graciela retains a community property interest of of the life insurance proceeds this percentage represents a interest in the four days earnings that funded the final day term of luis term life insurance.
conclusion 
we reverse and remand for the district court to award of the disputed life insurance proceeds to gloria ortiz and to graciela ortiz.
the majority reaches a senseless,unjust and cruel result by awarding half a million dollars to the former wife of a peace officer felled in the line of duty,leaving the officer widow and children out in the cold.we do need to do this.the law,the facts,the equities,common sense and the district court findings all support the just result here giving the proceeds of the service life insurance policies meant to protect the officer loved ones to the people he actually loved.
the majority pettifogs its way through the california caselaw,finding ways to distinguish this case and that,but loses sight of the key facts that support the district court judgment gloria woman who will get the windfall under the majority stilted given up all interest in the policies at the time of her divorce from deputy ortiz.she had no interest in the policies anyway because they were for term insurance and thus built up no cash value.every month coverage was paid for by premiums deducted that month from deputy ortiz paycheck.after the divorce,gloria had no interest in the deputy income.to award gloria the proceeds,one must believe that deputy ortiz meant to spend a chunk of his salary buying insurance for the benefit of his estranged wife instead of his wife and sons.
breadwinners buy life insurance to provide financial security for their dependents.deputy ortiz had no reason to provide financial security for a woman who was his dependent and whom,by all accounts,he despised.which is what the district court found after a trial.it true that deputy ortiz had not yet changed the beneficiary designation on his policies when he was killed.but the delay was very long,and certainly does compel a finding that deputy ortiz meant to leave gloria a pot of gold and his wife and sons a lump of coal.
the delay was,in any event,entirely understandable.while the deputy could have changed the beneficiary designation after his divorce in february,he prudently waited for graciela to become his wife.the two wedded at the end of may and,after a short honeymoon,deputy ortiz returned to work.he did rush to change the beneficiary designation on his policies,probably because he did imagine he be killed three weeks later.deputy ortiz,like the rest of mankind,must have believed that he had plenty of time.imprudent,perhaps,but very human.who amongst us has put off dealing with wills or other unpleasantries that remind us of our mortality is this the kind of mistake that should deprive deputy ortiz wife and children of the insurance he maintained for their security surely least not in california today.
the california courts have dealt with very similar situations for over half a century and have invariably awarded policy proceeds as intended by the decedent.thorp randazzo,cal d,is typical.the decedent was divorced from his former wife who,through a consent decree,gave up all claims to any benefits that she may have at present,or which may hereafter be derived from the life insurance policies upon the life of the husband.id.at.the former wife was the beneficiary of two policies the husband changed the beneficiary on one but not the other.the former wife sought the proceeds as the named beneficiary on the policy at the time of deceased death.id.at.the trial court ruled against her and awarded the proceeds to the husband estate.
the california supreme court recognized that t he failure of the husband to exercise his power to change the beneficiary ordinarily indicates that he does not wish to effect such a change.id.citations omitted.nevertheless,it affirmed the trial court because each case must be decided upon its own facts.id.citations omitted.thorp presented a much closer case than ours because the husband there did change the beneficiary on one policy but not the other.the most plausible inference would have been that he wanted the to remain as beneficiary of the policy he did change.even so,the trial court found that he did intend to change the beneficiary,and the state supreme court deferred to that finding.
thorp distinguished grimm grimm,cal d,which had reached the opposite result.the only material difference between the cases was that the trial court in grimm found that the decedent had intended to change the beneficiary,while the trial court in thorp found that he had.in each case,the state supreme court deferred to the trial court findings.
thorp was followed two decades later by life ins.of am.cassidy,cal d,where the california supreme court again affirmed a trial court judgment in favor of the estate and against the former wife.the court ruled 
we have concluded that the designation of appellant as beneficiary was superseded as of the date the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement which comprehensively disposed of all the rights and obligations between them.by terms of the agreement each waived all rights to take any property whatsoever at the death of the other unless such right was conferred by an instrument executed after the date of the agreement.the evidence produced at trial clearly shows that the fact appellant remained the named beneficiary of the subject insurance policy was not the result of an intent by the deceased to make a new gift of the benefits of the policy to his former spouse,but was contrary to his expressed intent that she be removed as beneficiary of all insurance policies on his life.we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.
id.at emphasis added.as the underscored language makes clear,the dispositive issue in cassidy was the decedent intent,with the beneficiary designation constituting but one indication of that intent,and not even a very significant one.
