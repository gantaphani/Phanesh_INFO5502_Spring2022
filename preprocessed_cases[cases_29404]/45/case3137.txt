generally,traveling home from work is not in the course and scope of employment as defined by the texas workers compensation act but is traveling from one workplace to another while on the way home the court of appeals answered we disagree.
petitioner liana leordeanu,a pharmaceutical sales representative officing out of her northwest austin apartment,drove her company car to business appointments in bastrop some forty miles southeast,then back to a south austin restaurant for dinner with clients.afterward,her route home took her past a unit,adjacent her apartment complex,in which she kept drug samples and marketing materials.she intended to stop at the unit and empty her car of business supplies in preparation for an personal trip the next day.but midway there,she ran off the highway and was seriously injured.
respondent,american protection insurance company,denied leordeanu claim for workers compensation.the texas department of insurance workers compensation commission division upheld apic decision,concluding that leordeanu was not in the course and scope of employment at the time of her accident,and she appealed.a jury found to the contrary,and the trial court rendered judgment on their verdict for leordeanu.a divided court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment for apic,holding that there was no evidence to support the verdict 
the enactment of the texas workers compensation act defined a compensable sustained in the course of employment to include 
all injuries of every kind and character having to do with and originating in the work,business,trade or profession of the employer received by an employee while engaged in or about the furtherance of the affairs or business of his employer whether upon the employer premises or elsewhere.
the definition had two components the injury had to relate to or originate in,and occur in the furtherance of,the employer business.both had to be satisfied 
the act did not require that an employee be injured on the employer premises.cases applying the act concluded that travel is in the course of employment but not,as a general rule,travel between home and work.an employee travel to and from work makes employment possible and thus furthers the employer business,satisfying the second component of the definition,but such travel can not ordinarily be said to originate in the business,the requirement of the first component,because t he risks to which employees are exposed while traveling to and from work are shared by society as a whole and do not arise as a result of the work of employers.we have explained it this way 
when an ordinary workman who lives at home and works at a fixed location is injured while going to or returning from work,his presence at the place of injury is causally related to the employment.the services for which he is employed can not be performed unless he goes regularly to the place where the work is to be done,and in that sense he furthers the affairs or business of his employer by making the journey.the problem in each case is to determine whether the relationship between the travel and the employment is so close that it can fairly be said that the injury had to do with and originated in the work,business,trade or profession of the employer 
chief justice calvert referred to the exclusion of travel between work and home from the course and scope of employment as the coming and going rule and noted that the case law had recognized several exceptions 
another rule that developed in the case law is this an employee traveling for both business and personal purposes is in the course and scope of employment only if the business purpose is both a necessary and sufficient cause for the travel.this dual purpose rule was explained by chief judge cardozo in marks dependents gray,as follows 
the test in brief is this if the work of the employee creates the necessity for travel,he is in the course of his employment,though he is serving at the same time some purpose of his own.if,however,the work has had no part in creating the necessity for travel,if the journey would have gone forward though the business errand had been dropped,and would have been canceled upon failure of the private purpose,though the business errand was undone,the travel is then personal,and personal the risk 
we indicated our approval of the rule in a case 
in,the legislature codified the coming and going rule and its exceptions in one sentence,and the dual purpose rule in another sentence and placed both in a new section of the act as follows 
unless transportation is furnished as a part of the contract of employment or is paid for by the employer,or unless the means of such transportation are under the control of the employer,or unless the employee is directed in his employment to proceed from one place to another place,such transportation shall not be the basis for a claim that any injury occurring during the course of such transportation is sustained in the course of employment.travel by an employee in the furtherance of the affairs or business of his employer shall not be the basis for a claim that an injury occurring during the course of such travel is sustained in the course of employment,if said travel is also in furtherance of the personal or private affairs of the employee,unless the trip to the place of occurrence of said injury would have been made even had there been no personal or private affairs of the employee to be furthered by said trip,and unless said trip would not have been made had there been no affairs or business of the employer to be furthered by said trip 
then in,the legislature rewrote this provision and the general definition,and combined them in a single section of the act the result,with minor edits in is now section of the texas labor code,which states 
course and scope of employment means an activity of any kind or character that has to do with and originates in the work,business,trade,or profession of the employer and that is performed by an employee while engaged in or about the furtherance of the affairs or business of the employer.the term includes an activity conducted on the premises of the employer or at other locations.the term does not include 
a transportation to and from the place of employment unless 
i the transportation is furnished as a part of the contract of employment or is paid for by the employer 
ii the means of the transportation are under the control of the employer or 
iii the employee is directed in the employee employment to proceed from one place to another place or 
b travel by the employee in the furtherance of the affairs or business of the employer if the travel is also in furtherance of personal or private affairs of the employee unless 
i the travel to the place of occurrence of the injury would have been made even had there been no personal or private affairs of the employee to be furthered by the travel and 
ii the travel would not have been made had there been no affairs or business of the employer to be furthered by the travel 
in the parlance of insurance policies,the general definition describes coverage,and travel must meet both its components to be in the course and scope of employment subsections a and b are exclusions,each followed by exceptions.subsection a has three,disjunctive exceptions if any one is met,the exclusion does not apply,and travel to and from work is not excluded from the course and scope of employment.subsection b has two,conjunctive exceptions and applies unless both are met.subsection b is somewhat convoluted.more simply put,it does not exclude travel from the course and scope of employment merely because the travel also furthers the employee personal interests that would not,alone,have caused him to make the trip.
although the act was completely overhauled in,the operative language of section largely tracks the definition of course of employment and the provision codifying the two travel rules.the revisions to those provisions appear to have been attempts at clarification rather than substantive changes.but the statute statement of the two travel rules,in two sentences one after the other,gave no indication of any relationship between them,while section rewrite,listing them as two disjunctive exclusions,can be read to suggest that travel is excluded from the course and scope of employment if either one applies.the difficulty with this construction is that travel between work and home is just one kind of travel,benefitting both employer and employee.if both subsections a and b apply in every situation,a becomes merely a specialized application of b.
the two rules did not develop that way in the case law.the dual purpose rule was devised for the distinct situation in which the employee is traveling between work and a place other than home.in marks,for example,the employee was injured en route to a nearby town to meet his wife,who was visiting relatives.his employer had given him a trifling job to do while there,but marks would not have gone for that reason alone,nor would he have cancelled had his employer said never mind the court held that he was not injured in the course and scope of employment,making no mention of the coming and going rule in each of the two cases in which we have applied subsection b,davis argonaut southwest insurance and jecker western alliance insurance the employee had left work to travel for both business and personal reasons and was killed in a car accident on the return trip in both cases,we held that there was evidence to support jury findings that the deaths were compensable under the dual purpose rule the coming and going rule developed separately,specifically for travel between home and work 
if the dual purpose rule also applied to travel to and from work,travel could never be in the course and scope of employment.it could satisfy subsection a and both components of the general definition,but it could never meet subsection b ii.subsection b ii excepts travel from the exclusion only if it would not have been made had it not furthered a business purpose.but any employee intending to take care of business on the way home,if the business purpose evaporates,will still go home.subsection a provides that travel home from work may be in the course and scope of employment if the employer furnishes,pays for,or controls the means of transportation,or directs the employee to proceed from one place to another along the short,if the travel furthers the employer interest.but if subsection b ii can not be satisfied,if the employee would further his own by going home regardless of whether subsection a i iii applied,the travel could not be in the course and scope of employment.applying subsection b ii to employees coming home from work limits subsection a to a going rule.
that is the problem in the case at hand.the court of appeals held that there was no evidence to support the jury finding that leordeanu was injured in the course and scope of her employment,reasoning that subsection b applied and b ii was not met.leordeanu testified that after she left her business dinner,she intended to stop by her storage unit to unload business supplies from her car,then go to her apartment.the storage unit,she stated,was adjacent her apartment complex,and the route from the restaurant to the storage unit was identical to the route home,except that her apartment was a stone throw farther.this schematic depicts her travel 
where r represents the restaurant,the accident site,and the storage unit.the court of appeals reasoned 
leordeanu concedes that she was going home for the evening from the restaurant.there is no evidence that leordeanu would not have made this travel if she did not intend to drop off items at the storage unit.on the contrary,leordeanu concedes that she was going home whether or not she dropped items off at the storage unit.therefore,on this record,the answer to the question whether the travel would not have been made had there been no affairs or business of the employer to be furthered by the travel,is no,and it precludes a finding that leordeanu was in the course and scope of her employment at the time of her injury 
the court of appeals noted that in paul fire marine insurance confer a sister court had reached a different conclusion in a similar situation.there,confer left work intending to stop by a computer store for supplies on the way home,but he was killed in a car wreck before he reached the store.the opinion in the case is somewhat confused,stating initially that in order to travel to the store,it would have been necessary for confer to deviate from his normal route home and later that the store happen ed to be along the same route as his route home so that he was not forc ed to travel away from his regular route home from the opinion turn by turn description of his normal route,it appears that while the store was on a route home,that route was not his usual one or the most direct.going to the store required a slight deviation from his normal route,and the accident occurred before he reached that point.schematically,confer intended travel was as follows 
where is the accident site.the court divided his trip into two segments,and,and concluded that the first,on which he was injured,was in the course and scope of employment because he was on a business errand the court also reasoned that if confer had been injured after diverging from his normal route but before reaching the store,at site in the following schematic 
he would clearly have been in the course and scope of employment,since that part of the trip would have been made solely for business reasons.why should the result be any different at or,the court asked 
two reasons,answered the court of appeals in the present case 
first,the statute expressly declines to adopt the policy of allowing coverage whenever there is any component to travel,and it mandates a different result for dual purpose travel based on specific statutory criteria second,the statutory scheme has a rational basis in that a policymaker could well come to the conclusion that dual purpose travel should not be compensable unless it is predominately for a purpose rather than predominately for a personal purpose with an incidental component 
in sum,because the legislature said so.but that answer begs the question whether the legislature really intended by section b a result that is certainly peculiar,if not perverse.confer travel at site would not have been excluded from the course and scope of his employment by the statute because b i and ii would both be satisfied i he would have been there even if he had not been going home,because of his business errand,and ii,he would not have been there but for the errand.yet to get to,he had to pass,where he would have been,even without a business purpose,because he was going home no matter what,and therefore condition ii would not have been met.
though the court of appeals answer to confer rhetorical question is unsatisfactory,its criticism of confer analysis has weight.dividing confer intended trip into a business segment followed by a personal segment does not leave him with a single,business purpose at point.however you slice it,when the accident occurred,confer had two concurrent purposes to run a business errand and to go home.if he had had no errand to run,he would still have made the same trip to the accident site on his way home,just as he usually did.thus,subsection b ii can not be satisfied by dissection.
and if it could,the court of appeals continued,there would be no need for the dual purpose rule at all.
s ection b would not exist.the statute would simply provide that if travel had any business purpose at all,it is in the course and scope of employment.there would not be a dual purpose rule because there would be no special treatment of dual purpose travel.dual purpose travel would,by definition,have a business purpose component and,therefore,would always be travel in the course and scope of employment 
this overstates the case.the dual purpose rule would still have application in the situations for which it was devised,cases like marks,davis,and jecker,where the employee was not headed home but to another destination,both on business and for pleasure.but the overstatement highlights what we think is the real problem the application of the dual purpose rule
