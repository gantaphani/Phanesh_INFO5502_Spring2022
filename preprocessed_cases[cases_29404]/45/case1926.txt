milton eichacker appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to paul revere insurance company.the district court found that eichacker could not meet the policy definition of disability because he did not receive a physician care for the condition causing his disability.eichacker argues that he did,in fact,receive the physician care necessary to entitle him to benefits.we find that whether or not eichacker met the physician care requirement is a disputed issue of fact that warrants a jury trial.accordingly,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for a jury trial on the question of whether eichacker met the policy definition of disability.
factual and procedural history 
milton eichacker is a lawyer who started his own law practice in las vegas,nevada.on february,he purchased a policy for individual disability insurance from the paul revere life insurance company.under the terms of the policy,eichacker could receive benefits if he suffered a total or residual disability.
a.the terms of paul revere insurance policy 
the policy defines total disability to require that,due to injury or sickness,the claimant is a unable to perform the important duties of his or her occupation,and b receiving a physician care the policy defines residual disability to require that the claimant is a unable to perform one or more of the important duties of his or her occupation,or unable to perform the important duties of his or her occupation for more than of the time normally required to perform them,and b receiving physician care.the policy defines physician care to mean the regular and personal care of a physician which is,under prevailing medical standards,appropriate for the condition causing the disability.
the policy requires that if a monthly premium payment is late,the insured has a grace period within which to make the payment.if the premium is not paid within this grace period,the policy lapses.the policy can still be reinstated without a new application if the premium is received days from the original due date.
the policy also provides that days after the claimant becomes disabled,all premiums are waived and the policy and benefits continue as if the premium had been paid.any premium paid during the days after the onset of the disability will be refunded.
the policy requires that written notice of a claim must be received within days after a covered loss starts,or as soon as is reasonably possible.
finally,the time of loss provision states that all losses must occur while your policy is in force.but,termination of your policy will not affect any claim for total disability that begins within days of the date of an injury causing such disability.
eichacker injury and disability 
on september,eichacker was an innocent bystander in a barroom brawl.when he attempted to stop the fighting,someone hurled a billiard ball at him.it hit him directly between the eyes,causing serious fractures and lacerations that required substantial reconstructive surgery.he received treatment from andres resto,a plastic and reconstructive surgeon,who operated on eichacker on september,and continued to see him regularly for over a year following the surgery.by november,resto stated that eichacker was sufficiently recovered from his facial surgery to return to his daily activities.at that point,eichacker attempted to return to work,but he encountered increasing difficulties in accomplishing even the most simple daily tasks.on september,resto referred him to a psychiatrist,robert peprah.
on september,peprah diagnosed eichacker with major depression.he found that eichacker had been depressed for the preceding nine months and had been completely paralyzed into inaction.his symptoms included sleep disturbance,impaired concentration and thinking ability,feelings of hopelessness,uncontrollable crying episodes,fear of leaving the house,and low energy.by september,his emotional state had become so debilitating that he closed his law office.over the next several months,his inability to function resulted in problems with the state bar,bankruptcy,and the eventual loss of his home.
c.the policy lapse 
meanwhile,on july,there were not sufficient funds in eichacker bank account for paul revere to withdraw his monthly premium.on july,paul revere informed him by letter that he had days from july to pay the premium,after which time his policy would lapse.the letter stated that if the policy lapsed,he would have another days to pay the premium and reinstate the policy without the need to.
eichacker sent in a check for the outstanding premium on september.according to the terms of the policy and the letter,this payment was days too late.paul revere returned the check,stating that a reinstatement application was required.
on april,eichacker submitted a claim for disability benefits to paul revere.they rejected his claim on march.the rejection letter explained that his policy had lapsed,he had delayed in submitting his claim,and he had further delayed in supplying them with requested information.
eichacker filed a complaint in federal district court in nevada.the complaint alleged breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and breach of statutory duties under nevada unfair insurance practices statute.paul revere moved for summary judgment on december,and the district court granted it on october.
ii.standard of review and applicable law 
we review the district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.liu amway,cir.in considering summary judgment,the threshold inquiry is whether there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.anderson liberty lobby,d.in making this determination,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.liu,at.
because this is a dispute over the interpretation of an insurance contract that comes to our court under diversity jurisdiction,our analysis is governed by nevada insurance law.if there are no nevada supreme court decisions directly on point,we must predict how the highest state court would decide the issue using intermediate appellate court decisions,decisions from other jurisdictions,statutes,treatises,and restatements as guidance.myers,city and county of san francisco,cir,quoting strother cal.permanente med.group,cir.we have previously noted that,where nevada law is lacking,its courts have looked to the law of other jurisdictions,particularly california,for guidance.mort united states,cir.accordingly,since there are no nevada supreme court rulings directly on point in this case,we will look to other jurisdictions,and particularly to california,to inform our analysis.
iii.discussion 
the district court found that,as a matter of law,eichacker could not qualify as disabled under the terms of the insurance policy because at no point prior to the policy lapse did he meet the physician care provision.this provision requires that the claimant receive the regular and personal care of a physician which,under prevailing medical standards,is appropriate for the condition causing the disability.the district court reasoned that eichacker disabling condition was depression,and yet he saw only resto,a plastic surgeon,while the policy was active.he did not begin seeing a physician for the condition causing his disability until september,over a month after his policy lapsed,when he had his first visit with peprah,a psychiatrist.the district court concluded that the undisputed facts demonstrate that plaintiff was not under a physician care as required under the total disability provisions of the policy.eichacker paul revere ins,no,slip op.at.october.
we disagree.eichacker has provided facts sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that he met the policy definition of total or residual disability,including the physician care requirement,prior to the lapse of his policy.
under the terms of the policy,if eichacker can show that he was totally or residually disabled for days after his injury on september,he is entitled to a waiver of further premium payments.this waiver would relieve him of respon
