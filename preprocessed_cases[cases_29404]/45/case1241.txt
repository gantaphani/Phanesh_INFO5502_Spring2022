this dispute arises from a fraudulent scheme perpetrated against first state bank of monticello causing a loss.james stilwell repeatedly exchanged bad checks for the bank money backed by the resources of the bank and as good as cash.the bank filed a claim for the loss with its insurer,ohio casualty insurance company,under a standard form financial institution bond.ohio casualty denied the claim and this lawsuit followed.the district court held the loss was covered and granted summary judgment in favor of first state bank.ohio casualty appealed the bank on the issue of its entitlement to prejudgment interest.
we affirm.stilwell scheme was a covered risk under insuring agreement b of the bond,which covers losses from theft or false pretenses occurring on the bank premises.the bank loss resulted directly from stilwell fraud and therefore came within the coverage specified in this provision of the bond.we also conclude that exclusion h,excluding losses caused by an employee,does not apply.finally,the bank tardy application for statutory prejudgment interest,first made in the district court in a motion to alter or amend the judgment under rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,was brought too late to entitle it to an award.
background 
for several months in and,james stilwell of atwood,illinois,carried on an extensive scheme of writing and cashing worthless checks.first state bank in nearby monticello was his victim.stilwell was a prominent entrepreneur who owned several businesses and some development property in central illinois,but he was also illiquid to acquire cash,stilwell devised a scheme whereby he or more commonly,one of his associates would draw checks on one of his accounts at tuscola national bank and tender them to first state bank in return for bank money orders,instruments backed by the resources of first state bank.but stilwell account at tuscola national bank was empty,or less than empty tuscola national bank allowed him to maintain negative balances for months at a time,returning some items and paying others that stilwell directed to be paid when he put funds into the account after the fact.so first state bank unwittingly allowed stilwell to exchange his worthless checks for the bank money orders,giving him access to immediately available funds.stilwell carried out this scheme for three months at the end of and into early,tendering checks daily to first state bank through january.over that time first state bank sold stilwell bank money orders for a total of.
cashing checks for noncustomers was against the bank policy stilwell had no accounts at first state bank,but when bank officers questioned stilwell about the transactions,he concocted a cover story that he was conducting a tax maneuver recommended by his accountant to reduce his tax liability on a future sale of land.on one occasion,to quell the doubts of a bank officer,stilwell dialed tuscola national bank automated banking system and handed the officer the phone,allowing her to listen to a statement of the current balance in what he claimed was.so while some at first state bank expressed concerns,others believed him,and the bank continued to accept his business based on his facade of being a successful businessman.the scheme collapsed on january,when tuscola national bank froze stilwell accounts.first state bank was left holding worthless checks totaling from the last three days of the scheme.
first state bank and stilwell entered into an agreement requiring stilwell to repay the bank in a series of installments and to admit that he had engaged in unlawful conduct.but stilwell died before fulfilling the terms of that agreement.first state bank filed a claim with its insurer,ohio casualty,after one of stilwell corporations filed for bankruptcy,preventing the bank from recovering its loss from the corporation.ohio casualty denied the bank claim,asserting that stilwell scheme was not covered under the bond fraud coverage insuring agreement b of the standard form financial institution bond or was excluded because it fell under exclusion h of the bond,which excluded losses caused by an employee.
first state bank then brought this lawsuit in state court,which ohio casualty removed to federal court based on the parties diverse citizenship.on for summary judgment,ohio casualty asserted several grounds for noncoverage.it claimed that the bank did not suffer a loss as that term is understood in the bond or if there was a loss,it did not result directly from stilwell conduct or if the loss was attributable to stilwell scheme,the failure of the bank employees to follow bank policy was an intervening and the predominant cause of the loss,removing coverage under exclusion h of the bond for losses caused by an employee.the district court rejected these arguments,granted first state bank motion,and awarded judgment to the bank.first state bank then moved to alter or amend the judgment under rule e,asking the court to clarify the amount of the award and to add statutory prejudgment interest.the district court agreed to clarify the award amount in the judgment amount of the loss less the deductible,but denied first state bank request to add prejudgment interest to the award.ohio casualty appealed the summary judgment,and first state bank the denial of its rule e motion for prejudgment interest.
