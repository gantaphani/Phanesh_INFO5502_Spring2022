for many years elizabeth black served as executive director of milwaukee world festival,mwf,the organization that operates summerfest,an annual music festival in milwaukee,wisconsin.as a benefit of her employment with mwf,black received disability insurance coverage under an insurance plan the plan that is underwritten and administered by standard insurance company.in august,black informed mwf president that she was disabled and could no longer work due to multiple aortic aneurysms and high blood pressure.she applied for disability benefits,but standard denied her claim and her later appeal.black filed this suit in the district court under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,see a b,and both parties moved for summary judgment.applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the district court affirmed standard denial of benefits.
black appeals,arguing,first,that we should review standard denial of benefits de novo and,second,that even under a deferential review,standard abused its discretion by ignoring evidence and unreasonably deferring to its own consulting physicians rather than black treating physicians.the plan language,however,unambiguously grants standard discretion in its benefits determinations.our review,therefore,is under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.because standard permissibly credited five consulting physicians who each concluded that black condition is not disabling,we conclude that standard decision is rationally supported by the record,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
at the age of,black was diagnosed with multiple aortic aneurysms,which are weakened and bulging areas in the aorta,the body main supplier of blood.see,aortic aneurysm.mayo.black underwent surgery at the cleveland clinic in march to repair aneurysms of the ascending aorta and aortic arch.her doctor recommended that she attempt to medically manage a third aneurysm,located in the descending aorta.black returned to work six weeks after surgery,and by the summer of,she had,by her own account,recovered well enough to run the festival to a record year.brian griffin of the cleveland clinic continued to monitor black remaining aneurysm,while her local cardiologist,david slosky,monitored her blood pressure and hypertension.
after summerfest,black sought a renewal of her employment contract for an additional term to begin after her contract expired on december.mwf,however,deferred consideration of black contract until.and by the end of the midst of contract relationships with her had become strained,and she accused them of harassment and verbal abuse.in december,black sent a letter to counsel for mwf,detailing her complaints and reiterating her desire for a new contract.in that letter black stated that she had a possibly illness that allowed her to be fully functional at this time,but which is reactive to stress,not the operational kind,but the unnecessary stress that comes from degrading,disparaging and harassing conduct.
black also solicited letters from her treating physicians for use in her contract negotiations.in a letter addressed to black attorney in november,griffin wrote that black has significant hypertensive problems it is vital that her blood pressure be well controlled.stress,particularly in the form of verbal abuse,is very deleterious for her blood pressure control.in a similar letter sent in december,slosky wrote that black has significant hypertension h er blood pressure is quite labile and reactive to stressful conditions.it is particularly sensitive to acute and direct confrontation the patient should not be subject to harassment of this kind.finally,eric maas,black treating neurologist,also wrote a letter,stating that any undue stress should be minimized given black medical history particularly with regard to hypertension and her vascular disease.he explained that black had been undergoing a great deal of stress stemming from her responsibilities as director of summerfest in milwaukee and her contract negotiations,and he requested that these factors be taken into account in planning these negotiations with elizabeth.
six months later,in july,the personnel committee of mwf board of directors voted not to renew black contract.on august,black initiated a disability claim with standard.in a letter to mwf board of directors,black stated that her medical condition prevented her from performing her duties as executive director,that her doctors had advised her that she was disabled and could no longer work,and that her condition had been aggravated by her job activities and stress.
in reviewing her claim,standard obtained medical records from black treating physicians,griffin and slosky,as well as her psychiatrist,michael deeken.griffin monitored black descending aorta biannually after her surgery in.black mri scans showed that immediately after surgery,her descending aorta measured cm in diameter.in may,the size had increased to cm but remained stable and unchanged as of september.griffin completed standard attending physician statement in which he reported that on september,he advised black to stop working because of her poor blood pressure control and severe stress.in a separate letter to standard,he wrote that given the nature of her current position she is unable to adequately maintain a normal blood pressure.he further stated that black should avoid any stressful managerial type position or work that requires her to be under media scrutiny or where she needs to meet time deadlines.
slosky saw black approximately once a year to monitor her blood pressure,and in august his records reflected that black reported no fatigue and her cardiac status was stable except for poorly controlled hypertension.in july,black again reported no fatigue and was asymptomatic,with a blood pressure reading reflecting mild hypertension.in july,one month before her disability claim,black blood pressure was normal she reported no fatigue and slosky concluded,f rom a cardiac standpoint,i feel that we finally achieved some stability,however,i have recommended that she make an attempt to further decrease the stress in her life,as that would help in decreasing the lability of her blood pressure.two months later,however,in a statement to standard,slosky wrote that black should cease working due to poor blood pressure control and the potential for aneurysm.deeken reported that he had been treating black since for generalized anxiety disorder,and as of february,black had a diagnosis of depressive disorder,which was in remission,and generalized anxiety disorder.
black also submitted evidence that the social security administration ssa had approved her application for disability benefits.the ssa found black disabled as of august,with a primary diagnosis of aortic aneurysm and a secondary diagnosis of anxiety disorders.black was also found disabled by the paul revere life insurance company,with which she had additional coverage.
after reviewing this evidence,standard denied black claim,finding that she did not meet the plan definition of disabled black filed an administrative appeal with standard,submitting additional evidence and claiming fatigue and psychological and cognitive impairment as additional grounds for disability.included in her additional evidence was a neuropsychological evaluation conducted in august by thomas hammeke,who found that black performed at an level in tests of intellectual and executive functioning but displayed mild skill deficits and concentration problems.that same month maas noted that black had reported recent memory problems.black also submitted letters from her family and friends stating that she had suffered extreme fatigue and cognitive impairment since her surgery in.finally,black presented an assessment by a vocational expert who concluded that,based on her physical limitations and the duties of her position,she could no longer perform her job.
standard consulted four board certified physicians and one board certified psychiatrist who each reviewed black medical records and other evidence submitted by both black and mwf.all five consulting physicians concluded that black medical condition did not prevent her from performing her job and that she is not disabled.theodore kleikamp,board certified in internal medicine,acknowledged that stress can impact blood pressure and negatively affect an aortic aneurysm.but,given black relative stability since,he concluded that it is not clear that the claimant blood pressure has been adversely affected by stress.
ronald fraback,board certified in internal medicine,concurred with this assessment but recommended that standard consult a cardiologist.accordingly,standard consulted with two cardiologists,kent williamson and storm floten.williamson,board certified in cardiology and a vascular surgeon,noted that a reduction in stress lowers the risk of an aneurysm rupture but concluded that black condition could be accommodated and managed with medication.he noted that black mri scans had not shown a significant change in the descending aortic diameter.williamson further observed that there is no solid evidence that blood pressures within the range recently reported by black are linked to an increased risk of rupture of thoracic aortic aneurysms such as black.floten,also board certified in cardiology and a thoracic surgeon,opined that black aneurysm had not been affected by the stress of her job,noting that the descending aorta has not enlarged significantly in the last three years.he concluded that black was not disabled.
finally,esther gwinnell,board certified in psychiatry,determined that black claim of fatigue and cognitive difficulties were not supported by her medical records.gwinnell specifically noted slosky records,which consistently show that black reported no recent fatigue.she also reviewed the neuropsychological testing by hammeke and noted that,for the most part,black tested in the normal to above normal range.
standard ultimately denied black claim on january.black appealed to the district court,where the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the plan motion and denied black.black now appeals to this court.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
our review of the district court ruling on the for summary judgment is de novo,and so,like the district court,we directly review standard determination.jenkins price waterhouse long term disability plan,cir.our review of an administrator erisa benefits determination is de novo unless the language of the plan gives the employee adequate notice of the administrator discretion to shape the application,interpretation,and content of the plan rules.firestone tire rubber bruch,d diaz prudential ins.of,cir.if that discretion is clear from the language of the plan,we will set aside an administrator decision only if it is arbitrary and capricious.see herzberger standard ins,cir.
black argues that the language of the plan fails to clearly convey standard discretionary authority.but we have previously reviewed the relevant provision of standard benefits and determined that the language unambiguously communicates the message that payment of benefits is subject to standard discretion.gutta standard select trust ins.plans,cir.in gutta,we noted that although standard plan does not use the word discretion,it uses a number of equivalent terms that convey its discretionary authority.see herzberger,at reiterating that no magic words are necessary to convey discretion.
nevertheless,black argues that we should reconsider our interpretation of standard plan in light of woods prudential insurance of america,cir,decided two weeks before gutta.in woods,the fourth circuit expressly aligned itself with this circuit precedent,emphasizing the need to distinguish between language that merely conveys the authority to administer the plan and that which conveys discretion.see woods,at citing herzberger,at.but woods provides no reason to overrule gutta,in which we also explicitly rejected the plaintiff argument that the plan merely conveys authority to standard.gutta,at.we explained that read as a whole,the plan clearly gives notice that standard has the discretion required to trigger the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.id.
additionally,black argues that even if the arbitrary and capricious standard applies,that review must be more rigorous given standard inherent conflict of interest as both the plan administrator and payor of benefits.black relies on the supreme court recent decision in metropolitan life insurance glenn,d,in which the court held that a plan administrator conflict of interest is just one of the many factors to be taken into consideration within the context of a deferential review.black contends that in so holding,the court required a change in the application of the scope of court review,and notes that the court cited citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,and universal camera nlrb,as support for this proposition.but the court cited those cases merely as examples in which it refrained from creating special rules and simply instructed reviewing courts to take a particular factor into account as part of the overall review.see glenn.at.moreover,we have already considered and rejected the argument that glenn requires a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard.see leger tribune.long term disability benefit plan,cir.as we explained then,we read glenn as an extension of the principle established in firestone,at,that an administrator conflict of interest must be weighed as a factor along with all other relevant factors.leger,at.while we must take its conflict of interest into account,standard remains entitled to the deference normally afforded under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see glenn.at.
benefit denial not arbitrary and capricious 
under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,we may overturn a benefit administrator decision only if the decision is downright unreasonable.mote aetna life ins,cir.although this standard is deferential,it is not a rubber stamp,and we will not uphold a denial if the administrator fails to provide specific reasons for rejecting evidence and denying the claim.williams aetna life ins,cir.in reviewing those reasons and the denial as a whole,however,we look only to ensure that the decision has rational support in the record.see speciale blue cross blue shield ass n,cir.
standard decision here is supported by the record.as standard explained to black in a letter denying her claim,five consulting physicians reviewed the medical records and statements from black treating physicians and,based on their reviews of the objective blood pressure readings and mri scans,determined that black condition was stable and had not been negatively impacted by the stress of her job.although she did have difficulty controlling her blood pressure,slosky records show that her blood pressure reading was normal and she had achieved cardiac stability just one month before she claimed disability.standard considered the reports of black treating physicians in the context of her employment history and concluded that those reports were designed to support black pursuit of another contract in and her disability claim in after the board voted not to renew her contract.black herself wrote in that,despite her medical condition,she remained fully functional and able to withstand the ordinary occupational stress of her position.finally,standard psychiatrist reviewed black medical records and found little objective support for her claims of fatigue and cognitive difficulties.this was sufficient rational support for standard denial of black claim.see leipzig aig life ins,cir holding that despite claimant stressful job and diagnosis of coronary artery disease,hypertension,and gout,insurer had presented rational basis for denying benefits based on physician reports that claimant was stable and asymptomatic.black contests this determination,arguing that standard unreasonably deferred to its own physicians,ignored her claims of fatigue and cognitive impairments,and disregarded her social security disability determination,which,she contends,requires us to place greater weight on standard inherent conflict of interest.we consider each argument in turn.
