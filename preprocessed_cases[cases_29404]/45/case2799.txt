this suit involves an insurer duty to defend a policyholder who claims there is a possibility of coverage in an underlying suit.the plaintiffs and policyholders in this case are watts industries,watts and james jones company jones,manufacturers of parts used in municipal water systems.in an underlying suit,various municipalities allege injury to their water systems and lead contamination of water flowing through the systems,resulting from substandard parts sold by watts and jones.during the years in which the parts were sold,watts and jones held commercial general liability cgl policies issued by defendant and respondent zurich american insurance company zurich.in the policies,and subject to various exclusions,zurich promised to defend and indemnify claims for damages resulting from property damage.
the issue in this case is whether there is a triable issue of fact as to the possibility of coverage based on allegations in the underlying complaint.zurich chief positions are there can be no damages based upon lead contamination of the water,because any contaminated water has been used and consumed,has left the water system,and can not be captured and purified the underlying complaint alleges no coverable damage to property other than to the substandard parts themselves and damage to the parts is excluded by a provision in the policy applicable to defective products,and any damage to other property resulting from the replacement of the parts is excluded by the impaired property provision.
we conclude that the underlying plaintiffs allegations of injury to their water raise a possibility of coverage sufficient to trigger a duty to defend that the claim that substandard parts containing hazardous materials were incorporated into their water systems also raises a possibility of covered property damage and that zurich has not shown that all damage is excluded by the impaired property exclusion.this,essentially,was the decision of the trial court,whose judgment we affirm.
factual and procedural summary 
for over a century,jones manufactured waterworks parts for municipal water systems.watts acquired jones in and owned all of jones corporate stock until roughly september,when it sold jones.from through and beyond,jones sold parts to various municipal water agencies and private contractors for use in municipal water systems.these parts contained greater amounts of lead or zinc,and lower amounts of copper,than contract specifications required.the municipal contracts called for parts made of metal,which is percent copper and percent each of tin,zinc,and lead.jones parts were made of metal with less copper and tin,more zinc and lead,or metal percent copper,percent zinc.
in june,nora armenta,a former jones employee,sued jones,watts,and jones subsequent owners in a qui tam action on behalf of various southern california municipalities.in a sealed complaint,she alleged that by selling substandard parts,the companies knowingly defrauded the municipalities and violated the false claims act,subds.a.in particular,she alleged that the jones parts wore out sooner than parts made of metal that the municipalities and their water customers had been harmed by increased lead exposure from jones metal parts,which contain percent more lead and that substandard jones parts would have to be dug up and replaced at more than sites.armenta claimed the cities had suffered and were exposed to substantial damages as a result.the complaint was unsealed and served on jones in march.armenta filed substantially similar amended complaints in november and september.
in november,the los angeles department of water and power dwp filed a complaint in intervention,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and unjust enrichment.dwp alleged that it might have to replace nearly jones parts to protect the water supply,health and welfare of dwp customers.it sought reimbursement of costs to replace all faulty jones parts,punitive damages,and civil penalties.thereafter,nearly other water districts and cities from across california joined the action.
in,in answer to interrogatories,several cities clarified the damages they claimed as the cost of replacement of the substandard jones parts including the cost of labor,materials,and appropriate replacement parts damages for diminished service life of the substandard parts damages for any decreased strength resulting from jones substitution of substandard metal for metal the cost of a lead education,lead monitoring program and indemnification for any lawsuits based upon the additional lead leached as a result of jones provision of substandard parts.subsequent complaints in intervention added claims for any additional sums the municipality may become obligated to pay in the future to any person arising out of the defendants conduct.
in april,watts tendered defense of the suit to zurich.zurich had sold cgl policies that covered watts and its subsidiaries from june to june.the policies contain standard form provisions under which zurich promised to pay sums that watts became legally obligated to pay as damages because of covered bodily injury or property damage,and to defend any suit seeking those damages.the policies define property damage as p hysical injury to tangible property or l oss of use of tangible property.along with purchasing standard cgl coverage,watts purchased operations hazard pcoh coverage.
the policies contain various standard coverage exclusions typically found in cgl policies.these exclude damage to the insured own product or work,damage to other property that was not physically injured but was rendered less useful due to defects in the insured products or work,and damages for product recalls caused by defects in the insured products or work.a separate endorsement excludes any cleanup costs and damages for bodily injury or property damage resulting from actual,alleged,or threatened discharge of pollutants.
zurich declined the tender of defense and denied any duty to defend or indemnify either company in connection with the armenta litigation.it concluded the complaint alleged damages that were purely economic,not due to bodily injury or property damage as defined in the policies,and hence that the damages were not covered.it also concluded that exclusions barred coverage.watts protested that the complaint raised numerous possibilities for coverage,including bodily injury and property damage,such as damage to pipes,water supply,of the state of california.zurich reiterated its argument that the complaint alleged no bodily injury or property damage,argued that it must render a coverage determination based upon facts and not on mere speculation as to injury or damage,and again denied any duty to defend or indemnify.
from early through early,watts kept zurich apprised of developments in the case and repeatedly insisted it was entitled to defense and indemnification.zurich continued to deny coverage.in february,watts and jones each sued zurich for breach of contract and bad faith denial of insurance benefits.the suits were later consolidated.watts sought a declaration that zurich was obligated to defend and indemnify,plus general and punitive damages.in its answer,zurich again denied coverage.
watts motion for summary adjudication as to zurich duty to defend was granted.the trial court noted that the parties disagreed as to legal interpretations of facts but not as to the facts themselves,and that zurich neither challenged watts evidence nor offered new or conflicting evidence.the court found that the underlying lawsuit sought damages for physical injury to municipal water and water system parts,including costs for investigation,correction,abatement,monitoring,and public education regarding lead contamination.these claims sought damages because of property damage under the policies,thus creating a potential for coverage which triggered zurich duty to defend watts.the court concluded that the exclusions zurich raised did not preclude cgl coverage,and that zurich had not shown that the exclusions applied to pcoh coverage or that the pcoh provisions are unambiguous.based on these findings,the court ordered zurich to reimburse watts and jones for incurred defense costs and pay further costs until the underlying suit was resolved.
after further proceedings to determine zurich payment obligation,in august,the trial court ordered zurich to pay past defense costs and interest.zurich filed this timely appeal.we denied watts motion to dismiss the appeal.we held that although the summary adjudication order on duty to defend normally would not be appealable by itself,the payment order is appealable.since the latter depends on the former,to review it,we must review both.as such,the summary adjudication and payment order together constitute a collateral final judgment that is appealable.
discussion 
summary adjudication is appropriate to dispose of an issue of duty.code civ,subd.f moore shaw th,fn,d.since a motion for summary adjudication involves pure questions of law,we review a ruling on the motion de novo.we consider all uncontradicted evidence and all indisputable inferences reasonably drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party.intrieri superior court th,d.
this case raises various legal issues regarding interpretation of insurance contracts.we begin with a reiteration of some basic rules governing the interpretation of insurance policies and the insurer duty to defend.
when determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and a duty to defend,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.contract interpretation is governed by the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed,which is inferred solely from the written provisions of the contract if possible,aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu.we construe insurance policy terms in their ordinary and popular sense,unless the contracting parties applied special or technical meanings to particular terms,aiu,at.in this case,the policy language is generally standard for the insurance industry,and there is no indication that policy provisions at issue here were actually negotiated,jointly drafted,or intended to have special or technical meanings.we therefore do not depart from the ordinary principles of interpretation.see aiu,at.
a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against third party claims that create a potential for indemnity.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose.since an insurer must defend suits which potentially seek damages within the policy coverage,including suits in which ultimately no damages are awarded or no coverage is found,the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.armstrong world industries,aetna casualty surety th,d armstrong.the defense duty arises on tender of defense by the insured,and lasts until the underlying lawsuit is concluded or the insurer shows that there is no potential for coverage.montrose,at,d.to make this showing,the insurer must establish that the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.id.at,d,quoting gray zurich insurance cal d,fn.
the insured and the insurer bear sharply differing burdens in an action regarding the duty to defend.to prevail,the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage,while the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.in other words,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.montrose,supra,cal th.at,d.any doubt as to whether the duty exists is resolved in the insured favor.id.at,d.california courts are consistently solicitous of insureds expectations that their insurers will defend them as promised.id.at,d.
an insurer duty to defend depends not upon the ultimate adjudication of policy coverage,but upon facts the insurer knew at the inception of the underlying lawsuit.montrose,supra,cal th.at,d.a duty determination usually involves comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.ibid.but because modern pleading rules liberally allow amendment,any extrinsic facts known from any source can trigger a duty to defend,even if the complaint does not facially indicate a potential for coverage.ibid armstrong,supra,th at,fn,d.t he third party plaintiff can not be the arbiter of coverage.montrose,at,d.
with these general rules in mind,we turn to zurich arguments that their policies afforded no coverage.
zurich argues the underlying suit does not involve allegations of damages because of property damage with regard to alleged lead contamination of water in the municipal water systems,because the remedies sought are merely prophylactic.
the underlying complaint alleges,the municipalities and their water customers have been damaged because jones parts made of metal contain more dangerous lead than permitted by contract specifications.that increased exposure is exacerbated by the fact that parts from jones foundry were generally and often included even more lead than the permitted for metal.the complaint thus alleges that municipal water customers already have been harmed by increased lead exposure from jones parts,and implicitly,that the parts already are leaching lead into the municipal water supplies.
the merit of zurich argument depends on whether there is any possibility that under these allegations,watts and jones could become legally obligated to pay any sums as damages because of property damage covered by the policies we follow the careful reasoning of the california supreme court in aiu,supra,cal d,which analyzed basic cgl coverage in a case which arose in the context of an analogous set of facts and procedural posture.id.at.
legally obligated and damages are not defined in the policies,but the supreme court gives a broad construction to both terms.the term legally obligated covers not only traditional legal damages,but also injunctive relief and recovery of government response costs to clean up environmental pollution.aiu,supra,cal d at.similarly,courts interpret damages according to its ordinary and popular definition a monetary payment recovered by a party for loss or detriment it has suffered through the acts of another.id.at.injunction and response costs are treated in the same way as traditional damages for coverage purposes.id.at.costs incurred strictly for prophylactic purposes are neither incurred because of property damage nor covered by cgl policies.but remedies which involve remedial or mitigative action constitute covered damages.id.at.
in requesting costs for replacement of jones parts and for water quality monitoring,the municipalities seek monetary payments due to alleged harm caused by watts and jones.whether these payments are viewed as traditional damages or as reimbursement of government response costs,they constitute damages under aiu.since the municipalities allege that lead contamination is ongoing,the requested remedies are necessarily at least partly remedial and mitigative,rather than entirely prophylactic,for they address harm which is already occurring,not just harm that might occur.see aiu,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court also gives a broad construction to the phrase because of property damage.environmental contamination constitutes property damage for coverage purposes.aiu,supra,cal d at.even unclaimed surface and groundwater is state property that may be damaged by pollution or contamination.id.at,fn,see also,port of portland water quality ins.syndicate cir,port of portland.and though a government primary motive in requiring environmental remediation or mitigation is to protect public health rather than a proprietary interest,if the event precipitating the government legal action is contamination of property,the resulting costs are incurred because of property damage.aiu,at.this is true regardless of who owns the property.id.at.
zurich does not dispute that the municipalities hold property interests in the water they distribute and sell from their water systems.by alleging this water is contaminated with lead,the municipalities have claimed covered property damage under aiu.although a major reason for their request for parts replacements and water monitoring is to protect the public health,the resulting costs are incurred because of property damage.see aiu,supra,cal d at.as such,the municipalities seek sums watts and jones would be legally obligated to pay because of property damage.this raises the possibility of coverage under the cgl provisions in the policies.
zurich argues that contamination of water only can be treated as covered property damage in cases involving real rather than imagined claims for the cleanup of existing in situ contamination of water bodies rather than measures taken to forestall future damage.it contends that the underlying plaintiffs make no claim for of the water supply allegedly contaminated by leaching lead,and that there can be no such claim because the underlying municipal plaintiffs have distributed and sold in accordance with their regular practices every drop of water that has been run past a watts product.as such,unlike water contamination cases involving cleanup of an oil spill in a river,there is simply no claim here seeking damages for injury to or even loss of use of water.zurich also argues that the remedies sought by the municipalities,particularly removal of the substandard jones parts,are nothing more than purely prophylactic measures,not covered under a cgl policy.
this complicated argument avoids analysis of several of its underlying premises.first,far from being merely an imagined or hypothetical claim,the municipalities claim is that increased leaching of lead caused by faulty jones parts already has caused,and is still causing,serious and harm to their water.this is no more imaginary,hypothetical,or futuristic than a claim for the cost to clean up an oil spill in a river.second,no evidence is cited or found to support zurich conclusory assertion that all contaminated water has been distributed and sold,and is therefore gone from the water systems.and even if contaminated water has left the system,it was replaced by other water.there is nothing in the record to establish that lead already leached has left the system and hence ceased to contaminate system water.
third,zurich cites no authority to support its argument that coverage for water contamination can exist only if the contaminated water is impounded in a contained area where it can be cleaned up,nor the implicit related assumption that an oil spill into a flowing river port of portland,supra,at,or seepage of toxic chemicals into an underground aquifer aiu,supra,cal d at,are situations totally unlike contamination of municipal water systems.in this case,as in aiu,the provisions at issue here do not specify that coverage hinges on the nature or location of property damage.we therefore construe them to encompass damages because of property damage in general id.at.
nor are the remedies sought purely prophylactic,as zurich contends.in aiu,the court defined prophylactic costs as those incurred to pay for measures taken in advance of any release of toxic materials.aiu,supra,cal d at.preventing releases that have not yet occurred or caused harm is different from stopping releases that already are occurring and causing harm.the former is prophylactic the latter is remedial or mitigative and results in costs that constitute covered damages.see id.at.here,the municipalities allege harmful ongoing lead leaching.to stop that ongoing release is not mere prophylaxis.
in a similar argument,zurich contends that because the municipalities sold and distributed the water,even if the water is contaminated there could be no legally cognizable damages on that account.zurich implicitly argues that a proper claim could be presented only if the municipalities were unable to sell water,or if they faced immediate,direct financial losses or lawsuits by customers alleging bodily injury.as we have seen,the supreme court construction of the key coverage terms is much broader.any existing environmental contamination constitutes sufficient property damage,and the cost to address that contamination,including the cost of injunctions or government responsive actions,may constitute covered damages.aiu,supra,cal d at,see also armstrong,supra,th at,d.the municipalities allegations are sufficient to meet that standard.zurich cites no contrary authority.
zurich also contends that remediation and mitigation should be narrowly defined to include only actual cleanup of contaminated water.again,no authority is cited to support this narrow definition.by standard dictionary definition,remediation is action taken to correct or supply a remedy for a problem,while mitigation is action taken to make a problem less severe or intense.see,american heritage dict.college ed.removal of the jones parts would stop the alleged ongoing leaching of lead into the municipal water.it fits within a reasonable definition of both remediation and mitigation,even though it does not involve impounding and purifying water already contaminated 
in sum,zurich does not deny that municipal water might have been contaminated with excess lead from jones parts,but treats the matter as having no legal significance.but the allegations are that the,and is,damaged in such a way as to require costly action to address ongoing harm.zurich urges us to view the damaged property here as discrete batches of water which do not count because they leave the water systems soon after they become contaminated.but this flow analysis also cuts in the other direction,for even as some contaminated water is leaving the system,other water is becoming contaminated.see santa clarita water lyons d.water is not stationary and it may be replenished from its source unlike other natural deposits.water becomes personal property when it is appropriated and placed in a container ibid,including artificial watercourses or conduits through which water flows.parks canal and hoyt cal,wl kidd laird cal.an appropriator owns all the water in such a container as an entire corpus or body.lindblom round valley water cal,parks canal,supra,at d water.
since a municipal water system is a conduit through which water flows continuously,as zurich acknowledges,the municipality owns all the water in its system at any one time as an entire body.see lewis scazighini.according to the complaint,at any one time,a portion of the total water in the system is becoming contaminated.thus at any one time,the municipality water,as a whole,is damaged.under the language of the policies,we find the allegation of lead contamination of water is sufficient to raise a possibility of coverage,and that zurich has not shown coverage to be impossible.
zurich argues the underlying suit does not involve allegations of damages because of property damage to any property other than the jones parts,since the underlying plaintiffs do not claim physical injury to other parts of the municipal water systems.
as with the preceding discussion,we must determine whether the underlying allegations raise any possibility that watts and jones could become legally obligated to pay damages because of covered property damage.although here we consider damage to property other than water,the allegations of hazardous lead leaching remain part of the equation.
as we have seen,standard cgl policies such as those in this case define property damage as p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property and l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.see f h construction itt hartford ins.th,d f h.courts applying standard cgl policy language generally agree that the incorporation of a defective component or product into a larger structure or system does not constitute physical injury to tangible property,unless and until the defective component physically injures some other tangible part of the larger system or the system as a whole.id.at,d.in other words,the mere presence of a defective part causing no immediate harm does not produce physical injury.ibid.
however,where products or work containing hazardous materials have been incorporated into other products or structures,courts have found immediate harm and physical injury to other property
