in this qui tam action,the united states of america,through its relator irvin willard willard,appeals from the judgment of the district court,pursuant to.b and b,dismissing the second amended complaint filed against humana health plan of texas,and humana,humana alleging humana violated the false claims act,et fca.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
humana,through its subsidiary humana health plan of texas,operates health maintenance organizations in various counties in texas.humana entered into contracts with the health care financing administration hcfa of the united states department of health and human services to provide health care services to medicare beneficiaries.humana is paid a fixed rate for each enrollee,determined annually,based on the average anticipated medicare expenses of all individuals in a given geographic area,generally on a basis.these rates are referred to as capitation rates.
willard worked as a sales representative for humana from through,selling humana medicare hmo products.during this time,humana operated an hmo for medicare beneficiaries in a houston service area comprised of harris,austin,colorado,fayette,and waller counties.harris county encompasses the metropolitan houston area,while the other counties are comprised of more rural areas.
an hmo under contract with the hcfa may not discriminate in enrollment on the basis of health,or on any other basis used as a proxy for health.see i a iv b.willard contends that,fairly read,its second amended complaint alleges that humana engaged in a cherrypicking scheme whereby less healthy potential program participants and those living in counties outside humana favored geographic area were methodically discouraged from joining humana hmo.willard alleged in his complaint that humana adopted a variety of techniques to prevent eligible participants from learning they can join humana hmos.willard further alleged that he was told that humana only wanted to insure healthy people,and would lose money if it enrolled sick people or people who lived too far from humana established providers.willard asserts that when he persisted in soliciting and enrolling people from the outlying counties,he was warned not to do so,and was ultimately fired.
willard contends that in order for humana to gain entry into the lucrative houston market,hcfa required that humana serve the outlying counties.in his complaint,willard alleged that w ithout revealing its intentions to either relators or hcfa,humana texas entered into contracts to serve those counties with no intention of actually enrolling medicare participants there.
in may willard filed a qui tam complaint under the fca against humana and other hmos.the government elected not to intervene.thereafter,in may willard filed his first amended complaint and humana filed a motion to dismiss willard first amended complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b,and challenged the constitutionality of the fca qui tam provision.on august,judge kent stayed the case pending this court en banc decision in riley luke episcopal hospital,cir en banc,in which this court upheld the constitutionality of the fca qui tam provision.at a july status conference following the riley decision,humana reasserted its request for willard to plead fraud with specificity.judge kent granted willard leave to amend his complaint and allowed humana to reassert its grounds for dismissal.willard filed his second amended complaint later in july.
on july,the case was transferred to judge lake.humana filed a renewed motion to dismiss willard second amended complaint pursuant to.b and b and willard moved for partial summary judgment.judge lake granted the motion to dismiss and denied the motion for summary judgment as moot.willard appeals the district court grant of the motion to dismiss,as well as the district court denial of leave to amend his complaint.

ii.dismissal of willard claims 
willard second amended complaint alleges that humana violated a and a.section states in relevant part 
any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government or a member of the armed forces of the united states a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government 
is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty 
willard contends that humana engaged in a cherrypicking scheme which violates the fca in three distinct ways.first,willard argues that because humana is paid based on the average expenses for all individuals,covering both healthy and sick beneficiaries,humana effectively overcharged the government for medicare services by cherrypicking which beneficiaries it would target for enrollment.secondly,willard claims that by seeking payment under the medicare program,humana falsely represented impliedly certified compliance with all material terms,statutes,and regulations central to the medicare hmo program.finally,willard argues that humana procured its contract with the hcfa by fraud in the inducement because humana never intended to provide services in the outlying counties.
iii.overcharging theory of liability 
willard argues that when humana receives payment at the capitation rate for healthier enrollees,this rate includes compensation for providing services to those individuals,as well as a premium to offset anticipated costs it expects to incur from providing services to less healthy persons.willard contends that by not providing services to less healthy persons under its cherrypicking scheme,humana is effectively overcharging the government in violation of the fca.
humana persuasively argues that any alleged discrimination by way of a cherrypicking scheme must occur within the population for which uniform rates have been set.humana asserts,and willard agrees,that the rates in this case are determined on a basis.therefore,willard must allege discrimination based on health status within a single county,not discrepancies in enrollment patterns among different counties,in order to establish that humana overcharged medicare.as such,willard overcharging theory of liability must fail because willard has not alleged discrimination based on health status within any particular county,rate area.
as humana capitation reimbursement rates were adjusted to each county,the district court properly concluded that humana accrued no unwarranted benefit and the government no loss by virtue of humana enrolling more beneficiaries in some counties than others.the district court also properly concluded that it was undisputed that all claims submitted by humana were valid.moreover,the district court found that humana contract with the government did not obligate it to take affirmative steps to enroll beneficiaries in all counties.perhaps most importantly,the trial court correctly found 
willard has also failed to state a cause of action under a.under section a,the plaintiff must identify both a false claim and a false record or statement made or used to get that false claim paid.thompson healthcare,at cir.as explained above,willard has not identified a false claim.moreover,willard has not identified any other document or statement used to get an allegedly false claim paid.
the false claims act does not create liability merely for a health care provider disregard of government regulations or improper internal policies unless,as a result of such acts,the provider knowingly asks the government to pay amounts it does not owe.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir the statute attaches liability,not to the underlying fraudulent activity or to the government wrongful payment,but to the claim for payment.therefore,a central question in false claims act cases is whether the defendant ever presented a false or fraudulent claim to the government.quoting united states rivera,cir.
because willard does not allege that any of the claims were false in the sense that they contained false statements or were for services not performed or the like,willard must resort to either the implied certification or fraud in the inducement theories of liability through which it may be possible to demonstrate that otherwise valid claims are actionable under the fca.
iv.implied certification theory of liability 
in order to receive payment,humana submits enrollment lists to hcfa identifying the persons enrolled in its hmo program for any given month.willard does not allege that those enrollment lists were literally false,in that they requested payment for individuals not enrolled or not eligible for enrollment.rather,willard argues that by requesting payment,humana has impliedly represented to the government that it has complied with applicable statutes and regulations central to performance of humana contract with hcfa,as well as the terms of the contract.willard further argues that by requesting payment,humana impliedly represented that the government received everything it had contracted and bargained for.as there was no express certification of compliance,willard contends that humana made an implied certification of compliance which the government relied upon.
this court has recognized that services rendered in violation of a statute do not necessarily constitute false or fraudulent claims under the fca.thompson healthcare,cir.this court,however,has also recognized that the fca interdicts material misrepresentations made to qualify for government privileges or services.id.quoting united states ex rel.weinberger equifax,cir.while this circuit has decided cases dealing with fca liability based on express certifications of compliance with various statutes and regulations,we have not specifically addressed whether fca liability can be based on an implied certification theory.
willard relies on the tenth circuit decision in shaw aaa engineering drafting,cir,to support recognition of fca liability based on an implied certification theory.the defendant in shaw had contracted to perform photography services for the government.id.at.under the contract,the defendant was required to dispose of certain chemicals used in the contracted for film processing in accordance with environmental guidelines and standards.id.at.the united states,appearing as amicus curiae,argued that by submitting monthly invoices for the photography services,the defendant 
impliedly certified that it had complied with the silver recovery environmental compliance provisions in the contract because the defendant was being paid not only for photography services but also for environmental compliance,its false implied certification of compliance with the contract silver recovery requirement gives rise to liability under the fca.id.at.
the tenth circuit embraced the implied certification theory of fca liability,noting that it is consistent with the legislative history of the amendments to the fca and supported by the language and structure of the fca itself.id.at.the district court found shaw unpersuasive,stating that 
although the court used the phrase implied certification,the court did not create or recognize a new or expanded cause of action under the false claims act.implied certification amounts to nothing more than an alternative expression of the idea that billing the government for something not delivered may constitute a false claim.if the government defines its bargain in a manner that requires adherence to a statute or regulation,compliance with that statute or regulation is implied by virtue of a request for payment.as with a claim brought under the theory of express certification,there can be no liability based upon an implied certification unless compliance is a condition for payment.citations omitted.
as the district court explained,t he tenth circuit held that submission of the invoices constituted a false claim because the payment requested was for both photography services and for silver recovery activities,but the silver recovery had not been performed.thus,the critical point is that an action on which payment was conditioned had not been performed.other circuits that have recognized the implied certification theory have also set forth this requirement.see united states ex rel.augustine century health,cir adopting the implied certification theory,explaining that fca liability can attach if the claimant violates its continuing duty to comply with the regulations on which payment is conditioned mikes straus,cir concluding that implied false certification is appropriately applied only when the underlying statute or regulation expressly states the provider must comply in order to be paid united states ex rel.siewick jamieson science eng g,holding that courts will infer certification from silence,but only where certification was a prerequisite to the government action sought.
this court need not determine here whether it will recognize the implied certification theory,because even if assuming for the sake of argument we were to apply such a theory here,willard would still lack a cognizable claim for two reasons.first,willard has failed to allege facts that would show that hcfa conditioned its payment to humana on any implied certification of compliance with the regulations.
it is clear that compliance with the regulations willard alleges humana violated was not a condition of payment under the contract.if humana engaged in any practice that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or discouraging enrollment based on health status,the government is merely authorized to suspend future enrollment,suspend future payments,or impose monetary penalties,rather than withhold payment for those already enrolled.see i.see also united states southland management,cir.moreover,willard does not allege that the regulations concerning discrimination based on health status and income were referenced in the contract.a review of the standard contract with medicare hmo providers submitted by willard indicates that neither i or b were mentioned in the contract,let alone their compliance certified as a condition for payment,despite the fact that compliance with numerous other regulations,some of which are specific to health care providers and others of which relate to labor more generally,was incorporated either within the contract itself or in its appendix.
second,willard has not alleged facts sufficient to reflect that there was any regulatory violation.willard does not allege that humana turned away less healthy people or discouraged less healthy medicare eligible people per se from participating in the program.under i,civil penalties may be imposed if a medicare contracting hmo engages in any practice that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying or discouraging enrollment by eligible individuals whose medical condition or history indicates a need for substantial future medical service.however,while willard alleges that humana supervisors stated,as a matter of fact,that the company does not profit by insuring the sick,willard does not allege that humana in fact implemented a policy or practice of actually discouraging less healthy individuals from enrolling or actually turning them away.the complaint never alleg
