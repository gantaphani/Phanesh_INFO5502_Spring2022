plaintiff insurance services,appeals the trial court granting of summary judgment in favor of defendant prudential insurance company of america.for the reasons expressed below,we vacate the trial court summary judgment and remand to that court for consideration of conversion and claims.
background 
in july,prudential appointed as a special agent,authorized to write and sell prudential property and casualty insurance on december,prudential gave notice that it was terminating this agency relationship on december.immediately protested prudential failure to provide it six months written notice of termination and continued renewal payments as mandated by the texas insurance code.see,a b.in a letter dated december,prudential acknowledged its unique relationship with and agreed to comply with article.accordingly,the termination date was extended to june,and prudential continued paying renewal commissions through december.
in february,prudential began notifying clients insured by prudential about the nonrenewal and offering replacement polices with other carriers.complained to prudential about this contact with its clients,and prudential agreed to stop soliciting these clients.
on june,sued prudential in texas state court for fraud,misrepresentation,conversion,and tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual relations.prudential removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds.central to claims was the theory that prudential stole its book of business,thereby allowing it to contact and steal customers.
on february,the trial court granted prudential summary judgment on all claims.it concluded that had not introduced facts to support its fraud and misrepresentation claims,and that prudential owned the book of business,thus rendering conversion and tortious interference impossible.filed a timely appeal from this final judgment to this court.in an unpublished opinion,we affirmed the granting of summary judgment on fraud and misrepresentation claims.however,we reversed the judgment on the conversion and claims because we concluded that the question of ownership of the book of business is a contested factual issue.accordingly,we vacated that part of the summary judgment and remanded those claims to the trial court.
on january,prudential filed a motion for panel rehearing,urging that regardless of who owned the book of property and casualty insurance,the tortious interference and conversion claims fail as a matter of law.we denied the motion without comment.
on remand,prudential filed a second motion for summary judgment,asserting,as it had in its motion for rehearing,that ownership of the book of business was irrelevant because received all relief that the texas insurance code authorizes terminated insurance receive for claims that relate to the termination of the relationship with prudential or that relate to the book of business.
on august,the trial court again granted prudential summary judgment on conversion and claims.the court acknowledged our opinion that a fact issue existed about ownership of the book of business.but the court agreed with prudential assertion that this ownership issue was immaterial.timely appealed the trial court granting of this second summary judgment to this court.
ii.the parties contentions 
argues that,because this court already reversed the trial court first granting of summary judgment on conversion and tortious interference claims,the trial court was barred by the law of the case doctrine from revisiting these issues in its second summary judgment order.in the alternative,argues that the trial court erred by concluding that the texas insurance code termination provisions preempt its conversion and tortious interference claims.finally,argues that summary judgment was improper because prudential failed to conclusively establish the elements of its affirmative defenses of privilege and justification.
prudential,on the other hand,argues that the law of the case doctrine does not apply here because no prior ruling exists on the issues the trial court decided in the second summary judgment.moreover,prudential contends that summary judgment was proper because it conclusively negated elements of conversion and claims.and,finally,prudential contends that it conclusively established all the elements of its affirmative defenses.
iii.the law of the case doctrine 
the law of the case doctrine,as formulated in this circuit,generally precludes reexamination of issues of law or fact decided on appeal,either by the district court on remand or by the appellate court itself on a subsequent appeal.todd shipyards auto,cir.as we have noted,it is premised on the salutary and sound public policy that litigation should come to an end.terrell household goods carriers bureau,cir quoting white murtha,cir.
the doctrine reach does have its limits.for example,unlike res judicata,the law of the case doctrine applies only to issues that were actually decided,rather than all questions in the case that might have been decided,but were not.morrow dillard,cir.but,the issues need not have been explicitly decided the doctrine also applies to those issues decided by necessary implication.in re felt,cir.in other words,even when issues have not been expressly addressed in a prior decision,if those matters were fully briefed to the appellate court and necessary predicates to the court ability to address the issue or issues specifically discussed,those issues are deemed to have been decided tacitly or implicitly,and their disposition is law of the case.id.
with these premises in mind,we turn to whether the trial court second summary judgment was an erroneous revisiting of issues already decided by this court in prior appeal.in its first order,the trial court specifically noted that its granting summary judgment on conversion and claims was predicated on its conclusion that prudential owned the book of business.
on appeal of that first summary judgment to this court,argued that a genuine issue of material fact existed about the ownership of the book of business.in part,it reasoned that prudential admission that article of the texas insurance code applied to its relationship with was important because article only applies if the book of business 
in response,the vast majority of prudential brief was dedicated to the argument that its contract with unambiguously granted it ownership of the book of business.it also argued that its compliance with article was voluntary,not mandatory,because article does not apply if it owns the book of business.only two sentences of prudential brief were dedicated to the alternative argument that ownership of the book was irrelevant because even if had owned the book of business,it received all that it was legally entitled to receive under the law and can not be heard to complain.
this court opinion reversing the first summary judgment on the conversion and claims also focused solely on the trial court finding that prudential owned the book of business.and we characterized the parties arguments as limited to this issue 
alleges that prudential converted book of business and tortiously interfered with contracts with its own clients.
prudential counters that it owns the book of business and therefore can not have converted its own property or tortiously interfered with its own contracts.
because we concluded that the question of ownership of the book of business is a contested fact issue,we vacated the trial court judgment as to conversion and claims.
in prudential motion for panel rehearing,it focused for the first time on the argument that ownership of the book of business was irrelevant.specifically,it asserted that it had conclusively established that,regardless of who owned the book of business,its actions were privileged and justified,could not establish its conversion claim,and was paid all it was due under the texas insurance code.and,for the first time on rehearing,prudential argued that the rights of a terminated agency derive solely from statutorily created obligations under the texas insurance code.in other words,prudential contended that could only claim damages under article,and,because prudent
