this case presents the question whether a shipper,who directs the loading of a truck on its premises and is to that extent a user of the truck,is also a borrower of the truck,and therefore an insured under the provisions of the trucking company insurance policy.we conclude the shipper did not exercise the requisite dominion and control over the truck to qualify as a borrower under the terms of the policy.
factual and procedural background 
this lawsuit has its origin in an accident that occurred on the premises of the city of los angeles city.truck driver brian haygood,who was employed by msm trucking,was injured when he fell off an during the weighing of his truck after it had been loaded with biosolids treated sewage at the city terminal island treatment facility.after haygood sued the city,the city sought a defense and indemnity from msm trucking insurers,allianz insurance company,fireman fund insurance company and national surety corporation the insurers refused to defend the city,taking the position that the motor vehicle liability policy issued to msm trucking did not provide coverage to the city for the injury haygood suffered as msm employee while his truck was being loaded on city property.the city was found liable for haygood injuries.
the city then sued the insurers,and a single issued was bifurcated and tried to the court.the issue tried was whether,under the terms of msm insurance contract,the city was a borrower of msm truck when haygood was injured.msm insurance contract covered payment of 
all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.
in addition to msm,the insureds covered by the policy included,by virtue of an exclusion from an exception to coverage,msm 
employees,partners,a lessee or borrower or any of their employees,while moving property to or from a covered auto.
thus,if the city was a borrower of the truck during the loading process,it was an insured under msm policy and was entitled to coverage for haygood injuries.
at trial,counsel stipulated to undisputed facts,and two and an msm management.the facts found by the trial court,in summary,were these.san joaquin composting,sjc entered into a written contract to purchase biosolids from the city.the contract required sjc to haul the biosolids away from the city terminal island treatment plant.sjc was an independent contractor,responsible under the contract for operating its equipment,including positioning the equipment under the loading chutes.the contract included protections against spilling once the vehicle left city property,and specified sealing features on the vehicle,tarping of the vehicle,and inspection of the loaded vehicle before it left the city property.the city provided sjc with detailed loading and weighing procedures that any vehicle operator was required to know before coming onto the city property to pick up a biosolids load.the city maintained the pickup site and provided the loading chutes,scales,weighing office,and gates on the premises.
sjc hired msm as a trucker to remove the biosolids from the city property and transport them to sjc depot.on the day of the accident,haygood drove a rig,or truck,onto the city property to receive a load of biosolids.the trial court described the ensuing procedures 
haygood,while on the city property,followed the instructions of the city employees as to the route along which he should drive the truck and as to how the should be positioned to receive the load.in particular,during the,the trailer had to be situated so that the biosolids could be dumped into the trailer and the trailer had to be weighed both empty and full,so the load weight could be documented.the loaded trailer had to be inspected by the city before it departed to insure that the load would not spill on the highway.the city employees directed haygood in these operations but they did not operate nor physically enter the.haywood was injured when he left his cab so the vehicle could be weighed and fell from an structure on the scale.
the trial court further found that 
t he driver was not authorized to leave after taking on a load until the city had provided the driver with the load weight paperwork and had inspected the vehicle for cleanliness and adequate tarping to prevent load spillage.the vehicle,however,entered the city premises in furtherance of msm own commercial purposes,that is,in the performance of its hauling contract with san joaquin composting.
the trial court analyzed the applicable precedents and concluded that the issue whether,under the terms of a trucker insurance policy,a landowner has borrowed a vehicle hired for work on its premises turns on a factual determination whether the landowner was so involved in the operation that he took over the control of the truck while it was on his property.on this point,the court found that 
the city,with respect to directing haygood procedures during the operation,did not exercise such dominion and control of msm truck that the city can be said,within the meaning of msm insurance policy,to have borrowed haygood truck.haygood maintained control over his truck at all times during the operation,merely following direction from city employees as to how he should position his truck and submitting to the weighing and inspection procedures that were in the contract between the city and san joaquin composting,the party that directed msm truck to the city terminal.
the court concluded the city was not a borrower of msm truck and therefore was not covered under msm policy.
judgment was entered for the insurers on march,and the city filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
the sole question in this case is whether the city was a borrower of msm truck.the trial court correctly determined this question in the negative 
although the insurance policy does not define borrower,the supreme court has provided some guidance in a case involving similar policy language.that case referred to a definition of a borrower as someone who,with the permission of the owner,has temporary possession and use of the property for his own purposes possession connotes the right to exercise dominion and control.home indemnity king cal d,home indemnity,citing liberty mut.ins.am.emp.ins.home indemnity concluded a forklift operator who was loading a trailer did not exercise the requisite dominion and control over the truck and trailer to be a borrower under the terms of the policy.home indemnity,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.accordingly,one point is beyond dispute the exercise of dominion and control over the truck is indispensable to a finding that the city was a borrower of msm truck under the terms of the insurance policy.
we find no flaw in the trial court determination that the city did not exercise such dominion and control of msm truck that it can be said to have borrowed the truck.this conclusion is supported by both case precedents and public policy as enunciated by the supreme court.we discuss the cases in the context of the arguments raised by the city.
the city contends it was a user of the truck under the controlling case law,which holds that use of a vehicle includes its loading and unloading,home indemnity,supra,cal d at.from this principle,which is correct,the city posits that it is difficult to use a truck one does not own unless one has borrowed or hired it,and that the same facts establishing the city was a user of the control over the loading establish it was a borrower of the truck.we do not think so,for several reasons.
first,the city initial premise is incorrect.one can load or therefore use a truck one does not own and has not borrowed or hired that much is plain from home indemnity,supra,cal d,in which the supreme court concluded the forklift operator hired to load a trailer was not a borrower,although he was necessarily a user.because t here was no evidence that he either moved the rig or had express authority to do so,or that forklift operators generally had authority with respect to vehicles being loaded or unloaded,the forklift operator did not exercise the requisite dominion and control over the tr
