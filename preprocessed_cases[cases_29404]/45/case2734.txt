plaintiff doheny park terrace homeowners association,doheny park,appeals from the trial court order dismissing its first amended complaint.the defendant,truck insurance exchange truck had demurred to doheny park pleading and the trial court sustained that demurrer without leave to amend.the trial court concluded that doheny park had not filed its action within the contractual limitation period specified in truck policy,or during the revival period established by code of civil procedure,section.in addition,doheny park had failed to plead facts sufficient to establish a basis for application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel precluding truck from asserting a limitations defense.
we have reviewed the record,including doheny park first amended complaint,and concur with the trial court that doheny park did not timely file its action,either within the original period or during the statutory revivor.we disagree,however,that it failed to plead sufficient facts to raise the bar of equitable estoppel.we will,therefore,reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
doheny park is a condominium association involving units located in the city of beverly hills,california.its property was damaged by the northridge earthquake on january.on that date,doheny park was insured by truck and the policy included coverage for earthquake damage,subject to a deductible.before the end of january,doheny park submitted claims for damage to truck.
after conducting an inspection of the damage to the doheny park property,truck concluded that such damage was in the sum of.this amount was less than the deductible in truck policy,so doheny park claim was denied 
doheny park took no further action with respect to its claim until february.at that time,it met with its counsel who recommended retention of an expert.following that expert inspection of the property,doheny park learned that the damage caused by the northridge earthquake was more extensive and,in fact,exceeded the amount of the policy deductible.in april,doheny park commenced this action against truck alleging four causes of action breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and violation of business and professions code,section 
truck filed a demurrer to the complaint alleging that the action was untimely more than eight years had elapsed from the date that doheny park had sustained damage until the time that it filed suit.the trial court held that doheny park action had not been timely filed and,in any event,code of civil procedure,section precluded any action by doheny park after december.truck demurrer was sustained with leave to amend and,on or about october,doheny park filed its first amended complaint,the operative pleading herein.
truck again demurred,arguing that the applicable limitations period had run and that doheny park had not pled sufficient facts to justify either its delay in filing the action,or the application of the doctrines of delayed discovery,equitable tolling or equitable estoppel which would preclude truck from successfully asserting a limitations defense.the trial court sustained truck demurrer,this time without leave to amend.the court held that section set an absolute deadline for doheny park action of december,and contained no provision for delayed discovery see fn,ante.it concluded that the only way doheny park could allege a viable claim was to set forth sufficient facts demonstrating that truck was equitably estopped under the principles set out in vu prudential property casualty ins.cal th,d,vu.after reviewing the new allegations submitted by doheny park,the court concluded that they again fall short.
thereafter,on february,an order of dismissal was entered and filed.doheny park has prosecuted this timely appeal.
contentions of the parties 
doheny park principal contention is that the allegations of the first amended complaint sufficiently set forth a basis for applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel as articulated by the supreme court in vu.it also urges that it is not bound by the limitation of the revival window opened by section and that its knowledge of the rationale for,or the passage of,that statute did not trigger any duty of inquiry.doheny park further urges that it is entitled to the benefit of the delayed discovery rule because,due to misrepresentations and concealment by truck,it did not reasonably discover the full extent of its damage until february.it also asserts the related argument that the limitation period was equitably tolled because truck never unequivocally denied doheny park claim in writing as required under the principles set out in com.insurance superior court cal d.finally,doheny park argues that the trial court improperly denied it an opportunity to file a second amended complaint so as to add certain additional allegations 
truck asserts that none of these arguments justifies a reversal of the order of dismissal.the policy provided for a limitation period from the date that doheny park discovered or should have discovered damage from the northridge earthquake.doheny park waited over eight years after it sustained damage,and over a year after the revival deadline set out in section before filing its action.truck argues that doheny park is relying on nothing but conclusionary and argumentative allegations to justify this extraordinary delay.truck also argues that,in any event,section establishes an absolute deadline december,for the pursuit of any claim arising from the northridge earthquake doheny park can not avoid that deadline by reliance on either the equitable estoppel or delayed discovery doctrines.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the appellate court decides de novo whether the complaint sets forth facts sufficient to state a cause of action.hoffman state farm fire casualty th,d.the court looks to the face of the complaint and treats the demurrer as admitting all the material facts alleged.blank kirwan cal d.however,the appellate court does not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.moore regents of university of california cal d.it is only necessary for a plaintiff to plead ultimate facts.perkins superior court d.
doheny park policy imposed a contractual limitation period that commenced to run on the date of the northridge earthquake and its delayed discovery argument fails 
the ordinary statute of limitations for breach of a written contract is four years from the date of the breach.when the contract is a policy of insurance,a homeowners policy and the insured has a property damage claim,there is a contractual limitation period imposed by the terms of the policy.in the case of fire policies,the limitation period is one year,as dictated by insurance code,section setting out the terms that must be included in the standard form fire policy such a shortened limitation period has long been recognized as valid in california,supra,cal d at.
under insurance code,section,the limitation period commences to run from the inception of the loss.that term has been construed to mean that point in time when appreciable damage occurs and is or should be known to the insured,such that a reasonable insured would be aware that his notification duty,the duty to notify the insurer of a covered loss under the policy has been triggered,supra,cal d at.
this rule applies even in the case of a single catastrophic event.kapsimallis allstate ins.th,d the analysis in is fully applicable to cases involving cataclysmic damage such as the northridge earthquake and precludes determining inception of the loss solely by the date of the occurrence of the physical event causing the loss.determining when appreciable damage occurs such that a reasonable insured would be on notice of a potentially insured loss is a factual matter for the trier of fact the insurer has the burden of proving those allegations by a preponderance of the evidence,supra,cal d at.thus when appreciable damage has occurred is an issue that is difficult to resolve on summary judgment.san jose crane rigging,lexington ins.d.
this principle,established by,constitutes a delayed discovery rule.its application,however,is subject to several conditions.t he insured is required to be diligent in the face of discovered facts.the more substantial or unusual the nature of the damage discovered by the insured,the greater its deviation from what a reasonable person would consider normal wear and tear,the greater the insureds duty to notify his insurer of the loss promptly and diligently.citation,supra,cal d at.once any damage becomes reasonably apparent the time begins to run,even if the full extent of the damage is unknown.the inception of the loss occurs when the insured should have known that appreciable damage had occurred,not when the homeowner learned the true extent of the damage.campanelli allstate life ins.cir,italics in original applying.law.in addition,the occurrence of appreciable damage does not depend upon discovery that the damage constitutes a covered loss under an policy,the inception of the loss is not delayed until the insured learns from an attorney that the damage might be covered.larkspur isle condominium owners farmers ins.group th,d see also lawrence western mutual ins.d.it is the occurrence of some cognizable event rather than the knowledge of its legal significance that starts the running of time to sue.
two examples will illustrate the point.in magnolia square homeowners safeco ins.d,the insured became aware in of possible structural defects in its property and sued the developer accordingly.it was not until,however,that the insured experts opened up certain walls and verified the structural problems.in,the insured sued its insurer under an property policy.the suit was barred because the policy required suit within one year after the loss occurs.id.at.the insured may not have known the full extent of the problem in when it sued the developer,but it knew enough that it should have conducted further investigation to determine the scope of the structural problem.id.at.
in sullivan allstate ins,the insureds made no claim for damage to their home after the northridge earthquake because they thought the repair costs would be less than the deductible.they left the home unrepaired for more than a year,during which time the house began to leak,exacerbating the earthquake damage.when they discovered it would cost to repair the damage,they submitted a claim to their insurer.the court held that the claim was barred under the policy suit limitation because the insureds were aware of appreciable damage from the outset even though they underestimated its cost.it was not a progressive loss merely because they allowed their property to deteriorate.id.at.
these cases articulate principles that dispose of doheny park delayed discovery argument.by its own allegations,it knew that sufficient damage had been done to warrant notification of the damage to truck.that started the running of the period in which to commence an action against truck.admittedly,doheny park did not file any action during that period nor as we discuss below during the revivor period established by section.
the running of the contractual limitations period was not equitably tolled 
as discussed above,the contractual limitations period commences to run upon the inception of loss.the running of this period,however,may be tolled during the period that the claim is being considered by the insurer.put another way,the limitations period will be tolled from the time the insured files a timely notice pursuant to policy notice provisions,to the time the insurer formally denies the claim in writing,supra,cal d at,italics added.this rule is justified on the ground that it would be unconscionable to permit the limitations period to run while the insured is pursing its rights in the claim process,as required by the policy,at,hayward,tilton rolapp ins.associates,th,d.
the tolling period ends,however,upon the insurer unconditional denial of the insured claim in writing,supra,cal d at,hayward,tilton rolapp ins.associates,supra,th at,d.it does not matter that the insurer act of denial does not specifically use that word.migliore ins.th,d the failure of the insurer to actually use the words deny or denial will not render the denial unequivocal,nor will the failure to mention the time limit for filing suit.once an insurer has unequivocally denied a claim,there is no justification for further tolling.thus,the insured request for reconsideration of the claim will not extend the time to sue.singh allstate ins.th,d.
doheny park claims that the running of the limitations period should be equitably tolled because truck never sent it a formal written unequivocal letter of denial.this exalts form over substance.truck specifically,and unequivocally,advised doheny park in writing that the amount of damage was less than its deductible.that obviously meant that there was,in truck view,nothing due under the policy.that,in practical effect,was a specific unequivocal denial sufficient to satisfy the test set out in,supra,cal d at.in addition,doheny park appears to have conceded the point.first,it certainly treated truck action as a firm denial for eight years.second,and more importantly,in its first amended complaint,it alleges that a t no time between truck denial of the insurance claim and january did plaintiff learn,or believe,that truck had misled plaintiff italics added.we see no basis for application of any equitable tolling of the running of the limitations period in the truck policy.
equitable estoppel may bar insurer from raising a limitations defense 
equitable estoppel differs from equitable tolling in distinct and important ways.they each arise under different circumstances,and have different rationales and different predicates.battuello battuello th,d.equitable estoppel does not extend a limitations period but rather comes into play only after the limitations period has run and addresses itself to the circumstances in which a party will be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to an admittedly untimely action because his conduct has induced another into forbearing suit within the applicable limitations period.id.at,d.unlike the doctrine of equitable tolling,which takes its life from the statute of limitations itself,the doctrine of equitable estoppel takes its life from the equitable principle that no man will be permitted to profit from his own wrongdoing in a court of justice.id.at,d.
the battuello court was construing and applying section providing for a limitation on a suit on causes of action which existed against a decedent at the time of death.that section specifically provided that the period shall not be tolled or extended for any reason except as provided in the statute.battuello held that this language precluded the application of any tolling of the limitations period,but did not bar the plaintiff from relying on the doctrine of equitable estoppel.battuello battuello,supra,th at,d.
battuello reasoning was cited with approval in lantzy centex homes cal th,d,lantzy,where the supreme court reached a similar conclusion with respect to section the absolute limitations period applicable in latent construction defect cases.lantzy noted that section did not mention either equitable tolling or equitable estoppel,but nevertheless concluded that the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling to the statutory limitations period would contravene the legislative purpose id.at,d,of providing repose to potential defendants after the already lengthy period during which they were exposed to suit.id.at,d.the court further held,however,that this same legislative purpose would not be contravened by allowing the plaintiffs to plead the doctrine of equitable estoppel in response to defendant statute of limitations defense.id.at,d.
in california,an insurer may be estopped to assert a policy provision limiting the time to sue where it has caused the insured to delay filing suit until after the expiration of the time period.in vu,an insurance adjuster inspected damage caused by the northridge earthquake damage to the insured home and told him incorrectly that the amount of damage was less than the deductible provided for in the policy.twenty months later,the insured discovered structural damage far exceeding the deductible and promptly submitted a claim which the insurer rejected as untimely.the supreme court,in answering a question certified to it by the ninth circuit court of appeals,held that the insurer may be estopped from asserting the time limitation as a defense if the insured had reasonably relied on the adjuster representation as to the amount of damage.this is a factual issue and would depend on such questions as the insured own knowledge and expertise regarding the amount of damage,the insured diligence in ascertaining the extent of damage,whether the adjuster was qualified and,if not,whether the insured was aware of such lack of qualification,what the insured told the adjuster about the damage,what led the insured to suspect that the damage was greater than the deductible,and so forth.vu,supra,cal th at,d.an estoppel may arise although there was no designed fraud on the part of the person sought to be estopped to create an equitable estoppel,it is enough if the party has been induced to refrain from using such means or taking such action as lay in his power,by which he might have retrieved his position and saved himself from loss.where the delay in commencing action is induced by the conduct of the defendant it can not be availed of by him as a defense.id.at,d.
in another case,following initial repairs of earthquake damage,the insurer adjuster told the insureds that all earthquake damage had been repaired.in reliance on that representation,the insureds allowed the limitations period to expire without conducting any further investigation.it was held that the insurer was estopped from asserting the limitation as a bar to claims for damage.ward allstate ins,applying.law cited with approval in vu,supra,cal th at,d.as the ward court stated,a fter the plaintiffs had submitted a timely claim to allstate,they relied on the representations of sanchez,a purported expert and agent of allstate,that their damage was limited to approximately.for this reason,the plaintiffs allowed the limitations period to elapse without conducting a further investigation.this is precisely the type of situation contemplated by the estoppel doctrine.allstate can not be allowed to lull the plaintiffs into sleeping on their rights,and then use the limitations period as a sword to cut down their claims.id.at.
there is one additional basis for application of the estoppel doctrine under california law.insurers are required by the relevant regulations issued by the commissioner of insurance to notify a claimant of any applicable time limits that might apply to the claim.unless it can be shown that the claimant in fact had actual knowledge of it,the insurer may be estopped to assert any time limit as to which the required notification was not given.see spray,gould bowers associated internat.ins.th,d neufeld balboa ins.th,d.
section conditionally revived certain northridge earthquake claims for a period but such statutory revivor does not preclude application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel 
in,the legislature enacted section see fn,ante in response to compelling reports of rampant mishandling of northridge earthquake insurance claims by insurers,and the unavailability of relief from the former administration of the department of insurance.century ins.superior court th,d century.section revived,for a period ending december,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired id.at,fn,d.put simply,section reopen ed the filing window,for a period,to those otherwise viable cases that had become time barred.rosenblum safeco ins.th,d.
there is no dispute that doheny park was a claimant who had contacted an insurer regarding its claim prior to january,and its claim was barred by the expiration of the limitation period in truck policy.thus,doheny park was a claimant entitled to the benefit of the revivor provisions of section.
truck does not argue otherwise,but urges that since doheny park admittedly did not file this action until april,section is of no assistance to it.we agree.but truck goes further and contends that section also operates to preclude,as a matter of law,doheny park reliance upon the doctrine of equitable estoppel.essentially,truck argument is that section supplemented or superseded the application of equitable estoppel to the northridge earthquake claims.in truck view,section amounts to an adequate legal remedy that is reflected in a comprehensive statutory scheme.see pacific scene,peñasquitos,cal d,equitable relief can not be intruded in matters that are plain ly and fully covered by positive statute.even though neither section,nor its legislative history,mentions the doctrine of equitable estoppel,it is truck view that by its enactment of section,the legislature intended to bar the assertion of equitable estoppel.section was,according to truck,intended to be the one final and complete remedy for all unpaid or underpaid northridge earthquake claims and,once the revival period had passed,all such claims were forever foreclosed.with this part of truck argument,we disagree.
this issue was directly reached by our colleagues in division of this district in cordova century ins.th,d cordova the cordova court addressed and expressly rejected the contention that the legislature had any intent at all,in enacting section,to bar an insured reliance upon the doctrine of equitable estoppel.the court noted,with emphasis,that there is not one word mentioned with respect to that doctrine in either the statute or its legislative history.id.at,d.
as the cordova court put it,c learly the legislature intended to put a lid on the statutory revival of claims but neither we nor century have found one sentence in the legislative history suggesting this lid was intended to exclude equitable remedies for those who for some legitimate reason could not bring their claims within this period.indeed it is the legislature expressive silence which most convinces us it did not intend section to supplant the doctrine of equitable estoppel with respect to claims for damages arising from the northridge earthquake.cordova,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
the cordova court emphasized that the legislature may or may not have been aware of the then pending vu litigation but most certainly it was aware of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.if by enacting section the legislature intended to take away a remedy which has existed for hundreds of years one would expect to see discussion of such a step in the legislative history.but there is not a word in the legislative record about the doctrine of equitable estoppel it is not our role to speak for the legislature when the legislature has kept silent.our conclusion section does not replace the doctrine of equitable estoppel is further supported by other extrinsic aids to statutory interpretation including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.fn.omitted.in enacting section the legislature object was to alleviate a broad and significant problem caused by the insurers conduct to help thousands of policyholders who were misled by the insurers into waiving their right to make claims in a timely manner.fn.omitted.the evil to be remedied was the insurance companies rampant mishandling of northridge claims,their systematic program of misleading their policyholders,and their refus al to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become.fn.omitted.the public policy reflected in the legislation was to enforce the insurance companies fiduciary duties to their policyholders fn.omitted and to advance the public interest in protecting insureds mistreated by their insurers at a time when the insureds were most vulnerable.fn.omitted.the statutory scheme of which section is a part is the regulation of insurance policies including the time for bringing suit under the policy as set forth in insurance code section.we have found no extrinsic evidence suggesting section was intended to bar any new claims for earthquake damage after december.
finally,we are not won over by century argument that after the passage of a reasonable length of time legislatively determined in section to be eight years insurers should be free from the burden of disruptive and protracted liability and able to plan their affairs with a degree of certainty it is unreasonable to expose insurers to liability on claims made,or years after the northridge earthquake.this argument was impliedly rejected in lantzy centex homes supra,cal th at,d,in which the court held the doctrine of equitable estoppel permits a plaintiff to bring an action for construction defects after the expiration of the absolute statute of limitations on such claims.fn.omitted.
t he burden of a late claim falls more heavily on the insured than the insurer.the insured first has to overcome the statute of limitations by producing evidence which would equitably estop the insurer from asserting the limitations period.this means proving the insurer was apprised of the facts it intended its conduct be relied upon by the insured the insured was ignorant of the true facts and the insured reasonably relied on the insurer conduct to her injury.fn.omitted.if the insured clears this hurdle she must also be able to prove the damage she is claiming was caused by the quake and not some other event.for these reasons we reject century contention applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel to the remaining northridge earthquake cases will expose insurers to unknown but significant liability.but as to those insureds who can establish the requisite grounds for estoppel,fairness and equity require the risk of loss be shifted from the innocent policyholder to the insurance company whose wrongful conduct induced the policyholder to postpone bringing suit.otherwise the courts wind up rewarding the insurer wrongdoing.even more disturbing,the biggest rewards would go to the insurance companies which best hid the truth from their insureds.accordingly,we hold section does not prevent cordova from contending century is estopped from defending her action on the ground the statute of limitations in insurance code section has expired.cordova,supra,th at,d.
for all of the reasons articulated in cordova,we disagree with truck fundamental premise,that section constituted or was intended to be,a comprehensive statutory scheme enacted to finally conclude all unresolved northridge earthquake claims.by its own terms and,as its legislative history confirms,it had a much narrower purpose.as we said in rosenblum safeco ins,supra,th,d,section simply reopen ed the filing window,for a period,to those otherwise viable cases that had become time barred.id.at,d italics omitted.we agree with the cordova court conclusion that the legislature did not intend,by the enactment of section,to in any way affect a potential assertion of an equitable estoppel argument under vu.
we,therefore,reject truck argument that the passage of section and doheny park failure to file its action by december,is fatal,as a matter of law,to its contention as to the application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.this leaves us with the issue upon which this appeal turns.has doheny park alleged,in its first amended complaint,sufficient facts to justify application of that doctrine we now turn to a more detailed examination of the allegations of that pleading in order to answer this pivotal question.
the allegations of the first amended complaint state sufficient facts to warrant application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel 
as already indicated,this case reaches us upon demurrer.we must therefore accept as true all well pled factual allegations,although not those that are conclusionary or argumentative moore regents of university of california,supra,cal d at.we focus on those allegations of doheny park first amended complaint upon which it bases its claim for application of equitable estoppel.
in the claims of plaintiff portion of its complaint which was incorporated by reference in each of the relevant separate causes of action,doheny park alleged that its property did suffer some damage from the january,earthquake and then alleged as follows 
doheny park was run by a volunteer board of directors that did not believe that the cost to repair the covered earthquake damage exceeded the policy deductible.it made a claim and entrusted truck with the building inspection in compliance with its policy of insurance and in furtherance of its duty to doheny park.though doheny park did not believe at the time the claim was reported that the cost to repair the damage would exceed the policy deductible,it believed that it had been diligent and that reporting a possible claim to truck,whom it trusted to inspect its property,was in furtherance of that diligence.
in truck representative inspected doheny park property and evaluated the earthquake damage.truck represented that it was an expert in the adjustment of property loss and valuation of property damages.it informed doheny park in writing that it determined that the cost to repair the covered earthquake caused damages at the condominium complex was.this repair estimate was a misrepresentation,though doheny park at the time had no reason to believe that truck was misrepresenting the cost of repair.
truck representation that the earthquake damages were and below the policy limits deductible was,in fact,false.truck intentionally misled doheny park by making this representation.truck also failed to fully and properly inspect the property but led doheny park to believe that the property was properly and fully inspected.in fact,the earthquake damage to doheny park buildings exceeded the policy deductible and may exceed the policy limits for the coverage to buildings.
doheny park reasonably relied on truck representation that the earthquake damage to the property was below the deductible.truck representation that the cost to repair the earthquake damage was,was consistent with doheny park uneducated estimate of the cost to repair the earthquake damage.it takes a trained expert to determine the cost to repair earthquake damage.no one on the board of directors had training to assess property damage and no one on the board knew or had reason to believe that truck analysis of the cost to repair the earthquake damage was wrong.doheny park knew of no facts which were inconsistent with the repair estimate of.the damage that doheny park witnessed at its building,some cracks around windows,appeared to the uneducated eye to be superficial and insubstantial.not being experts in the adjustment of property losses,and not having an independent expert opinion,doheny park trusted truck representation of the cost to repair.had it known that truck had a practice of underestimating the cost to repair earthquake damaged buildings in an effort to preclude claims payments,doheny park would not have relied on truck estimate.by reporting the existence of what it believed to be minor earthquake damage,and by having truck inspect and estimate the repair cost of the earthquake damage,doheny park was diligent in using the means at its command to ascertain the truth.unfortunately,truck was not truthful.doheny park,a organization run by volunteers,did not hire experts to verify truck factual assertions because it had no reason to believe that truck was misrepresenting any facts.had doheny park known that truck could not be trusted,that truck looked out for its own interests above the interests of its policyholders,and that it had a pattern and practice of misrepresenting the amount of earthquake damage to insureds,then doheny park would not have relied on truck representation as to the cost to repair the condominium complex.in reliance on truck representation,doheny park did not hire professionals to inspect the property to determine the true cost to repair the earthquake caused damage.at no time between truck denial of the insurance claim and january did doheny park learn,or believe,that truck had misled doheny park about the extent of earthquake damage and the cost to repair such damage.doheny park was not aware at any time that earthquake damage could be hidden in the walls and that such damage was ignored by truck or that truck knew of the existence of the hidden damage but failed to inform doheny park of its existence.while doheny park did learn of the passage of section prior to december,it had no reason to believe that truck had misrepresented any facts doheny park believed,at the time,that it could depend on truck.it did not know that as of december truck has paid over a hundred million dollars in settling commercial earthquake bad faith lawsuits arising from truck misrepresentations to policyholders that had earthquake damage.doheny park remained ignorant of the falsity of truck representation until february,when it learned from a professional that the earthquake caused damage to the property exceeded the policy deductible.
the foregoing allegations,which are no less specific than those found to be sufficient in battuello battuello,supra,th at,d,are what doheny park relies on in claiming that it has sufficiently pled a basis for the application of equitable estoppel.truck argues that the allegations are not sufficiently specific.they do not,truck asserts,show why doheny park waited until february before it hired a professional to inspect its property.such delay demonstrates,in truck view,that doheny park claims of ignorance and reliance on truck alleged misrepresentations were neither justifiable nor reasonable.
the problem with truck argument is that we are reviewing a demurrer,not a summary judgment.we must accept as true doheny park factual allegations.we do not agree that they are mere conclusions.doheny park was only required to plead ultimate facts and it has done so.whether it can produce at trial,or in response to a motion for summary judgment,evidence that will in fact support all or any of those allegations,including a legally justifiable defense of its delay,is another matter.careau security pacific business credit,d.the critical question raised by truck demurrer is whether doheny park allegations demonstrate a reasonable basis for its delay in filing suit.the issue of the insured diligence is,under the principles articulated by the supreme court vu,supra,cal th at,d,a factual question.such diligence or its absence is one of the factual questions that will determine whether there was reasonable reliance by doheny park on truck alleged representations.however doheny park alleged claims might test the limits of our credulity if we were sitting as a trier of fact,we can not say that its alleged explanation for the delay,as a matter of law,precludes a finding of reasonable reliance.
settled principles of law support our conclusion.in order to plead a cause of action,the complaint must contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action,in ordinary and concise language,subd.a.while it is true that pleading conclusions of law does not fulfill this requirement,it has long been recognized that t he distinction between conclusions of law and ultimate facts is not at all clear and involves at most a matter of degree.citations.for example,the courts have permitted allegations which obviously included conclusions of law and have termed them ultimate facts or conclusions of fact.citations.what is important is that the complaint as a whole contain sufficient facts to apprise the defendant of the basis upon which the plaintiff is seeking relief.citations.perkins superior court,supra,d at.italics added.it has been consistently held that a plaintiff is required only to set forth the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint a defendant with the nature,source and extent of his cause of action.citation.if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action,it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.citations.the particularity required in pleading facts depends on the extent to which the defendant in fairness needs detailed information that can be conveniently provided by the plaintiff less particularity is required where the defendant may be assumed to have knowledge of the facts equal to that possessed by the plaintiff.citation.there is no need to require specificity in the pleadings because modern discovery procedures necessarily affect the amount of detail that should be required in a pleading.citation.ludgate ins.lockheed martin th,d.this fair notice test is clearly satisfied here.
in spray,gould bowers associated internat.ins.th,d,we recited the four factors generally required in order to establish a basis for equitable estoppel the party to be estopped must know the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had the right to believe that it was so intended the party asserting the estoppel must be ignorant of the true state of facts and,he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.id.at,d.the allegations we have quoted above at length,when read as a whole,plead ultimate facts supporting each of these elements.doheny park has sufficiently set forth the circumstances from which the estoppel arises.see in re marriage of hanley d.no more is required.
we conclude that while both the original and revived limitations periods have expired,doheny park has alleged sufficient facts for application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.whatever difficulty it may or may not have in proving such allegations at trial,it is enough to survive truck demurrer.we will therefore remand the matter for further proceedings on this issue.
disposition 
the order of dismissal is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed herein.doheny park shall recover its costs on appeal.
the action filed by doheny park had also named as defendants,farmers group,farmers insurance exchange,truck underwriters association and insurance company.none of these other insurer defendants,however,are parties to this appeal.
as this case comes to us following the sustaining of a demurrer,the relevant facts that we recite are those set forth in doheny park first amended complaint,which we must accept as true.in light of the fact that doheny park appeal turns upon the sufficiency of its allegations,we consider them in greater detail in the discussion part of this opinion.
this is a conclusion with which doheny park does not agree.it argues that truck never formally denied its claim and thus it remains open.as we discuss below,that argument is without merit.
we do not discuss this last alleged cause of action,as doheny park voluntarily dismissed it prior to the entry of the order of dismissal that is the subject of this appeal.
it appears that truck policy which was attached as an exhibit to doheny park complaint provided for a contractual limitations period.
