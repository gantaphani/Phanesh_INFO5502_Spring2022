background 
detroit water team entered into a contract with the city of detroit to renovate the city water plant.in connection with that project,detroit water team procured two insurance policies a commercial general liability policy issued by american national,which covered detroit water team and one of its subcontractors,adamo demolition company and a builder risk policy issued by agricultural,which covered detroit water team,all of its subcontractors and other identified parties.
the water plant renovation project called for demolition of a portion of an old reservoir.detroit water team hired adamo,a demolition subcontractor,to perform this demolition work.connected to one wall of the reservoir was a manhole structure.the reservoir and the manhole structure shared one common wall that was made of concrete the rest of the manhole structure was made of masonry.the manhole structure contained an electrical system comprised of live wires,feeds and tubes,which provided power and air to the functioning water plant.the city and detroit water team agreed that this electrical system,along with the manhole structure that housed it,would remain entirely intact throughout the renovation project so that the water plant could continue to operate during that time.nevertheless,in the course of demolishing the reservoir,adamo also tore down the concrete wall that the reservoir shared with the manhole,which caused the entire manhole structure to collapse and the electrical system within to sustain considerable damage.
detroit water team immediately repaired the damaged electrical system and notified american national and agricultural of its expenses after both insurers denied coverage,this lawsuit ensued and all parties moved for summary judgment.the district court held that coverage was available under the american national commercial general liability policy,but not under the agricultural builder risk policy.american national appeals the award of summary judgment in favor of detroit water team,and detroit water team appeals the award of summary judgment in favor of agricultural.

american national policy 
our analysis of whether coverage is available under the american national policy the policy insuring agreement,which provides that american national will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.the district court held that detroit water team was not legally obligated to repair the electrical system,but the lack of michigan cases on the michigan supreme court would nevertheless require american national to prove that it suffered prejudice as a result of detroit water team actions in order to bar coverage.finding that american national had failed to demonstrate any prejudice,the district court held that coverage was not barred.for the following reasons,we hold that the district court was correct in determining that detroit water team was not legally obligated to repair the electrical system,but incorrect in predicting that the michigan supreme court would require american national to prove that it suffered prejudice in order to bar coverage on that ground.
it is that an insured has the initial burden of proving that its losses fall within the scope of the policy insuring agreement.see,esicorp,liberty mut.ins,cir data specialties,transcont l ins,cir.thus,detroit water team has the burden of proving that it was legally obligated to pay the sums that it incurred in repairing the damaged electrical system.the phrase legally obligated necessitates more than inchoate or potential liability.aetna cas.sur.dow chem,d,citing ryan royal ins.of,cir.although the michigan supreme court has never expressly defined the phrase legally obligated,decisions from the michigan court of appeals imply but do not expressly hold that the term legal obligation requires either a judicial determination of liability or a settlement between the insurer,insured and the claimant coil anodizers,wolverine ins,citing giffels home ins,macdonald state farm mut.auto.ins.in this case,it is undisputed that there has been no judicial determination or settlement establishing detroit water team liability.
detroit water team argues that its legal obligation to repair the electrical system derives from two sources general tort principles and its contract with the city.we disagree on both fronts.in an effort to establish tort liability,detroit water team argues that t here is a well settled princip le in michigan,as well as other jurisdictions,that a duty of ordinary care arises from the performance of a contractual obligation.chamberlain bissell.detroit water team contends that,by virtue of its contract with the city,it had a contractual obligation to exercise ordinary care to protect the city property from damage resulting from detroit water team demolition activities,and that detroit water team negligent performance of that contractual obligation was actionable in tort.detroit water team br.at.
detroit water team argument misconstrues the identity of the negligent party,if any,in this case.as the parties have stipulated,it was adamo,not detroit water team,whose demolition activities proximately caused the damage to the electrical system.there is no evidence that detroit water team has committed any negligence whatsoever.detroit water team apparently assumes that it is liable for adamo negligence,but the general rule under michigan law is that a general contractor is not liable for the negligence of its subcontractor.candelaria contractors.while several exceptions to this general rule exist,detroit water team has not argued that any apply here,and our independent review of the record confirms that none of the exceptions applies under the facts of this case.therefore,detroit water team has failed to carry its burden of proving that it was legally obligated in tort to repair the electrical system.
detroit water team also argues that it was legally obligated to make the repairs by virtue of its contract with the city,which required it to take immediate action to restore any interrupted service within hours there is some dispute as to whether contractual liability,as opposed to tort liability,can ever constitute a legal obligat ion within the meaning of the policy insuring agreement.compare lee russ thomas segalla,couch in insurance ed.while the phrase legal liability includes liability assumed by contract,the phrases liability imposed by law,and legally obligated to pay as damages do not,and hartford accident indem.reale,the purpose of a commercial general liability policy is to provide coverage for tort liability for physical damage to other
