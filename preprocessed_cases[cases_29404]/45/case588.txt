opinion of the court 
in april,the ship boom on a vessel owned by transportes ferreos de venezuela ii ca tfv collapsed.tfv sued edc,the boom designer and supplier,and in august,the parties settled.as part of the settlement,edc agreed to the entry of a million judgment against it,in favor of tfv.tfv agreed not to execute this judgment,and in exchange,edc assigned its rights under an insurance contract it held with hartford fire insurance company hartford to tfv.tfv then attempted to recover the amount of edc million settlement from hartford.the district court found for hartford,holding that hartford was substantially prejudiced by the fact that it was not notified of the accident until three years after it happened.we reverse and remand.
background 
tfv owned two vessels that it used to transport iron ore the rio caroni a bulk carrier and the boca grande a floating terminal and transfer station.the rio caroni carried iron ore down the orinoco river in venezuela from various inland points and,on arrival at the mouth of the river,unloaded the ore onto the boca grande.the boca grande then placed the ore on vessels.
in august,tfv predecessor,deltamar,entered into a contract with the nkk corporation for the conversion of the rio caroni from bulk carrier to shuttle vessel.as part of the conversion,nkk was required to build a materials handling essentially of a series of conveyor belts and a would be placed on the rio caroni to facilitate the movement of iron ore onto the vessel and its discharge from the vessel.nkk subcontracted the design and furnishing of the materials handling system to edc,which was to provide nkk with engineering expertise,drawings and parts.in turn,nkk would then assemble the provided parts to complete the conversion of the rio caroni.
one of the parts edc contracted to supply was a boom cylinder,which formed part of the boom hoisting mechanism.because edc was itself unable to build the boom cylinder,edc subcontracted the manufacture of this part to the sheffer corporation.exactly which party designed the boom cylinder is unclear from the record on appeal.the purchase order for the boom cylinder,which refers to a sheffer hydraulic boom hoist cylinder,indicates that sheffer regularly offered several standard boom cylinder models for sale to the public.however,the numerous specifications in the purchase example,the purchase order stated that blind or piston end of the cylinder to have pivot mount suitable for mm pin indicate that edc provided at least some special parameters with which sheffer cylinder was required to comply.as such,the boom cylinder appears to be a modified sheffer cylinder,to edc specifications.
on april,the rio caroni new boom suddenly collapsed while the vessel was unloading ore onto the boca grande,damaging both vessels.an investigation by walter herbst,president of edc,revealed that the boom collapse was due to a sudden fracture of the steel,a component of the boom cylinder that had been built for edc by sheffer.however,herbst report was not able to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure,giving possible reasons for possible design and manufacturing defects.at the request of tfv,edc arranged for metallurgical testing of the by professional services industries,psi to determine the precise cause of the failure.psi determined that the failed in a brittle manner,possibly due to its fabrication from an inferior grade of steel.following psi analysis of the,edc refused to pay a monthly storage fee for the.consequently,the was discarded by psi prior to the commencement of this suit,and it can not now be recovered.
district court proceedings 
on august,tfv filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against nkk,edc and sheffer,seeking an award of million for the physical damage to its vessels,as well as compensation for economic losses attributed to the vessels being out of operation.in its answer to tfv complaint,edc asserted a against sheffer,alleging that sheffer should pay any judgment entered against edc because it had improperly manufactured the.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this cause pursuant to.
through discovery,tfv learned that edc was insured under a policy with hartford.this comprehensive general liability and business liability policy provided a million aggregate limit for business liability claims.on march,tfv notified hartford of the accident and pending litigation.thus,hartford became aware of the accident approximately three years after the accident occurred and not until after this litigation was instituted.on may,edc brought suit in new jersey state court,seeking from hartford coverage a defense of tfv suit.hartford denied both coverage and a defense thereafter,for reasons not reflected in the record on appeal,the state court action was dismissed.hartford was then brought into the instant action as a defendant by way of edc complaint.in its answer to this complaint,dated july,hartford denied that its policy covered edc for the losses sustained on tfv vessels and refused to defend edc in the present action.
on august,approximately one month after being joined in the present lawsuit,hartford,along with the other parties to this suit,attended an settlement conference before the magistrate judge assigned to this case.at the conference,tfv agreed to settle its claims against all parties for million.during the settlement conference,the magistrate judge informed hartford that it could settle on behalf of edc for.if hartford chose not to settle,the magistrate advised the participants that edc was going to consent to judgment in the amount of million and assign its rights under the insurance contract to tfv.at hartford request,the magistrate judge allowed it two weeks to consider which of the two options it would accept.
hartford chose not to settle on behalf of edc.instead,in a letter dated august,hartford informed edc that it would now agree to provide edc with a defense,subject to a reservation of rights as to coverage of the claim.on august,counsel for all parties participated in a telephone conference with the magistrate judge,during which the judge informed hartford that,in spite of hartford offer to defend edc,the parties had signed a settlement agreement.under the final terms of the settlement,tfv received from sheffer and from various parties,including nkk and the supplier of the steel used in the manufacture.the settlement also made edc liable to tfv for million.however,because edc could not afford to pay the million settlement amount,it consented instead to a judgment against it in favor of tfv.tfv agreed not to execute this judgment,and in exchange edc assigned all of its claims against hartford to tfv.
thus,following the settlement,tfv and hartford were the only two parties remaining in this suit.tfv moved,and hartford,for summary judgment.the district court granted hartford motion for summary judgment,finding that the late notice of the accident voided coverage.the district court also found that hartford suffered substantial prejudice due to the late notice because edc consent to disposal of the prevented hartford from examining the itself.the district court believed that hartford was further prejudiced because the late notice prevented it from filing a for indemnification against sheffer.
tfv appeals.we have appellate jurisdiction over both the grant of hartford summary judgment motion and the denial of tfv motion.see.
ii.discussion 
the decision below arises out of for summary judgment.such motions 
are no more than a claim by each side that it alone is entitled to summary judgment,and the making of such inherently contradictory claims does not constitute an agreement that if one is rejected the other is necessarily justified or that the losing party waives judicial consideration and determination whether genuine issues of material fact exist.
rains cascade,cir.in addition,when an appeal from a denial of summary judgment is raised in tandem with an appeal of an order granting a for summary judgment,we have jurisdiction to review the propriety of the denial of summary judgment by the district court.nazay miller,cir.our review of the district court decision on the motions for summary judgment is plenary.see international union,united mine workers of america racho trucking,cir.we will uphold a grant or reverse a denial of summary judgment only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.
because there is no dispute that new jersey law governs in this case,we do not question its application.see newport assocs.dev.travelers indem.of,cir.under new jersey law,the words of an insurance contract are given their ordinary meaning,unless they are ambiguous.see new jersey ins.underwriting ass n.we test for ambiguity by asking whether the policy phrasing is so confusing that the average policyholder can not make out the boundaries of coverage.weedo.
tfv presents two issues on appeal whether hartford was appreciably prejudiced because it received late notification of the accident and because the was lost or destroyed and whether the insurance contract between edc and hartford covered edc liability to tfv.we address these issues in turn.
late notice 
the insurance contract between edc and hartford required that edc notify hartford promptly of any accident that might result in a claim 
liability and medical expenses general conditions 
duties in the event of occurrence,claim or suit.
a.you must see to it that we are notified promptly of an occurrence or an offense which may result in a claim.
b.if a claim is made or suit is brought against any insured,you must 
immediately record the specifics of the claim or suit and the date received and 
notify us as soon as practicable.
you must see to it that we receive a written notice of the claim or suit as soon as practicable.
the insurance contract defines an occurrence as an accident and a suit as a civil proceeding in which damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies are alleged.thus,the failure qualifies as an occurrence,and this cause qualifies as a suit,as those terms are defined in the contract.consequently,edc was,upon learning of the accident,obligated to notify hartford.
hartford the district court hartford can not be liable to edc because edc did not provide hartford with prompt notice of the accident,as required under the insurance contract.however,for an insurer to assert the defense of late notice under new jersey law,the insurer must prove not only that it was given late notice of the accident here,tfv does not dispute that its notice was late,but also that it suffered appreciable prejudice as a result of the late notice.see chemical leaman tank lines aetna casualty surety,cir noting that new jersey law requires showing of appreciable prejudice solvents recovery serv.of new england midland ins,noting that insurer bears burden of proving appreciable prejudice.new jersey courts look to two factors in analyzing whether a party has suffered appreciable prejudice whether substantial rights have been irretrievably lost by virtue of the insured failure to give timely notice and whether the likelihood of success of the insurer in defending against the underlying claim has been adversely affected.see chemical leaman tank lines,at.
under new jersey law,mere conjecture or suspicions may not form the basis for establishing appreciable prejudice.see molyneaux molyneaux.indeed,the insurer must establish more than the mere fact that it can not employ its normal procedures in investigating and evaluating the claim,r ather it must show that substantial rights have been irretrievably lost.kitchnefsky national of,d,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.these rights include the preparation and preservation of demonstrative and illustrative evidence such as vehicles or photographs,and the ability of experts to reconstruct the scene.baker aetna casualty surety,wl quoting morales national grange mutual ins,law div.
hartford believes that the above standards are satisfied by two actions it was unable to take as a result of the late notice it was denied an opportunity to inspect the failed assembly on its own and it was denied an opportunity to assert a against sheffer,the manufacturer of the.we address in turn,and reject,both of hartford proffered grounds for finding substantial prejudice.
hartford first alleges that,if it only had received prompt notice of the accident,it would have taken custody of the failed assembly and undertaken its own full analysis of it.while it is true that the failed has been irretrievably lost,it has been replaced by an independent professional metallurgist comprehensive laboratory report that seemingly details all relevant characteristics of the at the time of failure.the was fully tested by psi,and hartford has not stated any additional or different testing it would have pursued on its own had it had possession of the.instead,hartford appears to argue that it need not show how it was prejudiced by loss of the because,to its way of thinking,the loss of a piece of physical evidence will per se establish substantial prejudice.however,new jersey law is not so generous as noted,more than speculation and conjecture is required to establish substantial prejudice.because hartford has provided nothing beyond mere speculation,it has failed to show how it might have been appreciably prejudiced by its failure to run its own tests on the assembly.
whether hartford was prejudiced by its inability to fully pursue a against sheffer is a more difficult issue,but one that hartford emphasized at oral argument.hartford maintains that edc breach of the notice provision of the hartford policy also prejudiced hartford by reason of edc failure to aggressively pursue a for contractual indemnification from sheffer.appellee br.at.there are several problems with this argument,not the least of which is the fact that an insurer who has not paid its insured claim or provided the insured with a defense has no right to obtain the benefit of the insured claims against third parties.see fireman fund ins.security ins.of hartford,see also in re joint eastern southern dist.asbestos,cir.here,hartford received notice of the accident in march and was first sued under its policy with edc in may.nonetheless,hartford steadfastly refused coverage,or even a defense,to edc until one week after a settlement was agreed to in august.during the months following hartford initial notification of the accident,hartford had ample opportunity to assist edc,but turned down the chance to do so.therefore,hartford lost the right to pursue a against sheffer as a result of its own inaction,not by virtue of edc action.
hartford real problem appears to lie with edc decision to settle this case,thereby extinguishing its against sheffer.however,under new jersey law,when an insurer refuses to defend its insured,the insured is free to settle with third parties,and the settlement may be enforced against the insurer.see griggs bertram,thus,edc was free to settle,subject to limited oversight by hartford.of course,a settlement that is unreasonable in amount or entered into in bad faith is not enforceable against hartford,but hartford bears the ultimate burden of showing such frailties in the settlement.griggs bertram,at.hartford has not met that burden.
here,edc was justified,and perhaps even wise,to settle in the manner that it did.under its contract with nkk,edc warranted that it would provide equipment including the that is of merchantable quality,free from all defects in design,material and workmanship edc was apparently liable,therefore,to nkk for supplying a defective product,even if the defect was due perhaps to sheffer manufacturing error.hartford believes,however,that the indemnification clause in the boom cylinder purchase order clearly provided that sheffer would fully indemnify edc for any damages arising out of the defectiveness of the product.the clause reads i f this purchase order involves work to be performed by you at a job site,you,by the acceptance of this purchase order agree to indemnify and save edc incorporated against all claims for damages to persons or property arising out of the execution of the work.the indemnification clause is not as broad as hartford cl
