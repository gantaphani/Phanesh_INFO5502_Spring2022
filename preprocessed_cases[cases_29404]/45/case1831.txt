section of the california code of civil procedure extends the statute of limitations until for claims arising out of life insurance policies issued to armenian genocide victim s.c west.the primary issue in this appeal is whether interferes with the national government conduct of foreign relations.we conclude that it does,and accordingly,we hold that the california statute is preempted.the district court order denying the rule b motion to dismiss is reversed.
background 
in,the california legislature enacted senate bill,which amended california code of civil procedure to provide california courts with jurisdiction over certain classes of claims arising out of insurance policies that were held by armenian genocide vitcim s.bill reg.sess,cal.legis.serv.west,codified at.the bill also amended the code to extend the statute of limitations for such claims until december.id.section,in its entirety,provides 
a the following definitions govern the construction of this section

in the legislative findings accompanying the statute,the legislature provides formal recognition to an armenian genocide 
the legislature recognizes that during the period from to,many persons of armenian ancestry residing in the historic armenian homeland then situated in the ottoman empire were victims of massacre,torture,starvation,death marches,and exile.this period is known as the armenian genocide.
section was modeled after and,which extended the statute of limitations until for insurance claims and world war ii slave labor claims,respectively.jud,analysis of bill reg.sess.may.both of these sister statutes have been found unconstitutional,because they interfered with the national government foreign affairs power.deustch turner,cir finding unconstitutional steinberg int.comm.on holocaust era ins.claims,th,d,finding unconstitutional.
in december,vazken movsesian movsesian filed this class action against victoria verisherung ag victoria,ergo verischerungsgruppe ag ergo,and munchener aktiengesellschaft munich re.movsesian and his fellow class members are persons of armenian descent who claim benefits from insurance policies issued by victoria and ergo.munich re is the parent company of victoria and ergo.movsesian seeks damages from all three companies for breach of written contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unjust enrichment,and other related claims.munich re filed a rule b motion to dismiss the claims,arguing that the class members lacked standing to bring claims under,and contending that it was not a proper defendant under.munich re also challenged the constitutionality of,on the grounds that it violated the due process clause of the united states constitution and was preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine.
the district court granted munich re motion to dismiss the claims for unjust enrichment and constructive trust,and denied munich re motion to dismiss the claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of fair dealing.the court held that the class members had standing to bring their claims,and that munich re was a proper defendant under.the court rejected munich re due process challenge,and held that was not preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine.
munich re filed a motion to certify the district court order for interlocutory appeal,and to stay the action pending appeal.the district court granted the motion,and stayed the case.within the window provided by b,munich re petitioned this court for permission to pursue an interlocutory appeal,which we granted.
on appeal,the parties address three issues first,whether is preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine second,whether munich re is a proper defendant and third,whether the have standing to bring these claims we conclude that impermissibly infringes on the federal government foreign affairs power,and is preempted.we do not reach the other issues.
on december,our court received a letter from the turkish ambassador via facsimile.letter from nabi sensoy,the turkish republic ambassador to the united states,to molly dwyer,clerk of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit december.the letter expresses turkey opposition to,and urges the court to overturn the california statute.at oral argument,munich re asked us to take judicial notice of the letter movsesian objected.
we decline to take judicial notice of the letter,because the letter was submitted apparently in response district court decision.see,ctr.for reform,city and county of honolulu,declining to take judicial notice of documents issued after the district court decision.even if we did take notice of the letter,however,it would not alter our decision in this case.

iii.the constitutionality of under the foreign affairs doctrine 
this case presents the issue whether of the california code of civil procedure interferes with the national government power to conduct foreign affairs.munich re contends that is preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine in two ways first,that it is preempted by the claims agreement of,and the war claims act of and second,that it conflicts with the executive branch policy prohibiting legislative recognition of an armenian genocide.we conclude that conflicts with executive branch foreign policy,and thus,is preempted.we need not decide the questions whether is preempted by the claims agreement or the war claims act.
the supreme court has long recognized that the executive branch foreign policy preferences are entitled to preemptive weight when they take the form of executive agreements.see,dames moore regan,d united states pink.united states belmont.in garamendi,the supreme court recognized for the first time that presidential foreign policy itself may carry the same preemptive force as a federal statute or treaty.am.ins.garamendi,d.unlike in previous cases,the presidential foreign policy was not contained in a single executive agreement.instead,the policy was embod ied in several executive agreements,as well as in various letters and statements from executive branch officials at congressional hearings.id.at.in sum,the court held that in the realm of foreign affairs,t he exercise of the federal executive authority means that state law must give way where there is evidence of clear conflict between the policies adopted by the two.id.
to determine whether california holocaust victims insurance relief act hvira was preempted by presidential foreign policy,the garamendi court employed a traditional conflict preemption analysis.id.at.first,the court considered whether there was an express federal policy on point.id.at.next,the court analyzed whether the california statutory scheme posed a clear conflict.id.at.here,just as in garamendi,the question relevant to preemption in this case is conflict.and just as in garamendi,the evidence here is more than sufficient to demonstrate that the state act stands in the way of the president diplomatic objectives.id.at.citing crosby foreign trade council,d.
express federal policy 
munich re contends that presidential foreign policy prohibits legislative recognition of an armenian genocide,and that this policy preempts.in support of this argument,munich re points to several failed house resolutions,res,congress res,congress res,congress.each of these resolutions formally recognized the armenian genocide.each time,the administrations of president bush and president clinton took specific action,privately and publicly,to defeat these measures.
house resolution 
house resolution,entitled affirmation of the united states record on the armenian genocide resolution,c all ed upon the president to ensure that the foreign policy of the united states reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights,ethnic cleansing,and genocide documented in the united states record relating to the armenian genocide,and for other purposes.res,cong.in support of the resolution,the house passed a number of legislative findings,including the following 
the armenian genocide was conceived and carried out by the ottoman empire from to,resulting in the deportation of nearly armenians,of whom men,women,and children were killed,survivors were expelled from their homes,and which succeeded in the elimination of the over presence of armenians in their historic homeland.
id.at.in all,the resolution uses the phrase armenian genocide at least times.
president clinton personally expressed his opposition to the resolution in a letter to speaker hastert.letter to the speaker of the house of representatives on a resolution on armenian genocide,pub.papers.the president explained the potential negative impact the resolution would have on the nation foreign policy interests 
i am deeply concerned that consideration of res.at this time could have negative consequences for the united states.we have significant interests in this troubled region of the world containing the threat posed by saddam hussein working for peace and stability in the middle east and central asia stabilizing the balkans and developing new sources of energy.consideration of the resolution at this sensitive time will not only negatively affect those interests,but could undermine efforts to encourage improved relations between armenia and very goal the resolution sponsors seek to advance.
id.in sum,president clinton urged the speaker in the strongest terms not to bring this resolution to the floor at this time.id.
in addition,several administration officials sent letters to the chairman of the committee on international relations,reiterating the administration opposition to the resolution,at.the assistant secretary of state expressed the administration belief that legislative measures were not the appropriate means of addressing the sensitive issue raised in the resolution.id.at.the secretary of defense and the undersecretary of defense underscored the administration concern that the resolution would complicate our efforts to build relationships and protect our interests in the region and sustain our positive relationship with a key,strategically placed ally.id.at.the resolution was reported out of committee,but never brought to a vote on the floor.
house resolution 
in,a general resolution reaffirming support of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide was introduced in the house.res,cong.unlike the other two resolutions discussed in this section,house resolution did not contain any legislative findings,or even any reference to turkey or the ottoman empire.nevertheless,the bush administration strongly opposed it.the administration opposition to house resolution was based solely on two words found in the resolution armenian genocide.an official from the state department explained 
i am writing to express the administration opposition to the wording of res.of april,w e oppose hr reference to the armenian genocide.were this wording adopted it could complicate our efforts to bring peace and stability to the caucasus and hamper ongoing attempts to bring about reconciliation.we continue to believe that fostering a productive dialogue on these events is the best way for turkey and armenia to build a positive and productive relationship.declarations such as this one,however,hinder rather than encourage the process.
at.the bush administration echoed the clinton administration belief that legislation on the issue is counterproductive.id.at.this time,the resolution was reported out of committee and calendared,but was never actually brought to a vote on the floor.
house resolution 
in,the house entertained yet another resolution that would provide official recognition to an armenian genocide.house resolution was nearly indistinguishable from house resolution,discussed above.the bush administration renewed its opposition to legislative recognition of an armenian genocide through a joint letter from secretary of state condoleezza rice and secretary of defense robert gates to speaker nancy pelosi.letter from condoleezza rice,sec y of state,and robert gates,sec y of defense,to nancy pelosi,speaker of the house of representatives march.the secretaries sent an identical letter to the minority leader of the house,representative john boehner.letter from condoleezza rice,sec y of state,and robert gates,sec y of defense,to john boehner,minority leader of the house of representatives march.
in their joint letter,the secretaries underscored the importance of turkey contributions to the war in iraq.see letter from condoleezza rice and robert gates to nancy pelosi,supra,at.the secretaries noted that when the french assembly voted in favor of a similar bill,the turkish military cut off contact with the french military and terminated defense contracts under negotiation.id.the secretaries warned that a similar reaction by the government of turkey to a house resolution could harm american troops in the field,constrain our ability to supply our troops in iraq and afghanistan,and significantly damage our efforts to promote reconciliation between armenia and turkey.id.in conclusion,the secretaries strongly urge d the speaker to refrain from allowing the resolution to reach the house floor.id.
despite the secretaries exhortations,the house committee on foreign affairs passed a motion to order the bill reported.res,cong.as reported by comm.on foreign.in response,president bush made the following statement 
on another issue before congress,i urge members to oppose the armenian genocide resolution now being considered by the house foreign affairs committee.we all deeply regret the tragic suffering of the armenian people that began in.this resolution is not the right response to these historic mass killings,and its passage would do great harm to our relations with a key ally in nato and in the global war on terror.

following president bush statements,no further action was taken on the resolution.
emergence of the express policy 
the foregoing account of negotiations between the executive branch and congress,and the public statements and letters of two presidents,clearly establish a presidential foreign policy preference against providing legislative recognition to an armenian genocide.the garamendi court relied on similar communications between the administration and state legislative and executive officials,in addition to several executive agreements,in finding that hvira was preempted.garamendi,at.
unlike the presidential foreign policy at issue in garamendi,the presidential foreign policy in the present case is not embodied in any executive agreement.this does not,however,detract from the policy preemptive force.the executive agreements discussed in garamendi did not apply to all of the claims at issue,so they could not have been central to the court finding of preemption in that case.id.at.
furthermore,the preemptive power of the federal policy is not derived from the form of the policy,but rather from the source of the executive branch authority to act.presidential foreign policy only carries preemptive weight when the executive authority is validly measured by the tripartite framework set forth by justice jackson in youngstown.medellín texas,d citing youngstown sheet tube sawyer.jackson,concurring.in prior cases where the presidential policy at issue implicated criminal law an area traditionally left to the states to regulate,or foreign commerce an area delegated by the constitution to congress,the court has refused to accord the policy preemptive effect.see,medellin.at barclays bank plc franchise tax bd.of,d.here,however,the presidential policy concerns national security,a war in progress,and diplomatic relations with a foreign nation.the constitution squarely,if not solely,vests these powers with the executive branch.const.art.ii,cl.id.at,cl.id.at see also medellín.at holding that the president has the lead role in making sensitive foreign policy decisions garamendi,at.deutsch,at enumerating the foreign affairs powers delegated by the constitution to the president.
the president acts well within his constitutionally delegated powers by developing and enforcing the policy refusing to provide official recognition to an armenian genocide.accordingly,the presidential policy is entitled to preemptive effect.see,medellín.at,suggesting that the president,in the exercise of his article ii powers,could take action which preempts conflicting state law,but refusing to find such preemption in that case barclays bank plc,at.executive branch communications that express federal policy but lack the force of law can not render unconstitutional california otherwise valid,congressionally condoned,use of worldwide combined reporting.
even if the policy implicated a power shared by the president and congress,congress documented deference in this case lends the presidential policy additional authority.see medellín.at youngstown,at.the president and his senior officials lobbied congress,privately and publicly,to implement the policy.each time,congress deferred to the president authority,and did not bring the resolution to a vote.under the youngstown framework,this congressional acquiescence infuses the president authority to act with additional support.see medellín.at youngstown,at.
in sum,we conclude there is an express federal policy prohibiting legislative recognition of an armenian genocide,as embodied in the previously mentioned statements and letters of the president and other executive branch officials.this policy is a valid exercise of the president article ii powers.in light of this,and in light of congress deference to the executive branch on this matter,the policy is entitled to preemptive weight.
clear conflict 
we next consider whether clearly conflicts with the presidential foreign policy prohibiting legislative recognition of an armenian genocide.we conclude that it does.the conflict is clear on the face of the statute by using the phrase armenian genocide,california has defied the president foreign policy preferences.
the language of the california statute is very similar to that of the failed house resolutions.the california legislature made the following findings in support of 
the legislature recognizes that during the period from to,many persons of armenian ancestry residing in the historic armenian homeland then situated in the ottoman empire were victims of massacre,torture,starvation,death marches,and exile.this period is known as the armenian genocide.
this language closely parallels the legislative findings in house resolutions and,which the executive branch vehemently opposed.section implicates the same concerns raised by the executive branch in response to these resolutions.
movsesian contends that given severability provision,the constitutionality of c should be analyzed distinctly.even assuming subsection c could be separated from the constitutional deficiencies underlying the rest of the statute,the subsection would still conflict with the federal policy at issue.section c contains two references to the armenian genocide.as discussed above,the executive branch opposed house resolution simply because it contained the phrase armenian genocide.the heart of conflict with the presidential foreign policy lies in these two words.by choosing to use the words armenian genocide,directly contradicts the president express foreign policy preference.
movsesian ridicules the idea that two words could have such a talismanic effect.the symbolic effect of the words,however,is precisely the problem.the federal government has made a conscious decision not to apply the politically charged label of genocide to the deaths of these armenians during world war whether or not california agrees with this decision,it may not contradict it.see garamendi,at.when it comes to dealings with foreign nations,state lines disappear.belmont,at.california may not assert a distinct juristic personality.pink,at.
if provoked turkey ire,it is the nation as a just would suffer.if state action could defeat or alter our foreign policy,serious consequences might ensue.the nation as a whole would be held to answer if a state created difficulties with a foreign power.pink,at.the bush administration warned that american recognition of an armenian genocide could endanger america alliance with turkey,and thus,our troops on the ground in iraq.see letter from condoleezza rice and robert gates to nancy pelosi,supra at.
section also threatens to undermine the executive branch diplomatic relations with turkey.states may not compromise the very capability of the president to speak for the nation with one voice in dealing with other governments.garamendi,at.here,undercuts the president diplomatic discretion and the choice he has made in exercising it.id.at.
in garamendi and crosby,the court struck down state statutes which undermined the president diplomatic discretion.crosby foreign trade council,d.by providing explicit recognition to the armenian genocide,threatens to have the same deleterious effect.the executive branch chose to address the issue through the medium of presidential speeches,not legislation the president believes that the proper way to address this issue and express our feelings about it is through the presidential message and not through legislation what president bush wants is for the presidential message to be the thing that stands for the american response to this,not legislation passed by the house of representatives.see press release,white house office of the press secretary,press briefing by dana perino.california has done what congress declined to do it has defied the president foreign policy preferences,and has undermined the presi
