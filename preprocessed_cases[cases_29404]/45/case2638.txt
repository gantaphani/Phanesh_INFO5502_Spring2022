this petition for writ of mandate presents an issue of first impression in this state the meaning of occurrence in a commercial general liability cgl policy as applied to bodily injuries caused by exposure to asbestos.we conclude that,as used in the policies at issue,occurrence means injurious exposure to asbestos,not the manufacture and distribution of those products.accordingly,we grant the writ and direct the trial court to vacate its summary adjudication order.
introduction 
real party in interest kaiser cement gypsum corporation kaiser manufactured a variety of products containing asbestos asbestos products for more than years.in recent years,kaiser has been named as a defendant in products liability suits brought by thousands of claimants who allege they were injured by their exposure to kaiser asbestos products.these claims have been defended by kaiser primary general liability carrier,real party in interest truck insurance exchange truck.
after making indemnity payments for kaiser of more than million,truck filed an action seeking,among other things,a declaratory judgment that truck policies were exhausted and that truck had no further duty to defend or indemnify kaiser in litigation.subsequently,truck sought summary adjudication of the declaratory judgment cause of action.the summary adjudication motion turned on the meaning of the word occurrence as used in the cgl policies.according to truck,all claimants asbestos injuries resulted from a single occurrence kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos thus were subject to the policies per occurrence liability limits.thus,truck contended,because its indemnity payments exceeded policy limits,the policies were exhausted and it had no further obligation to kaiser.
petitioners london market insurers lmi,kaiser excess insurers,opposed the summary adjudication motion,arguing that the relevant occurrence was each claimant asbestos exposure,not kaiser manufacture or distribution of asbestos products.accordingly,lmi contended,the court could not conclude as a matter of law that all of kaiser asbestos claims resulted from a single occurrence or that truck policies had been exhausted.
the trial court agreed with truck that the occurrence was kaiser decision to manufacture and distribute asbestos products and,thus,that all asbestos injuries arose out of a single annual occurrence.it accordingly granted summary adjudication.
we find that the trial court interpretation can not be reconciled with the policies plain language,which compels our conclusion that an occurrence under the policies is injurious exposure to asbestos,not the manufacture and distribution of asbestos products.thus,the trial court erred in determining that all asbestos injuries arose from a single annual occurrence as a matter of law.moreover,on the present record we can not determine how many occurrences are responsible for the alleged injuries and,thus,whether truck policies have been fully exhausted.accordingly,we grant the writ and direct the trial court to vacate its order granting truck motion for summary adjudication and to enter a new order denying the motion.
factual and procedural background 
kaiser manufactured a variety of asbestos products,including joint compounds,finishing compounds,fiberboard,and plastic cements,from through the.kaiser produced these products at different facilities at various times.
by,more than claimants including,among others,carpenters,electricians,sheetrockers,painters,welders,shipyard workers,mechanics,plasterers,plumbers,tile setters,acoustical sprayers and architects had filed products liability suits against kaiser alleging that they had suffered bodily injury,including asbestosis and various cancers,as a result of their exposure to kaiser asbestos products.kaiser tendered these claims to truck,which had issued primary cgl policies to kaiser between and.as of july,truck had paid approximately million to more than asbestos claimants by october,truck indemnity payments for asbestos bodily injury claims exceeded million.
in april,truck filed an insurance coverage action concerning its obligations to continue to defend and indemnify kaiser for asbestos bodily injury claims.kaiser filed a against its excess insurers,including lmi,seeking a declaration of coverage under its excess policies in the event truck were able to establish that it had no further obligation to defend or indemnify kaiser.
in october,truck moved for summary adjudication that all its policies had been exhausted and it had no further duty to defend or indemnify kaiser the basis for truck motion was the per occurrence liability limitation in its cgl policies,which capped truck exposure for bodily injuries resulting from any one occurrence.according to truck,under the plain language of the policies,all claims in any given year arose out of a single occurrence because all had the same underlying cause the design,manufacture and distribution by kaiser and its subsidiaries of products.further,truck urged that the parties course of,kaiser payment of a single deductible per policy year for all asbestos bodily injury claims,rather than a deductible for each consistent with the conclusion that all asbestos claims resulted from a single occurrence.thus,notwithstanding its indemnity payments exceeding million,truck contended that its liability for asbestos bodily injury claims for all policy years was only million and that the policies were exhausted as of january.
kaiser responded that truck was entitled to summary adjudication,but contended that its analysis was only half right.kaiser agreed that under the plain language of truck policies,all asbestos bodily injury claims resulted from a single annual occurrence.thus,it agreed that truck policies had been exhausted.however,kaiser did not agree that this result was compelled by the course of the parties performance to the contrary,kaiser contended that neither it nor truck ever believed that they had reached an agreement on the issue.
lmi opposed the summary adjudication motion,contending that the court could not conclude as a matter of law that all asbestos bodily injury claims resulted from a single annual occurrence or that truck policies had been exhausted.further,lmi contended that the parties conduct demonstrated that they believed that the asbestos claims resulted from multiple occurrences.thus,lmi urged that truck motion should be denied because there were triable issues of fact as to the meaning of occurrence.
the trial court initially denied the summary adjudication motion.it explained that under california law,insurance policies are interpreted based on their plain language and the insured objectively reasonable expectations when the policies are issued.further,it said that in california occurrence means the underlying cause of act,or acts,of the insured that gives rise to the abic asbestos bodily injury claims.thus,the dispositive question was whether kaiser reasonably could have believed that its decision to incorporate asbestos into many different products over many decades was a single occurrence.the court held that it could not a s a matter of law it is not now,nor was it at the time the truck policies were issued,objectively reasonable to assume that the incorporation of chrysotile asbestos into multiple products over a period of many years would constitute a single occurrence.
although the court thus concluded that the asbestos bodily injury claims were not a single occurrence as a matter of law,it said that on the present record it could not decide how many occurrences were responsible for the asbestos claims.it explained the more difficult issue presented by truck motion is determining the number of occurrences under the policies,given that they are to be determined based on an analysis of the underlying cause of injury.the court finds that a reading of the policies as a whole does not support a determination that the manufacture,sale,and distribution of all kaiser products constitute a single occurrence.by the same token,however,the policies do not support lmi interpretation that each abic filed against kaiser was an occurrence.while a decision to manufacture a given product in a certain manner,or warn or not warn of the dangerous propensities of that product may constitute an occurrence,such a decision must be made with reference to a product or family of products.
thus,the court said,by denying summary adjudication it was not determining that the number of occurrences under the truck policies will necessarily be the total number of individual asbestos bodily injury claims.given the language of the policies,there may be evidentiary support for a finding that the design,manufacture,and distribution of a family of products,or a particular product line,constituted an occurrence under the post policies.accordingly,the determination of the actual number of occurrences under the truck policies will be subject to further evidentiary showings in subsequent stages of these proceedings.
several months after denying the motion for summary adjudication,on its own motion the court ordered reconsideration and supplemental briefing.the court then granted summary adjudication for truck.in doing so,it noted that california courts had not decided the issue before it,but said that the trend nationally is that insofar as asbestos coverage cases are concerned,the underlying cause test mandates a finding that either the manufacture and sale of products was the single occurrence or that the failure to warn of products was the single occurrence.thus,the court said,its decision to apply an underlying cause test required it to conclude that truck and kaiser reasonably intended to treat all asbestos bodily injury claims as a single occurrence under the policies.
additionally,the court said,there were significant practical problems with the approach of its prior order practically speaking,the roadblock in finding there were multiple occurrences based on the number of products kaiser produced is the difficulty if not impossibility in proving which products resulted in exposure to the individual claimants.there also would be no reliable way to determine what amounts paid to claimants could be allocated to a particular kaiser product.the complaints described in the claims matrix for the underlying abic illustrate this point.the underlying abic generally do not attempt to link any claimant asbestos injuries with any specific kaiser product or batch of products.under these circumstances,coverage under the policies could likely never be determined and kaiser would be without the insurance for which it bargained.
the court concluded upon reconsideration,the court finds,as a matter of law,that the manufacture and decision to place asbestos into products by the kaiser entities constituted a single occurrence under the applicable policies.accordingly,the court finds that truck primary policies have been exhausted,and grants truck motion for summary adjudication.
lmi filed a timely petition for writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause,ordered additional briefing and stayed all proceedings until further order of this court.

discussion 
the meaning of occurrence as it applies to asbestos injuries is an issue of first impression in this state.other states have considered the question,but they have reached varying conclusions.some courts have held that occurrence in the context means the manufacturer decision to incorporate asbestos into its products,and thus they have concluded that all asbestos injuries for which a defendant is responsible result from a single occurrence,greene,tweed,hartford acc.indem,civ.wl at pp.liberty mut.ins.treesdale,cir,westinghouse american home assurance,july,nos.wl at pp.gypsum admiral ins.d,united ins,colt industries aetna cas.sur.wl at pp.air products and chemicals,hartford acc.and indem,aetna cas.sur.other courts have held that the occurrence is the claimant unique asbestos exposure,and thus that each exposure is a separate occurrence,in re prudential lines cir,commercial union ins.porter hayden,stonewall ins.asbestos claims management cir,cole celotex so d.still other courts have said that the occurrence is the asbestos exposure,but have held that claimants who were exposed to asbestos at approximately the same time and place were injured by the same occurrence,fina,travelers indemnity d,metropolitan life ins.aetna cas.sur.
notwithstanding their profusion,none of the preceding opinions engages in the thorough examination of the policy language california law requires.trb investments,fireman fund ins.cal th,d.moreover,the insurance contracts in those cases differ from the present contracts in significant ways,and while we recognize that consistent interpretation of standardized terms in insurance contracts promotes clear understanding of future contracts,it would be foolish to state as a matter of law that the word occurrence has the same meaning in all insurance contracts.flintkote general acc.assur.d.therefore,although we have carefully reviewed the cases cited by the parties,we do not rely on them to any significant degree,but instead construe the insurance contracts solely on the basis of the policy language.
the applicable policy provisions 
truck issued cgl policies to kaiser over policy periods,from to.an initial version of the cgl policy was in effect from to,and a second version was in effect from to.the policy provisions relevant to the present petition are described below.
a.the first policy 
the cgl policy in effect from to the policy provided coverage for all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury.it further defined the scope of the coverage as follows.
liability limits.the policy limited truck liability for bodily injury to each person,each occurrence,and aggregate products.with regard to the each occurrence limit,it further provided that the limit of such liability stated in the declarations as applicable to each occurrence is,subject to the above provision respecting each person,the total limit of the company liability for all damages,including damages for care and loss of services,arising out of bodily injury,sickness or disease,including death at any time resulting therefrom,sustained by two or more persons in any one occurrence.with regard to the aggregate products limit,it provided that the limits of bodily injury liability and property damage liability stated in the declarations as aggregate products are respectively the total limits of the company liability for all damages arising out of the products hazard during the period beginning with the effective date of the products hazard coverage 
effective january,the parties eliminated the aggregate product liability limit.the policy continued to contain a per occurrence limit,which was increased to.
deductible.under the policy,kaiser was responsible for the first of loss for each occurrence regardless of the number of claims emanating therefrom.a later policy,effective january,retained the per occurrence deductible,but added an additional products hazard deductible.
occurrence.the policy defined occurrence as an event or series of events or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in legal liability,regardless of the number of persons,vehicles or objects affected by such act or acts or omission.as respects the products hazard,an occurrence shall be deemed to have taken place at the time of the injury or damage to the claimant and not at the time of the act of the insured giving rise to liability.
aggregation of claims.the policy provided for aggregating claims as follows all damages arising out of one lot of goods or products prepared or acquired by the named insured or by another trading under his name shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.
policy period.the policy applied only to occurrences which occur during the policy period.
b.the second policy 
the parties made fundamental changes to the cgl policy in.the relevant provisions of the policies in effect from to the policy are as follows.
liability limits.the policy contained a per occurrence liability limit.like its immediate predecessor,it did not contain any aggregate limit,but instead provided that there is no limit to the number of occurrences for which claims may be made hereunder,however,the limit of the company liability as respects any occurrence involving one or any combination of the hazards or perils insured against shall not exceed the per occurrence limit designated in the declarations.
the parties restored aggregate limits effective april.the aggregate limit was the total limit of the company liability for all damages arising out of the products hazard and completed operations hazard during the twelve month period beginning with the effective date of such coverage provided the personal injury or property damage occurs while the policy is in force.this change did not affect the per occurrence limit,which remained.
deductible.the policy imposed a deductible of for each occurrence.a january,endorsement increased the deductible to per occurrence.in april,the deductible was increased again,to per occurrence.
occurrence.the policy defined occurrence as an event,or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in personal injury or property damage during the policy period.
aggregation of claims.the policy provided that all such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.
policy period.the policy applied only to occurrences during the policy period.
the cgl policies are not reasonably susceptible of the conclusion that all asbestos bodily injury claims resulted from one occurrence or that the policies are exhausted as a matter of law 
there is no dispute between the parties regarding the limits of truck liability for asbestos injuries sustained from to january or april to,when the policies contained aggregate,limits on truck total liability for all damages arising out of the products hazard and completed operations hazard during the policy year.the sole dispute,instead,concerns liability limits between january and april,when the policies did not contain any aggregate limits.because during those years the only limitation on truck liability was the per occurrence limit,truck potential liability for asbestos injuries is a direct function of the number of occurrences deemed responsible for those injuries.
kaiser and truck contend,as the trial court concluded,that the relevant occurrence is kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos products,which they contend is either an event or exposure to conditions.they urge that all claimants asbestos bodily injury claims result from a single occurrence,the continuous use of asbestos in a number of kaiser products without warning.
lmi contends,instead,that the relevant occurrence is injurious exposure to asbestos.further,lmi urges that each claimant asbestos injury necessarily results from a separate occurrence because t he alleged asbestos injuries at issue were proximately caused by exposures to kaiser products that took place at different times,at different places,and under different circumstances.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that,as used in these policies,occurrence means injurious exposure to asbestos.we further conclude that all asbestos exposures can not be treated as a single occurrence under the aggregation provisions.however,on the present record we can not determine how many occurrences are responsible for the tens of thousands of claims asserted against kaiser thus,we do not conclude,as lmi urges us to do,that each injurious exposure to asbestos necessarily is a separate occurrence.
a.the occurrence is each claimant asbestos exposure,not kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos products 
the policy language defining occurrence 
the policies define occurrence in the disjunctive an event or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions.thus,to be an occurrence,kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos products must be either an event or exposure to conditions.as we now explain,it is neither.
an event.real parties suggest that event is a broad term that properly includes anything that happens.thus,they contend,kaiser intentional act of including asbestos in its products is an event within the policy language.
we do not agree.as lmi correctly notes,the plain meaning of event is a discrete happening that occurs at a specific point in time,random house webster college dict.event something that occurs in a certain place during a particular interval of time.thus,for example,while an explosion or series of related explosions is an event or series of events,years of manufacturing activities can not properly be so characterized.
this plain meaning analysis is reinforced by the drafting history of the form cgl policies from which truck policies were derived.the history,while not determinative,may properly be used by courts as an aid to discern the meaning of disputed policy language.mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th,d.before the,the form cgl policy provided coverage for injuries caused by accident.appleman on insurance holmes ed,couch on insurance ed.the underwriting intent of the caused by accident policies,as explained by the legal committee of the national bureau of casualty underwriters nbcu,was to require one identifiable event to trigger coverage.robinson,the best of intentions drafting the occurrence,and pollution exclusion policy language pli comm.law practice course handbook series.in other words,the drafters intended the caused by accident policies to cover traditional traumatic injury cases,but not to cover injuries from continuous or repeated exposure to conditions c aused by accident policy language is designed to include sickness and disease from an identifiable event such as typhoid resulting from drinking contaminated water,but not to include sickness and disease from exposure over periods of time and which is not attributable to an identifiable event such as silicosis,and usually would be so interpreted.id.at,quoting minutes of,meeting of nbcu legal committee.
in the early,the joint forms committee,a joint committee of the nbcu and the mutual insurance rating bureau,issued a memorandum recommending that caused by accident policies be endorsed to include coverage for continuous or repeated exposure bodily injury claims.id.at.consistent with that recommendation,the nbcu promulgated an exposure endorsement in.id.at.the endorsement substituted occurrence for accident,and it defined occurrence using language nearly identical to the language of the policy occurrence means an event,or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which unexpectedly causes injury during the policy period.id.at.
based on the plain meaning of the policy language,bolstered by the drafting history,we conclude that the parties did not understand or intend event to mean anything that happens,including the conscious inclusion of asbestos in products manufactured and distributed by the policyholder.if the parties had so intended,the continuous or repeated exposure clause would have been entirely superfluous,because any exposure for which a policyholder could be held liable necessarily would result from an event.see boghos certain underwriters at lloyd of london cal th,d,effect of,is to disfavor constructions of contractual provisions that would render other provisions surplusage farmers ins.exchange knopp th,d contracts,including insurance contracts,are to be construed to avoid rendering terms surplusage.instead,we conclude that the parties intended event to mean an identifiable,single accident under the older cgl distinct from continuous or repeated exposure.
manufacture and distribution of asbestos products over years can not reasonably be characterized as an event,as we understand that term to have been used in the policies,because it is not a single episode.instead,it is an ongoing course of conduct.accordingly,the event prong of the occurrence definition does not apply here.
exposure to conditions.real parties contend,alternatively,that kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos products is continuous or repeated exposure to conditions and,thus,is an occurrence under the policies.we do not agree.it unreasonably strains the plain language of the policies to characterize manufacture and distribution of products as conditions to which claimants were exposed.we find persuasive the reasoning expressed by two trial courts that interpreted similar policy language in litigation.see coordinated asbestos ins.coverage cases,jccp,at it unreasonably strains the plain language of the policy to characterize asbestos products which were shipped from fibreboard plants as conditions see also fina,travelers indemnity,supra,d at i t is difficult to accept the contention that a failure to protect from the dangers of asbestos was a condition to which all claimants were repeatedly or continuously exposed.such an interpretation places considerable strain on the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms condition and exposure.contrary to real parties,we conclude that the conditions to which claimants were exposed were the asbestos fibers released from kaiser products.this interpretation does not strain the policy language.to the contrary,it is the most natural reading of that language.
other policy provisions 
in addition to the occurrence definition,other provisions of the cgl we properly consider,because contractual language must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,supra,cal th at,d,reinforce the conclusion that occurrence means claimants asbestos exposure,not kaiser manufacture or distribution of asbestos products.
the products hazard definition.the policy defined products hazard as goods or products manufactured,sold,handled or distributed by the named insured or by others trading under his name,if the occurrence or accident occurs after possession of such goods or products has been relinquished to others by the named insured or by others trading under his name and if such occurrence or accident occurs away from premises owned,rented or controlled by the named insured.
as used in this clause,neither manufacture nor distribution can be an occurrence because both necessarily occur product is relinquished by the manufacturer or distributor.indeed,it is difficult to understand in what sense a product is a product prior to its manufacture.no such challenges are presented if occurrence means an event,because such an event logically can occur away from the manufacturing premises after a product has been purchased.
the products hazard deemer.the policy provided that as respects the products hazard,an occurrence shall be deemed to have taken place at the time of the injury or damage to the claimant and not at the time of the act of the insured giving rise to liability.this clause is unintelligible if the occurrence is the manufacture of the product,because the manufacture could take place at the time of the injury only if the injury happened during the manufacturing process.as we have just noted,however,manufacturing injuries are excluded from the policy definition of products hazard,which embraces only injuries that occur away from the insured premises after possession of such goods or products has been relinquished to others.
the timing clause.the policy applied only to occurrences during the policy period that result ed in personal injury or property damage during the policy period.in other words,there was coverage only where both the occurrence and the injury occurred in the same policy period.
interpreting occurrence to mean the manufacture and distribution of products would create significant coverage gaps because there would be no coverage for injuries caused in one policy period by products manufactured in a prior policy period.such gaps are fundamentally inconsistent with a comprehensive or ultra comprehensive liability policy,and real parties have not cited any evidence that the parties intended such gaps.see mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th,d,purpose of cgl policies is to provide the insured with the broadest spectrum of protection against liability for unintentional and unexpected personal injury or property damage arising out of the conduct of the insured business.
in contrast,interpreting occurrence to mean asbestos exposure eliminates these gaps because it provides coverage during every policy period in which injury occurs,regardless of when the product was manufactured.this interpretation thus is consistent with the kind of comprehensive coverage we believe kaiser thought it was purchasing and truck thought it was providing.
the notice clause.both versions of the policy require that in the event of an occurrence,written notice shall be given by or on behalf of the insured to the company as soon as practicable after the manager of the insurance department of the named insured has knowledge of an event or occurrence which,in his or her opinion is likely to result in a claim under this policy.such notice shall contain particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information respecting the time,place and circumstances of the occurrence,and name and address of the injured and of available witnesses.
as another court has noted with reference to a similar policy,this provision uses occurrence in the sense of accident an unforeseen event that causes injury to one or more persons,or to property.flintkote general acc.assur,supra,d at.manufacture and distribution of asbestos products is not an unforeseen event,but rather is better characterized as a business decision.ibid.it would be nonsensical to require kaiser to provide written notice as soon as practicable of its business decision to sell asbestos,and it would be equally nonsensical to require kaiser to provide the time,place and circumstances of its asbestos manufacturing or the name and address of witnesses to such manufacturing.moreover,only a seer would be able to determine that the manufacturing of a product is likely to result in a claim under a particular insurance policy.
the assistance and cooperation clause.the policies provide that the insured shall not,except at his own cost,voluntarily make any payment,assume any obligation or incur any expense,except for emergency medical and surgical relief to others at the time of the occurrence.implicit in this clause is the parties expectation that an occurrence may cause injuries requiring medical or surgical attention.it thus reinforces our conclusion that the parties understood occurrence to mean an event,not routine manufacture or distribution 
california law 
real parties urge that notwithstanding the policy language,occurrence must mean kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos products because california law defines occurrence as the underlying or remote cause of an alleged injury,not the immediate cause.thus,they suggest,because kaiser manufacturing and distribution is the single underlying cause of asbestos bodily injury claims,it necessarily is the relevant occurrence.
we do not agree.as we have said,under california law our primary guide to determining the obligations created by insurance contracts is the language of the contracts themselves.trb investments,fireman fund ins,supra,cal th at,d,intent of the parties to an insurance contract is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract aiu ins.superior court cal d,same.thus,even if other courts had held that occurrence means underlying cause in other insurance contracts with different provisions,those holdings would be largely irrelevant to our decision.
moreover,nearly every case real parties cite was decided long after the present policies were entered as a result,those cases could not have informed the parties understanding of occurrence when they entered into the policies and,thus,they are not material to our determination,trb investments,supra,cal th at,d,under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation emphasis added medical center shewry th,d,citing,the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting emphasis added roddenberry roddenberry th,d events long after parties divorce had no relevance to the question of what the parties intended by the language used in their settlement agreement and judgment thomas buttress mcclellan,d,the intent of the parties to a contract is to be ascertained as of the time the contract was made,not some later date.citations.subsequent unforeseen events can not be allowed to control in arriving at that intent.
finally,contrary to real parties contentions,none of the cited cases stands for the proposition that occurrence necessarily means remote cause of injury,rather than immediate cause.it is true,as real parties urge,that several california cases have held occurrence means the cause or underlying cause of an injury,not the injury or claim itself.caldo oil state water resources control bd.th,d whittaker allianz underwriters,th,d.but these cases do not consider whether occurrence means remote cause manufacture of asbestos products or immediate cause exposure to asbestos fibers,and thus they do not guide our decision 
state farm fire casualty elizabeth th,d,for example,considered the limits of an insurer liability for damages suffered by three children who were repeatedly molested while in the care of the insured,a daycare provider.although there,as here,the central issue was how many occurrences caused claimant injuries,the court had no occasion to decide whether occurrence meant remote or immediate cause because the parties stipulated that the occurrence was the insured asserted negligent remote cause of the immediate acts of molestation.ibid.
whittaker allianz underwriters,supra,th,d,also does not support real parties contention that occurrence means remote cause.indeed,whittaker is not an occurrence case at all.the only issue there was which of several cgl policies was triggered by a series of related products liability claims.that issue,the court explained,was entirely distinct from the number of occurrences the number of relevant occurrences for the purpose of interpreting the per occurrence limitation of liability is different from the question of when the relevant occurrence happens for the purpose of determining if there is coverage at all,or whether coverage should be allocated to a particular policy period.id.at,d.
eott energy storebrand internat.ins.th,d eott arguably comes the closest to equating occurrence with remote cause,but it too is not decisive.there,the insured suffered a million loss as the result of over thefts of its petroleum products.id.at,d.the insurer asserted that each theft was a separate occurrence,while the insured contended that the multiple thefts were part of an organized conspiracy and,thus,constituted a single occurrence.id.at,d.the court of appeal reversed the trial court grant of summary judgment for the insurer,holding that it could not conclude,as a matter of law,that there were multiple occurrences.id.at,d.it noted that the policy did not define occurrence and that the term must be interpreted consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.id.at,d.it concluded in our view,eott objectively reasonable expectation would embrace the conclusion that multiple claims,all due to the same cause or a related cause,would be considered a single loss to which a single deductible would apply.ibid.although eott thus holds that occurrence can mean underlying cause,it does not suggest that it necessarily has that meaning.to the contrary,the case is clear that it must interpret the term occurrence in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy.id.at,d,italics added.
therefore,none of the cases real parties cite holds,as they suggest,that when determining whether multiple injuries or claims arose from one or more occurrences,california courts look to the conduct of the insured which rise to liability.indeed,none of these cases purports to do anything more than interpret the language of the particular policies at issue,as california law requires.they do not alter our conclusion that as used in the present cgl policies,occurrence means asbestos exposure that results in bodily injury,not kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos products.
b.the plain language of the policies precludes treating all claimants asbestos exposure as resulting from a single occurrence 
for the reasons discussed in the prior section,we can not agree with the trial court that,as a matter of law,occurrence means kaiser manufacture and distribution of asbestos products.that conclusion is not fully dispositive of the present petition,however,because a lthough the trial court may grant summary judgment on one basis,this court may affirm the judgment under another it reviews the ruling,not the rationale.salazar southern cal.gas th,d see also modern development navigators ins.th,d,citing lucas pollock th,d we must affirm the judgment if it is correct under any theory of law applicable to the case.
therefore,we now consider the second issue raised by the petition whether the policy,the policies aggregation the thousands of individual asbestos exposures to be deemed a single occurrence.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that they can not be so deemed.
the one lot provision 
the sole aggregation provision of the policy provided that multiple injuries would be treated as resulting from a single occurrence if the injuries ar ose out of one lot of goods or products prepared or acquired by the named insured or by another trading under his name.this provision is nearly identical to a form cgl provision promulgated by the nbcu prior to,which was intended by the drafters to limit the insurer liability for products claims.nachman,the new policy provisions for general liability insurance june pp.new policy provisions.
this provision precludes treating all asbestos claims as a single occurrence.on its fac
