introduction 
after the employment development department edd paid temporary unemployment compensation disability ucd benefits to disabled workers harry white and francisco torres,edd filed lien claims for reimbursement with the workers compensation appeals board board the insurers for white and torres employers were insolvent.under applicable california law,et,california insurance guarantee association ciga had assumed the insolvent carriers obligations,but refused to satisfy edd liens.ciga argued it was only required to pay a covered claim and edd liens are excluded from the definition of covered claims as they are obligations to the state of california,subd.c.ciga also relied on the decision in california ins.guarantee workers comp.appeals bd.karaiskos th,d.in both the torres and white cases,the board ruled against ciga.the board relied on viveros north ranch country club in bank and reasoned that karaiskos,supra,applied only to edd liens litigated separately after the injured worker and the employer insurance carrier had entered into a settlement agreement on all other issues.the board found the fact that the liens here were not litigated separately to be significant 
ciga petitioned this court for a writ of review.
we hold an edd lien is an obligation to a state because the edd is a department of the state of california.therefore,its lien claim is not a covered claim that ciga is required to pay,subd.c.we also hold that it makes no difference when the lien is litigated,with all other issues or separately after the claimant has settled other issues with the employer and insurer.therefore the reasoning of karaiskos applies equally here.accordingly,we annul the board decisions 
discussion 
the standard of review and rules of statutory interpretation.
construction of a statute is question of law which appellate courts review de novo.california ins.guarantee liemsakul d.
w e apply the usual rules of statutory interpretation.the fundamental rule is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in order to effectuate the purpose of the law in doing so,we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language,at the same time not rendering any language mere surplusage.the words must be construed in context and in light of the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear the statute must be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the legislature,practical rather than technical in nature,and which,when applied,will result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity citation.klajic castaic lake water agency th,d.when statutory language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.california ins.guarantee liemsakul d.
ciga is not obligated to pay edd lien.
principles governing ciga.
ciga was created by legislation to establish a fund from which insureds could obtain financial and legal assistance in the event their insurers became insolvent.although funded by a compulsory membership of insurance companies doing business in california,ciga was created to provide a limited form of protection for insureds and the public,not to provide a fund to protect insurance carriers.citations.ciga role in guaranteeing workers compensation claims is therefore limited ciga is not,and was not created to act as,an ordinary insurance company.citation.it is a statutory entity that depends on the guarantee act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers,duties,and protections.citation.ciga issues no policies,collects no premiums,makes no profits,and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.citation.ciga duties are not with the duties owed by the insolvent insurer under its policy.citation.california insurance guarantee workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,italics added,quoting denny workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.we consider ciga responsibility in the present case in light of the fact it is strictly a creation of statute.
ciga is not authorized to pay obligations to a state.
ciga authority and liability in discharging its statutorily circumscribed duties are limited to paying the amount of covered claims.citations.california insurance guarantee workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.with certain exceptions,covered claims are the obligations of an insolvent insurer,subd.c,including the obligation to provide workers compensation benefits under the workers compensation law of this state,subd.c vi.specifically excluded from the definition of covered claims are among others,any obligations to any state or to the federal government,subd.c,italics added.
there is no dispute about what the governmental exclusion of insurance code section,subdivision c says claims requiring the payment of any obligation to any state are not covered claims for which ciga is liable.the logical and natural reading of the statute,then,is that covered claims do not include obligations to any state.period.county of orange fst sand gravel,th,d.in karaiskos,the court reasoned that edd lien claim for reimbursement of ucd benefits mistakenly paid to a disabled worker constitutes an obligation to a state because,edd is a department of an agency of the state of california,and the unemployment insurance code contemplates reimbursement be made to the edd unemployment compensation disability fund in general,rather than to a particular disabled workers account.karaiskos,supra,th at,d.
edd right to reimbursement from solvent insurers and employers does not supersede ciga release from obligations to the state.
in its answer and at oral argument,edd contended that ciga is required to provide workers compensation benefits and,therefore,it is bound to reimburse edd.edd argues that the legislature has provided a variety of programs to provide benefits to unemployed workers and ucd benefits are only for situations in which the disability sustained by the worker is not work related.unemp,et edd argues that unemployment insurance code section requires it to advance disability benefits when the character of the disability is in dispute,and the recovery provisions provided in section along with those provided for in labor code sections and require mandatory recoupment of edd funds when there has been an adjudication,finding of industrial disability and award.if edd is not reimbursed for its advanced funds in situations in which the unemployment is based on work related injury,edd is,in effect,acting much like a workers compensation insurer.
undisputedly,edd is entitled to reimbursement pursuant to those statutes and conditions when the employer insurance company is solvent.however,the legislature has concluded that not all workers compensation laws should apply to ciga.thus,ciga obligations are not coextensive with those of solvent insurers.as relevant here,the legislature has declared by statute that ciga is not liable for obligations owed to the state or federal government.ucd liens are not the only obligations from which ciga has been excused by law.for example,in cases where both an insolvent and a solvent insurer would be liable for a portion of a cumulative trauma injury,ciga is excused from contributing its percentage and the solvent insurer must absorb the entire cost,subd.c denny workers comp.appeals,supra,th,d industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.garcia th,d.ciga is not liable for penalties for unreasonable delay in payment of workers compensation benefits by the insolvent insurer for which a solvent insurer would be liable under labor code sections and,subd.c.and even when ciga obligations were expanded to include obligations of insolvent employers,section,subdivision c limited that obligation to per claim 
edd argues that requiring it to pay workers compensation benefits compromises the integrity of two separate and distinct programs.it cites department of employment dev.workers comp.appeals bd.garcia d.which quotes california comp.ins.acc.com.d,as follows the statutes here under examination are part of a comprehensive,integrated program of social insurance which,operating in their respective spheres
