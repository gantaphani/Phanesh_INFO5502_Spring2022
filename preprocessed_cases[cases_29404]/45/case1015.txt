amended opinion 
pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,maribea balmert appeals the district court judgment upholding the benefits determination of reliance standard life insurance company reliance standard.concluding that balmert received a full and fair review of her claim and that reliance standard benefits determination was not arbitrary and capricious,we affirm.
background 
balmert began her employment with big lots,as an analyst in.her position required her to sit most of the day and manipulate her hands,fingers,and wrists to use a computer.as a big lots employee,balmert subscribed to an employee benefit plan offering disability insurance under a contract insured and administered by reliance standard.
in august,she stopped working because of symptoms she believed were related to her rheumatoid arthritis.balmert was evaluated by her rheumatologist,kevin hackshaw,on august,but the results of the examination were inconclusive.according to hackshaw,balmert described symptoms of pain in her hands,but the pain that she complains of is disproportionate relative to the amount of synovitis that i see.noting that balmert symptoms suggested some other etiology with stress as a.hackshaw referred her to a neurologist and a psychologist and placed her on temporary medical leave in order to obtain evaluations and recommendations from his colleagues.
on august,balmert had her first consultation with her psychologist,wanda mcentyre.balmert told mcentyre that she had experienced pain from rheumatoid arthritis for a number of years,but her pain level had recently intensified.mcentyre noted that balmert expresses a strong desire to return to her job,but acknowledges that she does not perceive herself as capable of managing the hours,the pressure,and stress at this time.balmert began meeting with mcentyre approximately once every two weeks until she discontinued counseling in december.these counseling sessions generally focused on stress management techniques to prepare balmert to return to work.
after evaluating balmert on october,hackshaw noted that he detected n o active synovitis,that she was doing well,and that her rheumatoid arthritis seems to be under good control.hackshaw also told balmert that she could return to work with some limitations,but advised that she may wish to find a less stressful position or explore some type of flex plan that would allow her to take some of her computer typing work home.a few days later,balmert tearfully expressed her concern to mcentyre regarding hackshaw determination that she could return to work.at future counseling sessions,balmert continued to express concerns about her ability to return to work.
following an evaluation of balmert on february,hackshaw noted that she had no tender points and no synovitis that i could detect,so i think in general she is doing well.regarding balmert work status,hackshaw reported that we had allowed her to return to work with limitations and they apparently stated that she would not be able to return to work due to the limitations.
after evaluating balmert on may,hackshaw noted that balmert rheumatoid arthritis was somewhat stable,that she had no synovitis,and that she had f ull range of motion of joints.hackshaw noted,after evaluating balmert on august,that he was generally pleased with how she is doing.after evaluating balmert on november,hackshaw observed m inimal synovitis and stated that she is doing well with current medications.
balmert filed for disability benefits on february.in a letter dated june,reliance standard denied balmert claim for disability benefits,stating that there is no documentation of a physical condition that would preclude you from performing the material duties of your own occupation.balmert appealed reliance standard denial of her disability benefits.in support of her administrative appeal,balmert provided reliance standard with additional medical and other information pertaining to her claim.
the most important item submitted by balmert in support of her appeal was a modified functional capacity evaluation fce,conducted on march.based on balmert modified fce,matthew crill,a physical therapist,stated 
i do not believe it would be safe or prudent to place balmert in any type of formal work setting.this conclusion is based on her lack of sitting tolerance,lack of standing tolerance,severe deficits in upper extremity strength,severe deficits in fine motor skills,and chronic and intractable subjective pain rating.she would not be able to perform any of her previous work requirements under modified or full duty in the context of a full work day.these recommendations are pending the referring physician final evaluation.
in a letter dated july,hackshaw stated i have received a functional capacity evaluation on balmert from march and agree with the findings from this evaluation.i have been following balmert since and would agree her condition was the same at that time as it is now.
after reviewing this material,reliance standard arranged for balmert to be evaluated by an independent medical examiner,marvin thomas,on september,thomas reported 
while the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis as mentioned seems firm there is very little evidence of active disease and one would guess that it is in relative remission.prognosis is always uncertain in this disease but looks reasonably good for her at this point i would place very little limitation on her in terms of the use of her upper extremities.she might have some difficulty because of her knees with prolonged standing and negotiating steps.in summary while she has a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis,it seems controlled.i see no reason why she can not continue in her present position.
he also noted that t here is no rheumatological basis for disability.on november,he supplemented his report with a statement that b ased on the records that were sent to me it would appear initially that balmert would have difficulty keyboarding and other use of her hands.based on what i see now this would be much less of a problem.
after reviewing the record,reliance standard determined that balmert would have been precluded from performing her own occupation for a closed period of time between august,to september.the determination to grant balmert benefits for a closed period of time was evidently based on thomas opinion that balmert initially would have had difficulty keyboarding and with other use of her hands.balmert was informed of the resolution of her administrative appeal by letter dated december.the letter states,in pertinent part 
since it has been established that total disability is supported from august,to september,balmert file has been returned to the claims department to pay benefits up to the latter date and then close the file on the basis that disability is not supported beyond that date please be advised that our claim decision is now final,as balmert has exhausted any administrative remedies available.
balmert filed an erisa claim against reliance standard in district court on february,challenging the limited grant of disability benefits.on september,the district court granted judgment on the administrative record in favor of reliance standard.the district court concluded that reliance standard determination of benefits was supported by substantial evidence.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the district court.whitaker hartford life accident ins,cir.here,the district court appropriately applied the standard of review because the benefit plan granted the erisa plan administrator discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine eligibility for benefits.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also glenn metlife,cir.under the standard,we will uphold a plan administrator decision if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.baker united mine workers of am.health ret.funds,cir.however,as we have repeatedly stated,the federal courts do not sit in review of the administrator decisions only for the purpose of rubber stamping those dec
