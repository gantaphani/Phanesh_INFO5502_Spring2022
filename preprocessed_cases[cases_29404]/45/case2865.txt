in this case,we are asked to determine the enforceability of an other insurance clause in a liability policy issued by the appellant century surety company century.that clause provided century coverage for its insured would be excess to the coverage of other valid and collectable insurance.century was one of four successive insurers that had provided coverage to a common insured over a five year period.one of those other insurers was the respondent herein,lumbermens mutual casualty company lmc 
after the common insured tendered defense of a suit for damages that had been filed against it,lmc,along with united and reliance,accepted the tender and agreed to provide,and did provide a defense under a reservation of rights ultimately,those insurers settled the case.century,however,rejected the tender and refused to provide a defense,claiming that its coverage was excess to that of the other insurers.century claimed that it had no duty to participate as the underlying claim never threatened to exhaust the primary coverage of the other three insurers.when those insurers made demand upon century for contribution,it filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment validating its coverage position.the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by lmc and the other two insurers.
our review of the relevant cases dealing with this issue persuades us that the proper resolution of this dispute is to ignore century excess clause and compel an equitable proration among all four of the insurers.we will therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
this dispute between insurers arises out of an underlying action in which their common insured,county line framing,county line,was sued.the complaint in that action was filed by ronald arterberry and several other homeowners in certain residential developments located in imperial county that had been constructed by lewis homes of california lewis homes,a general contractor.after it was served with the complaint,lewis homes filed against several of its subcontractors,one of which was county line.
county line was covered during the relevant period by a series of successive commercial general liability policies issued by four different insurers over a five year period beginning on january,through february.united policy number nsa provided coverage from january,through january,reliance policy number nsa was on the risk from january,through february,and lmc issued a policy number for the period from february,through february.century issued a policy policy number ccp for the period from february,through february.
county line tendered defense and indemnity of the underlying arterberry action to united and reliance in october.subsequently,it also tendered defense and indemnity of that action to lmc and century in april.
each of the four policies included iso form cg and,therefore,contained a number of identical policy provisions.all of the policies,for example,provided that the insurer was obligated to pay those sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies and had the duty to defend any suit seeking such damages.each of the policies also provided that the insurance applied to property damage only if the damage was caused by an occurrence during the policy period.they each also contained identical definitions of occurrence and property damage.
the problem before us,however,arises from the principal difference between century policy and the other three.the policies issued by united,reliance and lmc all included the same other insurance provision from iso form cg 
other insurance.
if other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under coverages a or b of this coverage part,our obligations are limited as follows 
primary insurance 
this insurance is primary except when below applies subparagraph b does not apply in this matter.if this insurance is primary,our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is primary.then,we will share with that other insurance by the method described in below 
method of sharing.
if all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares,we will follow this method also.under this approach,each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains,whichever comes first.
if any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares,we will contribute by limits.under this method,each insurer share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.
the century policy,however,included a contractors amendatory endorsement that,inter alia,expressly replaced the other insurance provision of iso form cg as follows 
other insurance 
it is agreed that condition.other insurance of section general liability conditions is deleted and replaced by the following 
other insurance 
if other valid and collectible insurance is available to any insured for a loss we cover under coverage a or b of this coverage part,then this insurance is excess of such insurance and we will have no duty to defend any claim or suit that any other insurer has a duty to defend.
on january,after receiving tender of the arterberry action,reliance and united agreed to provide a defense to county line,subject to a reservation of rights.as already noted,county line subsequently tendered defense of the action to lmc in april of and lmc agreed to defend county line,also subject to a reservation of rights.
as a result of the acknowledgment of a duty to defend by united,reliance and lmc,century advised county line that the other insurance clause in its policy provided that its coverage was excess to any other valid and collectible primary insurance and that,therefore,century would only respond for defense or indemnity in the event the applicable underlying horizontal layer of primary coverage exhausts 
united,reliance and lmc went forward and provided a defense to county line in the arterberry action until the case settled in may.century did not participate.united,reliance and lmc paid defense fees and costs totaling and contributed to county line settlement of the action.relying on the language of its other insurance clause,century denied that it had any obligation to provide either a defense or indemnity to county line until coverage under the united,reliance and lmc policies had been exhausted.put another way,century took the position that under the clear terms of its policy,its coverage was excess to the coverage of the other three insurers.the indemnity coverage afforded by the united,reliance and lmc policies was never exhausted at any relevant time.thus,century argues,its obligation to provide a defense or indemnity never arose.
anticipating the dispute with the other insurers,century filed this action for declaratory relief on july.century sought a determination that it had no duty to defend or indemnify county line in the underlying arterberry action.united,reliance and lmc all filed answers,but lmc also filed a seeking a declaration that century did have a duty to defend county line in the underlying action and that it was liable to contribute a proportional reimbursement of the amount expended by lmc in defending that action.
the parties all stipulated to the facts recited above and then filed for summary judgment.the trial court held that century was a primary insurer and as such had a duty,along with the other three primary insurers,to defend and indemnify the common insured.therefore,it was required to share a contributive burden for the defense and indemnity of county line in the underlying arterberry action.for that reason,the trial court denied century motion and granted the motions filed by united,reliance and lmc.judgment was thereafter entered against century on august,and it has filed a timely appeal 
contentions of the parties 
century contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the other three insurers.the terms of its policy,century argues,clearly provide that its coverage will be excess to any other valid and collectible insurance and therefore it is not liable to provide coverage where such other insurance was present.it claims that it is entitled to the benefit of the contractual bargain that it made with its insured.
as we explain below,there are sound jurisprudential and public policy reasons,reflected in a growing number of recent appellate decisions,that support the rejection of century position.
discussion 
standard of review 
this case comes to us on stipulated facts.the parties agree that summary judgment in favor of someone is appropriate.the issue before us turns upon the proper interpretation and application to be given to the language in a policy of insurance and that is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.we thus review this matter de novo,not being bound by the decision or reasoning of the trial court.pacific indem.bellefonte ins.th,d.we apply a de novo standard of review to an order granting summary judgment when,on undisputed facts,the order is based on the interpretation or application of the terms of an insurance policy.citation.ibid.
general coverage principles relating to other insurance clauses 
there is a distinction between primary and excess insurance coverage that must be first understood.primary coverage is insurance coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches immediately upon the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to liability.citation.primary insurers generally have the primary duty of defense.excess or secondary coverage is coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches only after a predetermined amount of primary coverage has been exhausted.olympic ins.employers surplus lines ins.d.italics in original,fn.omitted.
the excess insurance referred to in this definition is that secondary insurance which provides coverage after other identified insurance is no longer on the risk.the identification of the underlying primary insurance may be as to a particular policy or policies that are specifically described or underlying coverage provided by a particular and specifically described insurer.in short,excess insurance is insurance that is expressly understood by both the insurer and insured to be secondary to specific underlying coverage which will not begin until after that underlying coverage is exhausted and which does not broaden that underlying coverage.wells fargo bank california ins.guarantee th,d.that is not the kind of excess insurance involved in this case.
the excess insurance problem before us arises when one insurer attempts,through the use of a other insurance clause,to reduce a primary coverage obligation into a more limited excess liability.insurance policies commonly include other insurance provisions which attempt to limit the insurer liability to the extent that other insurance covers the same risk.citation.one subcategory is known as pro rata provisions,which look to limit the insurer liability to the total proportion that its policy limits bear to the total coverage available to the insured.citation.there is another subcategory known as excess only clauses,which require the exhaustion of other insurance in effect,this insurer does not provide primary coverage but only acts as an excess insurer.citation.a final subcategory of escape clauses extinguishes the insurer liability if the loss is covered by other insurance.citations.commerce industry ins.chubb custom ins.th,d.
escape clauses came to be so named because they permit an insurer to make a seemingly ironclad guarantee of coverage,only to withdraw that coverage and thus escape liability in the presence of other insurance.citation.when excess only clauses are found in primary liability policies,they are treated the same way as escape clauses.citations.because these types of provisions are disfavored,courts have developed a method of overriding them when two or more applicable policies contain such clauses,both liability and the costs of defense should ordinarily be prorated according to the amount of coverage afforded.citations.the reason for this rule is that the conflicting provisions are deemed essentially irreconcilable if given effect competing clauses would strand an insured between insurers disclaiming coverage in a manner reminiscent of alphonse and gaston.citations.courts have found for the pro rata solution when confronted by a variety of conflicts between differing types of other insurance provisions a predicate for prorating policies with conflicting other insurance provisions is that the policies operate on the same level of coverage,that is to say,two or more policies apply to the same damage or loss suffered by the same party.citations.put another way,a n other insurance dispute can only arise between carriers on the same level,it can not arise between excess and primary insurers.citation.commerce industry ins.chubb custom ins,supra,th at,d italics added.
century is required to prorate 
as the above discussion suggests,problems arise when two or more insurers providing coverage at the same level have other insurance clauses in their respective policies.that is the precise problem presented here.there is no question that century sold,and county line purchased,a primary policy providing coverage for the period.indeed,century policy was the only policy that expressly provided county line coverage for that period.it is because we have here a liability problem and united,reliance and lmc,as the insurers for the preceding four years,had a coverage liability,that we have a multiple insurer dispute.whatever may be said about the merits of century attempt to limit its liability to excess coverage,it is clear that it was not,and it can not claim to be,a true excess or secondary insurer as we have described that term.century was one of county line primary insurers on the claim embodied in the underlying arterberry action.what century seeks to do here is enforce its excess other insurance clause to avoid the contribution and allocation claims of the other insurers that had discharged their primary coverage duty to county line 
historically,it has been generally true that terms of coverage will be honored whenever possible.a number of cases have articulated the view that courts will generally honor the language of excess other insurance clauses when no prejudice to the interests of the insured will ensue.however,there are many exceptions.for example,where two or more primary insurers policies contain excess other insurance clauses purporting to be excess to each other,the conflicting clauses will be ignored and the loss prorated among the insurers on the ground the insured would otherwise be deprived of protection.citations.thus,although a true excess that is solely and explicitly an excess insurer providing only secondary no duty to defend or indemnify until all the underlying primary coverage is exhausted or otherwise not on the risk,primary insurers with conflicting excess other insurance clauses can have immediate defense obligations.citation.provisions often collide with pro rata provisions.the supreme court has expressly decline d to formulate a definitive rule applicable in every case in light of varying equitable considerations which may arise,and which affect the insured and the primary and excess carriers,and which depend upon the particular policies of insurance,the nature of the claim made,and the relation of the insured to the insurers.citation.citation.although it is difficult to harmonize the many cases dealing with this situation,several recent opinions of the courts of appeal have held that in cases of conflict between liability insurance policies stating coverage is excess over all other available insurance and liability insurance policies providing for pro rata contribution,the policies must contribute pro rata to the coverage afforded by the polices.citations.these holdings are based on a variety of public policy considerations.provisions in otherwise primary liability insurance policies have been analogized to escape clauses whereby coverage purports to disappear in the presence of other insurance.such escape clauses are generally d
