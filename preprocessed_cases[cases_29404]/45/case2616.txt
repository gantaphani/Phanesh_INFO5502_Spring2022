the holder of a life estate on a residence and a trust holding the remainder interest separately purchased fire insurance policies on the dwelling from different insurance companies.when the home was destroyed by fire,the life tenant and the trust brought this action,seeking to each obtain the full value of the residence on their respective insurance policies,a total amount in excess of the damage to the residence.invoking the other insurance provision of each policy,the insurers moved for summary judgment on the basis that they had fulfilled their contractual obligations by paying the life tenant and the trust on a pro rata basis according to the value of their insured interests in the destroyed property.we hold that multiple insureds can not recover more than the value of the property destroyed on a fire insurance claim resulting from a single occurrence.we therefore affirm the trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of the insurers.
ann burns held a life estate in the residence located at valparaiso drive,claremont.mitchell weiss was a trustee of the kent burns trust the trust which held the remainder interest in the property.burns obtained insurance on her interest in the residence through california fair plan fair plan.the trust separately insured its interest by a policy issued by clarendon national insurance company clarendon.
the residence was destroyed by fire in.burns and the trust submitted claims to their respective insurers.the trust obtained an estimate to demolish and reconstruct the house for.burns obtained an estimate of as the replacement value of the house.
the insurers determined that burns and the trust were not both entitled to the full insured value of the property on the insurance policies.instead,the insurers determined that burns and the trust should recover on their interests on a pro rata basis.as a result,burns was paid by fair plan.clarendon paid the trust.
burns and the trust filed this action alleging causes of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract against the insurers.they each sought full recovery on their respective insurance policies,rather than the pro rata payout by the insurers.the trial court granted summary judgments in favor of the insurers on the following bases both policies contained the same pro rata liability clause the policies complied with the mandatory provisions of insurance code sections,and the other insurance clauses of each policy called for pro rata payment of percent of the loss between the applicable policies.burns and the trust timely appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
burns and the trust argue they held separately insurable interests in the property and each was required to obtain insurance in order to protect their respective interests.the trial court ruling that pro rata payments were appropriate under the insurance policies made it impossible for burns and the trust to fully protect their respective interests,as neither a life tenant nor remainderman has a claim to insurance proceeds obtained by the other estate holder,and neither has an obligation under california law to repair destroyed property with insurance proceeds.the estate holders argue that other jurisdictions allow a life tenant to recover insurance proceeds equal to the value of the property destroyed.they further argue that pro rata payment is permissible only when there is double insurance as defined in sections and.finally,burns and the trust argue the policy language did not authorize the insurers to make pro rata payment to their policyholders on the ground there was another party with an insurable interest and insurance coverage.
summary judgment standard of review 
summary judgment is properly granted if the record demonstrates that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary judgment may prove an affirmative defense,disprove at least one essential element of the plaintiff cause of action citations or show that an element of the cause of action can not be established.citation.citation.stonegate homeowners staben th,d.if the defendant has made this showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action code civ,subd.p.

b.the estate holders insurable interests 
central to the position of burns and the trust is the notion that each held a separately insurable interest in the destroyed property.under california law,this portion of their argument is indisputably correct,and the insurers do not argue otherwise.
every interest in property,or any relation thereto,or liability in respect thereof,of such a nature that a contemplated peril might directly damnify the insured,is an insurable interest.in common parlance,we speak of a house as being insured,but,strictly speaking,it is not the house but the interest of the owner therein that is insured,and,whether that interest is founded upon a legal title,an equitable title,a lien,or such other lawful interest therein as will produce a direct and certain pecuniary loss to the insurer by its destruction,he has an insurable interest therein.davis phoenix ins.cal.
in corder mcdougall cal,corder,a life tenant obtained insurance on a dwelling and improvements.the life tenant collected on the insurance policy after the property was destroyed by fire,and when the life tenant died,the proceeds passed to his estate.the remainderman demanded payment of the insurance proceeds from the estate,on the basis that the payout substituted for the destroyed property,which had passed to the remainderman upon the death of the life tenant.
our supreme court held there had been no transmutation of the destroyed buildings into money as a substitute,and the life tenant was not obligated to insure the property for the benefit of the remainderman,as e ach of them had an insurable interest in the property,but a policy in the name of one could not cover the interest of the other.the nature and effect of an insurance contract is to indemnify the insured against loss or damage,and not someone else who is not a party to the contract nor has such other party any lawful claim upon the amount realized by the assured under the policy.corder,supra,cal.at,see also d life tenants and remaindermen the general rule is that both a life tenant and a remainderman have an insurable interest in property in which a life interest and a future interest have been created.
while an arrangement obligating the life tenant so to protect the interest of the remainderman might be entered into,there was no such obligation in corder.corder,supra,cal.at.as such,the remainderman had no interest in the insurance proceeds.id.at,see also russell williams cal d,fire insurance indemnifies the owner of an interest in property for a loss,but is not a substitute for the property absent a contractual obligation to insure or other equitable considerations,insurance proceeds are not subject to claims by others who also have an interest in the insured property.
in light of the discussion in corder,burns and the trust had separately insurable interests in the claremont property.
c.the ability to protect an interest in insured property 
having established that burns and the trust each had an insurable interest in the claremont property,they contend that the approach of the trial the insurers to pay on a pro rata them of the ability to fully protect their insurable interests.burns and the trust contend the insurers were each obligated to fully compensate them for their loss in the fire,even if their combined recovery would approximately double the actual damage caused by the fire.while it can not be denied that burns and the trust had separately insurable interests,it does not follow that both could recover the maximum allowed under their respective insurance policies without regard to the value of the destroyed property.our supreme court long ago recognized that the nature of insurance does not provide for recovery in excess of the value of the property destroyed where there is but one loss.
insurance is a contract whereby one,for a consideration,undertakes to compensate another if he shall suffer loss.it is a contract of indemnity.this principle underlies the contract,and it can never,without violence to its essence and spirit,be made by the assured a source of profit,its sole purpose being to guarantee against loss or damage.citation.davis phoenix ins,supra,cal.at.if an insured interest extends to the whole of the subject matter of the property,the insured may recover up to the value of the property,subject to any policy limitation.ibid.however,if the interest of the insured is less than the whole of the property,his right is limited,not by the value of the property,but by the value of his interest.the very meaning of the term indemnity excludes all idea of profit to the insured.ibid.to permit a recovery for more than the value of the insured interest would greatly tend to the destruction of like property under like circumstances,and open the door and tempt men to enter therein for fraudulent purposes.id.at.
neither burns nor the trust have an interest that extends to the whole of the subject matter of the property.davis phoenix ins,supra,cal.at.the interest of each in the claremont property was necessarily less than the total value of their combined interests,as burns life estate by definition was of limited duration,and the trust remainder interest was dependent on the how long burns survived.
as discussed more fully below,fair plan determined that the actual cash value at the time of loss was clarendon received an estimate for reconstruction in the amount of.had each claimant been compensated at these amounts,recovery would be for,an amount far in excess of the loss suffered.an award in this amount can not be reconciled with the language in davis phoenix ins,supra,cal.at page.
authority from other jurisdictions 
relying on authorities,burns and the trust argue that the owner of a life estate may insure his or her estate for the full value of the property and be compensated in that amount.from this premise,they reason each was entitled to recover their full policy limits without regard to any payment to the other insured.the authorities cited do hold that a life tenant may insure the property to its full value.however,the authorities do not address the issue presented here,as none of the cases cited involve a fact pattern in which property is destroyed in a single occurrence and the life tenant and remainderman have separate insurance.to the contrary,none of the foreign authorities cited involves multiple claims for insurance proceeds under separately obtained policies.
in ellerbusch myers,the court held that remaindermen had no claim to fire insurance proceeds collected by the life tenant when the improvements on the estate were destroyed.adopting the rule in the majority of states,the court held that where a life tenant insures the property in his own name and for his own benefit and pays the premiums from his own funds,the life tenant is entitled to the entire proceeds of the insurance upon a loss to the property,even if the insurance covers the full worth of the property.id.at.the court was not confronted with a situation in which the life tenant and remaindermen each had insurance,nor did it speak to that issue.
the decision in home ins.adler,is similar to ellerbusch.a life tenant died minutes after a fire began in the insured property subject to her life estate.the insurance company refused to pay for the destroyed dwelling,arguing that whatever damage was done to the property in the fire fell upon the remaindermen who are not parties to the suit.home ins.adler,supra,at.the court rejected the argument.it is,however,the rule in many jurisdictions,including maryland,that a life tenant who insures the property in his own name in the whole value of the fee is not precluded from recovering the full amount of the policy proceeds.id.at.again,this decision had no issue of multiple insurance policies covering the same loss on behalf of the life tenant and holder of the remainder interest.
similarly,in crook hartford ins,the south carolina supreme court held that both a life tenant and remainderman may obtain fire insurance to protect their respective interests.factually,there was only one insurance policy on the property.the court in crook was thus not called upon to determine whether a recovery in excess of the value of the property destroyed was proper where there was more than one policy of insurance.see also keith estate ex rel.buckland keith,accordingly,we adopt the majority position to conclude that where a life tenant insures the property subject to the life estate in his own name and for his own benefit and pays the premiums from his own funds,he is solely entitled to the proceeds of the insurance upon a loss absent a provision in the instrument creating the estate that requires the life tenant to insure the estate for the benefit of the remainderman an agreement between the life estate tenant and the remainderman that the estate will be insured for the benefit of the remainderman or the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the remainderman and the life tenant.
the trial court correctly noted that if burns were the only insured party in this action,she could recover up to the value of her policy limits.in order to determine if burns and the trust were both entitled to recover up to their policy limits,without regard to the other,we turn to distinct concepts in insurance law double insurance and other insurance.
double insurance under sections and 
applying the maxim expressio unius est exclusion alterius,burns and the trust argue that pro rata payments on fire insurance are appropriate only when there is double insurance as defined in sections and.because the insurance policies in this case did not constitute double insurance,they argue pro rata payments were not permitted.they argue that application of pro rata payments outside of a situation involving double insurance runs afoul of the legislative intent behind sections and.
double insurance exists where the same person is insured by several insurers separately in respect to the same subject and interest.mission ins.hartford ins.d.in case of double insurance,the several insurers are liable to pay losses thereon as follows a in fire insurance,each insurer shall contribute ratably,without regard to the dates of the several policies,subd.a.sections and are incorporated into the standard form fire insurance policy set forth in section.
we agree with burns and the trust that this case does not involve double insurance,because the same person was not insured by fair plan and clarendon,although the insurance was in respect to the same subject and interest.however,we reject the expressio unius est exclusio alterius argument that pro rata payments are only permitted where there is double insurance as defined in sections and.
under the maxim of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,if exemptions are specified in a statute,we may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d.expressio unius est exclusio alterius is no magical incantation,nor does it refer to an immutable rule.like all such guidelines,it has many exceptions estate of banerjee cal d.the maxim does not apply where its application would run counter to a well established principal of law id.at,fn,or where the operation of the rule would contradict a discernible and contrary legislative intent.in re michael cal d.
the interpretation of sections and suggested by burns and the trust limiting pro rata payment on insurance contracts to double insurance situations would run afoul of a well established rule of law and is contrary to a discernible legislative intent in the area of other insurance.the argument runs afoul of the well established rule of law that insurance proceeds are to indemnify,not to generate a profit.if burns and the trust could each recover the
