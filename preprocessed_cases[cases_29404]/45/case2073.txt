service professionals,spi is a business.allstate insurance company maintains a list of vendors to which it refers its insureds for repair work.spi was on this list,but allegedly received a disproportionately low number of the referrals.spi filed the present suit alleging that allstate referral practices amounted to racial discrimination in violation of.the district court granted allstate motion for summary judgment on all claims,and we affirm.
background 
spi is an owned business that repairs and cleans smoke,fire,and water damage to property in oklahoma city.in,allstate established a program it called the quality vendor procedure qvp.under the qvp program,allstate maintained a list of approved vendors of emergency repair services.spi was included on the list of approved vendors.when one of allstate insureds needed a particular emergency repair service,allstate would allow the insured to choose from the qvp vendors who provided that service.although insureds were not obligated to use qvp vendors for their repairs,allstate encouraged their use by guaranteeing the work of qvp vendors.spi alleges that insureds rarely had a preference and that in such circumstances allstate would select the vendor.
spi asserts that allstate promise d to provide business to its qvp vendors.in response,allstate counters with evidence that its qvp vendor form,filled out by spi,stated that allstate personnel will utilize the qvp in such a way as to maximize customer service.we have no obligation to refer customers to this particular vendor.in his deposition,spi orlando harris admitted having filled out this form,but stated without elaboration that they told me that it was on a rotating basis,apparently meaning that allstate told him that,when insureds expressed no vendor preference,allstate would rotate which vendor it chose for the insured.
the same qvp form also stated 
the following is a record of quotations which have been received from this vendor.it is not a contract or agreement of any kind between this vendor and allstate.the only agreement in effect between allstate and this vendor is that if and when this vendor performs work for which allstate is responsible,it will follow the procedures outlined in section ii below.
section ii established standards that the vendor will comply with for service,billing,and recordkeeping.
the district court viewed spi complaint as asserting two distinct claims.the first was that allstate delay in adding spi to the qvp program amounted to a racially discriminatory refusal to contract under failure to contract claim.on appeal,spi disavows any intention to have asserted such a claim.the second was that allstate failure to refer insureds to spi amounted to a discriminatory referral practice motivated by racial animus desire to retaliate against spi for alleging racial discrimination discriminatory referral claim.as discussed below,the discriminatory referral claim itself is premised on two distinct theories first,that allstate was contractually obligated to refer a certain fraction of insureds to spi,and allstate failure to fulfill its contractual obligations based on discriminatory motives violated b and second,that even absent contractual obligation,allstate nonetheless was legally obligated under a to administer its referral program free of racial bias,and that allstate discriminatory refusal to give referrals to spi precluded spi from forming contracts with allstate insureds.
discussion 
standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.c.for purposes of summary judgment,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.simms,at.if the movant has shown the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,the nonmovant can not rest upon his or her pleadings,but must bring forward specific facts sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmovant on that issue.id.
ii.statute of limitations 
before reaching the merits of spi claims,we must determine whether any of the claims are.there are two issues to be resolved in the statute of limitations inquiry first,whether the statute of limitations applicable to each of spi claims under is oklahoma period or a federal period and second,if the applicable limitations period is two years,whether some or all of spi claims were untimely filed.the district court concluded that the applicable limitations period was two years.it further concluded that,while spi claim arising from allstate alleged delay in adding spi to the qvp was untimely which spi does not challenge on appeal,spi discriminatory referral claims arising from allstate alleged failure to refer business to spi once spi had been added to the qvp were timely.
section originally was enacted in,providing in relevant part that a ll persons shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts.the supreme court in patterson mclean credit union,d,held that did not apply to an employer conduct.id.at.t he right to make contracts does not extend to conduct by the employer after the contract relation has been established,including breach of the terms of the contract or imposition of discriminatory working conditions.emphasis added id.at.the right to enforce contracts does not extend beyond conduct by an employer which impairs an employee ability to enforce through legal process his or her established contract rights.emphasis added.
however,the civil rights act of amended,redesignating the original text as a and adding subsections b and c.subsection b,effectively reversing patterson,provides,the term make and enforce contracts includes the making,performance,modification,and termination of contracts,and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship.subsection c provides that applies to discrimination by nongovernmental as well as governmental actors.
in short,then,patterson held that present a provides no cause of action as to an employer conduct.the civil rights act of,codified at b and c,essentially created a new cause of action to challenge an employer discriminatory conduct.
one of two statutes of limitations applies to spi claims.the district court concluded,and allstate argues on appeal,that oklahoma analogous statute of limitations two years applies to all of spi claims.see goodman lukens steel,d holding that federal courts applying should select the most appropriate or analogous state statute of limitations because does not contain its own statute of limitations.spi argues that,enacted in after goodman,compels a different result as to the appropriate statute of limitations for its discriminatory referral claim.section provides that e xcept as otherwise provided by law,a civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section december,may not be commenced later than years after the cause of action accrues.
the question,then,is whether any of spi claims amount to a civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after december.we have explained that was intended to be applicable to legislation enacted after the effective date of this act,which creates a cause of action but is silent as to the applicable limitations period.laurino tate,cir quoting,at.in the past,this circuit has applied the state analogous statute of limitations to claims without discussing the potential applicability of.see thomas denny,cir reynolds sch.dist,denver,cir.
to decide whether statute of limitations applies to any of spi claims,we must answer two subsidiary questions.the first,and by far the more difficult,is whether applies to any claims.the answer to this issue remains hotly debated among federal courts,but the district court assumed without deciding that applied to b claims.the second subsidiary question is whether,if applies to some claims,it applies to any of spi claims in other words,if applies to b claims,whether any of spi claims arise under b rather than a.the district court held that spi claims are based upon as enacted in,and not on the amendments,and thus that they are subject to oklahoma statute of limitations.we agree with the district court that applies to b claims,but we conclude that the district court erred in ruling that none of spi claims arise under b.
the federal courts have split in determining which statute of limitations applies to suits brought under the amended version of.the third circuit has summarized the divergent approaches as follows 
three distinct approaches are recognized in the existing case law 
the first approach.when an act of congress passed after december,creates a claim that did not previously exist,that claim arises under an act of congress enacted after december,even though the new statute creates the new claim by amending a previously existing statute.this view of,when applied in the context of of the civil rights act of,as amended by the civil rights act of,results in claims based on the discriminatory termination of contracts being governed by the federal limitations period,and all other claims based on being governed by the state statute for personal injury claims.
see,miller federal express,d.
the second approach.when an act of congress passed after december,amends a statute existing before that date in a manner that substantially alters its meaning,all claims accruing after the passage of the new statute arise under an act of congress enacted after december,without regard to whether an identical claim arising earlier could have been successfully pursued under the prior statute.this view of,when applied in the context of of the civil rights act of,as amended by the civil rights act of,results in all claims arising after the amendment being governed by the four year federal limitations period.
see,alexander precision machining.
the third approach.when an act of congress passed after december,amends a statute existing before that date,as opposed to creating new law without reference to previously existing statutory language,all claims accruing after the passage of the amendment arise under an act of congress enacted before december,without regard to whether an identical claim arising earlier could have been successfully pursued under the prior statute.this view,when applied in the context of of the civil rights act of,as amended by the civil rights act of,results in all claims accruing after the passage of the amendments being governed by the state limitations period for personal injury claims.

each of the foregoing interpretations is textually plausible.
zubi,cir footnote omitted.
two circuits have resolved the issue,both holding that does not apply to any claims under,regardless of whether they fall under a or b,adopting what zubi identifies as the third approach.see madison ibp,cir zubi,at.one other circuit has acknowledged the issue but declined to resolve it.taylor.intertribal council title iv,cir per curiam.
a june district court decision counted approximately district court decisions on the issue and concluded that the majority of district courts also have adopted the zubi approach.adams donnelley sons,d.compare,campbell passenger amtrak,d,following zubi,and coleman shoney,d,same,with turner passenger amtrak,d,declining to follow zubi,and adams,d at same.
here,the district court assumed without deciding that the first approach applied.on appeal,spi argues that the first approach should apply,while allstate argues that the third approach should apply.after reviewing the arguments offered by counsel and other courts in support of their positions on this issue,we agree with spi that limitations period applies to claims that were created by the civil rights act of,claims under b.the case for this,zubi first approach is most convincingly made by the district court opinion in adams,which we quote at length 
section as originally written,protected just two rights the right to make contracts,which extend ed only to the formation of a contract,but not to problems that may arise later from the conditions of continuing employment,and the right to enforce contracts,which embrace d protection of a legal process,and of a right of access to legal process,that will address and resolve claims without regard to race.patterson mclean credit union,d.the civil rights act of,which became law,was enacted on november,revised in other words,the version of in the act created new causes of action that were not cognizable under the version of the statute.
the question for the court is whether this proposition historically applying state statutes of limitations to actions was altered by congress enactment on december,of 
looking at the plain language of,this seems to this court to be an easy question to answer,though judging by the panoply of ways in which the question has been framed and answered this is apparently a minority view.the seventh circuit has yet to address the question of whether governs claims brought under the act in fact only one circuit court,the third,has actually considered,analyzed and answered the question.in zubi,cir the court held that applies only when congress establishes a new cause of action without reference to preexisting law thus,because congress chose to build upon a statutory text that has existed since,the court held,zubi civil action arises under an act of congress enacted before december,and is governed by new jersey statute of limitations.id.at.the court can not imagine how this is possible in patterson,the united states supreme court clearly held that claims such as those asserted by zubi discriminatory firing did not arise under the version of.see patterson,at.the right to make contracts does not extend,as a matter of either logic or semantics,to conduct by the employer after the contract relation has been established.rather,such claims can be made only by virtue of congress enactment of b.
we think the first approach is the only one true to the language of the statute.
j udicial inquiry into the applicability of begins and ends with what does say and with what does not.connecticut national bank germain,d.section applies to any civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after december.we see nothing ambiguous in this language,at least as it relates to the claims at issue in this lawsuit.first,although some courts have found otherwise,we do not think the statute reference to an act of congress enacted is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.enact means to make into law by authoritative act,black law dictionary ed thus every act of congress,whether it reflects a considered subject or amends a previously existing statute,is enacted.to the extent there could ever be any doubt about whether the civil rights act of was an act of congress or whether it was enacted,the language of the law itself should set the record straight.congress specifically used both words in the law preamble 
an act to amend the civil rights act of to strengthen and improve federal civil rights laws,to provide for damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination,to clarify provisions regarding disparate impact actions,and for other purposes.
be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled,
civil rights act of,stat.emphasis added.
second,there is no question that civil action as used in means claim or cause of action.see david siegal,the statute of limitations in federal practice,including the new general one in federal question cases.finally,there is no question that arising under means stemming from or originating in.see black law dictionary ed.
in short,the meaning of is quite simple whenever congress,after december,passes legislation that creates a new cause of action,the statute of limitations applies to that cause of action.as applied to,claims that under patterson could be brought under the version of clearly arise under an act of congress that was enacted prior to enactment date,and the statute does not apply to such claims.claims that patterson said could not be brought under the version of,but which can be made only by virtue of b,just as clearly arise under the civil rights act of,an act of congress enacted after.section applies to those claims.having concluded that the language of the statute is unambiguous,we need not consider the statute legislative history.
the only other district judge in this circuit who has addressed this issue concluded that does not apply to any claims under,including claims given life by b it relied in part on legislative history that it read as indicating that congress did not view the civil rights act of as creating any new causes of action,but rather as restoring to its proper scope following the supreme court decision in patterson.this court does not agree.first,as indicated above,resort to legislative history is inappropriate where,as here,the language of the statute is unambiguous.but more importantly,whatever label congress chose to give to its enactment,it was not restoring,it was changing it.it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,marbury madison,cranch,and in patterson the supreme court determined not that should be narrowed despite its original intent,but rather that the statute,as enacted in,was never meant to reach certain forms of conduct.patterson,at.when congress enacted b,it thus undeniably created new causes of action,whether or not that is how it chose to label what it had done.
a number of courts have noted that our interpretation would result in courts applying two different statutes of limitations for every federal statute enacted prior to december,and amended thereafter to create new types of claims.the answer to that is.first,the court has not been asked to decide whether governs every legislative amendment the court must decide only whether the statute governs the claims raised by these plaintiffs in this lawsuit.second,courts routinely apply different statutes of limitations to different claims,including different claims made within a single lawsuit.and third,even if applying multiple statutes of limitations is inconvenient,that is what congress has required,and the courts are not at liberty to second guess an unambiguous statute.
to summarize,the court finds that is unambiguous and,by its terms,applies to all claims arising out of the civil rights act of,which was enacted after december,the date on which was enacted.section,by its terms,does not apply to claims arising under the version of these claims continue to be governed by the most analogous state law statute of limitations,here,illinois personal injury statute of limitations.
adams,d at citations omitted.
the question of whether b was enacted for purposes of,despite its being labeled an amendment,was also answered convincingly in the affirmative by judge alito in his dissent in zubi 
the term act of congress used in means a law enacted in one of the ways prescribed by article i,of the constitution.acts of congress are published in the united states statutes at large,which constitute legal evidence of what the law provides.
section is not itself an act of congress rather,it is a codification of two prior acts.subsection a of is a codification of section of the revised statutes of.until,it was unsettled whether the phrase make and enforce contracts in this provision reached the discriminatory termination of a contractual relationship,but in patterson mclean credit union,d,the supreme court held that this language did not apply to conduct occurring after the formation of a contract.t he patterson opinion finally decided what had always meant.rivers roadway express,d.
thus,it is not itself the law but only prima facie evidence of the law,a.see united states national bank of oregon independent insurance agents of america,d.
subsection a may be traced to section of the civil rights act of in,however,congress enacted into law the revised statutes of,a massive revision,reorganization,and reenactment of all statutes in effect at the time,accompanied by a simultaneous repeal of all prior ones.united states national bank of oregon,at.the relevant sections of the civil rights acts of and were thus repealed and then as section of the revised statutes of.see runyon mccrary,d.
when the was compiled,the provisions of stat.were codified at.in,when stat.was amended,the amendments were also,of course,reflected in.section of the united states code has never itself been enacted as positive law,though,and it is thus only prima facie evidence of the provisions of stat.as amended by the civil rights act of.see a.united states bank of oregon independent insurance agents of america,d.
in,shortly after enacting,congress broadened the scope of this provision.section of the civil rights act of,stat,amended section of the revised statutes and defined the phrase make and enforce contracts to include the termination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms and conditions of the contractual relationship.this new provision is codified as b.thus,as a result of the act,a plaintiff may now sue under for discriminatory termination of that is precisely what zubi did here.
it is beyond dispute that the civil rights act of qualifies as an act of congress in the sense in which that term is invariably used.we would have to use the term act of congress in in an entirely idiosyncratic way in order to reach a contrary conclusion.
at,alito,dissenting parallel citations omitted.
for the reasons set forth by the district court in adams and by judge alito in his zubi dissent,we hold that applies to claims brought under b,but not to claims brought under a.laurino,at holding that did not apply to claims because amendment to did not create a cause of action.
the next matter to resolve is identifying which,if any,of spi claims arise under a,and which,if any,arise under b.the amended complaint does not set forth distinct causes of action,but includes the general allegation that spi has been denied contracts directly with allstate and has been denied referrals by allstate in any fashion equal or comparable to vendors.on appeal,spi disclaims any intent to bring claims based on allstate conduct prior to entering into the qvp agreements with spi,explaining that w hile it claimed as part of its background facts that it had been denied entry into the qvp program until or,spi expressly claimed that discrimination continued after spi was placed on the qvp program.characterizing its suit as one for conduct,spi argues on appeal that limitations period governs the suit.
while there is no indication that any part of spi suit is based on conduct occurring prior to the formation of spi contract with allstate,spi does challenge allstate conduct spi prospective contracts with allstate insureds.spi couches this claim in the alternative.first,assuming that allstate has a contractual obligation to provide a pro rata share of referrals to spi,spi claims that allstate discriminatory refusal to comply with such contractual obligations violates b.second,assuming that allstate qvp program did not rise to the level of a contractual obligation to give referrals to spi,spi claims that the discriminatory referral of business would be actionable under a because allstate allegedly discriminatory referral practice impeded spi ability to make contracts with allstate insureds.
the district court ruled that all of spi claims are based upon as enacted in,and not on the amendments,and thus remain subject to oklahoma statute of limitations.for the reasons just discussed,this ruling is correct as applied to spi claims that do not rely on the existence of a contract between spi and allstate,but not as applied to the claims grounded in such a contract.the former claims are properly viewed as raising conduct,while the latter raise conduct oklahoma limitations period applies to the conduct claims,which arise under a,but limitations period applies to the conduct claims,which arise under b.
the parties do not dispute that the discriminatory referral claims arose less than four years prior to the filing of suit.therefore,the discriminatory referral claim based
