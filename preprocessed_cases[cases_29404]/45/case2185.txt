as the district court aptly put it,this insurance dispute under florida law concerning uninsured motorist coverage presents an intersection of the principles announced in allstate ins.boynton,so d,and in reid state farm fire cas,so d,and its progeny.the issue is whether an injured person who is an insured under multiple automobile policies can seek uninsured motorist benefits pursuant to those policies if the vehicle involved in the accident is a covered vehicle under the liability portion of the policies but there is no liability coverage for the accident due to exclusions.
the district court ruled that reid and its progeny governed,and granted summary judgment in favor of allstate insurance company and against richard gares.after surveying florida law,we agree and affirm.
richard gares is the brother of wesley gares and,during the relevant period,resided in the same household as wesley.wesley owns top gun muffler,an automobile repair shop located in okaloosa county,florida.richard is not an employee of top gun.
on october,carnac kitchens,delivered one of its trucks to top gun for repairs.wesley drove the truck onto a lift in a manner that caused the truck to proceed off the front of the lift and severely injure richard,who was visiting wesley at top gun.
richard sought payment from top gun liability insurer,which tendered its policy limits to him.richard also made a demand on allstate insurance company,the automobile liability insurer for carnac kitchens,the owner of the truck.allstate denied liability,presumably under castillo bickley,so d automobile owner,absent its own negligence,is not liable for the negligent operation of its automobile while left at a repair shop.
finally,richard made a separate demand on allstate for uninsured motorist benefits under two automobile policies issued by allstate to wesley for four other vehicles.allstate denied coverage,and this lawsuit ensued.the parties have stipulated that if richard prevails he is entitled to under the allstate policies.
the liability portions of the policies issued to wesley which are identical in all relevant respects obligate allstate to pay for all damages a person insured is legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury or property damages.policy at part i,bodily injury and property damage.the parties agree that wesley is a person insured when using a auto,the carnac kitchens truck.see id.at part i,persons insured.
an insured auto is defined,in relevant part,as any auto described on the policy declarations and the auto you replace it with,and a auto used by you or a resident relative with the permission of the owner.id.at part i,insured autos.it is undisputed that the carnac kitchens truck is an insured auto.nevertheless,there is no liability coverage for richard injuries because of the following exclusions auto business operations such as repairing,servicing,testing,of autos a auto while being used in any business or occupation of a person insured and bodily injury to any person related to a person insured by blood,marriage or adoption and residing in that person insured household.see id.at part i,exclusions.
under the uninsured motorist portions of the policies,allstate is obligated to pay only those damages which a person insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured auto because of bodily injury sustained by a person insured.id.at part iv,uninsured motorist insurance.the parties agree that richard is a person insured under the uninsured motorist portions because he resided in the same household as wesley at the time of the accident.see id.they also agree that the carnac kitchens truck is an insured auto because it was a motor vehicle operated by the insured with the permission of the owner,but not furnished for the insured regular use.see id.
the policies define an uninsured auto,in pertinent part,as follows 
a motor vehicle which has no bodily injury liability bond or insurance policy in effect at the time of the accident.
a motor vehicle,other than a motor vehicle insured under the liability portion of this policy,for which the insurer denies coverage.
a vehicle insured under the liability portion of a motor vehicle insurance policy which causes bodily injury to you or a resident relative while being operated by a person other than you or a resident relative and which is excluded under the liability portion of the policy.
an underinsured motor vehicle.an underinsured motor vehicle is one which has liability protection in effect and applicable at the time of the accident but in an amount less than the damages the person insured is legally entitled to recover.
id.at emphasis added.significantly,the policies also provide that a n uninsured auto is not a vehicle insured under the liability portion of a motor vehicle insurance policy,unless that auto causes bodily injury to you or a resident relative while being operated by a person other than you or a resident relative and which is excluded under the liability portion of the policy.id.emphasis added.
although the carnac kitchens truck might initially be thought of as an uninsured auto because it is an underinsured motor vehicle,the definitions quoted above prevent such a result.first,the definition of uninsured auto specifically excludes any motor vehicle insured under the liability portion of this policy,and the truck is,as noted earlier,an insured auto.second,the truck can not be considered an uninsured auto because it was being driven by wesley,the named insured and a resident relative of richard.
faced with these undisputed facts,the district court concluded that there was no uninsured motorist coverage for richard injuries under wesley allstate policies.relying on reid state farm fire casualty,so d,and distinguishing allstate ins.boynton,so d,the district court ruled that the carnac kitchens truck could not be both an insured auto under the liability portions of the policies and an uninsured auto under the uninsured motorist portions of the same policies.
reid,decided by the florida supreme court in,involved a passenger who was injured in an accident involving an automobile driven by her sister,owned by her father,and insured by state farm.although the automobile was covered under the policy and the sister was an insured,the policy contained a clause providing that there was no coverage for bodily injury to any insured or any family member of an insured residing in the same household.because the passenger lived together with her insured coverage was unavailable if the exclusion was valid.so d at.
the passenger requested that the exclusion be declared invalid.in the alternative,she sought uninsured motorist coverage under the policy,reasoning that if the exclusion applied,the automobile was rendered uninsured.the florida supreme court upheld the exclusion,and then rejected the claim for uninsured motorist benefits because the policy provided that an uninsured motor vehicle may not be the vehicle defined in the policy as the insured motor vehicle we hold that the family car in this case is not an uninsured motor vehicle.it is insured and does not become uninsured because liability coverage may not be available to a particular individual here,the family car,which is defined in the policy as the insured motor vehicle,is the same vehicle which the passenger,under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy,claims to be an uninsured motor vehicle.id.at.
the florida supreme court did not stop there.it expressly distinguished lee state farm mut.auto.ins,so d dca,a case which had,on similar but not identical facts,allowed recovery of uninsured motorist benefits.it explained,by citing to hartford accident indemnity fonck,so d dca,that in lee the uninsured motor vehicle which caused the injury was not the same vehicle as the insured motor vehicle named in the policy,and unlike reid,there was no policy provision which provided that the term uninsured motor vehicle does not include the vehicle named in the policy as the insured motor vehicle.so d at.
thus,reid holds that uninsured motorist coverage is not available if the claim is made against the same policy which provides liability c
