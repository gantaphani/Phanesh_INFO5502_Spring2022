background 
in april loretta initially applied for a life insurance policy from metlife.in the application,she listed her son,christopher justofin as her personal physician,mentioning that justofin treated her for occasional arthritis of her hands and feet.metlife issued the life insurance policy to loretta in the amount of.
five years later,at the age of,loretta applied to increase the policy amount,from to,by completing an application for change of placed personal life insurance form.it contained the following pertinent questions and answers.
has any person ever received treatment,attention,or advice from any physician,practitioner or health facility for,or been told by any physician,practitioner or health facility that such person had 
j arthritis,paralysis,or disease or deformity of the bones,muscles or joints yes 
in the past years,has any physician,practitioner or health facility examined,advised or treated any person yes 
the application instructed loretta to provide the details about her yes answers in questions and,including the name of each physician,nature and severity of condition,frequency of attacks,specific diagnosis,and treatment.she provided names of several doctors and the details of surgeries and treatment,including her foot surgery for arthritis.although loretta listed several doctors who treated her,including eugene jacobs her then personal physician,she did not mention justofin in this change application.in part b of the application,loretta again noted that she had arthritis and that she prednisone in for her arthritis when she owned a pharmacy.part c,the paramedical evaluation,shows that loretta disclosed that she had an unknown type of arthritis that caused noticeable hand swelling.effective may,metlife issued the increase in death benefit coverage.
loretta died on december.metlife paid the justofins based on the original policy but informed them that it was voiding the amended policy increase.initially,metlife stated reason for voiding the increase was that loretta failed to disclose that she had lupus the justofins brought suit against metlife in the eastern district of pennsylvania claiming breach of contract,bad faith,and negligence.metlife counterclaimed,seeking a declaration that the policy increase was void ab initio,and moved for summary judgment.the district court granted metlife summary judgment motion on the negligence issue but denied it as to the other issues.
metlife then filed a motion for reconsideration based on the evidence that loretta used prednisone,a drug used to treat lupus.metlife deposed justofin regarding this matter.he testified that he was a personal physician of his mother from until sometime in.during this period,justofin visited loretta weekly at her home to examine her and also to pick up his mail justofin asserted that,although he treated his mother for arthritis,she never had lupus.although justofin was not sure what kind of arthritis loretta had,he speculated that she had rheumatoid arthritis,osteoarthritis,or both justofin also mentioned that he used to write a supply of prednisone for loretta arthritis and she would adjust the dose depending on her condition justofin also opined that prednisone is a medication routinely prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis,rather than osteoarthritis.
metlife thereupon motioned for leave to file a supplemental counterclaim,seeking a declaration that the policy increase was void based on loretta failure to disclose that her son had treated her and prescribed prednisone for her the district court granted the motion.metlife then sought summary judgment on its new counterclaim and on the justofins breach of contract and bad faith claims.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of metlife on all claims.the justofins appealed.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.fakete aetna,cir citing fogleman mercy,cir.we therefore apply the same standard the district court employed under federal rule of civil procedure c.we should affirm the district court summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a fact is material when its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,and a dispute about a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.in reviewing the record,we draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.id.at.
iii.discussion 
breach of contract.is the policy amendment void as a matter of law because of allegedly false material misrepresentations 
we first determine whether the policy amount increase was void as a matter of law.if so,we shall affirm the district court summary judgment in favor of metlife on the justofins breach of contract claim.
to void an insurance policy under the law of pennsylvania the insurer has the burden to prove that the insured made a false representation the insured knew the representation was false when it was made or the insured made the representation in bad faith and the representation was material to the risk being insured.coolspring stone supply,am.states life ins,cir citing shafer john hancock mut.life ins.the insurer has the burden to prove all three elements by clear and convincing evidence.batka liberty mut.fire ins,cir pennsylvania requires that an insurer establish the defense of fraud in the application by clear,precise and indubitable evidence and that the factfinder be satisfied of the elements of the defense by clear and convincing evidence.citations omitted.
this heightened burden of proof should be taken into account in ruling on summary judgment.anderson,at.t he determination of whether a given factual dispute requires submission to a jury must be guided by the substantive evidentiary standards that apply to the case.consequently,where the clear and convincing evidence standard applies,the trial judge must inquire whether the evidence presented is such that a jury applying that evidentiary standard could find only for one side.in this case,if the evidence in the record reasonably supports the inescapable conclusion that metlife has shown all three elements to void the policy by clear and convincing evidence,we shall affirm the summary judgment.but if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could find that metlife has not shown all the elements by clear and convincing evidence,we shall reverse.
a did loretta make false representations 
in this context,we first decide whether a rational jury must find that metlife has shown that loretta made false representations.the district court found that her failure to list justofin treatment,along with his prescription of prednisone,in her application so qualified.
in pennsylvania,a false representation includes omission of an insured medical information.see grimes prudential ins.of,using the term a misstatement of fact to refer to an insured failure to disclose fully her medical history.the justofins correctly point out that their mother indeed disclosed in her initial application that justofin was her personal physician but loretta failed to inform metlife about her son prescription of prednisone.although the justofins claim that loretta disclosed that she took prednisone for her arthritis,the record shows that she listed only her of prednisone in but not her more recent use of the drug between and.because there is no evidence to contradict that loretta failed to disclose this information,no genuine dispute exists as to whether her representations were false.
b did loretta know that her representations were false or did she make them in bad faith 
next,metlife must show that loretta knew her representations were false or she made them in bad faith.while both involve state of mind,our discussion focuses primarily on bad faith,which was also the focus of the district court.
the justofins assert that a genuine issue of material fact exists whether loretta omissions were innocent,inadvertent mistakes rather than bad faith misrepresentations.if so,the district court erred in determining loretta bad faith as a matter of law.
metlife argues that we should adopt the summary judgment standard that pennsylvania courts apply to insurance fraud cases.it contends that this case falls into one of the rare instances in which pennsylvania courts would infer bad faith as a matter of law when considering summary judgment,and therefore we must also do so.we disagree for the following reasons.
a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction follows a federal rule of civil procedure when one of the federal rules controls the point in dispute.hanna plumer,d.when the federal rule speaks to the point in dispute and is valid,it is controlling,and we need not pay any regard to state provisions,regardless whether they are in conflict with the federal rule.charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.only if there is no federal rule covering the point in dispute,or the scope of the federal rule is not sufficiently broad to control the issue before us,do we ask whether to apply the state law.walker armco steel,d see also mcewen delta air lines,cir only when the federal rules are silent need the federal court ask whether to use state rules as templates.citing walker.even then,a federal court must apply the federal rule within its sphere of coverage.wright,miller cooper,supra.
rule c directly speaks to and thus controls the process pertaining to loretta intent in this case.metlife in fact concedes that rule c is sufficiently broad enough to cover the point in dispute.appellee letter brief at.nevertheless,it argues that we are compelled to adopt the pennsylvania law because,it claims,there is no conflict between the federal and state law in this case.contrary to metlife argument,however,when a federal rule is clearly applicable as is the case here,the absence of conflicting state law is all the more reason to adopt the controlling federal rule.walker,at.accordingly,by applying pennsylvania substantive law,we do not impress a different procedural requirement on rule 
generally an insured state of mind is an issue of fact for the jury.coolspring,at.the issue of intent is particularly inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment because evaluating state of mind often requires the drawing of inferences from the conduct of parties about which reasonable persons might differ.riehl travelers ins,cir citing ness marshall,cir.
contrary to the district court finding,we are not satisfied that justofin testimony and loretta answers in her policy applications incontrovertibly established her bad faith.justofin merely testified that she suffered from arthritis of an unknown type,which she disclosed.the testimony also showed that loretta saw her son on a weekly basis for a few years and he prescribed prednisone for her during that period.she did not disclose this information in her application.with respect to justofin treatment,the district court noted loretta disclosure of justofin treatment of her arthritis in her initial application.this shows,the court concluded,that loretta in bad faith did not disclose justofin treatment in the application.the district court also referred to loretta omission of justofin prescription of prednisone and contrasted it with her disclosure of taking prednisone from many years before.
it is possible that a jury could find it suspicious that loretta somehow thought it unnecessary to reveal this information.but we do not believe that the only reasonable inference from this evidence is that loretta must have had or,at least,must have believed that she had rheumatoid arthritis and in bad faith concealed this information from metlife by omitting her son treatment visits and prescription of prednisone.as this case came to us on summary judgment,all permissible inferences are to be drawn in the justofins favor.anderson,at.a jury might conclude that loretta did not think that her son casual visits were so important to report in her new application in great detail,especially when she had already disclosed that he was her personal physician and treating her for arthritis in her initial application,and when he had discontinued his weekly visits a year or two before the time of her new application.furthermore,a jury might determine that loretta not only was unaware of the type of arthritis she was suffering but also believed that further detail on the application,such as taking a particular drug,was unnecessary when she already stated that she had arthritis that was treated,inter alia,by a surgery.
we again emphasize that metlife has the burden to prove loretta state of mind,a difficult task nearly always and especially when she is dead.in the context of this case,loretta knowledge of misrepresentations and bad faith may not be inferred as a matter of law,as they are genuine issues of material fact to be decided by a jury.
c were the misrepresentations material 
the third issue we consider is whether the information loretta failed to disclose was material.information is material if it would have influenced the judgment of the insurer in making the contract or in fixing a premium.piccinini teachers protective mut.life ins.the district court found that loretta was treated for rheumatoid arthritis and that as a matter of law the information was material since metlife guidelines showed that rheumatoid arthritis,a more serious type of arthritis than osteoarthritis,was an important factor in determining the insurance risk.but it is not at all obvious from the record that metlife would have cancelled the policy or even demanded a higher premium had it known that justofin was prescribing prednisone.this is because metlife adjusts its premiums based on the severity of an insured rheumatoid arthritis,not the type of prescription drugs involved.metlife argues that had loretta disclosed her use of prednisone for either moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis,there could have been a decline of the increase in coverage.the record before us,however,does not clearly establish that loretta even had rheumatoid arthritis or that her use of prednisone was to treat her presumably rheumatoid condition therefore,a jury must determine whether the undisclosed information was material.
did metlife waive its right to contest the validity of the amended policy by failing to investigate 
we do not agree with the justofins,however,that metlife waived its
