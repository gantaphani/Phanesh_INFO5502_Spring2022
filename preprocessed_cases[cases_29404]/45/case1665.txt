jack mccord,daniel martin,and frances martin appeal the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant minnesota mutual life insurance company on claims arising out of minnesota mutual alleged fraudulent and deceptive practices in the marketing and sales of vanishing premium life insurance policies.we affirm.
mccord purchased a life insurance policy from minnesota mutual in.he alleges that the insurance agent represented,through a sales illustration,that the policy premiums would vanish after the seventh year of the policy because the policy dividends would be large enough to pay the premiums as they came due without mccord making additional payments for the remainder of his life.in,mccord began receiving annual policy review statements aprs indicating that the actual declared dividends were less than those projected in the illustration.mccord testified that he knew in that premium payments would be required for at least two years beyond the period he allegedly was promised in.appellee app.at.in,mccord arranged to have the policy reissued after reviewing another sales illustration indicating that policy dividends would exceed policy premiums after the third year of the reissued policy.after making nine annual premium payments from to,mccord contacted minnesota mutual in to inquire about his policy performance.when he learned that his premiums would not vanish as expected,he cancelled the policy.
the martins assert that the same insurance agent persuaded them to purchase a minnesota mutual life insurance policy in after representing,through sales illustrations,that the policy would require only ten annual premium payments,after which no further payments would be required.the martins policy was reissued three times.the martins admit to never having fully read the policy,sales illustrations,or aprs provided by minnesota mutual.nevertheless,daniel martin admitted that if he had read the aprs that he received after he would have recognized that the policy was not performing as he anticipated.id.at.
mccord filed this purported class action in louisiana state court in july,asserting that minnesota mutual alleged fraudulent and deceptive practices in the marketing and sales of vanishing premium life insurance policies gave rise to five causes of action under louisiana law unfair or deceptive acts breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing negligent misrepresentation and omissions breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.defendants removed the action,and the united states district court for the district of louisiana remanded.mccord filed an amended petition,adding daniel martin and frances martin as plaintiffs.mccord had also named the louisiana insurance agent,earl venable,as a defendant in his original petition,and after remand,venable filed a motion for summary judgment and dismissal of the claim against him.the state court entered a consent judgment dismissing venable without prejudice and indicated that plaintiffs had thirty days to reinstate their claims against venable,which they failed to do.venable dismissal from the action created complete diversity between the plaintiffs,who are louisiana residents,and defendant,a minnesota corporation.
minnesota mutual again removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana,and plaintiffs motion to remand was denied.the clerk of the multidistrict litigation panel then issued an order transferring the case to the district of minnesota,where the district court again denied plaintiffs motion to remand to louisiana state court.the minnesota district court subsequently granted minnesota mutual motion for summary judgment,concluding that louisiana substantive law governed all plaintiffs claims were under the relevant louisiana prescriptive periods and,alternatively,plaintiffs claims failed on the merits.mccord and the martins appeal,arguing that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction minnesota substantive law should govern the claims are not and the district court erred in applying the parol evidence rule to exclude the sales illustrations from consideration.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,giving the nonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences supported by the record.eddings city of hot springs,cir.we must determine whether the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
subject matter jurisdiction 
appellants argue that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the parties are not diverse and because the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional minimum.although the parties argued subject matter jurisdiction in their briefs,the district court summary judgment order does not address this argument,and appellants did not pursue it at oral argument.nevertheless,because the parties may not expand the limited jurisdiction of the federal courts by waiver or consent,we consider a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction even when first raised on appeal.see jader principal mut.life ins,cir.we review such issues de novo.see gilbert monsanto,cir.where,as here,the complaint alleges no specific amount of damages or an amount under the jurisdictional minimum,the removing party,minnesota mutual,must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds.see trimble asarco,cir t he party invoking federal jurisdiction must prove the requisite amount by a preponderance of the evidence.the complaint will be dismissed if it appears to a legal certainty that the value of the claim is actually less than the required amount.id.internal marks omitted.
the appellants argue that complete diversity does not exist because defendant venable,a louisiana resident,was improperly dismissed in state court.in a separate order denying appellants motion to remand,appellee app.at,the minnesota district court fully addressed this argument and concluded that the state court dismissal order controls under the law of the case doctrine.we agree with the district court analysis in that order,and we conclude that there is complete diversity between the remaining,who are louisiana residents,and minnesota mutual,a minnesota corporation.
the appellants also assert that the amount in controversy as to each appellant is below the jurisdictional minimum of.minnesota mutual argues that the appropriate measure of the amount in controversy in this case is the face value of the relevant life insurance policies for mccord policy and for the martins policy.see in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices,aff,cir where plaintiffs seek equitable relief pertaining to the enforcement of insurance policies,the face value of the policy is the measure of the amount in controversy.see also guardian life ins.of am.muniz,cir noting that the face value of life insurance policies constitutes the amount in controversy.cas.ins.harmon,cir finding that the value of future benefits under a disability policy is considered in determining the jurisdictional amount where the validity of the policy is at issue.additionally,minnesota mutual asserts that a settlement letter that it received from appellants requesting over in damages for each plaintiff is sufficient to establish the jurisdictional minimum.see addo globe life accident ins,cir holding that a demand letter constitutes other paper under b for purpose of ascertaining the amount in controversy.
although appellants were unable or unwilling to pay their premiums after,the complaint specifically states that they paid all premiums through the vanishing date allegedly represented to them by venable in expectation of whole life coverage.accordingly,if they would receive the equitable relief that they have requested,they would be due the face value of their policies upon their death,an event bound to happen.guardian life,at citation omitted.therefore,in lieu of a potentially smaller award based solely on compensatory damages,the face value is the amount that minnesota mutual would eventually have to pa
