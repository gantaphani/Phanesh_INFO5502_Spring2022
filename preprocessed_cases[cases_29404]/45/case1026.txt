the cincinnati insurance company cic sued beazer homes investments,llc in a action to establish that cic was not obligated to cover the costs that beazer incurred in repairing water damage to several houses that beazer had built as the general contractor.the damage was allegedly caused by faulty workmanship on the part of beazer subcontractors.cic motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted by the district court,which held that the damage at issue was not property damage caused by an occurrence as defined in beazer insurance policies with cic.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
from to,crossmann communities,was the general contractor for the construction of houses in the beaumont subdivision near lexington,kentucky.subcontractors performed all or most of the actual construction work.during this time,crossmann entered into a series of commercial general liability cgl insurance policies with cic the policies.the policies generally covered the ultimate net loss that crossmann was legally obligated to pay because of property damage caused by an occurrence.crossmann merged into beazer in,and beazer became the to crossmann insurance policies.
after the beaumont houses were completed and sold,several homeowners complained of damage as a result of water intrusion into their homes.the homeowners claimed that the damage was the result of faulty workmanship by crossmann its subcontractors.
procedural history 
after beazer began investigating and repairing the damage,it submitted a claim to cic,seeking coverage for the costs incurred in making the repairs.beazer specifically sought reimbursement for the costs of repairing properly constructed components of the houses that had been damaged by the water intrusion,which in turn had been caused by the faulty construction of other components.in response,cic sought a declaratory judgment holding that it was not liable for such costs.beazer filed an answer and counterclaim,seeking a declaratory judgment that cic was obligated to cover the costs of repair.cic subsequently filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
the parties agreed in the district court that indiana law governs their dispute and the interpretation of the policies.in march,the district court granted cic motion,holding that the judgment in a prior south carolina lawsuit between the parties did not estop cic from contesting whether beazer costs were covered by the policies under indiana law,the damage at issue was not property damage,and the damage was not caused by an occurrence.
shortly thereafter,beazer filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied.beazer also filed motions to supplement the record both in the district court and in this court,claiming that it had newly discovered evidence that cic had taken contrary positions on various matters in parallel litigation in a federal district court in indiana.a prior panel of this court denied the motion,but did so without prejudice to our reconsideration of the issue.beazer has timely appealed.

collateral estoppel 
as an initial matter,beazer argues that the district court erred in permitting cic to contest whether the policies cover the damage at issue.in,a south carolina state court issued a ruling against cic and in favor of beazer,interpreting south carolina law to hold that water damage to properly constructed parts of a house,which was caused by faulty construction on other parts of the house,was property damage caused by an occurrence under beazer policies with cic.see crossmann cmtys.of,harleysville mut.ins,may.the policies at issue in harleysville are the same as those in the instant case,but the damaged properties are located in different states.beazer argues that cic is prevented by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating whether the policies cover the damage because another court has previously ruled on this issue.
collateral estoppel bars subsequent relitigation of a fact or issue where that fact or issue was necessarily adjudicated in a prior cause of action between the same parties or their privies,but is appropriate only where the precise issue in the subsequent case was raised and litigated in the prior proceeding.cobbins.dep t of,cir.the question is therefore whether the harleysville court decided the same issue as that presented in the instant case.
over thirty years ago,the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan articulated a definition of an issue for the purposes of collateral estoppel that was praised by a leading treatise on federal law 
an issue is a single,certain and material point arising out of the allegations and contentions of the parties.it may concern only the existence or nonexistence of certain facts,or it may concern the legal significance of those facts.if the issues are merely evidentiary,they need only deal with the same past events to be considered identical.however,if they concern the legal significance of those facts,the legal standards to be applied must also be identical different legal standards as applied to the same set of facts create different issues.
overseas motors,import motors,emphasis added citations and internal quotation marks omitted,aff,cir,quoted in charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed describing the definition of an issue in overseas motors as a s good an effort as any.beazer characterizes the relevant issue in harleysville as whether the policies covered the damage to the homes because it was property damage caused by an occurrence.but that is too broad a reading of the harleysville decision.the issue in that case was not whether the policies covered the damage under some universal insurance law,but whether the damage was covered under south carolina insurance law.in the present case,the issue is whether such damage is covered under indiana insurance law.
collateral estoppel does not bar the relitigation of issues where the legal rules governing a specific case or issue are different.wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.identity of the issue is established by showing that the same general legal rules govern both cases and that the facts of both cases are indistinguishable as measured by those rules.preclusion should not apply if there has been a change either in the facts or the governing rules.emphasis added.
in boomer v.at t,cir,for example,a class of at t customers argued that at t was collaterally estopped from arguing that the arbitration clause in its service contract was valid.another class had previously brought suit against at t in a federal court in california,and that court found the clause to be unconscionable and therefore unenforceable under california law.when the second class sued at t in federal court in illinois,the seventh circuit refused to apply collateral estoppel to at t defense because the issue in the second suit was whether the clause was valid under illinois law.see id.in the prior case,the question of unconscionability involved california law,whereas in this case it involves illinois law,and therefore the issues are not the same.see also sw.pet,koch,app x,cir holding that collateral estoppel did not bar the litigation of an issue under arizona law where california law was applied in the prior suit,because the issues were not identical guild trust union pac.land res,cir denying the application of collateral estoppel,in part,because the law applied in the prior case was colorado property law and the law governing the case before the court was wyoming property law peterson clark leasing,cir per curiam holding that collateral estoppel did not apply in a case where the issue was whether financial records were inadequate under federal law,and a prior case had determined that the records were inadequate under california law,even though these inquiries are likely very similar alberta,starfire,wl,at.june,denying collateral estoppel where a prior court had applied oklahoma and california contract law to the issue,but kansas law applied in the subsequent case,stating that b ecause the law of different states applies,this court is not presented with an identical issue.
this rule of law has been applied within the sixth circuit as well.in quixtar brady,wl,the district court refused to apply collateral estoppel with regard to the enforceability of an arbitration clause.quixtar had brought suit against several of its distributors,seeking to enforce the mandatory arbitration clause contained in its distributor contracts.id.at.a different set of distributors had previously brought suit in a federal court in texas against quixtar and,on appeal,the fifth circuit found that the arbitration provision was unenforceable under texas law.id.at.
the quixtar court held that the prior decision by the fifth circuit did not collaterally estop quixtar from asserting the validity of the arbitration clause because the parties had agreed that michigan law governed their dispute.like beazer in the current case,the distributors in quixtar had attempted to broadly define the issue previously decided,claiming that the relevant issue decided by the fifth circuit and to be decided by the michigan court was the enforceability of the arbitration provisions.id.at.the quixtar court,however,rejected this broad definition.instead,it defined the issue as whether these provisions were unenforceable under texas law.id.emphasis in original.
not surprisingly,the fifth circuit expressed no view as to whether quixtar arbitration provisions might be unenforceable under the law of michigan or any state other than texas.it readily follows,then,that the precise issue to be decided,the enforceability of quixtar arbitration provisions under michigan law was not raised and litigated before the fifth circuit 
this rule applies with equal force in insurance cases.in evanston insurance affiliated fm insurance,one insurance company evanston sought a declaratory judgment that a second insurance company affiliated was liable for primary indemnification and the defense of the insured.the contested issue was which insurer was the primary insurer in light of the conflict between affiliated policy and evanston policy.two years prior to the decision in evanston,a federal court in pennsylvania had held that affiliated policy which was identical to the policy at issue in evanston made it the primary insurer where there was a conflict with a policy.evanston argued that the issue could not be relitigated in connecticut because collateral estoppel applied.the district court in connecticut rejected this argument,however,because the prior case had been decided under pennsylvania state law.because the question in evanston was how connecticut courts would rule on the issue of conflicting versus policies,the issues raised were not identical and collateral estoppel did not apply.id.at.
a district court in massachusetts reached the same result in stop shop federal insurance,rev on other grounds,cir.there,a district court in california had previously decided that an insurance policy provided coverage for losses that clients of an accountant had suffered when the accountant diverted millions of dollars that the clients had entrusted to the accountant to pay to the internal revenue service.id.at.when stop shop,another client of the accountant,sued for a declaratory judgment that the same insurance policy provided it with coverage for identical losses,stop shop contended that the insurer was precluded from arguing that its policy did not provide coverage given the previous determination in california.the district court in massachusetts,however,denied the use of collateral estoppel because california state law was used to resolve the prior dispute,and massachusetts state law governed the later dispute.id.at.
beazer responds by citing aaron mahl,for the proposition that even if indiana and south carolina courts might interpret the policies differently,collateral estoppel still applies.in that case,mahl former employer brought suit against her in a california state court for various causes of action and won a judgment of damages.id.at.mahl employer then assigned the california judgment to an individual named jim aaron,who filed suit in both indiana and south carolina state courts to enforce the judgment.the indiana court enforced the judgment,specifically rejecting mahl argument that the assignment was invalid.subsequently,a south carolina trial court found the assignment to be invalid and refused to enforce the judgment.but the south carolina supreme court reversed,holding that res judicata and collateral estoppel applied to require the south carolina trial court to enforce the california judgment of damages and the indiana holding that the assignment was valid.id.at.
aaron is distinguishable from the present case for two reasons.first,nowhere in the aaron opinion is there any suggestion that the law applied in california and indiana differed from the law to be applied by the south carolina courts.the two issues in giving rise to the judgment and the validity of the thus already been decided,so the south carolina trial court erred when it reanalyzed these issues.here,the issue of coverage under indiana law has not been previously determined.second,aaron was ultimately about the enforcement of a judgment,and a final judgment,unlike a matter of contract interpretation under a different set of laws,is entitled to full faith and credit under the constitution.see hosp.underwriting group,summit health,cir holding that the district court failure to enforce a judgment of damages from an arizona state court because it viewed the damages as excessive violated the full faith and credit clause of the constitution,which requires federal courts to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of state courts.collateral estoppel is thus not applicable to the instant case,and cic is free to contest whether the policies cover the costs that beazer incurred.
property damage caused by an occurrence 
turning now to the merits,beazer sought coverage not for repair of the faulty work by the subcontractors,but for damage to other components of the houses caused by water intrusion that resulted from the allegedly faulty workmanship.the district court held that such damage was neither property damage nor caused by an occurrence under indiana law,and thus was not covered by the policies.beazer argues that these conclusions are erroneous or,in the alternative,that indiana law on this issue is not settled,thus prompting its request that we certify the question to the indiana supreme court.
property damage 
the policies define property damage as p hysical injury to or destruction of tangible property including all resulting loss of use.applying indiana law,the district court held that each completed house in its entirety is the work of beazer and that damage to the contractor own work is not property damage under the policies.
the first indiana case to squarely address this issue was thompson associates,monroe guaranty insurance.there,a home builder sought coverage for the costs of repairing damage arising from inadequate materials and substandard construction work.id.at.the definitions of property damage and occurrence contained in the policies in the instant case are virtually identical to the definitions in thompson and the various other cases discussed in this opinion.because the damage was limited to the builder own work,the court held that such damage was not property damage as defined by the builder cgl insurance policy 
the great weight of authority is to the effect that cgl policies cover the possibility that the goods,products,or work of the insured,once relinquished or completed,will cause bodily injury or damage to property other than to the product or completed work itself,and for which injury or damage the insured might be exposed to liability.the coverage is for tort liability for physical damages to others,and not for contractual liability of the insured for economic loss suffered because the completed work is not what the damaged person bargained for.
id.at emphasis in original.
other indiana cases have adopted this reasoning.in amerisure,wurster construction,for example,the court denied coverage to a general contractor that was seeking reimbursement for repairs made to the houses that it had built.faulty exterior and insulation systems,which were installed by subcontractors,caused the damage.the court found that such damage was not property damage because cgl policies cover the risk of damage to property other than the project itself.id.at emphasis in original.because wurster did not allege damage to any person or property,other than these interconnected systems on the buildings being constructed by the general contractor,there was no property damage.id.emphasis in original.
the court in amerisure followed the same reasoning as the court in thompson 
the construction of cgl insurance contracts is based upon two types of risk arising from a contractor work.the first,business risk,is a result of not performing well,faulty work and is borne by the contractor in order to satisfy its customers.the second type of risk is occurrences which give rise to insurable liability.these occurrences are accidental injury to persons or property due to faulty workmanship.in other words,a business risk arises when,for example,a craftsman applies stucco to a home in a faulty manner and discoloration,peeling and chipping result,where the work must be repaired or replaced by the contractor.on the other hand,should the stucco peel and fall from the wall,and thereby cause injury to the homeowner or his neighbor or to a passing automobile,an occurrence of harm arises which is covered under a cgl policy.
id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
similarly,in sheehan construction continental casualty,vacated,sc,the homeowners sued a general contractor after their homes were damaged by water intrusion,which was caused by the subcontractors faulty work on various components of the houses.the court held that such damage was not property damage as defined in cgl policies because the builder did not claim any damage to property other than the structural components of the homes themselves.id.at citation omitted.
beazer seeks to distinguish these prior cases by arguing that they involved repairs only to the faulty components themselves,not the properly constructed parts of the houses that were damaged as a result of the faulty components.but even if this is a factually accurate reading of the prior caselaw,the distinction ignores the holding of the indiana supreme court that the entire house is the general contractor work.see.ins.dezutti,holding that the entire project or house which he built and sold is the product and work of the general contractor.beazer,in other words,can not successfully argue that damage to a properly constructed component of a house due to faulty workmanship on another component is property damage under a cgl policy.
other courts applying indiana law have similarly rejected this argument.see trinity homes llc ohio cas.ins,wl,at,westfield ins.sheehan constr,d,aff,cir.these federal cases,together with the indiana state cases of thompson,amerisure,and sheehan,clearly hold that a general contractor can not claim cgl insurance coverage for the costs it incurs in repairing houses that are subsequently damaged due to the faulty workmanship of its own subcontractors.
beazer,however,relies on one of the policies exclusions in arguing to the contrary.the your work provision excludes coverage for damage to work performed by the policyholder or on its behalf.but the exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.beazer argues that the interpretation of property damage adopted by the indiana courts renders superfluous the policies your work exclusion and that exclusion subcontractor exception.
unfortunately for beazer,the indiana supreme court has rejected the concept that exclusion clauses can be interpreted to enlarge coverage.see dezutti,at.in dezutti,the insurance policy specifically excluded coverage for liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement.id.at.the exclusion had an exception,however,for a warranty of fitness or quality of the named insured products or a warranty that work performed by or on behalf of the named insured will be done in a workmanlike manner.id.dezutti argued that the exception must grant or extend coverage to breach of contract damages for the performance of work in a negligent and unworkmanlike manner.id.at.the court rejected this argument because such logic ignored the fundamental tenet of insurance law that exclusion clauses do not grant or enlarge coverage.id.
but beazer argues that dezutti reliance on a policy exclusion to deny coverage actually supports its position that the damage at issue is covered property damage.dezutti was a general contractor for a set of houses and was assisted in the actual construction by various subcontractors.the homeowners discovered problems with the foundation and sued the general contractor,who then sought coverage for the cost of repairs from his insurance company.the court first stated that the general insuring clause,which covered property damage caused by an occurrence,would seemingly provide coverage for the damages.id.at.next,however,the court analyzed a set of exclusions,and held that an exclusion that eliminated coverage for property damage to work performed by you meant that the damage at issue was not covered.id.at.the court then outlined its reasoning,using the same business liability risk distinction relied on by the intermediate indiana courts in thompson,amerisure,and sheehan 
t he two risks involved are quite different and the costs attendant upon the repair or replacement of the insured own faulty work is part of every business venture and is a business expense to be borne by the in order to satisfy customers.it is a business risk long excluded by comprehensive liability policies.another form of risk is injury to people and damage to other property caused by the contractor negligence or defective product.it is this risk which the policy in question covers.
beazer submits that because the indiana supreme court resorted to looking at the exclusions in the policy in dezutti,rather than rejecting coverage based on the meaning of property damage alone,it would find coverage in the instant case.but the court in thompson explicitly rejected this argument.see thompson,at we recognize that dezutti defined the scope of the cgl coverage in part by addressing exclusions to the policies however,the reasoning has led courts to the same result without reliance on the policy exclusions.see also sheehan,at rejecting the argument that the your work exclusion and subcontractor exception demonstrates that damage to the contractor own work is covered property damage,reasoning that i f the insuring clause does not extend coverage,one need look no further quoting amerisure,d at.
the united states district court for the southern district of indiana,when faced with nearly identical facts as those in the instant case,has similarly concluded that indiana law interprets property damage as covering only damage to property other than the finished houses.as recently as september,that court ruled that costs incurred by a general contractor in repairing properly constructed components of a house,which were damaged by faulty subcontractor work on other components,were not covered under the policies because the damage was not cgl property damage 
i t is clear that the cost of repairing faulty workmanship is not deemed property damage if the damaged property is limited to the project itself therefore,the insured seeking coverage must demonstrate that some property other than the project is to say,something other than the homes constructed by the general contrac
