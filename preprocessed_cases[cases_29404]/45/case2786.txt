the judge presiding over this matter denied hartford casualty insurance company hartford motion for summary adjudication.the judge later realized he was disqualified because an alternative dispute provider had contacted him concerning possible employment upon his retirement from the bench.he then proceeded to recuse himself from the matter.however,when hartford moved that the new judge assigned to the case vacate the prior judge order,the new judge refused on the ground that hartford had not shown good cause.that refusal was an error.accordingly,we will grant hartford petition for a writ of mandate directing the respondent court to vacate its order denying hartford motion and enter a new and different order granting that motion.
facts and procedural history 
hartford refused to defend a lawsuit filed against its insureds,real parties entertainment,knuckleheads,and earl benjamin collectively referred to as entertainment.entertainment then sued hartford for breach of contract and bad faith insurance practices,and included a claim for punitive damages.hartford for declaratory relief,seeking a determination that it did not breach any of its duties to entertainment.on october,the trial court granted entertainment motion seeking a summary adjudication that hartford owed it a duty to defend the underlying lawsuit.an order summarily adjudicating the issue in entertainment favor was entered on november.
on november,hartford filed its own motion for summary adjudication of entertainment cause of action for bad faith insurance practices and its punitive damages claim,or for adjudication of hartford various claims for declaratory relief.on january,at a hearing on a different matter,the trial judge agreed to refer the case to mediation as suggested orally by hartford,and supported by hartford,in order to attempt a speedy resolution of the action in light of entertainment request to continue trial the court left it up to the parties to determine how to mediate the case.
on february,hartford filed a motion to appoint a referee to determine the amount of damages that were at issue in the case.on the same day,the trial judge heard argument on hartford motion for summary adjudication and issued an order denying the motion.however,on march,when the motion to appoint a referee came on for hearing,the judge revealed that he would be disqualified from presiding on the matter further pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a b,unless the parties waived the issue.the judge revealed that within the last two years he had had discussions with multiple alternative dispute resolution providers regarding prospective employment when hartford refused to waive the issue,the judge recused himself.no party filed a petition for writ of mandate to challenge the judge action.code civ,subd.d.
the matter was reassigned to the current trial judge.hartford then brought a motion to vacate the february,ruling of the prior judge denying its motion for summary adjudication,arguing the judge had been disqualified as of the january,reference to mediation however,the current trial judge denied the motion,concluding that code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,imposed a good cause requirement for vacating the orders of a disqualified judge,but no good cause was shown.this petition followed.
discussion 
code of civil procedure,section,subdivision a b,clearly states that a judge shall be disqualified if,
the judge has a current arrangement concerning prospective employment or other compensated service as a dispute resolution neutral or is participating in,or,within the last two years has participated in,discussions regarding such prospective employment or service,and b t he matter before the judge includes issues relating to the enforcement of an agreement to submit a dispute to alternative dispute resolution or the appointment or use of a dispute resolution neutral.
a dispute resolution neutral is further defined as an arbitrator,mediator,temporary judge appointed under section of article vi of the california constitution,referee appointed under code of civil procedure section or,special master,neutral evaluator,settlement officer,or settlement facilitator,subd.a.thus,under the plain terms of the statute,a judge is obligated to recuse himself whenever he a has participated in discussions regarding prospective service as a dispute resolution neutral,and b presides over a case in which the potential use of an arbitrator,mediator,settlement officer,or other type of dispute resolution neutral,arises.the language used by the legislature in the statute is unambiguous,and must be applied as stated people johnson cal th,d,people lawrence cal th,d,rex club workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
indeed,the initial trial judge in this case concluded that his contacts with alternative dispute resolution providers were sufficient to disqualify him from presiding under the provisions of section,subdivision a b.once he was called upon to decide hartford motion requesting appointment of a referee,the judge understood that he became disqualified and took action to recuse himself.the judge action was not challenged by the parties in a petition for writ of mandate and we do not question his action here,subd.d.however,the judge overlooked the fact that the same disqualifying factors existed before he was asked to appoint a referee,and so he should have recused himself even earlier in the litigation.specifically,on january,when the parties requested referral to mediation,the litigation became one in which there was an issue relating to the appointment or use of a dispute resolution neutral,subd.a b.that,coupled with the judge admitted discussions with alternative dispute resolution providers regarding prospective employment,operated to disqualify him from further acting in the case,subd.a b,subd.d.
the conclusion that the judge was disqualified as soon as the relevant factors arose is consistent with case law considering similar situations.for example,in urias harris farms,d,a judge who apparently did not know his former law firm represented the defendant in an action in which he presided was later deemed to have been disqualified when he entered summary judgment for that defendant.accordingly,the judgment he entered was considered ineffective and was subject to attack by the plaintiff,even after the action had concluded.id.at.similarly,in tatum southern pacific d,decided under the prior disqualification statutes,a judge who forgot that a trust portfolio he oversaw contained the stock of a defendant appearing before him was nevertheless considered disqualified and without authority to act,making his prior rulings in the action void.and,in giometti etienne cal,also decided under the former disqualification statutes,a supreme court order granting review of a case was considered void because one of the justices who signed it did not realize his relative represented the petitioner.as the giometti court explained,it is the fact of disqualification that controls,not subsequent judicial action on that disqualification.but see,sincavage superior court th,d judge misled into believing she did not substantively participate in prior prosecution of defendant not disqualified until actual facts were called to her attention.that rule is confirmed by decisions holding that a judge who improperly rejects a timely filed statement of disqualification is disqualified as of the time the challenge was filed,ziesmer superior court th,d zilog,superior court th,d in re jenkins th,d see also geldermann,bruner d.
the remaining question in this case is what becomes of the rulings made by the disqualified trial judge after he should have recused himself.entertainment suggests the judge rulings may only be vacated upon a showing of good cause.it points to the provisions of section,subdivision b,which provide,
in the event that grounds for disqualification are first learned of or arise after the judge has made one or more rulings in a proceeding but before the judge has completed judicial action in a proceeding,the judge shall,unless the disqualification be waived,disqualify himself or herself,but in the absence of good cau
