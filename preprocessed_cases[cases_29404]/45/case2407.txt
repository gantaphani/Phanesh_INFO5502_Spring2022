soon after purchasing her first new car,melody carson was involved in an automobile accident with a third party,who was at fault and who was insured.at the time of the accident,carson vehicle had a market value of.her automobile insurance policy with mercury insurance company provided it had the option of repairing or paying for carson vehicle,subject to several express liability limitations and exclusions.rather than declaring the car a total loss and paying carson to replace the vehicle,mercury elected to repair the car as the initial restoration estimates were approximately.during the repair process,additional damages were revealed and mercury paid a total of to repair the vehicle.
unhappy with mercury decision to repair the car,and unsatisfied with the work performed at the repair shop,carson sued mercury for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.she asserted mercury should have taken into consideration her financial interests,specifically that her repaired vehicle would have a diminished stigma value the repaired honda was only worth approximately.in addition,she asserted her new vehicle was constructed in a way that could never be repaired to its safe preaccident condition and value.carson alleged mercury was obligated to declare the car a total loss and it wrongfully asserted subrogation rights against the driver.she did not prevail at the court trial.
on appeal,carson alleges the trial court wrongly eliminated most of her claims in its pretrial rulings and it failed to consider her argument the insurance policy was unenforceable as being against public policy.she also claims the court conclusions based on the evidence presented at trial were impossible,which we deem to be a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.while we are sympathetic to her situation,we conclude all her contentions on appeal lack merit,and we affirm the judgment.
carson purchased her first new car,a honda accord,on september,for a total cost of.she purchased an automobile insurance policy that provided collision coverage from mercury.
under the terms of the collision coverage portion of the policy,mercury has the option of repairing,replacing,or paying for the honda accord if it was damaged in a collision.specifically,the policy provided in part iii,titled physical damage coverage e collision the company,at its option,will repair,replace or pay for the owned automobile or part thereof,for loss caused by collision but only for the amount of each loss in excess of the deductible stated in the declarations.in part iii the policy listed exclusions to coverage,including as relevant to this appeal,the policy did not apply to loss due to diminution in value of any motor vehicle repaired under coverages d or 
in addition,condition of the policy set forth the limit of liability settlement options coverages d and e and specified the policy would not cover depreciation the company liability shall not exceed the lesser cost of the following options repair or replace the motor vehicle or any part thereof,using original or equipment manufactured parts,with deduction for depreciation,or pay the agreed or appraised value of the motor vehicle.
in july,carson was involved in an automobile accident while driving in victorville,california.her car was struck by a ford pickup truck driven by guy anderson,who was insured with permanent general assurance corporation permanent general.his policy provided personal injury limits in the amount of per person and per accident.the property damage limits were.
carson required medical attention and her car was taken to and inspected at performance paint body,a repair facility in victorville.the shop prepared a repair estimate in the amount of,and determined the actual cash preaccident value of the vehicle was.alex mingo,an automobile damage appraiser employed by mercury,inspected the vehicle and prepared a repair estimate in the amount of.
carson made arrangements to have her vehicle taken to a repair facility of her choice,specialty body works.jimmy patopoff at specialty body works prepared his own estimate to repair the vehicle,and determined it would cost to repair.
during the repair process,specialty body works found damage that was not visible when the original estimates were made.patopoff prepared a supplemental estimate stating the repairs would cost.in the end,it cost a total of to repair the vehicle,which included towing charges of.mercury paid for the repairs,including carson deductible.
carson made a personal injury claim against anderson insurance.permanent general paid her the policy limit of.mercury pursued a subrogation claim against permanent general for the amount it paid to repair carson vehicle.permanent general paid mercury the property damage limit and from this amount carson was paid to reimburse her for towing expenses.carson signed permanent general release form.
on july,carson filed a complaint against mercury alleging causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.she alleged the damage to her vehicle was so substantial and major that the vehicle was unrepairable to its preaccident condition with respect to safety,reliability,mechanics and performance,and was in a condition which,for economical and practical reasons,reasonably required the vehicle to be totaled.the vehicle was by any logical financial consideration a total loss,meaning that the costs of repair,plus the and salvage value of the vehicle,and the loss of value of the vehicle,even if repaired,would be greater than the total value of the vehicle after the vehicle was repaired.
in the complaint,carson maintained mercury breached the terms of the policy and acted in bad faith by withholding benefits,including its failure to treat the vehicle as a total loss and paying the replacement value,failure to repair the vehicle to its preaccident condition,and asserting subrogation rights against the driver to her detriment.
pretrial motions 
mercury filed a motion for summary judgment,or alternatively,summary adjudication of the second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.mercury argued it was not required to declare carson vehicle as a total loss because the policy expressly provided it with the option of repairing or replacing the vehicle.mercury also asserted it could not be held liable for failing to repair the vehicle to its preaccident condition because carson selected the repair facility.finally,mercury alleged it properly asserted subrogation rights against permanent general,the insurer of the driver that hit carson vehicle.
in its tentative ruling,the trial court judge kazuharu makino explained there was a triable issue of fact as to whether mercury breached its duty to repair the vehicle to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition,as required under ray farmers insurance exchange d.ray.however,the court rejected carson assertion mercury was required to take into account diminution in value in determining if the car was a total loss,stating,there is a total loss only where costs of repair exceed the value of the vehicle.citing martinez enterprise rent a car th,d.the court denied the motion.however,in the minute order the court included a statement defining total loss.
the case was assigned to judge kirk nakamura for trial.on the first day of trial,the trial court observed that based on the prior court ruling on the summary judgment motion,the claims for trial were limited to whether mercury repaired the vehicle to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition.carson argued there were two additional issues first,carson maintained it must be determined whether mercury breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because it was obligated to declare the vehicle a total loss.the court disagreed,citing to the prior minute order defining total loss and to the policy language giving mercury the option to repair,replace,or pay for the automobile.second,carson asserted there was an issue about whether mercury improperly asserted subrogation rights.carson explained that because her vehicle suffered diminution in value,mercury violated the made whole rule by pursuing subrogation.the court stated this claim was barred because it was undisputed carson signed a release of her property damage claim in favor of anderson,and therefore she could not make a claim for diminution in value against him before mercury was entitled to subrogation.the court ruled the above two issues the good faith and fair dealing claim and the subrogation claim could not be raised at trial.
the court then ruled on the following pretrial motions carson filed a motion seeking a jury instruction that mercury breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing on the grounds mercury did not specifically deny the allegations of bad faith set forth in paragraphs,and of her complaint.mercury responded that the failure to deny these allegations was an inadvertent mistake and it sought leave to file a motion for leave to file a verified first amended answer to generally and specifically deny the allegations.the court denied carson motion and granted mercury motion seeking leave to file a first amended answer.
carson also moved for an order precluding mercury from offering any evidence that if carson had her car repaired at a facility associated and selected by mercury the repairs would not have been any better than those performed by specialty body works.the motion was made on the grounds such evidence was irrelevant because the vehicle could never have been repaired to its preaccident condition.at the hearing,carson explained mercury was obligated to repair her vehicle to the manufacturing standards of a brand new car.carson also asserted she had a modern unibody car and the repairs can never replicate the manufacturer standards because the car can not be tested for crush worthiness.mercury replied the appropriate standard for determining vehicle repair is a comparison to industry repair standards.it also maintained that if carson had left her vehicle at performance paint body in victorville following the accident,mercury would have guaranteed the repairs.it explained performance paint body is a direct repair facility for mercury.on the other hand,carson was permitted by california law to select a different repair facility,specialty body works.mercury paid for those repairs and specialty body works made repairs and warranted the repairs for the lifetime of the vehicle so long as carson owned it.it asserted if the repairs were not properly made by the shop of carson choosing,mercury is not responsible.carson should take the car back to specialty body works and have the repairs performed pursuant to its guarantee to her.the court agreed and denied the motion.
both parties submitted motions in limine regarding evidence of whether the vehicle should have been declared a total loss.carson motion requested the court exclude any evidence mercury had the unilateral and absolute option to either repair or declare the vehicle a total loss and pay carson the car preaccident market value.she asserted the portion of the policy giving mercury discretion to choose repairing or replacing was unenforceable as being against public policy.the trial court denied the motion without commenting on the public policy argument.it stated mercury could discuss at trial what its policy states,it had the option to either repair or replace the vehicle.
mercury motion in limine sought to exclude evidence carson vehicle was a total loss on the grounds the policy gave mercury the option to repair the car and there is no reason why it should be obligated to declare the car a total loss.mercury explained the vehicle was valued at approximately and the cost of repair,after deducting charges for towing,was only and therefore the vehicle need not be declared a total loss.carson opposed the motion,asserting the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing required mercury to calculate if the vehicle was a total loss by also considering the vehicle diminution in value after the repairs,the vehicle salvage value,and the loss of use of the vehicle while the vehicle is being repaired.the court granted mercury motion in limine,excluding evidence carson vehicle was a total loss.
b.the trial 
the trial court bifurcated the issues of whether carson vehicle could be repaired,and that it was actually restored to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition from the issue of whether there was a bad faith breach of the obligation to repair the vehicle to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition from the issue of punitive damages.the parties agreed to proceed with a court trial on this first issue.
carson first witness was rocco avellini.he testified at length about his background and training in the automobile industry as a body shop repairman and property manager at hertz rent a car.avellini inspected carson vehicle in august when it had been driven approximately miles.he opined the damage was in the severe range.he discussed the areas of damage to carson car.mercury objected when carson counsel asked avellini to give his expert opinion about whether the repairs would have changed the deployment rate of the airbags.after considering additional testimony,the court determined avellini qualification as an expert on body repairs did not render him qualified to also testify about the deployment rate of the airbags.for this same reason,the court also sustained mercury objections to questions about whether the vehicle was repaired to its preaccident safe condition and if the repairs negatively impacted the car safety.
avellini testified the car could never have been restored to its preaccident factory designed condition.the court ruled this was not the applicable standard.it determined a vehicle repaired preaccident condition could not be defined by how the car looked just after it was manufactured,but rather by the repair standards prepared by the vehicle manufacturer.on,avellini testified the repairs had not been done properly by specialty body works,but the vehicle could have been properly repaired within honda repair specifications.
carson testified on her own behalf.she selected specialty body works to repair her vehicle on her own after calling a honda dealership.she testified the vehicle looked cosmetically fine when she picked it up.specialty body works gave her a lifetime guarantee on the repairs.
mercury called alex mingo,who it employed as an estimator.he testified that he wrote a repair estimate on july,for,and he did not consider her vehicle to be a total loss.he denied being told by anyone at specialty body works the vehicle should be totaled.he prepared the estimate based on the mitchell system,which is a computer program that contains the manufacturer guidelines for what is repairable and how much its costs.the system will also specify when a part or area of damage is not servicable meaning it should be a total loss to the car,because there is nothing you can do.you ca replace that part.mingo testified carson authorized the repairs,specialty body works controlled the manner of the repairs,and mercury paid for the repairs and towing.
mercury also called patopoff as a witness.patopoff worked as an estimator at specialty body works and handled the repair of carson vehicle.he also evaluated the car using the mitchell system,which he understood utilized the repair recommendations and standards from honda.patopoff testified he never thought the vehicle was a total loss because it could be repaired for less than its actual cash value.patopoff recalled carson authorized all the repairs and the shop properly repaired the vehicle within the manufacturer standards.patopoff testified he never advised mercury the vehicle should be a total loss and carson never advised specialty body works that she did not want the vehicle repaired.carson was given a lifetime guarantee on the repairs.
mercury next witness was robert barney,an expert in the field of vehicle appraisals and valuations.he testified the vehicle was repaired to honda specifications,which were the same standards as existed before the accident.he opined carson vehicle could have been repaired to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition.he stated mercury paid for the replacement of the b pillar and package tray but this work was not performed by specialty body works.he also discovered there was no upper body sway after the repairs.
carson called joseph salguiero as her expert witness.salguiero owns an auto dealership and a body shop repair facility.due to the lack of his education and background in engineering or metallurgy,the court ruled he was not qualified to testify that the vehicle was not repaired to its preaccident safe condition.
during closing argument,carson counsel conceded the vehicle was cosmetically repaired to its preaccident condition.the court ruled in favor of mercury.it determined carson failed to prove the vehicle could not be repaired to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition.in addition,it concluded that even if the vehicle was not repaired to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition,mercury was not liable for the failure to properly repair the vehicle because carson selected the repair facility that guaranteed the work.
bifurcated trial rulings and judgment 
the trial court pretrial rulings eliminated many of carson claims and,consequently,the court determined carson could proceed to trial only on the narrow issue of whether the vehicle could be restored to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition.the court reasoned if it was determined the vehicle could not be repaired and was not repaired,then the jury could consider whether there was a bad faith breach of mercury obligation under the policy and also whether punitive damages were warranted.before analyzing the merits of the various pretrial rulings,we begin by addressing carson challenges to the trial court ruling in mercury favor at the bench trial.as we will explain anon,carson inability to prove her vehicle could not be repaired to its preaccident condition renders moot many of her arguments regarding the pretrial rulings.
the trial court decision to focus the trial on whether the vehicle was repaired to its preaccident safe,mechanical and cosmetic condition was based on its understanding of case law.collision coverage is typically limited to the cost of restoring the damaged vehicle to its preaccident condition,not to exceed the actual cash value of the car at the time of loss.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.condition means the preaccident safe,mechanical and cosmetic condition of the covered vehicle.citations.id.at.
as stated by the trial court,the repaired preaccident condition of the car is not defined as the condition of the car when it left the factory or the showroom floor.it aptly noted the condition of any new car changes once it is driven off the lot,and no repair can ever restore a vehicle to its pristine factory condition.and if that was the standard,then no vehicle could be adequately repaired,rendering meaningless the policy provision authorizing the insurer to repair the vehicle using original or equipment manufactured parts.an interpretation which gives effect to all provisions of the contract is preferred to one which renders part of the writing superfluous,useless or inexplicable.williston on contracts ed.
carson does not offer any authority,below or on appeal,to support her contention the factory designed condition is the appropriate standard.honda,the manufacturer of carson car,has published repair specifications to be used by insurance companies and repair shops.we conclude the trial court appropriately applied the manufacturing repair specifications as the standard by which to compare the repairs on carson vehicle to determine if it was returned to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition.
in california,and the majority of other jurisdictions,when the insurer elects to repair the car to its preaccident condition,it is not also required to pay for any loss of value to the vehicle,which can occur after a seriously damaged vehicle is fully repaired.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.to hold the insurer liable for the automobile diminution in value would render essentially meaningless its clear right to elect to repair rather than to pay the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of loss.ray,supra,d at.
the ray case is instructive.ray,supra,d.in that case,the insured ray sued the insurer farmers for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant,alleging farmers was obligated to compensate ray,after repair of his wrecked car,for the car diminution in market value because of its status as a wrecked car.id.at.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court rejection of ray contention.it explained,the policy unambiguously gave farmers the right to elect to repair ray vehicle if the cost to repair to like kind and quality was less than the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of loss.id.at.the appellate court rejected ray theory that the term like kind and quality was the equivalent of actual cash value at the time of loss.id.at.it relied on the court opinion in owens pyeatt d.owens holding an insurer election to repair is conclusive provided the repair places the automobile substantially in its preaccident condition.if it does not,then the automobile is deemed a total loss and the insurer is liable for the preaccident value of the car.ray,supra,d at,citing owens,supra,d at.
based on this authority,the trial court narrowed the scope of the trial to whether mercury satisfied its obligation under the contract to repair carson vehicle to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition.at trial,carson admitted the vehicle was repaired to its preaccident cosmetic condition.she presented no evidence on whether the vehicle was restored to it preaccident mechanical condition.her sole focus at trial was attempting to prove the car could never have been repaired to it preaccident safe condition,and that in fact it was not restored to its preaccident safe condition.we have reviewed the record and agree with the trial court assessment that carson was unable to prove the vehicle was unrepairable to its preaccident safe condition.
carson difficulties in proving her case arose when the trial court determined her designated experts,avellini and salguiero both having experience as body shop repairmen or estimators,were not qualified to render an expert opinion on whether the vehicle could never be repaired to is preaccident safe condition or that the repairs otherwise impacted the car structural safety.the court ruled these witnesses had no expertise or specialized knowledge in engineering,crash testing,or metallurgy,and therefore they lacked the proper qualifications to opine the car structure or airbags could not be restored to a preaccident safe condition.
on appeal,carson does not challenge these evidentiary rulings.instead,she asserts,even if the experts are discounted and the t rial c ourt just uses common sense,the finding that the vehicle was restored to its preaccident condition as existing before the accident is still impossible.the photographs reveal this vehicle was destroyed and was then rebuilt and at a body shop by shop workers.the photographs speak common sense.remember the supreme court has accepted bob dylan account as to whether an expert is needed,affirming that you do need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,citing bob dylan,subterranean homesick blues,bringing it all back home columbia records.flowers torrance memorial hospital medical center cal th,d.she explains the vehicle was essentially by a repair shop by being cut into pieces and welded together in places different from that which existed before the accident.she asserts you do not need an expert because it is obvious a unibody designed car,such as her honda,could never be restored to its preaccident safe condition.she is wrong for two reasons.
first,our supreme court reference to bob dylan song was made in the context of a medical malpractice case and related to the common knowledge exception to expert testimony the standard of care against which the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of experts it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be proved by their testimony citations,unless the conduct required by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman.citations.citations.the common knowledge exception is principally limited to situations in which the plaintiff can invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur,when a layperson is able to say as a matter of common knowledge and observation that the consequences of professional treatment were not such as ordinarily would have followed if due care had been exercised.citations.the classic example,of course,is the x ray revealing a scalpel left in the patient body following surgery.citation.flowers torrance memorial hospital medical center,supra,cal th at,d.
we do not agree with carson contention that a layperson observing the photographs of her damaged vehicle could say as a matter of common knowledge the vehicle could never be repaired to its preaccident safe condition.in contrast to the medical negligence readily apparent from simply observing the abandoned scalpel,the workings of and safety levels of repaired airbags,crush zones,and metal welds are not obvious from a set of photographs of the car.it can not be said a reasonable person has an inherent understanding of the causal relationship between particular metal welds and the restoration of crush zones,to the deployment rate of the air bags,or the overall structural safety of the car.we agree with the trial court assessment that this type of evidence,essentially establishing a causal link between a repair and a safety feature,are matters peculiarly within the knowledge of experts,having specialized training,skill,or experience in car engineering,metallurgy,or crash testing.moreover,because mercury was not obligated to restore the vehicle to its factory or showroom quality condition,expert testimony would be required to prove if honda repair specifications were not properly implemented.the evaluation and determination of honda rules for repairing its vehicles is beyond the common knowledge of a layperson.
on the other hand,mercury presented undisputed evidence the unibody car could have been repaired to manufacturing repair specifications.it presented evidence it paid nearly to have the vehicle repaired to those specifications.mercury presented evidence specialty body works could have properly repaired the vehicle.carson alleged expert also admitted the vehicle could be fixed following honda repair specifications just not to its factory condition.and although pictures of the damaged car can suggest the car was not repairable,the court was free to determine this speculative inference was outweighed by mercury substantial evidence to the contrary.we find no reason to disturb the trial court determination that mercury decision to repair the car to its preaccident condition was possible,and therefore it did not breach the contract or covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
second,in her briefing carson fails to appreciate the issue of whether her car could be repaired to its preaccident safe condition is different from whether the car actually was so repaired.as discussed above,the first issue directly relates to mercury liability for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.this is because under the terms of the policy mercury had the discretion to repair rather than pay the market value of carson vehicle,and after having decided to repair it,mercury would be liable if there was evidence the car actually could not have been repaired to its preaccident safe condition.
the second related issue of whether the car was actually repaired properly in this case was not relevant to carson claim against mercury because it was undisputed carson selected her own repair facility that guaranteed the work.as correctly stated in mercury briefing,insurance code section,subdivision b,provides that if an insured agrees to use an auto body shop recommended by the insurer,the insured is not liable for any further costs of repair.the insurer guarantees the repairs.the same can not be true if the insured selects the body shop.mercury paid the insured for the repairs,and the insured can and should return to the body shop if there is a problem with the repairs.it would be unfair to allow carson to select a poor repair facility and then ask mercury to pay for a redo of the same repairs.mercury was only obligated to pay the amount necessary to restore the care to its preaccident condition and it did so.the evidence was undisputed special body works was independent of mercury and guaranteed it own repairs.carson remedy is to return her vehicle to specialty body works and have the repairs done properly pursuant to its guarantee.
therefore,as the trial court properly recognized,the issue of whether the car was actually repaired to a safe condition was not dispositive.when ruling in mercury favor,the court recognized there was some evidence carson vehicle required further repairs from specialty body works.the court stated someone at the repair facility missed an issue with the airbag sensors and the shop likely should have replaced rather than welded the b pillar section of the vehicle.the court concluded that due to these problems there was some doubt as to whether the vehicle was currently in a safe condition,however,this conclusion was not grounds to hold mercury liable for breaching the contract.the court explained the current state of the vehicle could not be used to prove the vehicle in question was nonrepairable.there was no evidence suggesting that if carson returned the vehicle to specialty body works the car could not be eventually restored properly to its preaccident safe,mechanical,and cosmetic condition.
pretrial rulings 
carson asserts the court erroneously pretried the majority of her case in making various rulings before trial.she asserts the court effectively denied her right to try her case.on appeal,carson repeatedly states a long laundry list of issues she claims would have been litigated but for the pretrial rulings.however,her briefing is essentially limited to the following five broad categories of argument the policy was ambiguous and should be construed against mercury to compel declaring her vehicle a total loss due to its depreciation in value mercury and the court did not correctly define when a vehicle is a total loss because they failed to take into account the vehicle depreciation in value the policy provision giving mercury a unilateral option to repair a nonrepairable vehicle must be deemed unenforceable as against public policy the court erroneously excluded evidence regarding mercury wrongful demand for subrogation rights without carson being made whole and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can apply even if the underlying contract is not expressly breached,and therefore,the covenant applies a to mercury duty to properly investigate a claim,b to obligations set forth in insurance code section,c to mercury consideration of its insured financial and safety interests in deciding whether to repair or replace the vehicle,and d to writing a policy that eliminates the need to cover diminution in value.
we conclude the majority of these arguments are premised on the factual presumption carson vehicle was nonrepairable.as described in detail above,carson was unable to prove this fact at trial.for this reason and because we conclude she has misconstrued the applicable law,all carson contentions lack merit.
i the policy was not ambiguous or against public policy.
carson first alleges the declarations page of the policy was ambiguous because it states coverage for property damage liability is and uninsured motorist property damage liability is maximum.she argues a reasonable person would understand that in the event there was insufficient insurance by another driver responsible for the accident,the policy would cover the insured vehicle up to the maximum of.she interpreted the declarations page to mean mercury must pay for the diminution in value to her vehicle because the driver was underinsured.we disagree.
first,the liabilit
