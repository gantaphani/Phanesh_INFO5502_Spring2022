the plaintiffs appeal from the entry of summary judgment for the defendants on claims asserting violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,et rico.we affirm.
the plaintiffs commenced this suit as a putative class action,purporting to represent,among others,providers of medical products and services covered under policies issued or administered by the defendants,as well as the subscribers to those policies.the defendants include a number of insurance companies and similar businesses,such as claims administrators,who allegedly joined together with a number of others in a rico enterprise.the enterprise has allegedly engaged in efforts to acquire control of,capitalize,and convert the assets of,a insurance company which,the plaintiffs say,had restricted the use of those assets to charitable purposes 
the complaint asserted twelve numbered counts,each setting out a separate rico violation in the form of a different scheme.in relevant part,these alleged schemes have enriched the enterprise by overcharging subscribers and underpaying providers for medical products and services that were covered under insurance policies issued by the defendant insurers.to carry out these schemes,the defendants have allegedly made a number of mailings in violation of the mail fraud statute,and transmissions in violation of the wire fraud statute,id.one of the schemes has also allegedly relied on extortion in violation of the hobbs act.id.b.the plaintiffs characterize these crimes as the pattern of racketeering activity underlying their rico claims.see id.
in response to the complaint,the defendants moved to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the plaintiffs had failed to plead mail and wire fraud with the requisite particularity.see.b.the plaintiffs rejoined that,insofar as their claims relied on transmissions from the defendants to the plaintiffs,they had sufficiently pleaded them.in support of this point,the plaintiffs submitted an appendix explaining that through their communications with the plaintiffs sic classes the defendants failed to disclose,misrepresented and covered up the alleged overcharges and underpayments.the plaintiffs stated that the communications thus misled them to believe that they were paying the correct charge or receiving the correct payment.
the district court denied the motion to dismiss in part,ruling that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded communications that fraudulently induced plaintiff subscribers and providers to accept lower reimbursements and higher charges.nevertheless,the district court ordered the plaintiffs to amend part of their complaint to identify certain of those communications in accordance with rule b.the plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint asserting only those four counts that had survived the motion to dismiss.three of these counts alleged that the defendants made mailings and wire transmittals f or the purpose of executing and concealing various artifices,consisting of claim practices that have resulted in the overpayment of deductibles by subscribers or the underpayment of providers for their services to the subscribers the fourth count alleged that the defendants violated the hobbs act by threatening the providers with economic injury in the form of exclusion from the network of insurance plans administered by the defendants,audits of the providers accounts,withholding of payments,and denial of patient referrals.
subsequent to the amended complaint,the district court approved the parties joint proposed scheduling order.the order provided that fact discovery would consist of two phases of roughly four months each,with the first to conclude before the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification,and the second to commence after briefing on that motion had been completed.the order noted,however,that 
class certification discovery will in part overlap with merits discovery in that plaintiffs may request general or template documents in addition to documents referring to the named plaintiffs and take.b depositions of the defendant corporations to ascertain their claims procedures and similar factual issues without discovery as to damages and similar discovery.
while the order provided a deadline for the filing of dispositive motions,it also noted that the p arties may file dispositive motions earlier,if they understand that the issue s are ripe.
after several months of discovery,including the depositions of the named plaintiffs and triple s by way of several rule b designates and the exchange of voluminous written discovery,the plaintiffs moved for class certification.the defendants opposed the motion on the grounds that,inter alia,the plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain the claims set forth in the amended complaint which,apart from being fatal to class certification in its own right,also meant that the plaintiffs could not satisfy the typicality and adequacy requirements of.the defendants argued that,according to the plaintiffs own deposition testimony,they had suffered no harm from the alleged racketeering activity,the violations of the mail and wire fraud statutes and the hobbs act.in particular,the defendants noted that the plaintiffs could not say how the communications they received from the defendants concealed their alleged schemes.
in response,the district court issued an order directing the plaintiffs to show cause within ten working days why summary judgment should not enter against them based on the deficiencies in proof identified by the defendants.while the court acknowledged that an objection to class certification is not the proper vehicle through which to attack standing,it reasoned that the defendants arguments and the corresponding facts are so compelling that it would be a poor use of judicial resources to proceed with class certification without first establishing whether this case is even remotely viable.
before reaching this conclusion,the court analyzed the plaintiffs deposition testimony in detail,finding that it did not support their allegations of mail and wire fraud or extortion.the district court determined,for example,that none of the physicians serving as plaintiffs was able to identify a single incident of fraudulent concealment in the correspondence they received from the defendants.yet the court recognized the possibility that the plaintiffs testimony as to whether or not their injuries were incurred through the transmission of fraudulent communications or the infliction of extortion relies on incomplete understanding of various terms of art.accordingly,the show cause order would give plaintiffs a last opportunity to present a crystal clear picture of how their allegations are factually supported.the court also preemptively rejected any argument that the incomplete state of discovery would prevent the plaintiffs from doing so,because their claims relied on fraudulent communications that were delivered to them and on acts of extortion that were inflicted directly upon them.
despite this admonishment,the plaintiffs rejoined that the district court would create reversible error by entering summary judgment before they had the opportunity to complete the discovery allowed by the scheduling order.the plaintiffs did not,however,ask for an extension of time to respond to the order to show cause.instead,they submitted nearly three hundred pages of evidentiary materials,including the declarations of twelve plaintiffs and two expert witnesses and a number of exhibits.each of the plaintiffs attested to receiving documents from at least one of the defendants,but stated 
it is impossible for a layman or a plaintiff or class representative to articulate the specifics of the solely from the documents received from the defendants because of the concealed nature of their fraud.therefore,i rely on the experts hired for this case to explain how the defendant sic practices form a rico scheme.
each of the plaintiffs claimed that,for the same reason,he or she could not articulate the specifics sic damages suffered from the and relied on the experts to explain that as well 
the plaintiffs experts,for their part,verified that a lay person to the insurance industry can not understand the underlying because of its complexity,and the substantial time and resources which would have to be expended to understand the scheme.while the experts provided some examples of each of the defendants claim practices cited in the amended complaint,their explanations of how those schemes were fraudulent were decidedly less comprehensive.the experts attested that each individual provider 
has no way of knowing of the specifics of the scheme due to the overwhelming amount sic of documents the provider receives from on a monthly basis and because important information regarding the scheme is omitted from those documents.the time and resources needed to go through the documents would be overwhelming and a substantial hardship.additionally,the documents received by the provider,while not fraudulent on their face,are used in furtherance of the scheme for to obtain an economic benefit that it does not rightfully deserve.
the experts gave a similar account of the alleged scheme to defraud the subscribers,explaining that they would have no way of knowing of it since part of this is reflected in the documents received by the providers of which the subscriber does not get copies.
based on these materials,the district court determined that the plaintiffs were advancing a new theory of mail and wire fraud while they had asserted in response to the motion to dismiss that the transmissions from the defendants to the plaintiffs misled them to believe that they were paying the correct charge or receiving the correct payment,they were now arguing that those transmissions were not fraudulent on their face.but the district court concluded that,under either theory,the plaintiffs could not survive summary judgment.
treating the plaintiffs new the defendants transmissions violated the mail and wire fraud statutes because they failed to disclose the entirety of their a proposed amendment to their complaint,the district court ruled that the plaintiffs had not alleged the underlying schemes with the particularity demanded by.b.the court further ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to further discovery before satisfying this pleading requirement.the district court also agreed with the defendants that the plaintiffs original theory of mail and wire fraud and their claim of extortion had been fatally undermined by their deposition testimony.accordingly,the court entered summary judgment for the defendants.
the plaintiffs challenge the district court decision on procedural and substantive grounds.first,they argue that the district court erred in entering summary judgment sua sponte before the plaintiffs had an opportunity to engage in discovery as to the merits of their claims.second,the plaintiffs argue that even the limited evidence they were able to marshal at the time the court ordered summary judgment was sufficient to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact.we review these questions de novo.see,john alden,of john alden ins.agency of,cir.
a district court can enter summary judgment even though none of the parties asks for it.see celotex catrett,d.nevertheless,given the potential for unfairness lurking in this approach,we have ruled it unless two separate conditions obtain.see berkovitz home box office,cir.first,the discovery process must be sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.id.second,the district court must provide the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.id.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court course of action satisfied neither of these criteria,insisting that a district court can not order summary judgment sua sponte unless and until discovery has been completed.but we have never adopted such a hard and fast rule.to the contrary,we have determined that a district court properly considered summary judgment on its own initiative once discovery had proceeded to the point where the parties understood the material facts at issue.penobscot indian nation key bank of,cir finding first condition satisfied where parties had compiled a voluminous record that included depositions of all the parties involved in event giving rise to claims see also dep t of natural envtl,cir reaching same conclusion where discovery had proceeded to the point where party was able to move for summary judgment on relevant issue.we have even affirmed summary judgment entered sua sponte before any discovery had taken place,where the decision was based on legal conclusions independent of any potentially available evidence.bank int l bus.machs,cir upholding sua sponte summary judgment on contract claim unsupportable in light of unambiguous language of agreement.
these decisions comport with the rule that sua sponte summary judgment must wait until the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity not necessarily the full duration of the discovery period to glean the material facts.aetna cas.sur.p b autobody,cir drawing distinction between discovery being merely sufficiently advanced and complete for purposes of sua sponte summary judgment.of course,what amounts to a reasonable opportunity largely depends on the state of the particular litigation and the nature of the issue decided by the sua sponte summary judgment procedure.bank,at observing that district court could not have properly relied on extrinsic evidence in entering sua sponte summary judgment on contract claim before discovery commenced.here,given the circumstances at hand,we conclude that the plaintiffs did have a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts before the district court ordered summary judgment on its own initiative.
our conclusion follows largely from the fact that the district court decided to consider sua sponte summary judgment against the plaintiffs based on what they said at their own depositions.after reviewing that testimony in detail,the court made the preliminary determination that the defendants interactions with the plaintiffs did not amount to violations of the mail or wire fraud statutes or the hobbs act.the court then stuck by that determination after reviewing the plaintiffs testimony a second time during its evaluation of their response to the show cause order.in this context,discovery obtained from the defendants could not have altered the outcome which,in the district court view,was ordained by the plaintiffs own deposition testimony see morales orssleff eftf,cir noting propriety of summary judgment where plaintiff deposition testimony foreclosed any possibility of recovery from defendant.
furthermore,by the time the plaintiffs were called upon to answer the show cause order,the discovery period had been running for nearly twelve months during this time,the plaintiffs had taken the depositions of a number of triple s employees pursuant to rule b and procured voluminous documents and other written discovery responses.this discovery enabled the parties to file comprehensive briefing,together with numerous evidentiary materials,on the plaintiffs motion for class certification.to support the motion,in fact,the plaintiffs asserted that the rule b depositions established myriad examples of the uniformity and standardization of defendants practices that apply across the classes,namely in terms of pricing,standard communications,and automated systems that cover up the frauds the plaintiffs allege or make them nearly impossible to detect.by even the plaintiffs contemporaneous account,then,discovery was sufficiently advanced that the parties ha d enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts under consideration by the district court,berkovitz,at,namely,whether the standard communications supported the plaintiffs claims.
the plaintiffs,however,maintain that they were not given the chance required by the first berkovitz,for that matter,the notice required by the second the district court entered summary judgment sua sponte before they could take the merits discovery permitted by the scheduling order.seizing on our statement in berkovitz that w hen a court charts a procedural route,lawyers and litigants are entitled to rely on it,at,the plaintiffs contend that the district court unfairly changed course by entertaining summary judgment in advance of the discovery cutoff.as just discussed,though,berkovitz does not demand the completion of discovery before the entry of sua sponte summary judgment no matter what.
moreover,the scheduling order specifically contemplated both that class certification discovery would in part overlap with merits discovery and that the parties could file dispositive motions prior to the deadline for doing so,if they underst ood that the issue s were ripe.so the plaintiffs could not reasonably have believed,based on the order,that they would under no circumstances have to oppose summary judgment prior to the completion of merits discovery.and,when the district court gave them ten working days to do so by issuing the order to show cause,the plaintiffs did not seek an extension of time to respond.under these circumstances,the plaintiffs had appropriate notice and a chance to present their evidence on the essential elements of the claim s that the district court found insufficient in entering summary judgment berkovitz,at.the sua sponte nature of the summary judgment order was not error.
the plaintiffs also question the substance of the summary judgment order.summary judgment can enter against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the ultimate burden of proof at trial.celotex,at.an essential element of the plaintiffs case was mail and wire fraud,or extortion,which they characterized as the pattern of racketeering activity underlying their rico claims.see,a.the plaintiffs argue that their deposition testimony,together with their submissions in response to the show cause order,sufficed to create genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendants had engaged in mail and wire fraud,as well as extortion.we consider the mail and wire fraud allegations first.
mail or wire fraud requires proof of a scheme to defraud based on false pretenses the defendant knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific intent to defraud and the use of interstate mail or wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.see,united states cheal,cir perez volvo car,cir.as we have recounted,the district court entered summary judgment against the plaintiffs on their mail and wire fraud claims because their deposition testimony did not support the allegations of mail and wire fraud set forth in the amended complaint and the materials submitted in response to the show cause order advanced a new theory of mail and wire fraud which,even if treated as a second amendment to the complaint,was not stated with the particularity required by rule b.the plaintiffs insist,however,that they consistently alleged the same theory of mail and wire fraud all the defendants transmissions fail to disclose or conceal how they process the plaintiffs requests for that they had sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment on that theory.
taking the plaintiffs at their word that they did not shift theories in response to the show cause order we nevertheless believe that the district court properly entered summary judgment on the mail and wire claims.a defendant failure to disclose information,without more,can not make out a violation of the mail and wire fraud statutes.see,am.united life ins.martinez,cir united states gray,cir united states autuori,cir united states cochran,cir emery am,cir united states kamer,cir.the authorities are less uniform on what more must be shown to transform a nondisclosure into fraud in this context.some courts have required a duty to disclose,triggered by an independent statutory scheme,the relationship between the parties,or the defendant partial or ambiguous statements that require further disclosure in order to avoid being misleading,autuori,at,while others have held that withholding information with the intent to deceive is enough,see,gray,at emery,at.
we considered the issue in bonilla volvo car,cir.there,we took the view that,without a legal,professional or contractual duty to disclose,the failure to do so generally can not support a mail or wire fraud claim,though we acknowledged the existence of a shadowy area where nondisclosures in the absence of such a duty,if deliberate,could arguably be treated as artifices to defraud under the federal statutes.id.at.we nevertheless observed that i t would be a truly revolutionary change to make a criminal out of every salesman assuming the use of the mails or telephone who did not take the initiative to reveal negative information about the product and jury might harbored in his heart the hope that the buyer would never ask.id.
for present purposes,however,we need not attempt to delineate the shadowy area where a failure to disclose,accompanied by the necessary intent,might transmogrify into a scheme to defraud under the mail and wire fraud statutes.though the district court rejected the plaintiffs theory on the ground that they had not alleged it with particularity,the plaintiffs make no effort to explain how their theory even states a claim predicated on mail and wire fraud.they do not say whether the defendants have a duty to disclose the actual manner in which the payment requests were processed or,if so,what the source of that duty is they do not say whether the defendants fail ed to disclose or conceal ed this information with the intent to deceive the plaintiffs.instead,they proceed on the assumption that nondisclosure alone can support mail and wire fraud claims.as we have discussed,that is not the law,in this circuit or elsewhere.
to excuse this shortcoming,the plaintiffs argue that they can not explain how the defendants actions amount to a scheme to defraud without further discovery,because t he schematics of the fraudulent conduct are,as in many rico enterprises,within the control of the defendants.we agree with the district court that this argument is paradigmatically antithetical to rule b requirement.as we have held,the rule does not permit a complainant to file suit first,and subsequently to search for a cause of action.hayduk lanna,cir see also feinstein resolution trust,cir it is not enough for a plaintiff to file a rico claim,chant the statutory mantra,and leave the identification of predicate acts to the time of trial.the plaintiffs have taken this proscribed approach here they have charged the defendants with schemes to defraud in violation of the mail and wire fraud statutes,yet maintain that i t is impossible for a layman or a plaintiff or class representative to articulate the specifics of each.by way of these statements,made in the declarations the plaintiffs submitted in response to the show cause order,they have essentially conceded what the district court they can not personally provide any information about the alleged fraud.
the plaintiffs did,as they emphasize,submit declarations from two expert witnesses to explain how the defendant sic practices form a rico scheme,but,as the district court concluded,those declarations fall short of that objective.each declaration provides examples of the defendants various claim practices challenged by the amended complaint,followed by the conclusion that the defendants send the plaintiffs documents in furtherance of the scheme for to obtain an economic benefit that it does not rightfully deserve.the declarations do not explain,however,how any of these schemes equates with a scheme to defraud under the mail and wire fraud than the statement that each individual plaintiff would have no way of knowing of the scheme and,again,simple nondisclosure does not mail or wire fraud make.
as the district court reasoned,the expert declarations or even certain snippets of the plaintiffs own deposition testimony might have buttressed a theory that the defendants claim practices violated the express or implied terms of their contracts with the plaintiffs,but breach of contract itself does not constitute a scheme to defraud.rather,the scheme must be intended to deceive another,by means of false or fraudu
