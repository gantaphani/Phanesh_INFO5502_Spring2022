in this case,the appellant,euclid homeowners association hoa,a homeowners association of a residential condominium,made a claim to its insurer for damages resulting from the january,northridge earthquake.hoa building was insured by the respondent,state farm fire and casualty company state farm,under a policy with coverage of for earthquake damage,subject to a percent deductible.the appellate record reflects that,after a preliminary inspection by representatives of both state farm and hoa,it was determined that the damage sustained was largely cosmetic and totaled an amount that was well below the deductible under the state farm policy.thereafter,hoa withdrew its claim and state farm closed its file.nearly eight years later,after the passage of code of civil procedure,section,hoa filed this action against state farm,alleging claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
on state farm motion for summary judgment,the trial court concluded that there was no dispute of material fact with respect to hoa withdrawal of its claim.the court held that such withdrawal excused state farm from further performance of any coverage obligation under the policy and precluded any claim for breach of contract or bad faith.state farm motion was granted and judgment was thereafter entered.after a review of the record on appeal,we conclude that the trial court analysis and ruling were correct and we will therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on january,hoa was the homeowners association managing a condominium building at euclid street,santa monica,california.state farm had issued a policy covering the period april,to april,that provided earthquake coverage of,subject to a percent deductible.
as of the date of the earthquake,hoa building had a number of deferred maintenance problems.for example,prior to any damage that might have been caused by the earthquake,the building needed new plumbing and had experienced leaks and water pressure problems also,the exterior of the building needed to be painted.in addition,there were problems involving balcony leaks,concrete cracks and uneven flooring 
about hours after the earthquake,building inspectors from the city of santa monica inspected hoa building and determined that it was structurally safe.they placed a green tag on the property.within a few days after the earthquake,a structural engineer retained by hoa management company found no structural damage to the building,but did discover a number of stucco and plaster cracks in the walls and ceilings shortly thereafter,a retired building inspector who was the father of one of the residents living in hoa building also inspected the building and found no significant structural damage.he also found,however,that there was a substantial amount of cosmetic damage.
in late january,hoa solicited at least five bids to make repairs to the building.none of those bids exceeded.on january,hoa submitted a claim of loss to state farm.state farm was advised by two officers of hoa that its president,elaine baker,was the contact person for the claim.on february,state farm confirmed this in a letter addressed to elaine baker but mailed to hoa management company in order to facilitate repairs to the building,hoa obtained a small business administration sba loan which,after an sba estimator had apparently visited the property,was set in the sum of 
because she had been informed by the engineer who had inspected the property that the damage to the building did not include structural damage and was apparently largely cosmetic,multiple ceiling and wall cracks and had received the same information from the retired building inspector,elaine baker formed the belief that the total damage to the building would not exceed the percent deductible.after discussing it with the other tenants she advised state farm,on or about february,that the previously submitted claim was withdrawn.state farm confirmed such withdrawal by a letter dated march,the fact and import of such withdrawal was not disputed or even questioned until this action was filed nearly eight years later,in late december.
the hoa building had also received a preliminary damage inspection by don robison,an independent adjuster hired by state farm.this inspection was conducted by robison on or about january,when he arrived at euclid,he asked an hoa board member to show him all of the earthquake damage to hoa building.she did so.they went around the building exterior,hallways and stairs looking for earthquake damage.robison inspected only three condominium units because he was advised that those were the only units with any earthquake damage.if he had been told there was a claim of earthquake damage in the other units,he would have inspected those units as well.
robison opinion of the extent of the damage to hoa building was consistent with the opinions which hoa had obtained.the earthquake damage was primarily cosmetic and involved stucco cracks and drywall cracks around windows and doors.robison did not see sufficient cosmetic damage to the wall finishes at euclid to suggest there was any structural damage beneath the walls.he knew that if there had been serious hidden structural damage there would also have been more serious cosmetic damage to the building finishes.in other words,if there had been broken wood framing behind the drywall,there would also have been extensive damage to the drywall itself.
based upon robison observations of cosmetic damage and his extensive experience in assessing damaged residential buildings,he formed the opinion that the earthquake did not cause structural damage to the hoa building and the cosmetic damage could be repaired by patching and painting.he admitted,however,that he had only perused the building,meaning that he walked around the property,looking at both the exterior and some interior corridors and hallways and stairs.he wrote down in his claim log that he thought the repairs could be made for.he did not write a complete estimate because he felt that the total damage was far less than the deductible.board member joan mccrea told robison she was not sure hoa was going to proceed with the claim.however,mccrea asked him to communicate directly with hoa president,elaine baker.
hoa went ahead and used its sba loan to make the various repairs needed by the building.as already noted see fn,ante,such repairs did not exceed,which was less than half of the deductible under the policy.neither hoa,nor its management company,nor any of its board members or residents ever contacted state farm again until for nearly eight years,after the passage of section.an examination of the record reflects that hoa apparent first contact with state farm after withdrawing its claim in was on or about january,when it caused the insurer to be served with this lawsuit which had been filed on december,just three days before the expiration of the revivor period created by section on february,state farm advised hoa by letter that the matter was being referred to its litigation counsel 
after filing an answer asserting a number of affirmative defenses,including the allegation that hoa damages did not exceed the policy deductible clause and that hoa had failed to comply with the duties in the event of loss provisions of the policy state farm responded to hoa complaint by filing a motion for summary judgment.as suggested by the record that we have just summarized,state farm primary contentions were that hoa had in fact withdrawn its claim in early within a few weeks after originally submitting it and thus state farm,as a matter of law,could not be liable for breach of either an express or an implied term of the policy and,in any event,the damages actually sustained by hoa as a result of the northridge earthquake were well below the percent deductible set out in the policy.
hoa responded to state farm detailed evidentiary showing by presenting a number of declarations,to which the trial court sustained state farm multiple evidentiary objections,and a separate state of undisputed facts that was conclusionary and unsupported by any admissible or relevant evidence.indeed,as the trial court put it,hoa separate statement of additional facts consists of eight legal conclusions asserting that state farm breached the insurance contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and acted with malice,oppression and fraud.no competent evidence is set forth in hoa separate statements.
on january,the trial court granted state farm motion for summary judgment.hoa has prosecuted this timely appeal.the parties assert the same contentions and arguments that were presented to the trial court,as summarized above

standard of review 
in addressing this appeal,we apply the settled principles of summary judgment review.
summary judgment is granted when no triable issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c villa mcferren th,d.after examining documents supporting a summary judgment motion in the trial court,this court independently determines their effect as a matter of law.hulett farmers ins.exchange th,d.the moving party bears the burden of establishing,by declarations and evidence,a complete defense to the plaintiff action or the absence of an essential element of plaintiff case.westlye look sports,th,d code civ,subd.f.the moving party must demonstrate that under no hypothesis is there a material factual issue requiring a trial.flowmaster,superior court th,d.when the moving party makes that showing,the burden of proof shifts to the opposing party to show,by responsive separate statement and admissible evidence,that one or more triable issues of fact exist.macelhenny,levy th,d code civ,subd.n.an issue of fact becomes one of law and loses its triable character if the undisputed facts leave no room for a reasonable difference of opinion.preach monter rainbow th,d.
state farm did not breach its contractual obligations under the policy 
hoa effectively never submitted a claim on which state farm was required to act 
in its policy,state farm undertook to provide coverage for any loss sustained by hoa by reason of earthquake,subject to a deductible of percent.state farm obligation was also subject to a number of conditions.one of those conditions was that the insured provide prompt notice of the claimed loss,including a description of the lost or damaged property.in addition,the insured was required to provide a timely submission of a sworn statement of loss.given the unrebutted evidence that state farm was advised,on or about february,by hoa president that the claim for which a notice had previously been given was withdrawn,neither of these conditions was ever met.indeed,the voluntary withdrawal of a damage claim by an insured arguably has the same legal consequence as the failure to file any claim at all or,after filing a claim,the failure or refusal to provide to the insurer the information necessary to adjust the claim.see,othman globe indemnity cir.
while the submission of a proper and timely notice and proof of loss may be subject to a substantial compliance standard mccormick sentinel life ins.d.and even a predicate requirement of insurer prejudice scottsdale ins.essex ins.th,d,the total failure to comply with the notice and proof of loss conditions will excuse insurer liability due to the failure of a condition precedent.see hickman london assurance cal,hall travelers ins.companies d.a fortiori,where an insured submits no claim at all or,as in this case,voluntarily withdraws the claim less than days after first giving notice of the claim to the insurer,the insurer can not be faulted for closing its file.the burden is on the insured to initiate and support a claim.
hoa voluntary withdrawal effectively resolved its original claim 
this record clearly demonstrates that state farm had every justification to conclude that hoa had independently determined that whatever damage its building may have sustained,it did not exceed the policy deductible.certainly,this was entirely consistent with state farm own initial inspection of the property following the earthquake.for nearly eight years hoa apparently believed this to be true as it did nothing further after the february claim withdrawal until it filed this action in late december.although hoa alleges that state farm had breached the contract of insurance,there is no factual basis for such a conclusion that is either alleged in hoa complaint or supported by any admissible evidence submitted in opposition to state farm motion for summary judgment.this record reflects only that state farm accepted hoa claim withdrawal and took no further action.it did not at any time fail or refuse to provide demanded policy benefits.it simply closed its claim file at hoa request.
in its complaint,hoa alleged only that state farm failed to adequately investigate hoa claim of damage.this alleged investigative failure led state farm to deny the claim as below the deductible.this is the sole factual basis alleged by hoa in support of its breach of contract claim.there is however,no record support for such allegations.indeed,the record directly contradicts such a claim.it is undisputed that in less than days after the northridge earthquake,hoa had satisfied itself that its damages were well below the deductible and voluntarily withdrew the claim that act,which is clearly demonstrated by the record excused state farm from any obligation to conduct further investigation of possible damage to the hoa property.these circumstances demonstrate that a claim was submitted and effectively resolved,to the apparent satisfaction of the parties and in accordance with the relevant terms,the deductible provisions of state farm policy.as we have previously held,a claim resolved by the parties to an insurance contract ends the matter and it will not be given new life by the provisions of section.see,rosenblum safeco ins.th,d.
thus,as of the date that hoa filed its complaint,state farm was not in breach of the policy.although hoa seems to argue otherwise,the passage of section did not give or create any rights for hoa beyond a window to file any claim it might otherwise have.as we explained in rosenblum safeco ins,supra,th at,d,s ection did nothing more than reopen the filing window,for a period,to those otherwise viable cases that had become.it did not impact or affect any other defenses that an insurer might have to an insured claim,a voluntary abandonment in light of policy limitations citations.indeed,to hold otherwise,as the foregoing authorities make clear,would risk subjecting section to the constitutional infirmity of contractual impairment.italics added.
moreover,this record demonstrates that state farm would sustain substantial prejudice as a result of hoa voluntary withdrawal of its claim in february if now,after nearly eight years of silence,its resurrection in this lawsuit is allowed.while the notice prejudice rule is applicable in california and requires that an insurer must demonstrate substantial prejudice arising from an insured failure to provide a timely notice and proof of loss downey savings loan ohio casualty ins.d,the undisputed record in this case establishes such prejudice to state farm.after hoa withdrew its claim,it spent up to in making repairs to its building.the nearly delay and the making of such repairs effectively denied to state farm any opportunity to fully investigate the loss which hoa now argues is over times greater than the amount it actually spent on repairs in.as noted,hoa voluntary claim withdrawal terminated both state farm obligation and reason to conduct an appropriate investigation.obviously,critical observations of the property as it existed immediately after the earthquake would be impossible nearly eight years after the fact.a number of the unit owners who were living in the building in have sold their units and moved away and were replaced by persons who have no firsthand knowledge of the damage allegedly sustained.indeed,the individual declared to be the person most knowledgeable during discovery in this matter was one robert wakefield,who did not even live at euclid at the time of the earthquake.as a result of these circumstances,it is clear that hoa failure
