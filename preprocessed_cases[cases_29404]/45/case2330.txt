in,marlene garnes family home in richmond,california was seriously damaged by a kitchen fire.she had purchased a fire insurance policy for the property,with a policy limit of the policy,from california fair plan association fair,california insurer of last resort.the dispute in this case and the issue on appeal is how much coverage garnes is entitled to under the policy.she claims she should receive the amount it will cost her to repair the house,less an amount for depreciation,the net amount of which the parties agree would be.fair contends the policy,and the insurance code,allow it to pay her the lesser of that amount or the fair market value of the house,which at the time of the fire was.the answer to this question depends on interpretation of sections,and of the insurance code including the phrases total loss to the structure,partial loss to the structure and actual cash value in section,and whether sections and permit insurers to provide less favorable coverage than that prescribed by section.applying our independent judgment to these questions of statutory interpretation,we conclude that garnes is correct.section of the insurance code provides that under an open fire insurance policy that pays actual cash value,as does the policy here,the measure of the actual cash value recovery shall be determined in one of two ways,depending on whether there has been a total loss to the structure or a partial loss to the structure.for a partial loss to the structure,the measure prescribed is the amount it would cost the insured to repair,rebuild,or replace the thing lost or injured less a fair and reasonable deduction for physical depreciation or the policy limit,whichever is less,subd.b.construed in accord with its plain meaning,this provision,coupled with sections and,sets a minimum standard of coverage that requires fair to indemnify garnes for the actual cost of the repair to her home,minus depreciation,even if this amount exceeds the fair market value of her home.further,the legislative history and the insurance commissioner interpretation of this statute also support this interpretation.fair arguments are based on interpretations of these sections that can not be squared with their plain language,and the contention that requiring recovery of repair costs less depreciation where they exceed fair market value is bad policy.the latter argument is for the legislature,not this court.the law supports garnes interpretation.therefore,we reverse the trial court judgment and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
fair is an insurance industry placement facility and joint reinsurance association created by the legislature in to ensure that homeowners who live in high risk or otherwise uninsurable areas have access to basic property insurance.cyr california fair plan th.it is composed of insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing basic property insurance within this state,and it is charged with assisting persons in securing basic property insurance and administering a program to equitably apportion that insurance,and the risks and benefits it entails,among california insurers,subd.a.
in october,garnes home in the iron triangle neighborhood in richmond was damaged by a fire.she submitted a claim to her insurer,fair,seeking indemnity for the costs required to repair her home,less depreciation.fair declined to pay the amount she requested and instead paid her the it determined represented the fair market value of her property in.when the parties were unable to agree,fair filed an action against garnes seeking declaratory relief regarding the interpretation of section.fair alleged it had issued garnes a policy that covered the damage to her home,that the cost to repair and rebuild the home was estimated to be more than and that the home fair market value in its undamaged condition before the fire was.it further alleged that garnes claimed she was entitled to the cost to repair her home,that fair had paid her the fair market value of for her home and that the parties disputed whether the damage resulted in a total loss or a partial loss within the meaning of section.fair contended the loss was total because the cost to repair exceeded the home fair market value,and that garnes was entitled only to the fair market value of the home under section.according to fair,garnes contended she suffered only partial loss,which entitled her under section to recover the lesser of the policy limit and the cost to repair or replace less depreciation.fair sought a declaration that damage to garnes home constituted a total loss within the meaning of the policy and section and that garnes,therefore,was entitled only to the actual cash value,meaning fair market value,of her richmond home.
garnes filed an answer contesting fair interpretation of section and alleging that the policy,as written,violates sections,and.she sought a declaration that total loss under section means total loss to the structure and that fair was violating its statutory obligations.she also filed a against fair asserting claims for breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing fair filed an answer denying her allegations.
in august,fair filed a motion for summary judgment on its complaint against garnes.it argued that the policy limits garnes to the actual cash value of the home where the cost to repair the damage exceeds the home fair market value,and that the policy complies with sections and.
fair based its motion on a handful of undisputed facts.these included that fair issued the policy providing coverage for garnes dwelling,that the dwelling was damaged by fire within the policy period,that garnes submitted a claim for the cost of repairing the damage,less depreciation,of,and that the appraised fair market value of the home before the fire was determined to be.fair also set forth the relevant terms of the policy,which stated that if the cost to replace or repair a damaged dwelling exceeded its actual cash value,which the policy referred to as total loss,fair would pay the actual cash value,but in any other case,which the policy described as partial loss,fair would pay the lesser of the cost to repair less reasonable depreciation or the actual cash value.
in opposition to fair motion,garnes offered the following additional facts the policy has a limit of,garnes father purchased the richmond home in the,it was garnes childhood home and garnes intended to repair and move back into it,but fair had refused to pay an amount sufficient to repair it.garnes also stated that fair never changed its policy form to comply with the amendments to section enacted by the legislature in,despite having been warned by the insurance commissioner,and had refused to pay her the amount required by section,subdivision b.
garnes contended that the amendments to section were part of the homeowners bill of rights,which was designed to protect consumers of insurance who suffer loss of homes or other structures,that the bill required insurers to amend their policies to comply with section by july,and that fair did not amend its policies.she argued that the policy,by seeking to limit recovery for partial losses to fair market value,was in clear contradiction with section.she further argued that the court should look to the insurance code,not the policy,to determine the extent of fair liability for her fire loss.
in a tentative ruling that it subsequently adopted as its order,the trial court granted fair motion for summary judgment,adopting fair interpretation of the statutes.the parties thereafter stipulated to certain rulings that resolved the remaining issues,and the court entered judgment in favor of fair on all claims.
this appeal followed.after the parties submitted their briefs,we received and granted requests to file amicus curiae briefs from the insurance commissioner commissioner,who is charged with enforcing the insurance code and other laws regulating the business of insurance in this state,and from united policyholders,a national organization that seeks to promote and protect the interests of insurance consumers 
discussion 
the facts here are not in dispute.the parties agree that garnes purchased from fair an insurance policy with a limit of covering fire damage to her richmond home for the period from december,to december.a kitchen fire occurred on january,within the policy period,that caused substantial damage to her home.the cost to repair the damage,including necessary lead and asbestos abatement,was.subtracting depreciation,the public adjuster submitted a claim to fair on garnes behalf for.fair obtained an appraisal to determine the fair market value of the home in its undamaged condition just prior to the fire,which was determined to be.
it is also undisputed that the policy fair issued to garnes is a fire insurance policy of a kind known as an open policy,meaning one in which the value of the subject matter is not agreed upon,but is left to be ascertained in case of loss.further,it is an actual cash value or acv policy.in a section entitled conditions,the policy contains a paragraph entitled loss settlement,which states in relevant part that fair will pay the following amounts for losses to garnes dwelling total loss if the greater of the cost either to reconstruct or replace the damaged part of the property exceeds the actual cash value before the loss of all covered property,we will pay such actual cash value.partial loss in the cases of losses that are not described in above,we will pay the least of the following amounts a the lower of the cost either to reconstruct or replace the damaged part of the property,less a reasonable amount for depreciation or b the actual cash value before the loss of the damaged property.the policy defines actual cash value of property to mean its fair market value.
at the crux of this appeal are two legal issues,which we review de novo.hawley ins.lopez th,the de novo standard of review applies to issues of statutory and insurance policy interpretation.first,do the relevant provisions of the insurance code,sections,and,which govern open acv policies,require fair to provide coverage to garnes to pay for the repair of the damage to her home,minus depreciation,if this amount exceeds the fair market value of her home,as garnes contends,or are these statutes consistent with the policy,which categorizes any loss in which cost to repair exceeds actual cash value as a total loss entitling the policy holder to,at most,the fair market value of her property,as fair contends second,if these statutes and the policy conflict,which governs the parties relationship here,the statutes,as garnes contends,or the policy,as fair contends we conclude garnes is correct as a matter of law in both respects the insurance code requires payment of the costs to repair her home,less depreciation,even if this amount exceeds the fair market value of her home,and it governs over any conflicting terms of the policy.
the insurance code requires fair to pay for the repair of garnes partially damaged home.
in their dispute over what the insurance code requires,garnes and fair principally debate two questions of statutory construction.first,does total loss in section,mean,as fair contends,damage to a dwelling so extensive that the cost to repair or replace it exceeds its fair market value,or,as garnes contends,the total physical destruction of a dwelling second,does actual cash value as used in section mean,as fair contends,the fair market value of the dwelling,exclusive of the land,or,as garnes contends,the actual cash value that is set forth in section,which for a loss that is partial is the lesser of the cost to repair the dwelling minus depreciation and the policy limit 
we construe insurance statutes to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent,looking first to the statutes words.calfarm ins.wolf th.if those words are clear,there is no need for construction.when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,however,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the object to be achieved,the evil to be remedied,public policy,the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,and legislative history,fn.omitted.applying these principles,we have examined the statutes plain meaning,the relevant legislative history and the insurance commissioner interpretation of the statutes,and conclude that garnes interpretation of the statutes is correct.
section plainly refers to physical,rather than economic loss.
section sets forth the measure of indemnity in fire insurance for an open acv policy.section,subdivision a states that an insurer indemnity obligation under an open acv policy is generally based on the expense of replacing lost or injured property this obligation is further explicated by subdivisions b and,which prescribe mandatory measures of actual cash value recovery for each of two distinct situations one that applies i n case of total loss to the structure and another that applies i n case of a partial loss to the structure or to loss of the contents 
in the case of a total loss to the structure,recovery is limited to the lesser of the policy limit or a property fair market value,subd.b.in the case of partial loss to the structure,however,recovery is not limited to fair market value instead,it is the lesser of the policy limit or the amount it would cost the insured to repair,rebuild,or replace the thing lost or injured less a fair and reasonable deduction for physical depreciation based upon its conditions at the time of the injury,subd.b.under subdivision b,it is clear that in the case of partial loss to the structure,the insured is entitled to repair,rebuild or replace that which was lost or injured.while such recovery is reduced by a deduction for physical depreciation and may not exceed the policy limit,nothing in subdivision b or the remainder of section indicates that the policyholder is limited to the fair market value of the property or any part of it.
the language of section not only specifies the meaning of actual cash value for total and partial losses,it provides strong indication of what constitutes a total or partial loss of a residential property specifically,that the determination depends on what happens to the structure.contrary to fair policy definition,which defines total loss and partial loss by reference to economic considerations whether the cost to repair exceeds the property fair market value,section differentiates between the degree of loss to the structure,and it prescribes two different measures of actual cash value depending on whether the loss to the structure is total or partial.
the parties cite various authorities regarding the meaning of the phrases total loss and partial loss,but these authorities are of little value because they do not address the statutory language before us total loss to the structure and partial loss to the structure.garnes cites authorities that are equivocal and indicate there are two possible meanings of total loss however,these authorities do not contain language referring to loss to the structure.fair refers throughout its briefs to total loss and partial loss but fails to address the full phrases used in section total loss to the structure and partial loss to the structure.
while neither party provides any case law or other authority interpreting either total or partial loss to the structure,we are at a loss to understand how the phrase loss to the structure,without more,can possibly connote the economic concept fair urges,a loss requiring repairs that would or would not cost more than the structure fair market value.while loss by itself may be physical or economic the structure obviously refers to a physical structure,the insured dwelling as garnes puts it,in the statute,the object phrase total loss operates upon the subject phrase a structure by way of the preposition to.had the legislature used the word of,or used a different sort of construction,such as where a structure is a total loss,there might be some ambiguity.but total loss to a structure unmistakably contemplates a quantum of physical damage,complete or total and excludes the sort of economic analysis employed by fair plan.
further,if the legislature had intended an economic definition,it could have said so.indeed,fair provided just such an explanation or definition for total loss in the policy if the greater of the cost either to reconstruct or replace the damaged part of the property exceeds the actual cash value before the loss of all covered property and black law dictionary defines constructive total loss as s uch serious damage to the insured property that the cost of repairs would exceed the value of the thing repaired.black law dictionary ed.but the legislature did not employ such language connoting an economic measure.instead it employed a phrase,loss to the structure,that connotes physical damage.applying that meaning to the undisputed facts,it is apparent that the loss to garnes home was partial within the meaning of section,as she contends,rather than total,as fair contends.garnes home was damaged,not destroyed.
nonetheless,fair contends,even if the loss was partial,the outer limit of recovery allowed under the insurance code is the fair market value of the dwelling.while fair acknowledges that section,subdivision b,addressing recovery in the case of a partial loss to the structure,does not mention fair market value as an outside limit,it contends section contains an indemnity cap,that the actual cash value cap in that section is synonymous with the fair market value of the property,and that section was not intended to repeal this cap.to evaluate this argument,we must consider section together with sections and.
sections,and read together support garnes view of fair statutory obligations.
section generally requires fire policies in california to be on the standard form set forth in section,but permits insurers to deviate from the form provided,that coverage with respect to the peril of fire,when reviewed in its entirety,is substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the insured than that contained in such standard form fire insurance policy.fair appears to argue that the policy is consistent with the standard form,which we take to mean substantially equivalent to it.
the standard form as set forth in section provides,in relevant part,that in consideration for the premium,the insurer does insure the insured and legal representatives,to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss,but not exceeding the amount which it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss,subd.a.fair argues this language clearly caps the limit of liability at the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss.next,fair relies primarily on jefferson ins.superior court cal d,jefferson for the proposition that actual cash value of the property as used in section,is synonymous with fair market value.thus,fair continues,if the cost to repair or replace the damaged property is more than its fair market value,then,according to the plain language of section,there is no coverage for the repair or replacement cost to the extent it exceeds the actual cash value of the property.
in jefferson,the california supreme court addressed the meaning of actual cash value as used in the average clause of the standard form insurance policy then set forth in section.the insurers sought to apply the average clause,which allowed them to proportionately reduce their coverage of fire damage to a hotel if the hotel owner had not purchased a policy insuring the building to at least percent of its actual cash value jefferson,supra,cal d at.they contended actual cash value,as used in the average clause of the policy,did not mean fair market value,but meant the replacement cost of the building less depreciation.id.at.the replacement cost for the hotel,less depreciation,was determined to be almost far more than the hotel fair market value of.id.at.whether the hotel was insured for percent of its actual cash value depended on whether actual cash value was interpreted to mean replacement cost less depreciation or the hotel fair market value.by using the higher replacement cost minus depreciation measure,the insurers sought to invoke the average clause and thereby reduce what they owed the hotel owner under the policy.id.at insurers sought to pay as proportion of loss.the supreme court held that a ctual cash value,as used in section,was synonymous with fair market value rather than replacement cost less depreciation.jefferson,at.
the jefferson court also sought to reconcile the use of the term actual cash value in the average clause with the term use in the basic insuring clause of the policy the term appears not only in the average clause,but also in the insuring clause and must be given the same meaning in both.the latter clause insures to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss,but not exceeding the cost to repair or replace the property since replacement cost less depreciation can never exceed replacement cost,it would not be logical to interpret this clause to mean to the extent of the replacement cost less depreciation,but not exceeding the cost to repair or replace the property.italics added.if actual cash value had been intended to mean replacement cost less depreciation,the legislature would not have used the cost to replace the property as a limiting factor,and would have specified as a limiting factor only the cost to repair the property.jefferson,supra,cal d at.
fair reliance on jefferson overlooks one thing the case involved a standard form policy that was part of an earlier statutory regime.in,years after jefferson was decided,the legislature adopted the current version of section,which prescribes the method for determining and therefore the meaning of actual cash value for purposes of determining the insurer indemnity obligation under an open fire insurance policy.thus,while in,the jefferson court interpreted actual cash value as used in section to mean fair market value,in the legislature adopted a more specific and mandatory measure of actual cash value in a closely related section of the insurance code,section for a total loss,the legislature determined actual cash value means the lesser of fair market value of the structure or the policy limit.for a partial loss to the structure or loss to its contents,it means the lesser of the cost to repair or replace the thing lost or injured minus a reasonable deduction for physical depreciation or the policy limit.see kirkwood california state automobile.bureau th,the amendments to section,set out the precise method of determining actual cash value of lost or injured property under an open policy of fire insurance.to the extent section definition of actual cash value differs from that in jefferson,this legislation controls see adoption of kelsey cal th,statute superseded prior california supreme court decision city and county of san francisco cobra solutions,cal th,statute superseded prior court of appeal decision.
but,fair argues,there is no indication that the legislature intended to abrogate the supreme court interpretation of the phrase actual cash value of the property as used in section.the legislature failure to specifically amend section,fair contends,gives rise to a presumption that it did not intend to alter the operation of that section.we disagree.section did not and does not define actual cash value,although the court interpreted that phrase in jefferson.as already discussed,the legislature thereafter,in amending closely related provisions of the insurance code,specifically defined that same phrase in a manner different from the definition adopted in jefferson.the legislation thus does indicate a legislative intent to abrogate jefferson in part.
fair also argues that section does not repeal the actual cash value limit set forth in section.but the argument relies on a statutory construction that would give actual cash value two different meanings as applied to an open fire insurance policy.in measuring the recovery for a partial loss under the mandatory language of section,actual cash value is the lesser of the policy limit or the cost to repair or replace the damaged property,less a deduction for physical depreciation.this would be further limited,according to fair,by reading the language to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss in section to mean the fair market value of the damaged property.thus,in fair view,section,in conjunction with section,means that a property owner whose home is damaged but not destroyed may recover not the lesser of two measures the policy limit and the cost to repair or replace the damaged property minus depreciation but the least of three the policy limit,the cost to repair or replace minus depreciation and the fair market value of the property.fair does not explain how the words of sections and support its position,and for the reasons just stated,they do not.
fair argues,however,that this interpretation is necessary to harmonize sections and.we are not convinced.to continue to interpret the language actual cash value in section to mean fair market value in the face of section specific definitions of that phrase would run contrary to the general presumption that a word or phrase used in a particular sense in one part of a statute is intended to have the same meaning if it appears in another part of the same statute.delaney baker cal th.the presumption is rebuttable if there are contrary indications of legislative intent id.at,but fair fails to identify such indications in the legislative history,and we are not aware of any.
further,if the legislature had intended to impose a fair market value cap or limit on recovery for partial loss to a structure,it would have included fair market value as an express limitation in subdivision b of section.this is made evident by the fact that the legislature included precisely such an express limitation on recovery for total losses to a structure in subdivision b.see,subd.b in case of total loss to the structure,the policy limit or the fair market value of the structure,whichever is less,italics added.if that is what it intended for subdivision b,it could and would have used the same or similar language.
finally,reading the language in section,to the extent of the actual cash value of the property to mean to the extent of the fair market value of the property would create a redundancy with section,subdivision b,which already limits recovery for total loss to a structure to the policy limit or the fair market value of the structure,whichever is less.italics added.see pacific legal foundation unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d,wherever reasonable,interpretations which produce internal harmony,avoid redundancy,and accord significance to each word and phrase are preferred.
nor do we agree with fair that interpreting the phrase actual cash value in section to mean the same as actual cash value defined in section will result in an implied repeal of section.again,section prescribes the basic terms of a fire insurance policy from which,under section,an insurer may not generally deviate.it uses the phrase actual cash value but,unlike section,does not prescribe a measure for it or otherwise define it.the definition fair urges,which focuses on fair market value,comes from case law discussing an earlier statutory regime,not from section.as incorporated into section,section definitions of actual cash value superseded the jefferson court definition in part but that does not mean section repealed section.
on the contrary,section can readily be harmonized with section by simply incorporating into section the more specific measures of actual cash value now prescribed by section.as the commissioner explains,s ection did not repeal section rather,it provided a clear and consistent measure of actual cash value that informs the reference to the term actual cash value in.thus,sections and do not conflict and must be read together to effectuate the intent of the legislature.
as so construed,section retains outer limits on insurers liability under an open fire insurance policy.those outer limits are the actual cash value as defined in section.in the case of a total loss to a structure,the outer limits are set by the lesser of fair market value or the policy limit,and in the case of a partial loss to a structure or loss to the contents,the outer limits are defined by the lesser of the cost to repair minus depreciation or the policy limit.fair fails to explain why,thus reconciled with section,section does not continue to serve its function of specifying the minimum requirements for fire insurance policies in california.we conclude that it does so.
c.the legislative history of section also supports garnes view of fair statutory obligations.
in,the legislature adopted assembly bill ab,amending section to add subdivision b which prescribes the measure of actual cash value recovery under an open actual cash value policy.stats,ch.the legislative history of ab,which was sponsored by the commissioner and the department of insurance assem.insurance,background information sheet on assem.bill reg.sess,further supports garnes view of fair statutory obligations to pay for the repairs of her home 
the purpose of ab is made plain in many documents contained in the legislative history files.in the wake of a series of devastating wildfires in southern california that destroyed thousands of homes legislators were concerned about a lack of clarity in insurance policies and inconsistent practices by insurers regarding the determination of actual cash value in adjusting claims under residential fire insurance policies.it is not entirely clear from the legislative history what gave rise to these concerns,but the state of the law at the time provides some idea.see san francisco internat.yachting group city and county of san francisco th,both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining legislative intent.
prior to,section provided under an open policy,the measure of indemnity in fire insurance is the expense to the insured of replacing the thing lost or injured in its condition at the time of the injury,such expense being computed as of the time of the commencement of the fire.stats,ch.in,the california supreme court in jefferson interpreted actual cash value to mean fair market value.and in,an appellate court in cheeks california fair plan th stated that an insurer could define actual cash value in a manner different from that required by section as interpreted by jefferson by simply drafting their policy to say so.cheeks,at.
against this muddled legal backdrop,it is perhaps not surprising that,as the legislative history reflects,insurers were using a variety of different measures of actual cash value when adjusting claims made under fire insurance policies,only one of which was replacement cost minus depreciation,and that disagreements about how to measure the recovery under fire insurance policies were a source of continuing conflict between insurers and policyholders.
for example,the background information sheet regarding ab for the assembly insurance committee in a description of existing law on this issue,stated the california residential property insurance disclosure provides coverage definitions however,the valuation of property is unclear and continues to be an issue between insurance companies and consumers.assem.insurance,background information sheet on assem.bill reg.sess.it described what the bill did as follows clarifies the measurement of actual cash value in relation to a homeowners insurance policy.prohibits insurance companies from deducting depreciation for labor when consumers replace or rebuild their property.ibid.in a section entitled what wrong with existing law why is this bill needed,it stated many homeowners policies do not clearly define how actual cash value will be determined and referred to a practice by insurance companies in calculating actual cash value of deducting the cost of labor.id.at.it further stated this bill will explain and provide consistency for how claims will be adjusted and prohibit insurance companies from deducting the cost of labor in settlements.id.at.
similarly,a report by the assembly committee on insurance dated may,states the purpose of the bill,according to the author,is to explain and provide consistency for how claims will be adjusted and prohibit insurance companies from deducting the cost of labor in settlements.the author states that many homeowners policies do not clearly define how actual cash value is to be determined,and additionally,when calculating this value,most insurance companies deduct the cost of labor.thus,supporters believe that consumers are forced to pay costs for a portion of the repairs.the author believes that this bill would clarify the measurement of actual cash value in relation to a homeowner insurance policy.assem.com.on insurance,on assem.bill reg.sess.as proposed to be amended may.the same report goes on to note that the author of the bill highlights that the california residential property insurance disclosure provides coverage definitions however,the valuation of property is unclear and continues to be an issue between insurance companies and consumers.id.at.
also,a report of the senate committee on insurance dated june,explains existing law.defines an open policy of fire insurance,generally speaking,as one that does not state the amount for which the item is insured,but also states,in essence,that the measure of payment is the expense to replace the item in its condition at the time just prior to commencement of the fire section.otherwise leaves unanswered important questions about how to calculate actual cash value.com.on insurance,on assem.bill reg.sess.as proposed to be amended june.it goes on to explain this bill.would specify that actual cash value,in the case of a total loss,would be equal to the policy limit or fair market value of the structure,whichever is less.would specify that actual cash value,in the case of a partial loss to the structure or contents,would be the amount it would cost the insured to repair,rebuild,or place sic the thing lost or injured less a fair and reasonable deduction for physical depreciation based upon the condition at the time of the injury or the policy limit,whichever is less.would specify,also with respect to a partial loss of a structure,that a deduction for depreciation shall apply only to parts of the structure that are normally subject to repair or replacement.ibid.it describes the purpose of the bill as t o clarify the measurement of actual cash value under a homeowners insurance policy,and to provide protections against cancellation during the rebuilding process.id.at.it further states that a ccording to the author office,many homeowners policies do not clearly define how actual cash value will be determined.the bill is needed to provide consistency in the calculation of actual cash value.consistency will further protect consumers.ibid.
finally,as described in an enrolled bill memorandum ab was designed,among other things,to clarify the measurement of actual cash value in relation to a homeowners insurance policy and help resolve disputes between insurers and their policyholders.enrolled bill memo.on assem.bill reg.sess.prepared for governor schwarzenegger.the same memorandum contains language similar to that in earlier reports,expressing the author statement that the valuation of property is unclear and continues be an issue between insurance companies and consumers.id.at.
significantly,another enrolled bill report explicitly recognized that ab would change the law as articulated in jefferson a section entitled legal impact states jefferson superior court,cal d california authority that defines actual cash value.state and consumer services agency,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.prepared for governor schwarzenegger.this suggests the legislature understood that ab would supplant jefferson definition of actual cash value with the measure set forth in the bill.
fair barely acknowledges this legislative history which undermines its contention that section,subdivision b provides a measure of actual cash value that is effectively modified and limited by ascribing a different meaning to the same phrase as used in section.the legislature was attempting to eliminate confusion and disagreement,not to create them.to read the actual cash value in section to mean fair market value and to create an additional limitation on recovery for partial losses beyond the limits imposed in section would create unnecessary complexity and inject uncertainty into the measure of recovery for a partial loss to a structure,undermining the legislative goals of providing clarity and avoiding disputes.as we have already stated,if the legislature had intended to limit actual cash value for partial losses by fair market value,it could have done so clearly by expressing that limitation in subdivision b of section.further,if that had been the legislature intent,one would expect to see some indication of it in the legislative history of ab,but there is none.
for these reasons,the legislative history supports garnes interpretation of insurance code sections and.
d.the insurance commissioner and the legislature interpretations also support garnes view of fair statutory obligations.
other factors support garnes interpretation.first,the insurance commissioner interpretation is consistent with hers.while we are not bound by the commissioner interpretive regulation,we nonetheless accord it great weight and respect.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,yamaha.
the commissioner interpretation is best reflected in a regulation the commissioner amended in to include the following language under a policy,subject to california insurance code section,where the insurer is required to pay the expense of repairing,rebuilding or replacing the property destroyed or damaged with other of like kind and quality,the measure of recovery is determined by the actual cash value of the damaged or destroyed property,as set forth in california insurance code section.cal.code,tit.the commissioner maintains this interpretation in his amicus curiae brief,and it deserves significant deference the commissioner interpretation obviously supports garnes interpretation.
second,as the commissioner points out,the legislature itself interpreted sections and,albeit in legislation enacted six years after the amendment of section.see people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco cal th,while subsequent legislation interpreting a statute can not change the meaning of the earlier enactment,it does suppl y an indication of the legislative intent which may be considered together with other factors in arriving at the true intent existing at the time the legislation was enacted.specifically,in sections and,the legislature prescribed a form of disclosure statement that insurers are required to provide consumers when issuing or renewing a policy of residential property insurance.that form informs purchasers of actual cash value coverage that actual cash value coverage pays the costs to repair the damaged dwelling minus a deduction for physical depreciation.if the dwelling is completely destroyed,this coverage pays the fair market value of the dwelling at the time of loss.in either case,coverage only pays for costs up to the limits specified in your policy.the legislature interpretation supports garnes interpretation of sections and in two respects.it indicates that actual cash value in the case of a damaged dwelling means the costs to repair the dwelling minus physical depreciation,and that the only cap in that situation is the limits specified in the policy.only where the dwelling is completely destroyed is actual cash value limited to the fair market value of the dwelling at the time of loss.it also indicates that partial loss to the structure and total loss to the structure in section mean,respectively,that the dwelling is damaged and that the dwelling is completely destroyed.
fair other arguments are unpersuasive.
fair argues that garnes and the commissioner interpretation of section,subdivision b would lead to absurd results because,if she had suffered a total loss,her recovery would have been limited to fair market value,whereas the partial loss she in fact sustained does not so limit her recovery.we disagree.it is conceivable the legislature intended for homeowners whose houses were not entirely destroyed to have the option of repairing their homes and remaining in the homes and neighborhoods they had chosen and,for some homeowners,such as garnes,in the neighborhoods and homes they had grown up in.
indeed,this would hardly be the first time that real property has been recognized as unique see real estate analytics,llc vallas th,civ.code,especially regarding a home.see lennar homes of california,stephens th,reese wong th,fn.code civ,civ.code,presumption of uniqueness conclusive in case of dwelling party intends to occupy.courts have recognized that homes may have values to an owner that are distinct from economic worth,such as familiarity,comfort and the memories they invoke,and accorded them legal significance,in re marriage of duke d,emotional attachment of custodial parent and children to family residence is fact to be considered in determining its disposition.
the legislature may well have concluded that,in the case of a home that is not destroyed and is amenable to repair,a measure of indemnity that provides for repair and rebuilding serves to preserve these intangible interests,at least to some degree.it may also have concluded that where a home is destroyed so completely that these attributes can no longer be enjoyed,a recovery that will enable the owner to purchase a dwelling of equal economic value is appropriate.we thus disagree with fair that the interpretation of sections and urged by garnes and the insurance commissioner produces absurd results.
fair also argues that garnes and the commissioner interpretation would eliminate the distinction between actual cash value and replacement policies.fair is correct in stating that replacement cost policies provide greater coverage than acv policies.see actual cash value coverage is the most limited level of coverage listed.it is also true,as fair points out,that a replacement cost policy pays the insured the replacement cost of the lost or damaged property regardless of its fair market value and without deduction for depreciation.however,the role that fair market value and depreciation play in the insured indemnity obligation under acv and replacement cost policies is different depending on whether loss to a structure is partial or total.when the indemnity afforded by acv and replacement cost coverage provided under the insurance code is compared for both partial and total losses,it becomes apparent that the interpretation of the code adopted by garnes and the commissioner does not conflate acv and replacement cost coverage.
indeed,as we have already alluded to,the differences between the two,under california law,are summarized succinctly in the mandatory form of disclosure contained in section actual cash value coverage pays the costs to repair the damaged dwelling minus a deduction for physical depreciation.if the dwelling is completely destroyed,this coverage pays the fair market value of the dwelling at time of loss.in either case,coverage only pays for costs up to the limits specified in your policy,subd.a.replacement cost coverage,extended replacement cost coverage and guaranteed replacement cost coverage are all intended to provide for the cost to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed dwelling,without a deduction for physical depreciation.replacement cost coverage pays replacement costs up to the limits specified in your policy extended replacement cost coverage provides additional coverage above the dwelling limits up to a stated percentage or specific dollar amount and guaranteed replacement cost coverage covers the full cost to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed dwelling regardless of the dwelling limits shown on the policy declarations page.
in other words,in comparing the two types of coverage with respect to a partial loss,an acv policy pays the costs to repair minus a deduction for physical depreciation up to the limits of the policy,whereas a replacement cost policy pays the cost to repair without a deduction for physical depreciation up to the limits of the policy,and for extended and guaranteed replacement cost coverage,beyond the limits of the policy.for total losses,acv pays the fair market value of the dwelling at the time of loss,whereas replacement coverage pays for replacement costs up to,or beyond,the limits of the policy.
this comparison,which is entirely consistent with garnes and the commissioner interpretation of sections and,belies fair contention that such interpretation will eliminate the distinction between acv and replacement cost policies.as the form disclosure statement reflects,the two types of policy provide different indemnity measures for both partial losses and total losses,and replacement policies provide more generous coverage than acv policies.the further cap fair would have us read into sections and is not required to achieve this result.in short,fair interpretation is a solution in search of a problem.
fair also argues that garnes and the commissioner interpretation would circumvent the provision in section that allows insurers to withhold a portion of the replacement cost under a replacement cost policy until the insured completes the repair or rebuilding of the property.that section provides in relevant part that i f the policy requires the insured to repair,rebuild,or replace the damaged property in order to collect the full replacement cost,the insurer shall pay the actual cash value of the damaged property,as defined in section,until the damaged property is repaired,rebuilt,or replaced and that o nce the property is repaired,rebuilt,or replaced,the insurer shall pay the difference between the actual cash value payment and the full replacement cost reasonably paid to replace the damaged property,up to the limits stated in the policy,subd.a.had garnes purchased a replacement cost policy,fair contends,she would have been entitled to the amount needed to rebuild,repair or replace the damaged property only upon showing that she had made those repairs.that is,actual repair or replacement of the damaged property is a condition precedent to recovery of replacement costs.under garnes interpretation,fair contends,she would be entitled to replacement cost recovery without having to first repair the property or to otherwise comply with section a.
fair description of the statute is not accurate.section,subdivision a does not require insureds to repair or replace as a condition precedent to recovery of replacement costs.rather,it implicitly allows fair or other insurers to include a provision in the policy requiring the insured to repair or rebuild in order to collect the full replacement cost,subd.a,italics added.however,it requires the insurer in the meantime to pay the actual cash value of the damaged property until the damaged property is repaired or rebuilt,and then to pay the difference between actual cash value and full replacement cost once the repair or rebuilding is completed.ibid.
moreover,fair does not explain or provide authority for what its obligations are where replacement costs are provided under an acv policy,much less how they differ from its obligations under section,subdivision a for a replacement cost policy.under both types of policy,actual cash value,as interpreted by garnes and the commissioner,for a partial loss means replacement cost minus depreciation,or the policy limits,whichever is less.however,the indemnity measure under a replacement cost policy is replacement costs without a deduction for physical depreciation,or the policy limits,whichever is less.under an acv policy,the owner is entitled to actual cash value,period that is,the lesser of the policy limit or replacement costs minus depreciation.under section,subdivision a,under a replacement policy that requires repair,rebuilding or replacement,the owner is entitled to actual cash value in the same amount as an acv policyholder,at the outset,but in addition,is entitled to the difference between actual cash value and full indemnity replacement costs without depreciation at the conclusion of repair or rebuilding.there is no anomaly in this result.the two types of policyholders are treated the same before completion of repair or rebuilding,but the replacement policyholder ultimately receives an additional payment,and is therefore better off than the acv policyholder,once repair or rebuilding is complete.
in short,this argument,too,lacks merit.
finally,fair argues that garnes and the commissioner interpretation would create a moral hazard.it posits that s ince a partial loss may easily exceed the actual cash value fair market value of the property,an insured could purchase an old,property,it and hope for a convenient fire that would not totally destroy the property.further,i f garnes interpretation were to be adopted,an insured would have every incentive to make a claim for the cost of repairs,then sell the property as a teardown and pocket the balance.
the hazard fair describes is,to be generous,overstated.the idea that individuals would purchase a property and then hope for a convenient fire that would not totally destroy the property is at best speculative.further,if fair means to suggest an owner might bring about such a fire intentionally,such moral hazard could be rectified by the insurer invocation of the intentional acts exclusion of section to deny coverage.regardless,fair argument amounts to an attack on the policy underlying the standard form fire insurance policy as adopted by the legislature.to the extent fair thinks it ought to be revised,it is a matter for the legislature,not this court.
the insurance code governs fair obligations to garnes.
the parties also dispute whether the policy is to be applied in accordance with its terms or instead in accordance with the insurance code.fair argues that regardless of whether the policy complies with the governing insurance code provisions,this case and its obligations to garnes are governed by the policy she purchased,not by some statutory form policy she never purchased.garnes relies on ins.garcia cal th for the proposition that a fire insurance policy that offers less coverage than the standard form insurance code is invalid,and that insurers may not provide less coverage than appears in the form fire policy set forth in.
in view of this dispute,a few words about the intersection of insurance policies and the insurance code are in order.as witkin points out,all insurance policies issued in california are governed by the provisions of the insurance code.citation.when insurance coverage is required by law,the statutory provisions are incorporated into the insurance contract.the obligations under an insurance policy are measured and defined by the pertinent statute,and the statute and the policy together form the insurance contract.citation.this general principle is subject to the condition that statutory provisions may not be read into a policy to the insured detriment,even where the statutory language appears mandatory.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.insurance.
while the duties and obligations of the insurer and the insured are contractual in nature,neither party has the inviolate rights that normally characterize private contracts.this is because the business of insurance is a matter of the public interest,and insurance contracts are subject to the reasonable exercise of the state police power.citation.any provision in an insurance policy that fails to conform to law or violates public policy is unenforceable.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra.finally,p olicies may be required to include certain provisions.ibid.citing as example.
consistent with these principles,courts have long held that an insurer has the right to limit policy coverage in plain and understandable language and may limit the nature of the risk it undertakes to assume.citations.nevertheless,an insurance company limitation of coverage must conform to the law and public policy.citation.furthermore,it is also well settled that insurance contracts,as contracts of adhesion,are subject to careful judicial scrutiny to avoid injury to the public.citation.courts considering adhesion contracts have a heightened responsibility to prevent the marketing of policies that provide unrealistic and inadequate coverage.thus,any portion of an insurance contract which is violative of public policy is not enforceable.carson mercury ins.th.
on which garnes relies,applied these principles to a fire insurance policy challenged by the insureds as inconsistent with section.the california supreme court held an exclusionary clause that was less favorable to the insureds than the section standard form policy impermissibly reduced the statutorily mandated coverage and thus was invalid and unenforceable,supra,cal th at.it reversed the court of appeal affirmance of a trial court ruling sustaining the insurer demurrer based on this exclusion provision in the policy.see ibid.the insured was entitled to enforce the policy notwithstanding the invalid provision.
specifically,involved a fire insurance policy that contained clauses precluding coverage if the loss was caused by the intentional act or criminal conduct of any insured,supra,cal th at.the court concluded these clauses impermissibly reduce coverage that is statutorily mandated.ibid.under the policy,as written,the insureds could not recover against even if they were innocent of wrongdoing because their losses were caused by a fire intentionally set by their son,who was a.id.at.although the policy purport ed to exclude coverage of the insureds losses,the court held section requires a comparison of the policy with the standard form fire policy set forth in section.id.at.the question was whether the policy provides coverage that is at least as favorable to the insureds as the coverage provided in the standard form.ibid.if it did not,the exclusion to that extent was invalid.ibid.
the supreme court determined that,while the statutory standard form contained no express exclusion for losses caused by intentional acts or criminal conduct,section set forth such a willful act exclusion that was incorporated into the standard form policy,supra,cal th at see id.at referring to section as implied statutory exclusion.but section was a more limited exclusion than that in the policy.section use of the term the insured bears directly on the instant coverage issue unlike policy exclusions that refer to an insured or any insured,exclusions based on acts of the insured are construed as not barring coverage for innocent coinsureds.citations.given the settled meaning of the language used in section,the standard form fire policy must be construed as including a willful acts exclusion that is protective of innocent insureds,at.because,under the standard form,which must be read as including section exclusion for losses caused by the wilful act of the insured,innocent insureds would not be barred from coverage,the court concluded that the intentional acts exclusion in the policy results in coverage that is not at least substantially equivalent to the level of protection provided in the statutory standard form fire policy and therefore was invalid.id.at.
in howell state farm fire casualty d,disapproved on other grounds in reid google,cal th,fn,also cited by garnes,division three of this court held that a policy provision that conflicted with insurance code provisions is unenforceable.the court held that an insurer could not enforce a policy exclusion that was inconsistent with section as interpreted by our supreme court in sabella wisler cal d.howell,at.
section and sabella govern how coverage is determined when there is a concurrence of different causes of loss.see howell,supra,d at.the insurer in howell,state farm,argued that it could contractually exclude coverage notwithstanding section and sabella.howell,at.our court flatly rejected that argument,citing three earlier cases in which the courts had applied the sabella efficient proximate cause analysis despite the presence of specific exclusionary language not present in the sabella contract.id.at.we stated the simple truth which state farm insists on ignoring is that this provision is a part of the statutory law of this state and is applicable to all insurers who issue all risk policies.for this simple reason,the exclusions contained in the policies at issue are not enforceable to the extent they violate section.ibid see also julian hartford underwriters ins.cal th,julian citing howell for the proposition that p olicy exclusions are unenforceable to the extent that they conflict with section and the efficient proximate cause doctrine.
further,the court reasoning in howell was not limited to section.stated simply,the important question presented by this case is whether a property insurer may contractually exclude coverage when a covered peril is the efficient proximate cause of the loss,but an excluded peril has contributed or was necessary to the loss.we conclude that a property insurer may not limit its liability in this manner,since the statutory and judicial law of this state make the insurer liable whenever a covered peril is the efficient proximate cause of the loss,regardless of other contributing causes.consequently,the policy exclusions at issue in this case are not enforceable to the extent they conflict with california law.howell,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
and howell hold,and julian reiterates,that where california statutory or decisional law require coverage,an insurer may not circumvent the law by employing contrary contract terms.fair counters with cheeks,in which a panel of the second district court of appeals suggested the opposite.however,it did so in dicta that can have no force after the california supreme court issued its decision in years later.further,howell and julian involved the requirements of sections and,general provisions of the insurance code regulating causes of loss,and case law interpreting them.these cases demonstrate that where an insurer policy contains terms that conflict with the law,the courts will decline to enforce the impermissible terms and read into the policy the terms required by statute.see also wildman,supra,cal d at where policy provisions were in derogation of vehicle code sections,latter must be considered a part of every policy of liability insurance even though the policy itself does not specifically make such laws a part thereof utah property casualty ins.guaranty ass united services auto.d,fn.and cases cited therein.
fair seeks to distinguish,contending it involved an exclusion that conflicted with section.according to fair,garnes does not claim that the fair plan policy fails to comply with section or.rather,she claims the policy does not comply with section.fair concedes that section is mandatory but argues section contains no such mandatory language and for this reason is inapplicable.
we disagree for three reasons.first,garnes plainly does argue that the policy fails to comply with sections and.she points out that section provides for coverage to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss,but not exceeding the amount which it would cost to repair.she further argues that section defines actual cash value for purposes of the section standard form policy and that the statutory definition is mandatory.
second,fair argument that section is not mandatory is spurious.section language is mandatory.it provides under an open policy that requires payment of actual cash value,the measure of the actual cash value recovery,in whole or partial settlement of the claim,shall be determined as follows,subd.b,italics added.it then sets forth the measures that apply in the case of total loss to the structure and in the case of partial loss to the structure.ibid.and lest there be any doubt about the meaning of shall,section provides that a s used in this code the word shall is mandatory.moreover,the legislative history makes clear that the measures adopted in section were intended to be mandatory.the legislative goals of clarity,consistency and dispute avoidance would not be served if insurers could substitute other and conflicting provisions in their policies in place of section.section thus provides mandatory minimum coverage under an open acv fire insurance policy.
third,since mandatory insurance coverage provisions are incorporated into every policy to which they pertain,section is incorporated into the standard form policy set forth in section,as indicated by case law,regulation and statute.in the court stated because section represents an implied exclusionary clause which by statute is to be read into all insurance policies citation,the standard form fire insurance policy is properly read as excluding coverage for losses caused by the willful act of the insured,supra,cal th at.similarly,because section represents an implied coverage requirement which is to be read into all open acv fire insurance policies,the standard form fire insurance policy is properly read as incorporating the measures of indemnity it sets forth.
further,as the commissioner points out,its regulation,subdivision f explicitly incorporates section into the standard form policy.the regulation states under a policy,subject to california insurance code section,where the insurer is required to pay the expense of repairing,rebuilding or replacing the property destroyed or damaged with other of like kind and quality,the measure of recovery is determined by the actual cash value of the damaged and destroyed property,as set forth in california insurance code section.cal.code,tit,subd.f.
finally,section requires a ll fire policies to be on the standard form or provide coverage for fire losses that is substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the insured than that contained in such standard form fire insurance policy.the policy,insofar as it purports to cap indemnity for partial losses at fair market value,or to treat a loss that does not destroy the structure as a total loss,is not substantially equivalent to or more favorable to garnes than the standard form policy,read to incorporate the provisions of section.the policy,to that extent,is unenforceable,and we must treat it as if its indemnity terms conformed to section.
in short,the policy must be applied in accordance with the insurance code rather than by its own terms.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed,and we remand the case to the superior court for proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.garnes is awarded costs of appeal.
all further statutory references are to the insurance code,unless otherwise indicated.
the suit also named garnes husband,johnie garnes,who is now deceased.
fair also alleged it had paid her separate amounts totaling about for demolition,asbestos abatement,emergency board up and lost rental value.those amounts are not in dispute.
the parties and the commissioner have also submitted various requests for judicial notice,some of which we now rule upon.on july,garnes submitted a request for judicial notice of certain correspondence from counsel for the commissioner to counsel for fair,which fair opposed.we deny this request as untimely,having been filed after fair had filed its respondent brief.see evid.code,subd.a.on august,the commissioner submitted a request for judicial notice of five items.we grant the request for the first three items,but deny it as to the two letters from the commissioner counsel to fair counsel in and because,as fair points out in its brief in response to the commissioner amicus brief,these letters pertain to an argument that fair policy is unenforceable because fair did not seek or obtain the commissioner permission to use it that was not raised in the parties briefs on appeal.mercury casualty hertz th,as a general rule,issues not raised by the appealing parties may not be considered if raised for the first time by amici curiae.further,to the extent the letters also reflect the commissioner interpretation of the statute,they are redundant of the commissioner view as stated in his brief.we also deny fair subsequent request for judicial notice of materials related to this argument of the commissioner that we have declined to consider.see people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,fn.that judicially noticed material be relevant to a material issue is a precondition to the taking of judicial notice.
the policy insures the dwelling for and personal property for.
this is to be distinguished from a valued policy,which is one that expresses on its face an agreement that the thing insured shall be valued at a specified sum.as fair points out in its brief,the
