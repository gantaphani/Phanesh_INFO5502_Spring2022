the accident 
respondents are friends and share a condominium at village green court in los angeles.respondent walker is years old the bulk of her income is per month in social security payments respondent williams is an office worker earning about per month.as condominium owners,respondents belonged to the village green homeowners association hoa.
walker owned a honda.on the afternoon of june,while williams was at work,walker was proceeding towards her detached garage to get her car.the garages at village green are not owned by the individual condominium owners and are located in a common area.when walker saw her garage door,she pressed the remote garage door opener.another tenant,juanita wasson not a party hereto,was struck by the garage door as it was opening wasson was thrown to the ground and suffered a broken hip.
the policy 
farmers insured hoa under a policy.the policy provided coverage for claims of bodily injury.the named insured was hoa.the policy also stated that an insured was each other of the described condominium,but only with respect to that person liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or repair of the portion of the premises which is not owned solely by the or out of that person membership in the association.
about two and a half months after the accident,wasson made a claim against hoa,which reported the claim to farmers.
farmers assigned the claim to john hughes,who described himself as a general adjustor.he started with farmers in from to the time of trial,he handled homeowners association claims.hughes reported to commercial team leader steve hedglin,who in turn reported to commercial claims office manager thomas weindorf.
hughes began by contacting hoa board member edna ridgley,who told him that wasson had been struck by a garage door operated by remote control.on august,hughes visited the scene of the accident and took wasson statement.in substance,wasson stated that someone had activated a garage door by remote control,and that the opening door threw wasson across the driveway,breaking her hip.hughes prepared a report summarizing hoa coverage and the basic facts of the claim.hedglin reviewed the report on september,and made the following notation need insured statement.need scene pictures in file.need liability analysis.liability questionable.
in october,at the request of wasson attorney,farmers paid wasson under hoa coverage for medical expenses.
the next event was a report prepared by hughes and sent to hedglin.the report noted that wasson had a broken hip and had incurred approximately in medical bills.the report also noted the possibility of contribution by the unit owner who had opened the garage door.however,the report noted that that this unit owner advised hughes that she did not have any liability insurance to cover her for this accident.
the rest of the year was taken up with unsuccessful attempts to obtain a further statement from hoa ridgley.a notation by hedglin made in november repeated that liability was unlikely.
on january,hughes spoke with wasson attorney,who offered to settle with hoa for medical expenses of about.hughes told the attorney that he had not yet obtained a statement from hoa and that it was unlikely that farmers would settle for the amount demanded.
wasson filed her action on february,the named defendants were hoa and respondents.
hughes received the complaint on march.he contacted ridgley,who told him that respondents were unit owners.hughes did not think that respondents were insured or covered by the policy.
farmers assumed hoa defense without reservation.the case was ultimately assigned to attorney michael,who filed an answer on hoa behalf.also filed,but did not serve,a against respondents.a litigation report written by shortly thereafter estimated that an adverse verdict could be in excess of to.prediction turned out to be accurate.as we relate below,the eventual jury verdict in favor of wasson was.
respondents were served with the complaint on march.respondent williams went to hoa ridgley and told her that she had reviewed the ccr for hoa and concluded that respondents were covered for liability because the accident occurred in a common area.williams explained that she and respondent walker did not carry homeowner insurance because they were careful and only invited their lifelong friends who would not sue them.
respondents retained the firm of halverson associates.respondents charged the retainer of on a credit card,and continued to pay their legal bills by means of the credit card.attorney theresa powell was assigned to handle their case.
powell called hughes and and requested,informally,that farmers defend respondents.these requests were denied,also informally.this led to a formal request by powell set forth in a letter dated april.the letter pointed out that the accident occurred on village green common property,in an area maintained and managed solely by village green,and that homeowners had no rights with regard to the use of the garage.when hughes received this letter,he understood that he was under an obligation to act in good faith toward respondents,which meant,among other things,that he was to take account of facts that supported respondents.hughes,however,concluded that respondents potential liability had nothing to do with the ownership,maintenance or repair of the premises.
farmers concedes that what now occurred violated farmers own protocol that was to be followed when a request to furnish a defense was denied by farmers.neither hughes,hedglin or even weindorf had the authority to deny an insured request for a defense.only weindorf direct supervisor,zone manager eric sharp,had that authority.the protocol required the following steps upon receiving powell request to defend respondents,hedglin would have reviewed the file to determine whether it presented a coverage question if he thought that there was such a question,he would have directed hughes to prepare a coverage question review if hedglin was satisfied with this review,he would forward it to weindorf if weindorf agreed,he would pass the matter on to sharp and sharp would make the final decision.
as it turned out,the decision to deny respondents a defense was made by hughes and hedglin.hughes decided that there was a potential that respondents were individually liable since hoa had nothing to do with the garage door opener that respondent walker used to open the garage hoa had neither owned or furnished,nor had it operated,the garage door opener.hughes concluded that respondents were not entitled to a defense on their individual liability they were entitled only to a defense as hoa members.there is a short paper trail of notes exchanged between hughes and hedglin in which the two men agreed that hughes theory of the matter was correct,and that powell should be so informed.on june,hughes wrote powell a letter in which he denied respondents a defense for their individual liability arising from the use of the garage door opener.the letter stated that respondents would be represented collectively as hoa members.
the initial decision made by hughes and hedglin to deny respondents a defense was not reviewed by either weindorf or sharp it is another matter whether that decision was effectively ratified by farmers.as we note below,substantial evidence supports the jury verdict that farmers adopted or approved the decision after it was made.on june,in an internal memo
