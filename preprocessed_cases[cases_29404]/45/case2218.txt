transamerica leasing,transamerica sued several insurance underwriters the underwriters,alleging that the underwriters owe transamerica damages under an insurance policy.the district court granted partial summary judgment to transamerica,and a jury awarded transamerica in damages.the underwriters appeal,and we reverse and remand for trial.
transamerica is a lessor of ocean cargo containers and related equipment.in the early,transamerica entered into various lease agreements with venezolana de navigacion cavn,a venezuelan government shipping line.under these agreements,transamerica leased various equipment to cavn,including containers,trailers,and chassis.cavn used this equipment to move cargo on routes around the world.
the lease agreements between transamerica and cavn required cavn to obtain insurance coverage for the leased equipment,so cavn acquired all risk insurance from the underwriters.cavn first slip insurance policy with the underwriters covered the year beginning june,and named cavn as the only assured.subsequently,the parties executed an addendum that stated 
noted and agreed as from inception,named assured is more precisely as below and not as previously advised venezolana de navigacion associated companies and various lessors.losses if any are payable to the assured as their respective interests may appear or order.all other slip terms,clauses and conditions remain unaltered.
the policy,as well as the policies that followed,stated that it should be interpreted according to english law and practice.the policies provided all risk coverage for the equipment leased by transamerica to cavn,but listed various exclusions and conditions.one such exclusion excepted loss,damage or expense arising from insolvency or financial default from coverage.
cavn again acquired all risk insurance from the underwriters for the policy year beginning june.the named assureds were venezolana de navigacion leasing companies as owners and producers of equipment subsidiary associated affiliated companies.addendum number one to the policy,dated october,states it is hereby noted and agreed to accept the following as additional payees as their respective interests may appear transamerica leasing,incorporated all other terms,clauses and conditions remain unaltered.the parties dispute the authenticity of this addendum.
the underwriters again provided cavn with all risk insurance for the year beginning june,with the policy essentially identical to the policy.on november,the policy was cancelled due to cavn failure to pay premiums.
in july,cavn informed transamerica that it had lost track of at least pieces of transamerica equipment.transamerica searched for and recovered some equipment but could not locate many units.in october,cavn informed transamerica that the units either were lost or damaged and would not be returned.
on november,susan esposito,manager of risk management for transamerica,sent a letter to rollins huding hall,cavn united states broker,giving notice of a claim under the policy for physical damage and loss of containers that had been on hire to cavn.on december,the underwriters declined coverage,stating 
due to the volume of claims intimated against under the above policies,the age of several of the claims and the total lack of assistance insurers have received from in identifying the number of claims lodged with them,insurers hereby formally decline cover in respect of any claims of whatsoever nature that may fall for their consideration under any of the policies referred to above.
insurers hereby repudiate cover under the above policies due to late notification and failure by cavn to disclose material facts to underwriters at each and every renewal subsequent to bankruptcy proceedings in the venezuelan supreme court.
transamerica does not know how,or on the precise date on which,the missing and damaged containers were lost,damaged,or destroyed.cavn financial troubles caused it to cease doing business in july and to file for protection under venezuelan bankruptcy law in october of that year.
in september,transamerica sued the underwriters in florida state court,alleging that the and policies together,the policy cover transamerica claim for damages resulting from the lost equipment.the underwriters removed the case to federal district court under diversity jurisdiction.in may,the district court granted partial summary judgment to transamerica,holding that transamerica is entitled to recover under the policy.first,the district court held that transamerica is an additional assured under the policy.second,the court rejected the underwriters argument that alleged cavn misrepresentations voided the policy,thereby preventing transamerica from recovering.instead,the court held that the policy was severable,so that even if cavn failed to disclose material facts when renewing the policy,the policy continued to provide coverage for transamerica.third,under the burden shifting test enunciated in new hampshire martech usa,cir,the court held that the underwriters failed to show that the loss of equipment occurred outside the policy period.finally,the court found a genuine issue of material fact regarding the issue of damages,so a jury trial on the damages issue ensued.
before trial,transamerica filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the underwriters from producing any evidence at trial relating to defenses not raised in the underwriters december,declinature letter.the district court granted transamerica motion.the damages trial resulted in an award of to transamerica.the underwriters appeal.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.mitchell usbi,cir.a district court may grant summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.thus,a court may grant summary judgment only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact.crawford babbitt,cir.as the policy dictates,we apply english law.
is transamerica an additional assured,a loss payee,or both 
the initial issue is whether transamerica is an additional assured,a loss payee,or both an additional assured and a loss payee under the policy.as the district court explained 
a coinsured party under an insurance policy has all the rights afforded to the named assured and can recover under the policy under its own right.on the other hand,a loss payee is merely a party designated to receive payment should the named insured prevail on its claim.in other words,a loss payee can only recover to the extent the named insured can recover.
see also couch on insurance ed.loss payee rights under insurance policy are derivative of named insured rights when named insured has no right to recover,loss payee can not recover under policy.the district court held that transamerica is both an assured and a loss payee under the policy and,therefore,can recover damages under its own right.
the policy lists the assured as venezolana de navigacion leasing companies as owners and producers of equipment subsidiary affiliated companies.emphasis added.this language seemingly requires us to find that transamerica,a leasing company,is an assured.
however,the underwriters point to an addendum to the policy that states it is hereby noted and agreed to accept the following as additional payees as their respective interests may appear transamerica leasing,incorporated.the underwriters argue that the addendum specific reference to transamerica takes precedence over any general policy terminology to the contrary.see macgillivray on insurance law ed stating that clauses of specific application may contradict clauses of general application which,if they stood alone,would control the specific subject matter,and the clause of specific application then controls.
viewing the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the underwriters,we hold that the addendum creates an issue of fact necessitating a jury trial.transamerica disputes the authent
