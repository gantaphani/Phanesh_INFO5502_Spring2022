the appellants in this case are a group of insurance companies the insurers who were sued in state court by appellee russell corporation russell.the insurers removed the case on diversity grounds,but the district court remanded for want of unanimous consent to removal.we affirm.
background 
russell filed this action in the circuit court of jefferson county,alabama,seeking to determine whether there is insurance coverage for contamination to a lake and surrounding property allegedly caused by russell.russell claimed that the insurers breached their obligations to defend and indemnify russell with respect to two civil actions for property damage and personal injury.two of the insurers timely removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of alabama,based on diversity jurisdiction.russell,however,argued that a service of suit clause contained in its insurance policy with defendant first state insurance company first state rendered first state consent void.the service of suit clause provides 
it is agreed that in the event of the failure of this company to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder,this company,at the request of the insured,will submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction within the united states and will comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction and all matters arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with the law and practice of such court.
the district court agreed with russell and found that the foregoing clause prevented first state from consenting to removal.accordingly,the district court granted russell motion to remand pursuant to c for want of unanimous consent to removal.the insurers filed timely notices of appeal challenging the district court remand order.
whether this court can review the district court decision to remand for failure to comply with the unanimity requirement when the district court decision was based on a service of suit clause that prevented one defendant from consenting to removal.
if the remand order is reviewable,the remaining issue is whether the district court erred in interpreting the service of suit clause and concluding that the case was due to be remanded because all defendants did not consent to removal.

iv.discussion 
as a preliminary matter,we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.because the district court remand order constitutes a final judgment for the purpose of our appellate jurisdiction,we may review that order unless d applies.florida polk county prison health,cir.section d provides that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise despite this broad provision,the supreme court has held that d bars appellate review only where the remand order is based upon grounds specified in c.thermtron,hermansdorfer,d see also snapper,redan,cir.section c specifies two grounds for remanding a removed case lack of subject matter jurisdiction or procedural defect in the removal of the case.things remembered,petrarca,d florida polk county,at.therefore,in order to determine whether we have jurisdiction to review this appeal,we must decide whether the instant remand order was based upon either of those grounds.
while there is no question that the first ground dealing with subject matter jurisdiction is not at issue in this case,the second ground is a different matter.here,the district court remanded the case to state court because the unanimity requirement was not met.the unanimity requirement mandates that in cases involving multiple defendants,all defendants must consent to removal.chicago,ry.martin.in re ocean marine mut.protection and indem.ass n,cir in re federal sav.loan ins,cir.we have held that a remand based solely on the unanimity requirement is clearly based on a defect in the removal process.in re bethesda mem l hosp,cir in re ocean marine,at.in other words,the general rule is that if a case is remanded for failure to comply with the unanimity requirement,the remand is based on the second ground set forth in c.in re ocean marine,at.consequently,such a remand is normally not subject to appellate review.id.the matter at hand,however,is not the normal case.
here,the district court found that the unanimity requirement was not met only after it had interpreted the service of suit clause and determined that the clause rendered first state consent void.in essence,the court made a substantive determination of a contractual provision,which was external to the removal process,and found that the provision precluded first state from removing or consenting to the removal of the state court action.as a result of this finding,the district court concluded that there was a lack of unanimous consent,which,as explained above,is considered a procedural defect.thus,the remand order was based on a substantive determination outside of the removal process,which led the court to find a defect in the removal process.
this court recently addressed a similar situation in the case of snapper,redan,cir.snapper involved litigation over numerous security agreements,each of which contained the following forum selection clause 
the guarantor agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this instrument may be brought in the courts of the state of georgia or the united states district court,northern district of georgia,atlanta division,all as creditor may elect.by execution of this instrument,the guarantor hereby submits to each such jurisdiction,hereby expressly waiving whatever rights may correspond to it by reason of its present or future domicile.
snapper,at.snapper,the creditor,instituted litigation in state court against each of the guarantors.id.at.the guarantors timely removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,dekalb county.id.however,the district court promptly remanded the case to state court finding that the forum selection clause in each of the security agreements signed by the guarantors constituted a waiver of their right to remove.id.at.
on appeal,the snapper court noted that d bars appellate review of a remand order based on a defect in the removal process.id.at citing new sports recreation,cir.however,the court determined that the remand order before it was based solely on the forum selection clauses,which were entirely separate from the removal process.id.at.the court reasoned that 
a remand based on a forum selection clause depends on an adjudication of the meaning of the clause,a determination that is external to the removal process.the ultimate determination that the clause does not permit further adjudication in that particular federal forum does not render the removal defective in any ordinary sense of the word it merely means that the federal court has held the parties to the terms of their agreement,as with any other contractual adjudication.
id.in other words,the court concluded that the district court did not remand due to a defect in the removal process.id.at.accordingly,the court in snapper held that d did not bar appellate review.id.
we recognize that snapper is not directly on point to the case at bar because the unanimity requirement was not at issue there.however,snapper does provide instruction that an appellate court may properly exercise jurisdiction over a remand order which was based on the district court interpretation of a contractual provision between the parties.id.many of our sister circuits share this view.karl koch erecting new york convention ctr.dev,cir reviewing on appeal a remand order based on a forum selection clause foster chesapeake ins,cir same mcdermott,lloyds underwriters of london,cir reviewing on appeal a remand order based on a service of suit clause regis assocs.rank hotels mgmt,cir holding that in a case where the remand order was based on a forum selection clause,the order was reviewable on appeal because it was predicated on a substantive decision on the merits of a collateral issue as opposed to just matters of jurisdiction pelleport investors,budco quality theatres,cir holding that an order remanding to state court on the basis of an interpretation of a forum selection agreement is reviewable on appeal milk n more,beavert,cir same.while the foregoing cases represent persuasive authority,only one circuit court has addressed the precise issue at hand.
in sbkc serv.prospect partners,cir,the tenth circuit considered a case virtually identical to the one before us and concluded that d did not prohibit appellate jurisdiction.id.at.the district court in sbkc remanded the case to state court because one defendant waived its right to remove the case according to the district court interpretation of certain clauses.id.at.the district court concluded that as a result of the one defendant inability to remove the case,that defendant was prevented from joining in or consenting to the removal by the other defendants as required under.id.in essence,the district court remanded for failure to comply with the unanimity requirement.id.on appeal,the appellee argued that the remand order was not reviewable because it was based on a procedural defect.id.the court of appeals disagreed.
after discussing an earlier case where the tenth circuit held that a remand order based on a forum selection clause was reviewable,the sbkc court concluded that d did not prevent it from entertaining the appeal.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court disregarded the fact that the district court remand order was ostensibly based on a procedural defect,because the procedural defect found by the district court arose only because it held that the choice of venue clauses rendered the defendant consent void.id.furthermore,the sbkc court noted that if it accepted the district court characterization of the basis for the remand,it would create an opportunity for any district court to insulate from review a remand decision predicated upon a contract interpretation by specifically stating that its construction of the agreement voids unity or consent to removal.id.this practice,the court reasoned,would contravene public policy.id.accordingly,the court exercised jurisdiction over the appeal.id.we agree with the tenth circuit analysis.
as stated,this case is essentially indistinguishable from sbkc.like the district court in that case,the district court here made a decision on the substantive merits of a contractual provision before concluding that the unanimity requirement had not been fulfilled.as in sbkc,the district court in this case characterized its remand order as one based on a procedural defect.however,after analyzing the remand order we conclude that the district court finding of procedural defect was premised upon its substantive decision regarding the service of suit clause,which was completely external to the removal process.based on the reasoning contained in sbkc,we determine that d should not preclude us from reviewing that substantive decision.because we agree with the holding in sbkc and adopt the reasoning contained therein,we hold that the instant remand order is subject to appellate review.
we turn now to the merits of this dispute.the question is whether first state waived its right to consent to removal when it issued an insurance policy to russell containing a service of suit clause.as noted earlier,the service of suit clause provides that in the event that first state fails to pay any amount claimed to be due under the policy,russell may bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction and first state must comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction the district court found that by executing this clause,first state had agreed to go to,and stay in,the forum chosen by russell.the court reasoned that allowing first state to participate in the removal from russell selected forum would ignore the plain meaning and diminish the importance of the language found in the service of suit clause.in short,the district court refused to allow first state to avoid its promise by seeking to remove a claim brought by russell in state court.after reviewing the record,we find ourselves in agreement with the district court decision.
the insurers argue that first state consent to removal was allowable because the binding service of suit clause is contained in only one of three policies issued by first state to russell.we disagree.first state clearly granted russell the power to select the court in which disputes concerning the policy in question would be adjudicated,and the clause in question contains no exception for cases also involving other first state policies.accordingly,first state argument is unavailing.
while this court has not ruled upon the precise language contained in the first state policy,every federal court excluding those addressing removal under the foreign sovereign immunities act interpreting this clause has determined that language essentially identical to that contained in the first state policy constitutes a waiver of the right to remove.see,the travelers ins.keeling,cir foster chesapeake ins,cir transit cas.certain underwriters at lloyd of london,et,cir public util.dist.of grant county illinois employers ins.of wausau,cir unpublished opinion.thus,the collective holdings of all federal courts that have addressed similar service of suit clauses would support a remand in this case because first state consented to be sued in any jurisdiction chosen by russell thereby waiving its right to remove this case to federal court.moreover,as discussed above,this court has ruled that a similarly worded forum selection clause constitutes a waiver of the ability to seek removal.snapper,at.
the insurers attempt to distinguish snapper to salvage their position against remand.they argue that the snapper court interpreted a policy with slightly different language from that contained in the first state policy.the distinction,however,is immaterial because in both cases the pertinent clause gave the party commencing a lawsuit the sole right to choose the forum for litigation.by the plain language of the service of suit clause contained in its policy,first state agreed to submit to any court of competent jurisdiction selected by russell and to comply with all requirements necessary to give such court jurisdiction over a dispute between first state and russell.to permit first state to consent to removal from the forum selected by russell would defy the express language of first state contract.see snapper,at.
in their attempt to evade the effect of the service of suit clause,the insurers rely on a series of inapposite cases that either depend upon a rationale that has been rejected by this court or concern distinguishable contract clauses that have nothing to do with the right of removal.indeed,four of the cases relied upon by the insurers are state court cases none from alabama that do not serve as authoritative precedent for this court.see brooke group,jch syndicate,cannelton,aetna cas.sur.of,whirlpool certain underwriters at lloyd,london,d,columbia cas.squibb.these state court cases do not even concern a waiver of the right to remove as here rather,they address the issue of forum non conveniens.this critical difference is determinative since private parties can not bargain away the power of a federal court to order the dismissal or transfer of a case based upon forum non conveniens grounds.as explained in archdiocese of milwaukee underwriters at lloyd,london,
the difference between remand and forum non conveniens is the difference between a purely private interest and a public interest therefore,the forum non conveniens cases have no application to a remand case.the defendants right to remove a case is their right alone.they can waive it,exercise it,or bargain it away.the court and the public have no interest in what the defendants do with their right to remove.on the contrary,forum non conveniens deals with where a case should be t
