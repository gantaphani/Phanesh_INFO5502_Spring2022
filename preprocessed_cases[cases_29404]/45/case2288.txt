in palma industrial fasteners,cal d palma,we outlined the rare circumstances in which an appellate court may grant accelerated writ relief in the form of a peremptory writ in the first instance,in lieu of following the usual procedures associated with the issuance of an alternative writ or an order to show cause.we held that,at a minimum,a peremptory writ of mandate or prohibition may not issue in the first instance without notice that the issuance of such a writ in the first instance is being sought or considered.palma,supra,cal d at.in addition,we emphasized that an appellate court,absent exceptional circumstances,should not issue a peremptory writ in the first instance without having received,or solicited,opposition from the party or parties adversely affected.ibid.pursuant to palma,our courts of to ordering issuance of a peremptory writ in the first notice that such a writ may issue,and invite informal opposition,in orders routinely called palma notices.
at issue in the present case is the propriety of suggestive palma notices.a suggestive palma denominated a coercive or speaking palma contains the following notice that the court of appeal intends to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance granting the relief requested by the petitioner a discussion of the merits of the writ petition,with a suggestion that the trial court erred in the manner claimed by the petitioner a specific grant to the trial court of power and jurisdiction to change the disputed interim order and enter in its place a new order consistent with the views of the appellate court,in which event the writ petition will be vacated as moot and a solicitation of opposition to the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance,should the trial court elect not to follow the appellate court recommendation.
as discussed below,we conclude that it is not improper for an appellate court to issue a suggestive palma notice,and that it may do so without first having received or solicited opposition from the real party in interest.a suggestive palma notice is not the equivalent of a peremptory writ,which requires both notice and an opportunity for opposition before the writ may issue in the first instance.although a suggestive palma notice may be styled as an order,such a notice in no way commands or otherwise obligates the lower court to follow the course of action suggested by the appellate court.rather,a suggestive palma notice is analogous to a tentative ruling,in that it sets forth the appellate court preliminary conclusions with respect to the merits of the writ that,similar to those reflected in a tentative ruling,are not binding upon either the trial court or the appellate court.
it appears,however,that upon receiving a suggestive palma notice from an appellate court,a trial court often will quickly vacate,modify,or otherwise reconsider the challenged ruling in order to conform its action to the views expressed in the before the party adversely affected has filed or has had an opportunity to file any opposing papers in response to the palma notice.when the trial court takes such action,the court of appeal will dismiss the writ petition.
we conclude that if a trial court decides on its own motion to revisit its interim ruling in response to a suggestive palma action within its inherent authority see le francois.goel cal th,le francois that court must inform the parties of its intent to do so,and provide them with an opportunity to be heard.see id.at.requiring adherence to this procedure is consistent with our relevant case law,and reasonably balances the interests of conservation of scarce judicial resources with the parties right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.
the writ proceeding in the case now before us arises from an action for declaratory relief brought by great american insurance company gaic against its insured,brown,winfield canzoneri,brown,to resolve an insurance coverage dispute.initially,the trial court stayed the declaratory relief action,pending resolution of litigation involving claims for which brown sought coverage,but in july,while the underlying litigation still was pending,that court lifted the stay in the declaratory relief action and set a trial date.
on august,in response to the foregoing action taken by the trial court,brown filed with the court of appeal,second appellate district,a petition for writ of mandate,prohibition,or other appropriate relief,requesting an immediate stay of all declaratory relief proceedings,and further requesting an order requiring the trial court to vacate the trial date and stay all proceedings until after conclusion of the underlying litigation.on august,the court of appeal issued an order comprising the suggestive palma notice at issue in the present proceedings.
at the outset,the suggestive palma notice stated that it appears the trial court erred in lifting the stay of the declaratory relief action prior to the determination of the underlying action.the notice then discussed both the factual and the legal merits of the writ petition,concluding that brown entitlement to relief is so obvious that no purpose could reasonably be served by plenary consideration of the issue citations.based upon this conclusion,and citing palma,supra,cal d,the challenged notice advised the trial court and the parties of the court of appeal present intention to issue a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance directing the trial court to vacate its july,order and enter an order reinstating the stay pending resolution of the underlying case.the notice then conferred upon the respondent trial court the power and jurisdiction to change and correct its erroneous order,and to enter in its place a new order in accord with the views expressed herein.the notice stated that in the event the trial court were to take the latter action,the writ petition would be dismissed.finally,the notice provided a schedule for briefing to be followed if the trial court fail ed to comply with the directive set forth herein.
on august,one day after the court of appeal filed its palma notice,the trial court issued an order that acknowledged the court of appeal suggestive palma notice,vacated the trial court july,order,and reinstated the stay of the declaratory relief action pending resolution of the underlying case.upon receiving a copy of the trial court order reinstating the stay,the court of appeal dismissed the writ petition.
we thereafter granted gaic petition for review of the appellate court august order,limiting our review to the following issues whether an appellate court properly may issue a suggestive palma notice and,if so,whether,absent exceptional circumstances,such a notice may be issued without the appellate court having received or solicited opposition from the real party in interest 
the california constitution grants the courts original jurisdiction in proceedings seeking extraordinary relief in the form of writs of mandamus,prohibition,and certiorari.cal,art.vi.the code of civil procedure and the california rules of set forth the procedures governing a court exercise of its power and discretion to issue a writ.see generally et rule et.
when a petition is filed seeking a writ commanding the respondent superior court to act in a certain manner,such as by vacating or revising an interim order,an appellate court may summarily deny the petition issue an alternative writ or an order to show cause pursuant to section,or issue a peremptory writ in the first instance,pursuant to section and the procedure set forth in palma,supra,cal d.see lewis superior court cal th,lewis.the scenario that gives rise to the issues in the present case involves the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance.this accelerated procedure dispenses with the issuance of an alternative writ,and with the requirement that the court of appeal afford an opportunity for formal briefing and oral argument before ordering that a peremptory writ issue.see cal.civil writ practice ed,civil writ practice a palma notice informally describes the first step in the streamlined procedure for deciding the merits of a writ petition that avoids the more formal procedures triggered by the issuance of an alternative writ.
in palma,supra,cal d,we considered the circumstances and procedures appropriate to an appellate court issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance.based upon section due notice requirement which was intended to place the respondent and real party in interest on notice,in the absence of an alternative writ,that a peremptory writ might issue palma,supra,cal d at,we held that a peremptory writ of mandate or prohibition may not issue in the first instance unless,at a minimum,the parties adversely affected by the writ have received notice that the issuance of such a writ in the first instance is being sought or considered.palma,supra,cal d at.we further concluded that,absent exceptional circumstances,an appellate court should not issue a peremptory writ in the first instance without having received,or solicited,opposition from the party or parties adversely affected.ibid.finally,we cautioned that a peremptory writ in the first instance should not issue unless it appears that the petition and opposing papers on file adequately address the issues raised by the petition,that no factual dispute exists,and that the additional briefing that would follow issuance of an alternative writ is unnecessary to disposition of the petition.id.at.
this court observed in palma that these procedural notice and requesting informal opposition prior to the issuance of a peremptory a number of important purposes.for example,the notice requirement places the respondent and any real party in interest on notice,in the absence of an alternative writ,that a peremptory writ might issue.palma,supra,cal d at.additionally,b y eliminating the necessity for full scale response where such a response is unnecessary,such a practice helps to reduce the cost of litigation to the parties and by encouraging opposition when the court is about to act affirmatively on a petition,it helps to conserve judicial resources as well.in the case of a peremptory writ in the first instance,such a practice helps also to assure that the respondent,or real party,has had full opportunity to oppose what may turn out to be the final,and to his interests adverse,resolution of a legal issue.id.at.
subsequently,in ng superior court cal th ng,we emphasized that the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance is a procedural rarity,and we cautioned that this exception to the normal writ procedure should not become routine.id.at.generally,the accelerated palma procedure should be adopted only when petitioner entitlement to relief is so obvious that no purpose could reasonably be served by plenary consideration of the example,when such entitlement is conceded or when there has been clear error under principles of law and undisputed when there is an unusual urgency requiring acceleration of the normal process.if there is no compelling temporal urgency,and if the law and facts mandating the relief sought are not entirely clear,the normal writ procedure,including issuance of an alternative writ citation,should be followed.ng,supra,cal th at see,alexander superior court cal th,the court of appeal erred in considering writ application under expedited procedures authorized in section instead of under alternative writ procedure of section,because nothing in the record suggested unusual urgency justifying expedited resolution.
of course,even in the limited circumstances in which issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance is appropriate,such a writ may not issue unless the appellate court first satisfies the strictures outlined in palma,supra,cal d at page.compare kernes superior court th,the appellate division of the superior court erred in ordering issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance when the petition did not expressly notify the respondent that such relief was being sought,the court failed to request opposition from the respondent,and no unusual exigency justified that failure,with payless drug store superior court th,after giving notice that it was considering issuing peremptory writ in first instance,then requesting and receiving informal replies from real parties in interest,appellate court ordered issuance of writ on grounds that exceptional circumstances existed and further proceedings would add nothing to its review,because petitioner entitlement to relief was obvious.
finally,in lewis,supra,cal th,this court recognized that an appellate court may order issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate or prohibition in the first instance without affording the parties an opportunity for oral argument id.at,but we also reaffirmed the importance of the procedural safeguards outlined in palma,noting that the court of appeal generally should afford the respondent real party in interest the opportunity to present written opposition lewis,supra,cal th at.we again emphasized that the accelerated process for issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance is reserved for truly exceptional those in which a compelling temporal urgency requires an immediate decision.denying plenary consideration where the petitioner entitlement to relief is obvious and entirely clear under principles of law and undisputed facts citation,is permitted only in extremely narrow circumstances.application of established law to undisputed facts must leave no room for doubt regarding the proper result.principles of law must be set forth in controlling authority that squarely applies to the circumstances of the case before the court.if the respondent or real party in interest presents any reasonable argument that the applicable law is unsettled or does not govern the precise issue presented in light of the particular undisputed facts,or if the application of legal principles set forth in various sources of law might lead to different results,and there is no compelling need for an expedited decision,the court must follow the usual writ procedure and issue an alternative writ or order to show cause.id.at.
in accordance with palma,supra,cal d,our courts of appeal typically advise the parties in writ proceedings that issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance is under consideration,by filing an order requesting informal opposition to the writ petition by a specified date.see,div.one,internal operating practices,original proceedings.the usual palma notice directed to the parties in the writ proceeding may read,for example the petition for writ of mandate or prohibition filed herein on date,has been read and considered.the parties are notified that the court may issue an order for peremptory writ in the first instance requiring the respondent to grant the relief sought.palma indus.fasteners,c.the real party in interest is requested to file and serve opposition on or before date.civil writ practice,supra.because a peremptory writ may issue without further briefing and without oral argument,the response of the respondent or any real party in interest to the palma notice may provide such a party with its sole opportunity to be heard in the court of appeal on the merits of the writ petition.
the issue presently before us is the propriety of the suggestive type of palma notice.this type of notice clearly complies with the minimum procedural safeguards outlined in palma,supra,cal d,in that it provides notice that the court of appeal is considering ordering the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance,and furnishes an opportunity for the respondent or any real party in interest to oppose issuance of the writ.the problem that occurs,according to gaic and amicus curiae,is that the suggestive palma notice does not stop also discusses the merits of the writ petition,suggests that the trial court erred in the manner claimed by the petitioner,grants power and jurisdiction to the trial court to reconsider the challenged interim order and enter in its place a new order in accordance with the views of the appellate in which event the writ petition will be vacated as moot,and solicits opposition to the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance only if the trial court fails to follow the appellate court suggested course of action.see,civil writ practice,supra.
as brown accurately observes,however,our decisions in palma and subsequent cases do not prescribe any particular form for the notice informing the parties that the court of appeal may issue a peremptory writ in the first instance and providing an opportunity for informal opposition.moreover,these decisions do not prohibit,explicitly or implicitly,an appellate court from addressing the merits of the writ petition in the palma notice,or from explaining the reasons why that court is considering ordering the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance.gaic and amicus curiae respond that,by issuing a suggestive palma notice strongly encouraging the trial court to take action in accordance with the relief requested in the writ petition,the court of appeal in essence has decided the merits of the writ petition and effectively has issued the peremptory writ in the first instance before the real party in interest has had a meaningful opportunity to respond.
we are not persuaded that the issuance of a suggestive palma notice is the effective equivalent of issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance.a peremptory writ of mandate issued by an appellate court and directed at an inferior tribunal is the reviewing court ultimate order commanding the respondent court to grant the relief requested.such a writ issues only after the written decision granting the writ petition and directing that the writ be issued becomes final,both as to the court of appeal and the supreme court.thereafter,the appellate court is authorized to make any orders necessary and proper for the complete enforcement of the writ,and the unexcused neglect or refusal to obey a writ may,upon motion,be the subject of a fine and,in the case of persistent refusal,imprisonment,until the writ is obeyed.
by comparison,even if styled as an order,a suggestive palma notice in no sense commands or obligates the trial court to follow the course of action suggested by the appellate court.rather,in the absence of a peremptory writ,the trial court remains free to stay its course.ng,supra,cal th at superior court erred in acting immediately upon the court of appeal opinion ordering issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance,rather than awaiting issuance of the writ itself,thus necessitating the supreme court emergency action.a suggestive palma notice acknowledges as much,when it sets a briefing schedule for opposition and reply papers in the event the trial court elects not to act in accordance with the notice.
a suggestive palma notice is more analogous to a tentative ruling,such as may be issued by a civil law and motion department of a superior court prior to oral argument on a motion.see,super.riverside county,local rules,rule super.sac.county,local rules,rule super.county,local rules,rule d.tentative rulings indicate the way the judge is prepared to decide the matter based on the information before him or her when the ruling was prepared.weil brown,california practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.such a tentative ruling,however,becomes the final ruling of the trial court only if the court does not order oral argument in its tentative ruling,and notice of intent to appear is not given by one of the parties,or only after the hearing on the motion is conducted,assuming the court does not then render a different ruling.rule see also jespersen th,courts are not bound by their tentative rulings.similarly,a suggestive palma notice indicates the manner in which the court of appeal is prepared to decide the merits of the writ petition,based upon what was before it when the notice was prepared,but such a notice is not binding upon either the trial court or the appellate court.see,foundation for taxpayer consumer rights garamendi th,referring to tentative conclusions expressed in suggestive palma notice garamendi.rather,the conclusions expressed in a suggestive palma notice remain provisional unless and until they are incorporated into a written decision granting the writ petition and directing that a peremptory writ be issued.
issuance of a tentative ruling allows both sides the opportunity to reevaluate their respective positions in light of the preliminary views expressed by the issuing court on the matter,and to either submit to the tentative ruling,thereby negating the need for oral argument,or to focus their arguments at the subsequent hearing.we presume the transparency provided by a suggestive palma notice is similarly useful.knowing in advance the reasoning behind the court of appeal present intention to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance should assist the real party in interest in deciding whether to accede to the requested relief and,in the event that party is not inclined to do so,should assist it in tailoring any future opposition.see,garamendi,supra,th at although plaintiffs disagreed with tentative conclusions expressed in suggestive palma notice,they stipulated to the relief sought by writ petition.
another practical effect of a suggestive palma notice is that it preserves the options available to the appellate court.because that court has issued a palma notice rather than an alternative writ or an order to show cause,the writ proceeding has not become a cause.see palma,supra,cal d at fns.therefore,if the trial court declines to reverse or modify the disputed interim order as suggested in the notice issued by the appellate court,the latter court still may issue a summary denial after receipt of informal opposition.id.at.alternatively,because the appellate court has complied with palma by providing the requisite notice and soliciting opposition,it may order issuance of a peremptory writ without inviting further briefing or holding oral argument.lewis,supra,cal th at.or it may issue an alternative writ,request formal briefing,and hold oral argument before disposing of the petition by way of a written opinion.finally,the suggestive palma notice may relieve the appellate court of the need to exercise any of these options,thus avoiding further expenditure of the court scarce resources.because the notice specifically identifies the error perceived in the trial court interim order and strongly suggests that the trial court act in accordance with the appellate court views,it is more likely that the trial court will so act than had the appellate court simply issued a traditional alternative writ or palma notice 
the suggestive palma notice remains,however,merely a a strongly worded the trial court reconsider the order challenged by the writ petition in light of the circumstance that the court of appeal tentatively has concluded the trial court erred in some respect.see,luckett,supra,th at in response to suggestive palma notice,trial court reconsidered whether plaintiff should post a vexatious litigant bond.in support of its recommendation,an appellate court may,for example,discuss the merits of the writ petition,note that the writ proceeding will become moot if the trial court enters a new order that affords the relief sought in the writ petition,instruct the parties to inform the appellate court if the trial court changes its order,and provide that any stay issued by the appellate court does not preclude the trial court from reconsidering its order in the manner suggested by the appellate court discussion of the merits.the suggestive palma notice may not,however,direct the trial court to change its order,or purport to grant the trial court authority to change its order without first affording the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard in the trial court.for this reason,and to avoid any ensuing confusion,the court of appeal should refrain from describing its suggestive palma notice as a directive,or otherwise suggesting that the trial court must comply with the notice.in addition,the suggestive palma notice should acknowledge the procedural safeguards required in the event the trial court does revisit an interim ruling in response to such a notice,as further discussed below 
gaic alternative even if the suggestive palma notice procedure is proper,such notice should not issue,absent exceptional circumstances,without the appellate court first affording the real party in interest an opportunity to file an not compel a different result.the california rules of court specifically authorize an appellate court to notify the parties that it is considering issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance without requesting preliminary opposition or waiting for a reply.rule a.
we acknowledge,however,that although the circumstances in which a palma notice may issue are rare,the availability of this procedure may place appellate counsel for the real party in interest in a difficult situation.on the one hand,counsel do not wish to waste their clients resources by responding immediately and fully to every writ petition,particularly in light of the circumstance that the overwhelming majority of such petitions are summarily denied.on the other hand,counsel face a risk,albeit a small one,that the appellate court may issue a palma notice and,in response,the trial court may reconsider its ruling,without counsel having vigorously represented their client interests in the appellate court.therefore,although not required,in order to help alleviate this practical dilemma we strongly encourage appellate courts to inform the invite preliminary the event the appellate court anticipates taking any action other than summarily denying the writ petition.
in le francois,supra,cal th,we held that a trial court has inherent power to reconsider an interim ruling on its own motion.id.at.this authority derives from the judiciary fundamental,constitutionally mandated function to resolve specific controversies between parties.id.at.concerns of procedural fairness,however,led us further to conclude that a trial court intending to exercise this power must provide the parties notice that it may do so and a reasonable opportunity to litigate the question.id.at see id.at.
at issue in le francois was a successive motion for summary judgment,which the trial court granted despite the circumstance that the motion was not based upon either new facts or new legal authority,and therefore was not authorized by either section,subdivision f or section we held that,although these provisions limit the circumstances in which a party may seek reconsideration,they do not limit the court ability,on its own motion,to reconsider its prior interim orders so it may correct its own errors.le francois,supra,cal th at.interpreted in this manner,the statutes serve their purpose of limiting the ability of litigants to waste the court resources by repeatedly bringing the same impairing the court ability properly to resolve controversies and ensure the orderly administration of justice.id.at.
we explained in le francois that it is immaterial what may have triggered a trial court insight that its interim order might be erroneous we can not prevent a party from communicating the view to a court that it should reconsider a prior ruling although any such communication should never be ex parte.we agree that it should not matter whether the judge has an unprovoked flash of understanding in the middle of the night citation or acts in response to a party suggestion.if a court believes one of its prior interim orders was erroneous,it should be able to correct that error no matter how it came to acquire that belief.le francois,supra,cal th at see,in re marriage of barthold th,although motion for reconsideration that is unsupported by new legal authority or new evidence violates section,such a motion may inspire the trial court to reconsider its previous decision on its own motion.
finally,in le francois we addressed the procedures to be followed when there is a suggestion,or when there exists a concern,that an interim ruling is erroneous.the court need not rule on any suggestion that it should reconsider a previous ruling and,without more,another party would not be expected to respond to such a suggestion.le francois,supra,cal th at.but,t o be fair to the parties,if the court is seriously concerned that one of its prior interim rulings might have been erroneous,and thus that it might want to reconsider that ruling on its own we think will happen rather should inform the parties of this concern,solicit briefing,and hold a hearing.citations.then,and only then,would a party be expected to respond to another party suggestion that the court should reconsider a previous ruling.this procedure provides a reasonable balance between the conflicting goals of limiting repetitive litigation and permitting a court to correct its own erroneous interim orders.id.at,italics added see,montegani johnson th,after trial court determined it should reconsider an interim order in light of intervening case law,it informed the parties of its concern,requested briefing,and held a hearing nickolas superior court th,juvenile court had statutory and constitutional authority to modify its prior disposition order,on its own motion,after giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard.
similar concerns of fairness lead us to conclude that the procedural protections outlined in le francois,supra,cal th,should apply when a trial court,in response to a suggestive palma notice,decides to revisit an interim ruling.it is,of course,understandable that the receipt of a suggestive palma notice,which typically explains in some detail the factual and legal basis for the appellate court present intention to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance,may prompt the trial court to reconsider the challenged interim ruling.after all,as we consistently have emphasized,the accelerated palma procedure should be adopted only when petitioner entitlement to relief is so obvious for example,when such entitlement is conceded or there has been clear error under principles of law and undisputed facts.ng,supra,cal th at.in view of the nonbinding nature of a suggestive palma notice,however,a trial court that is inspired to act in response to such a notice necessarily acts on its own motion.we therefore conclude that before vacating,modifying,or otherwise reconsidering an interim ruling in response to a suggestive palma notice,the trial court must inform the parties that it is considering taking such action and provide them with an opportunity to be heard.this procedure reasonably balances the interest in conserving scarce judicial resources with the parties right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.it also should assist in forestalling any errors by the trial court resulting from the appellate court issuance of a suggestive palma notice that is based upon an incomplete or inaccurate writ petition to which there has been no response,and further assist in avoiding subsequent writ or appellate proceedings that might be brought to challenge such errors 
in light of the foregoing conclusions we reach,the court of appeal did not err in issuing its august,order comprising the suggestive palma notice here at issue.as noted,subsequent settlement of the litigation underlying brown writ petition has rendered moot the relief sought in that petition.we therefore affirm the court of appeal judgment dismissing the writ proceeding.
concurring and dissenting opinion by werdegar,
the questions we face are whether suggestive or coercive palma are permissible,given the strictures of code of civil procedure section and the california rules of court,and whether,even if so,we should countenance them in the exercise of our supervisory powers over the courts of this state.the answer to the first of these questions is probably not the answer to the second,i submit,is an unqualified no.accordingly,on the merits of this appeal,i respectfully dissent 
my colleagues and i agree on many points.for one,we agree it is critical in writ proceedings for parties to have notice and the opportunity to submit briefing to the decision maker before adverse action is taken.see,ante,at.for another,we agree that conservation of judicial the extent it can be accomplished without compromising the interests of litigants in fair an admirable and worthy goal.what we disagree over is the extent to which suggestive palma notices,even as modified by the additional trial court proceedings the majority proposes,ante,at,satisfy these goals.
in palma,we interpreted code of civil procedure section requirement that due notice be provided before a peremptory writ could issue.we identified both notice and an opportunity to be heard as essential prerequisites a peremptory writ of mandate or prohibition may not issue in the first instance unless the parties adversely affected by the writ have received notice,from the petitioner or from the court,that the issuance of such a writ in the first instance is being sought or considered.in addition,an appellate court,absent exceptional circumstances,should not issue a peremptory writ in the first instance without having received,or solicited,opposition from the party or parties adversely affected.palma,supra,cal d at.a traditional palma notice satisfies these requirements the party opposing the writ receives notice and is given time to file opposition in the court of appeal before that court decides the merits of the writ.here in contrast,where the court of appeal issued a suggestive palma notice instead,the proceedings below violated palma requirements.
this case arises from an insurance coverage dispute.law firm brown,winfield canzoneri,brown winfield,was sued for malpractice by azusa pacific university based on the firm handling of an eminent domain action.brown winfield sought coverage from its malpractice carrier,great american insurance company great american great american accepted defense of the action with a reservation of rights,but also filed a declaratory relief action asserting there was no coverage.brown winfield obtained a stay of the declaratory relief action pending decision of the underlying malpractice case,but in the trial court lifted the stay.
on brown winfield petition for writ relief,the court of appeal issued the suggestive palma notice at issue here.the notice discussed the merits at length and strongly suggested the trial court had erred in lifting the stay.having done so,the court of appeal gave the trial court jurisdiction to change its mind and enter a revised order.the trial court did so the next day and the court of appeal dismissed the petition two weeks later,all without any briefing or opportunity by great american to be heard.
while great american technically was provided notice,one may question how meaningful the notice was in light of the fact it was issued after the close of business on august,and elicited a reversal from the trial court less than hours later more clearly,the proceedings below violated the requirement that an opportunity to present opposition be provided parties opposing issuance of a writ before the matter is adjudicated.palma,supra,cal d at code civ.were great american counsel superman himself,he could not have prepared an opposition brief and filed it in time for the court of appeal to read it,rethink its position,issue a new order reversing itself,and have the trial court receive and consider that new order before reversing itself.
this case illustrates how a suggestive palma notice subverts the orderly process we intended before a peremptory writ could issue.by issuing a suggestive notice,the court of decision maker on the an opinion on the merits without having ever heard from the opposing side.that this decision can be deemed tentative,ante,at does not redeem the process.when a court issues a tentative decision,the party who stands to lose generally has a chance to argue its side to that court in hopes of persuading it to reconsider and reach a different decision.a suggestive palma notice denies writ opponents this opportunity because it effectively sends the case back to the trial court immediately,thus permitting or,as in this case,encouraging the issue to be resolved in the trial court without further proceedings in the court of appeal.here,of course,the problem was amplified by the trial court speedy response,which meant that great american was unable to tell its side to either court.
while it is true we acknowledged in palma that it might suffice for a court of appeal to merely solicit informal opposition from the potentially adversely affected party palma,supra,cal d at,we did so in contemplation of a situation where that party,afforded a reasonable time in which to submit briefing,voluntarily elected to forgo its opportunity to put forward the merits of its position.we did not contemplate a situation where,as here,the adversely affected party was provided no meaningful opportunity to explain why a peremptory writ should not issue nor does it matter that no writ was actually issued because the trial court,attuned to the clear import of the court of appeal notice,did as directed and reversed itself.see,ante,at.the sine qua non of a peremptory writ under palma,meaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard,was lacking here.the majority unsupported contention to the contrary,ante,at is disingenuous and simply wrong 
moreover,the proceedings here also failed to comport with the california rules of court,which provide if the court notifies the parties that it is considering issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance,the respondent or any real party in interest may serve and file an opposition.cal.rules of court,rule b.while may is permissive rather than mandatory,the most credible reading of this provision is that an adversely affected party has a right,but may choose not to exercise that right,to oppose issuance of a peremptory writ.suggestive palma notices like the one issued here can not be reconciled with that right 
as a practical matter,the majority proposal to permit suggestive palma notices,provided the trial court solicits briefing before acquiescing in the court of appeal views on an issue,does not in my view cure these failings.what code of civil procedure section,palma,supra,cal d,and rule b of the california rules of court all focus on is the importance of a meaningful opportunity to be heard by the decision maker,the entity with the ultimate authority on a question.in suggestive palma notice situations,the court of appeal,not the supposedly mistaken trial court,is the true decision maker.consequently,the opportunity to be heard in the trial court may prove illusory.rare,i believe,is a trial court that would adhere to its initial ruling in the face of a court of appeal written assessment that it was patently wrong.critically,if the position advanced in the suggestive palma notice is flawed because of something the court of appeal overlooked,the trial court,unaware of this oversight from the text of the notice itself,may be reluctant to rely on such an overlooked ground as dispositive presented with a meritorious but overlooked argument,the trial court is likely to reverse itself anyway.i can not see from a fairness perspective,or a perception of fairness litigants the sense they have been heard and had their day in this is superior to having courts of appeal wait a few extra days for opposition briefing 
the urge to look past the requirements of palma and the california rules of court might be at least understandable,if still unjustified,were there some significant administrative benefit to the suggestive palma procedure in either its original form or as modified by the majority.there is not.
that suggestive palma notices have saved courts of appeal a small amount of time,albeit at the likely cost of having some litigants feel they were deprived of a fair hearing,may be true.but court of appeal economy is not the same as judicial economy,and the transfer of decisionmaking from one court level to another is not necessarily a resource saver in the aggregate.we must consider the costs to the court system as a whole,at the trial as well as at the appellate level.that the trial court proceedings the majority now proposes involve any increased judicial efficiency over the usual palma procedure is not apparent 
from an efficiency perspective,moreover,a more pernicious unintended consequence of today decision for both courts and litigants is likely.as amicus curiae the california academy of appellate lawyers ably explained in its briefing and at oral argument,attorneys advising their clients how or whether to oppose a writ petition must take into ac
