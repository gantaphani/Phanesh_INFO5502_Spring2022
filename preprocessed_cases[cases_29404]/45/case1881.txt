at the heart of this insurance coverage dispute lie two properties,identified as contaminated by the state of washington,that were sold in their polluted state rather than remediated.after the sale,appellant robert goodstein,as receiver,tendered a million claim to appellee industrial indemnity industrial under a comprehensive general liability cgl policy,reflecting the difference between the appraised value of the sites if uncontaminated less the sales price of the sites in their contaminated states.industrial refused to pay,and goodstein consequently brought this lawsuit seeking a declaration that industrial owed a duty to indemnify and defend goodstein under the policy and damages for breach of both duties.the district court granted summary judgment for industrial on all claims,and goodstein timely appealed.
we affirm the district court holding that goodstein claim for the diminution in the sale value of the properties due to pollution was not covered under industrial policy,but reverse the district court conclusion that industrial is as a matter of law not liable for breaching its duty to defend goodstein.
a.the properties 
members of the sternoff family jointly owned,through partnerships,two industrial properties in washington collectively,the properties one on marginal way in seattle the marginal property and the other in renton the renton property.at the marginal property,the sternoffs operated for years a scrap metal salvage yard that caused ground pollution.at the renton site,the sternoffs recycled scrap metal and electrical equipment for approximately years,resulting in hazardous waste byproducts containing high concentrations of soluble lead.the properties were identified by the washington state department of ecology doe as environmentally contaminated in the late and early and were listed as hazardous sites under the model toxics control act of washington 
starting in the,the sternoff partners had a series of disagreements among themselves that resulted in litigation.on march,the king county superior court dissolved the partnerships and appointed robert goodstein as receiver to wind them up.the court indicated that goodstein may proceed with remediation of contaminated properties as necessary but may also consider sale without remediation.
recognizing the sternoffs liability for remediating the polluted properties under state and federal law goodstein presented two options to the receivership court sell the properties as is,with a discounted sales price accounting for the pollution,or remediate the pollution and then sell the properties.the court approved of a plan to sell the two properties as is.
in and,respectively,the receiver sold the renton and marginal properties.the marginal property sold for and the renton property for.the sales agreements for both properties disclosed that the lands were polluted and required the purchasers to take over responsibility for any cleanup the the practicalities of the real estate in the future demand.the agreements did not,however,commit the purchasers to remediate the properties on their own.both agreements also provided that n o amendment,change or modification of the agreements shall be valid,unless in writing and signed by the parties hereto.
b.the insurance policies 
industrial issued primary and excess insurance policies to the sternoffs between and.in relevant part,the policies provide industrial will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage under the policies,industrial also assumed the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such property damage,even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false or fraudulent,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient the policies do not define damages,claim,or suit.occurrence is defined to mean an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.
in a provision entitled insured duties in the event of occurrence,claim or suit,the policies required the sternoffs to provide written notice of an occurrence to industrial as soon as practicable,and,in the event a claim or suit is asserted against the sternoffs,to immediately forward to industrial all demand,notice,summons or other process received by the sternoffs.in the same provision,the sternoffs agreed not to voluntarily make any payment,assume any obligation or incur any expense related to any such claim.
communication between the receiver and industrial 
communication 
on september,goodstein wrote to industrial,indicating that the washington doe had identified the marginal and renton sites as contaminated and stating that goodstein had initiated a study to assess the damage and cost of cleaning up the land.the letter also stated we write to notify you that sternoff may make a claim for cleanup and related costs under the insurance policies you issued in favor of sternoff.emphasis added.copies of the relevant policies were requested,and in closing,the letter stated,after we have had an opportunity to review the policies,we may make a more formal claim for coverage of the cleanup costs.emphasis added.
internal documents indicate that industrial understood the september,letter to be asserting a claim for the cleanup and other related costs.industrial wrote a letter to goodstein on october,acknowled ing receipt of the captioned claim,and indicating that it was attempting to find the sternoffs policies,as requested.
in a reply letter dated october,goodstein acknowledged receipt of industrial october,letter,but stated please note,however,in case there is any confusion,we are not presently making any claims under th e se policies.at present,we are simply asking to obtain copies of any policies,applications,relating to insurance provided by industrial indemnity to sternoff.emphasis added.
industrial heard nothing more about the sternoff policies thereafter,and in december closed the file for lack of activity.before the file was closed,a summary of what was known regarding a possible claim,and a list of possible defenses,was prepared.the summary document indicated that no coverage position letter had been issued because no claim had been filed.
communication 
on september,eight years after goodstein told industrial that he was not presently making any claims under the sternoff policies,goodstein sent a letter to industrial indicating that the renton and marginal properties had been sold.goodstein stated 
previous correspondence on my behalf had notified industrial indemnity,as an insurer of sternoff,of potential claims arising out of the environmental contamination of properties owned operated by sternoff.the extent of the contamination has now been more fully investigated,and the properties have now been sold.i am,therefore,now in a position to fully present and settle the environmental claims related to those properties.
in that letter,goodstein also stated 
i hereby demand payment of for the loss on the marginal way property,and million for the loss on the renton properties.these amounts are calculated based on the appraised value of the sites if uncontaminated less the sales price of the sites in their contaminated condition.
industrial responded a month later with a letter disclaiming any coverage for the losses claimed by goodstein on behalf of the sternoffs.
procedural history 
four years later,in,goodstein filed this lawsuit.the second amended operative pleading for the purposes of this,in relevant part,a declaratory judgment that industrial owed a duty to defend and to indemnify goodstein under the cgl policies and asserted a claim for breach of contract based on industrial failure to fulfill those duties.
industrial thereafter moved for summary judgment on the grounds that goodstein claimed losses due to the allegedly reduced proceeds from the property sales were not covered by the policies and that goodstein had never invoked the duty to defend.
in opposing the summary judgment motion,goodstein offered evidence that he and the purchaser of the renton property,zelman renton llc zelman,had entered into an oral agreement to ensure that all rights to insurance coverage for environmental damage at the renton site are consolidated and assigned to the receiver.specifically,the declaration stated that the receiver and zelman have agreed that all rights the receiver had to insurance coverage for environmental contamination will be transferred to zelman and zelman will transfer all rights it has to insurance coverage back to the receiver.the declaration attesting to the indicated that t he agreement has not yet been finalized.no such agreement evidencing the transfer and was submitted in support of goodstein opposition to summary judgment.
the district court granted industrial summary judgment motion on july,finding that industrial had neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify goodstein under the policies.in rendering its decision,the court did not consider the evidence purporting to establish a.
goodstein thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration,this time supported by a new declaration that stated that all the material terms of the agreement had been negotiated by,agreed to,and known to the parties as of january.a written agreement was also submitted as evidence.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration on august,holding that goodstein failed to comply with the local rules governing such motions.
goodstein timely filed the instant appeal.on appeal,goodstein challenges the district court failure to consider the evidence at the summary judgment and reconsideration stages,as well as the district court grant of summary judgment for industrial on goodstein duty to indemnify and duty to defend claims 
before proceeding to evaluate the merits of the district court summary judgment order,we first address whether the court erred in refusing to consider goodstein evidence submitted in opposition to the summary judgment motion,and denying goodstein motion for reconsideration predicated on additional evidence of the.
goodstein asserts that it offered evidence that zelman,who purchased the renton property,entered into an agreement with goodstein in principle to rights to insurance coverage,such that all of the rights goodstein had were transferred to zelman and all of the rights that zelman had were then transferred back to goodstein.in so doing,goodstein argues,the agreement created an indisputable damages claim,since zelman paid the costs to remediate the renton property.because we hold that the district court properly declined to consider the evidence at summary judgment and properly refused to reconsider that decision,we do not address the possible impact of the alleged on goodstein substantive claims.
evidence at summary judgment stage 
the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to consider the evidence submitted at the summary judgment stage see orr bank of,nt sa,cir reviewing trial court refusal to consider inadmissible evidence at summary judgment under abuse of discretion standard.goodstein argues that he had reached an oral agreement concerning the assignments,and that the declaration properly served as evidence of its existence.he asserts that testimony of an agreement is adequate to prove its existence,and that oral agreements are enforceable if they set forth all material terms of the agreement and provide that the parties will later memorialize the agreement.
the evidence goodstein submitted in opposition to summary judgment,however,indicates that no definitive agreement had actually been reached the receiver has reached an agreement in principle with zelman the agreement has not yet been finalized.emphasis added.so,contrary to goodstein assertion,the declaration did not state that the parties had already agreed to the final terms but would memorialize them later.restatement second of contracts.moreover,the sales agreement executed by zelman and goodstein,which the purported to modify,made clear that only written,signed agreements could supersede or amend the original sales agreement.
given these circumstances,the evidence submitted in opposition to summary judgment is insufficient to prove the existence of an enforceable contract under washington law for an agreement to be enforceable,the terms assented to must be sufficiently definite,and the contract must be supported by consideration.keystone land dev.xerox,citation omitted.moreover,testimony attesting to the existence of an oral contract must describe the essential terms of the agreement.see hansen transworld wireless.the declaration submitted by goodstein discloses no pertinent details of the purported,including what consideration supported the parties agreement because the purported agreement was admittedly not final,not in writing,despite the requirement in the original contract,and the evidence failed to sufficiently detail its terms,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider the evidence.
evidence at reconsideration stage 
the district court also properly declined to reverse its summary judgment ruling on the basis of evidence submitted in support of goodstein motion for reconsideration.we review a district court denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion.software,madacy,cir.
the district court refused to reconsider the issue because goodstein failed to meet the standard for such motions laid out in the local rules.the western district of washington local rules provide that motions for reconsideration are disfavored,and will be granted only upon,in pertinent part,a showing of new facts which could not have been brought to the court attention earlier with reasonable diligence.local h.
goodstein new evidence indicated that,w hile the agreement was not memorialized to sic writing by the time the original declaration in opposition to summary judgment was submitted,all the material terms had been negotiated by,agreed to,and known to the parties as of january.yet,the declaration submitted in january in opposition to summary judgment did not recite the terms contained in the written document dated more than seven months later and submitted in support of reconsideration.because those terms were,according to goodstein,fully settled at the time the opposition to summary judgment was filed in january,the july submission on reconsideration fails of its own weight according to that submission,the precise terms of the agreement could have been brought to the district court attention in january,as they were negotiated,agreed to,and known to the parties by then.goodstein motion for reconsideration therefore did not meet the burden imposed by the local rules.local h see also shalit coppe,cir r econsideration is appropriate only in very limited circumstances,and the overwhelming weight of authority is that the failure to file documents in an original motion or opposition does not turn the late filed documents into newly discovered evidence.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence at summary judgment and in denying goodstein motion for reconsideration.we therefore need not consider the possible impact of the alleged of rights on goodstein substantive claims for coverage under industrial cgl policy.we turn to those claims next.
goodstein challenges the district court conclusion that industrial had no duty to indemnify the receiver for the difference between the sale price received for the polluted properties and the fair market value of the land had it been cleaned up prior to sale.we agree that the policy does not provide for such indemnity.we can not,however,adopt the rationale asserted by the district court,as industrial urges.
in finding that industrial had no indemnification duty under the policy,the district court first emphasized that washington adheres to a strict distinction between third and first party insurance.see,at.given the fact that industrial policy was designed to protect third party harm,the district court reasoned,the policy provision obligating industrial to pay on behalf of the insured,rather than to the insured must be read literally,to provide only for indemnify ing the insured for someone else loss,not for the insured own loss,and thus to preclude coverage for the decreased sale price.
the washington supreme court,however,has demonstrated a marked willingness to take a view of policy language in the context of insurance coverage for environmental cleanup claims sufficiently expansive to preclude such literalism.for example,in boeing aetna casualty surety,which concerned a cgl policy identical to the one at issue here,the washington supreme court interpreted the policy to provide coverage beyond the literal scope of the policy language.the specific question certified to the court in boeing concerned whether environmental cleanup costs incurred by an insured constituted damages under a cgl policy.id.at.in concluding that such costs are within the scope of cgl coverage,the court necessarily rejected the notion that the policy covers only sums paid to the third party damaged by the insured actions.in other words,boeing held remediation costs covered under a liability policy even though the insurer was to pay the insured for costs incurred,rather than paying the party to whom the insured was actually liable for the property,the epa the washington doe.yet,the literal language of the policy,as interpreted by the district court in this case,would appear to prohibit such coverage.thus,goodstein claim can not fail simply because it is not a request for a payment made to a harmed third party.
so recognizing,goodstein argues that the claim for the diminution in value of the land due to the pollution should be covered because it is a functional approximation of the cost to remediate the properties,which industrial would be liable to pay under boeing and weyerhaeuser aetna casualty surety,in support of this argument,goodstein urges us not to confuse form and substance washington courts have taken a more pragmatic approach and have refused to allow a forfeiture of coverage based on an insurer superficial objections to the form that a claim takes,especially where the substance of the claim is identical to what the insurance covers,citing boeing.
but the instant land sale contracts do not amount to the functional equivalent of the claims in boeing and weyerhaeuser in one crucial respect neither contract required the buyer actually to remediate the pollution as a condition of sale.because of that omission,this case is fundamentally different from the situation presented in both boeing and weyerhaeuser.
the rationale for finding coverage in those two cases is that the third party injured by the insured bad act is made whole through the insurer payments for cleanup costs.the plaintiffs in boeing and weyerhaeuser actually cleaned up the polluted land,thus remedying the harm to the public caused by the contamination.the covered damages were incurred as part of that effort.as the court in boeing explained,the cgl policies cover as damages an insured obligation to pay environmental response costs because the substance of the claim for response costs in the present case concerns compensation for restoration of contaminated water and real property.at emphasis added.
in this case,however,goodstein would have industrial compensate him when he has not taken any action to by procuring clean up services himself or by requiring the buyer of the contaminated land to do the harm caused by the sternoffs polluting activities has been or will be remedied.indeed,the record indicates that while one of the properties was cleaned up by the purchaser,the other remains polluted almost ten years after the sale and over fifteen years after the government first identified the land as containing hazardous waste.
this holding does not elevate form over substance,as goodstein suggests.rather,it draws a line consistent with washington expressed preference for encouraging prompt,voluntary remediation of pollution in the insurance coverage context.
the washington supreme court articulated such a concern in weyerhaeuser.weyerhaeuser acknowledged that special considerations inform coverage disputes in the environmental claims context,because environmental statutes impose strict liability on polluters in order to safeguard society in general.at.the court then cited the concerns expressed by commentators and the doe that precluding coverage of voluntary clean up costs under cgl policies would create a disincentive to engage in independent cleanups,and that,as a result,the environment will suffer severe harm if owners have to postpone a cleanup until a clear third party claim prompts a lawsuit.id.at.weyerhaeuser discussion of these potential harms demonstrates a concern with encouraging prompt remediation of the harm caused to the public by pollution with a minimum of transaction costs to the government.
echoing the washington supreme court is the insurance commissioner,who articulated the state basic position on environmental claims by declaring 
it is in the public interest to reduce the costs incurred in connection with environmental claims and to expedite the resolution of such claims.the state of washington has a substantial public interest in the timely,efficient,and appropriate resolution of environmental claims involving the liability of insureds at polluted sites in this state.this interest is based on practices favoring good faith and fair dealing in insurance matters and on the state broader health and safety interest in a clean environment.

in this case,goodstein presumably did receive a significantly reduced price for the sale of the properties due to their pollution.we believe,however,that washington courts would not find that loss covered under industrial policy,as goodstein failed to ensure that the polluted properties would be cleaned up promptly.again,the purchase agreements contained no cleanup condition.in economic terms,it is probable that the reduced purchase price represented a calculation premised on the probable cost of remediation as discounted by a factor representing the probability that the costs would actually be incurred and,if so,how far in the future.the reduction in price for the cleanup costs was thus almost surely not equivalent in amount to the present cost of prompt cleanup.and the purchaser retained the right,and had an incentive,to contest any specific cleanup requirements,as well as to delay incurring cleanup costs as long as possible.
furthermore,the language of the policy supports our conclusion that goodstein claim for diminution in value can not be covered under industrial policy.first,diminution in value does not alone constitute property damage where the policy language requires physical injury to tangible property.in guelich american protection ins,the issue was whether a homeowner umbrella liability insurer had a duty to defend him in a view obstruction suit.the court held that diminution in property value resulting from an obstructed view does not constitute a physical injury to tangible property that would give rise to the duty to defend,because such diminution is not itself a physical injury,and a view is not tangible property id.at.thus,it appears that under washington law,diminution in property value would not be covered as property damage under the physical injury language of the industrial general liability policy.see also new hampshire ins.vieira,cir w e are persuaded that diminution in value is not physical damage to tangible property under california law ins.carl brazell builders,most courts hold the diminished value of tangible property does not constitute property damage within the meaning of cgl policies which define property damage as physical injury.
nor can diminution in value fall within the realm of damages that the insured shall become legally obligated to pay because of property damage.while washington courts have interpreted such damages to include response costs incurred by insureds in cooperation with an environmental agency,see weyerhaeuser,at boeing,at,they have never extended such interpretation to include diminution in property value as a surrogate for response costs never incurred.here,there is no indication that the sternoffs or goodstein incurred any expenses or compensated an environmental agency for its response costs indeed,they were not required to expend any money block golden eagle ins,th,d holding that diminution in property value does not constitute damages under a liability policy.furthermore,goodstein did not constructively expend any money for remediation,because the sale was not conditioned on remediation that the buyer would perform with the money saved from the reduced purchase price 
accordingly,we affirm the district court holding that industrial had no obligation to indemnify goodstein for the loss associated with the sale of the polluted properties under the policy 
goodstein also challenges the district court grant of summary judgment for industrial on the duty to defend claim.
duty to defend duty to indemnify 
the district court held that industrial had no duty to defend goodstein because the policy clearly did not cover his claim for diminution in value damages.while it is true that the duty to defend does not arise for claims which are clearly not covered by the policy,an insurer has a duty to defend whenever the insurance policy conceivably covers the allegations.woo fireman fund ins,en banc quoting kirk airy ins,en banc emphasis added.according to goodstein,the doe allegations of contamination created a duty to defend,because claims for environmental remediation are potentially covered under the industrial policy.
as an initial matter,we note that whether doe actions in declaring the sternoff properties polluted constituted a suit within the meaning of the policy is an open issue under washington law.the washington supreme court has repeatedly declined to resolve the issue.see,at observing that c ase law from around the country is split on what constitutes a suit for purposes of the duty to defend in environmental cleanup cases and declining to resolve the issue weyerhaeuser,at same.but industrial has not argued in this court that the government conduct related to the polluted properties did not constitute a suit,so we do not endeavor to resolve the issue.instead,we assume that the doe designation of the property was a suit.
so assuming,the issue is whether industrial would have been potentially liable for response costs under the policy.because washington courts agree that environmental response costs can constitute covered damages under cgl policies,see boeing,at,we are satisfied that the doe action implicated industrial duty to defend.
that goodstein ultimately did not pay any response costs is irrelevant to whether a duty to defend existed while such response costs were potentially payable,because u nder washington law,the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify are separate obligations,dewitt constr.charter oak fire ins,cir,and should be examined independently,weyerhaeuser,at.however,once goodstein sold the properties without performing any remediation,he converted the response costs,which may have been covered under the policy,into an economic loss that clearly fell outside the scope of coverage.hence,while the duty to defend began at the time of the doe action,it terminated upon the sale of the properties.see overton consol.ins,an insurer duty to defend is a continuing one,and does not end until the underlying action is resolved or it is shown that there is no potential for coverage.emphasis added.we therefore analyze the duty to defend solely with respect to the time period from the doe action up to the sale of the properties.
invocation of the duty to defend 
industrial argues that we need not further concern ourselves with whether the duty to defend was breached,because goodstein claim that it was comes much too late.given that the duty to defend can be breached without implicating the duty to indemnify,our analysis of the timing issue begins with when,if at all,goodstein invoked the duty to defend in the first instance.
goodstein asserts that he invoked the duty via the september,letter,which he claims gave industrial notice of the fact that the doe had declared the properties polluted a review of the full record before us,however,makes clear that this position is untenable.
washington courts have rejected the notion that a tender of defense is sufficient if the insured puts the insurer on notice of the claim.unigard ins.leven.a n insurer can not be expected to anticipate when or if an insured will make a claim for coverage the insured must affirmatively inform the insurer that its participation is desired.see also griffin allstate ins,time oil cigna prop.cas.ins.goodstein october,letter went to great pains to inform industrial that no claim had been made please note,however,in case there is any confusion,we are not presently making any claims under the policies.emphasis added.far from informing industrial that its participation was desired in any investigation,negotiation or defense regarding the extent of goodstein liability for the pollution,see griffin,at,goodstein specifically disclaimed any intent to invoke coverage under the policies.goodstein can not now claim industrial duty to defend arose as a result of that early correspondence.
failure to invoke the duty 
industrial position is just as unpersuasive.industrial asserts,as it also did in the district court,that it could not have breached the duty to defend because goodstein never invoked that duty.accordingly,industrial argues,because the duty to defend never arose in the first place,washington late notice rule under which an insurer must prove that the insured delay in tendering the defense claim caused the insurer actual and substantial prejudice to avoid liability for defense costs,does not apply see mutual of enumclaw ins.usf ins,see also pub.util.dist.int l ins,griffin,at.
industrial argument is creative,but it can not fly.as an initial matter,industrial cites no case law supporting the notion that there is a meaningful distinction between a late invocation of the duty to defend and a failure ever to invoke that duty that is probably because,as a matter of both washington law and of simple logic,it makes no sense to say that a duty to defend was never invoked when,as here,the insured has sued the insurer for a breach of the duty to defend.the filing of the lawsuit itself constitutes a request for payment of defense costs under the policy and at that point,the late notice rule applies.
the logic of a recent washington court of appeals case illustrates the point by analogy.in mutual of enumclaw,the insured was sued for construction defects.the insured tendered indemnification and defense claims to two insurance companies collectively enumclaw,but specifically decided not to tender the claims to a third usf.id.at.enumclaw then settled the lawsuit.id.at.as part of the settlement,the insured assigned its rights under all other policies to enumclaw.id.
enumclaw later discovered the usf policy and sued usf for contribution.id.the trial court granted summary judgment for usf,holding that usf was excused from its duty to perform under its policy or to contribute to a settlement procured by a coinsurer,because the insured had affirmatively chosen not to tender the claim to usf.id.the washington court of appeals reversed,holding that enumclaw,standing in the shoes of the insurer,could invoke the late tender rule through the instant lawsuit.id.at.consequently,the court held,usf would be liable to contribute unless it could prove actual and substantial prejudice.id.enumclaw logic dictates that even if a claim for defense costs is never made until after the lawsuit is settled,and even if that claim is asserted in the form of a coverage suit rather than by a letter to the insurer demanding a defense or submitting defense costs,the insurance company is still liable for the defense costs absent evidence of substantial prejudice.
accordingly,the fact that goodstein may never have tendered a defense request to industrial before filing this lawsuit does not relieve industrial of its obligation to prove prejudice.
industrial can not establish prejudice as a matter of law on the record before us.the existence of p
