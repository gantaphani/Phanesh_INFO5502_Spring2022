plaintiff alleged that it decided to outsource substantially all of its employee needs with leased employees.it entered into a contract with builders staff corporation bsc whereby bsc agreed to employ persons recommended by p laintiff and furnish those employees to p laintiff the contract required bsc to carry worker compensation insurance for those workers hired at p laintiff recommendation and to provide p laintiff a certificate evidencing such insurance.
a broker obtained a workers compensation and employers liability policy from defendant covering employees of bsc furnished to p laintiff under the bsc agreement based on a certificate of insurance issued by d efendants,p laintiff believe d it was insured for any claims made by leased employees provided by bsc defendant was aware of and approved issuance of the certificate of insurance showing p laintiff as a named insured 
bsc furnished to plaintiff a person named jimmy guardado.because of the loose contractual relationship between bsc and p laintiff,there was a potential issue whether guardado was the employee of p laintiff.plaintiff supervised and directed the activities of guardado and otherwise controlled his duties

discussion 
introduction 
the primary issue presented in this case is whether plaintiff has shown either it alleged facts establishing the guardado action created a potential for coverage under defendant insurance policy or a reasonable possibility exists that it can amend the pleading to assert a potential for coverage.if so,the trial court judgment must be reversed.otherwise,the judgment must be affirmed.quan truck ins.exchange th,d michaelian state comp.ins.fund,supra,th at,d.
plaintiff attached a copy of the policy to its amended complaint.the document,denominated a workers compensation and employers liability insurance policy capitalization omitted,contains two parts.part one provides workers compensation coverage for the benefits required by the workers compensation law for bodily injury by accident or by disease.under it,defendant promised to defend at its expense any claim,proceeding or suit against plaintiff for benefits payable by this insurance.part two applies to bodily injury by accident or disease if it ar os e out of and in the course of the injured employee employment under this part,defendant promised it would defend,at its expense,any claim,proceeding or suit against plaintiff for damages payable by this insurance.however,part two contained an exclusion which declared,t his insurance does not cover.any obligation imposed by a workers compensation,occupational disease,unemployment compensation,or disability benefits law,or any similar law 
in la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d,the supreme court explained the nature of this type of insurance policy.workers compensation policies generally contain two types of coverage the first is workers compensation insurance part in the policy at issue in this case,under which the insurer agrees to pay all workers compensation and other benefits that the employer must legally provide to covered employees who are occupationally injured or disabled.citation.the second,which is optional,is employers liability insurance part in the policy at issue in this case.citation.this insurance protects employers against lawsuits by employees who are injured in the course of employment,but whose injuries are not compensable under the workers compensation laws.citation.this coverage also indemnifies employers against civil suits brought by employees.citation.e mployers liability insurance is traditionally written in conjunction with workers compensation policies,and is intended to serve as a,providing protection to the employer in those situations where the employee has a right to bring a tort action despite the provisions of the workers compensation statute or the employee is not subject to the workers compensation law generally,these two kinds of coverage are mutually exclusive.citation.id.at,d.
although in this appeal,plaintiff focuses solely on defendant obligation to provide a defense under part two of defendant policy,in the trial court it relied on part one.but,as defendant notes,any attempt to rely on part one is doomed to fail.la jolla beach tennis club,held a had no reasonable expectation its workers compensation insurer would provide it with a defense to a former employee civil action filed in the superior court seeking damages for wrongful termination.construing the workers compensation portion to also include the duty to defend any claim asserted by an employee,including civil suits for damages,renders the employer liability section superfluous.we do not believe this result is what the parties reasonably intended or expected.t he policy in this case does not require industrial to defend la jolla in any proceeding.rather,by its express language,the policy requires industrial to defend la jolla in any claim,proceeding or suit for benefits payable by this insurance.citation.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity,supra,cal th at,d.a civil suit for damages is no more a claim for workers compensation benefits than a criminal or disciplinary action is a civil suit for damages.citations.id.at,d.
