background 
venable llp plan 
defendant venable,llp long term disability plan the plan is an employee benefit plan sponsored by the law firm of venable llp venable,of which miles was a partner.principal issued a group long term disability ltd insurance policy to venable to provide ltd coverage to eligible plan participants.the plan is governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.principal is the plan administrator and miles,who was a employee of venable,is a member of the plan.
according to the policy terms,when a plan member submits complete and proper proof of disability,benefits will be payable.venable llp group policy group policy,article.as relevant to this appeal,a member will be considered disabled if,solely and directly because of sickness or injury,the member can not perform the majority of the substantial and material duties of his or her own occupation.group policy,article.the policy defines substantial and material duties as t he essential tasks generally required by employers from those engaged in a particular occupation that can not be modified or omitted,and defines own occupation as t he specialty in the practice of law the member is routinely performing for the policyholder when his or her disability begins.id.at.the policy does not define sickness or injury.
to be eligible for benefits,a claimant must provide w ritten proof that disability exists and has been continuous.id.at.this proof includes the date,nature,and extent of loss.id.principal,as the plan administrator,may request additional information to substantiate loss and reserves the right to determine when these conditions are met.id.
b.the administrative proceedings 
miles applies for benefits 
miles,a commercial real estate attorney,worked as a senior equity partner in the new york office of venable,and was the head of its real estate practice.he stopped working on april,as a result of bilateral tinnitus noises in both ears,intractable ear and head pain,and a feeling of disorientation.he filed his claim for ltd benefits soon thereafter,on may.he was years old at the time he applied for benefits.
on friday,april,the day he stopped working,miles made an appointment for the following monday to see his doctor,internist steven kobren,about the pounding sensation in his ears and head.on april,he went to winthrop hospital emergency room,believing he was having a heart attack or a stroke.the next day miles visited kobren,seeking help for lightheadedness,dizziness,and loss of balance.kobren indicated that miles suffered from vertigo,m ost likely secondary to labyrinthitis,and referred miles to kenneth etra,an ear,nose and throat ent specialist.
etra report indicated that miles difficulties commenced about eight months earlier,when he began to suffer bilateral ear pain with tinnitus and hearing loss in his left ear.then,immediately before he stopped working on april,miles developed significant pain in the ears as well as in the head with a pulsation feeling in his head.etra identified two separate problems one being sinusitis and the second being the sensorineural hearing loss with the tinnitus.id.at.he indicated a diagnosis of s inusitis,sensorineural hearing loss,tinnitus,and headache and placed miles on steroids and antibiotics.etra also referred miles for a neurological evaluation due to his fogginess.that same day,a neurologist,itzhak haimovic,performed a neurological consultation.his review of systems reported as follows significant for tinnitus,vertigo,hearing loss,headaches,lightheadedness,and generalized weakness.he ordered a series of tests,including an electroencephalography eeg and an mri of the brain,and placed miles on a medication for musculoskeletal headaches as well as a muscle relaxant.
on may,miles completed a disability claim form seeking ltd benefits under the plan,alleging that he was unable to work beginning on april.disability claim form claim form.etra filled out the physician portion of the form,listing diagnoses of intractable tinnitus,hearing loss,and headache.expanding on his diagnoses in an attached letter,etra indicated that miles complains of a pounding in his head that is synchronous with his heartbeat,and opined i believe at this time he appears to be with significant tinnitus,hearing loss and intractable head pain.etiology at this point is undetermined.he seems to be very foggy and unable to concentrate and it seems that he will at the present time be unable to carry on his job.
in further support of his claim,miles provided a description of his symptoms and the duties and activities he was unable to perform at work as a result of those symptoms.with respect to the former,he stated as follows 
i have constant pain in my left ear and frequent pain in the right and a generalized painful sensation throughout my head.at times,i would describe the pain in my ears as a pounding sensation.i also have other odd sensations.the left side of my face feels numb and puffy.i feel disoriented with frequent high frequency sound in my ears blocking out everything else.these high frequency sounds occur even as i sleep,waking me and leaving me sleep deprived on many mornings.when i went to the emergency room on april i was afraid i might be having a stroke.since then,my doctors have diagnosed tinnitus and vertigo,and the pain and the sense of disorientation have continued.
see claim form.as for the demands of his employment,miles stated 
my work as a commercial real estate partner has involved several main duties communicating with others including lengthy negotiation sessions in person,by phone,and via computer or blackberry reading and understanding complex documents both paper and electronic drafting and revising dense and often lengthy documents memorizing detailed facts thinking about difficult problems and devising solutions and supervising the work of associates assigned to work with me.all these tasks must be done both quickly and carefully,often under significant time pressure,and sometimes late into the night.
id.he concluded that,b ecause of these problems,especially the pain,i am not able to read for any length of time and can not concentrate adequately to address the complicated issues typical for my work day.the last day i tried to work was friday,april,but the pain and disorientation made it impossible for me to do my work at all.id.
principal initial investigation 
principal claim examiner conducted a lengthy telephone interview of miles on august.minutes into the interview miles lost his concentration and asked for a minute break to lie down.when the interview resumed,he explained the nature and demands of his employment as a real estate lawyer.the claim examiner notes state,in relevant part,as follows 
on thursday april,as miles was driving,he began to feel disorientated as evening wore on,he began to have something like pounding sensation in ears and head did not pass with time and even when went to bed it was still persisting,but felt if he got thru day it would begin to wear off.went to work on friday,april,but whole day nothing changed and he called the doctors sic office made an appointment to see kobren on.
on sunday april,miles went to er as the pounding sensation in ears and head was more rapid on april,miles s aw etra told him overview of symptoms and beyond pain he had constant ringing in ears,high pitched sound continues to have severe pain in left ear and hearing loss,pain in head,creates a lack of concentration 
restrictions constant tinnitus,pain in ears,disorientation daily and constant his work involved very intense negotiations and all forms whether in person or phone,he would get novel documents to review and comment on prior to multi million dollar transactions and billions of dollars of real estate loans.long hours,and it really takes a lot of concentration and a lot of focus ability to concentrate and focus for long periods of time is not something he can perform.
there was no indication in the record that miles stopped working at venable for any reason other than the symptoms.nevertheless,three weeks after the telephone interview of miles,the claims examiner called venable benefits coordinator and explained that it need ed to know what actually happened at the time ralph stopped working.specifically,principal a sked the benefits coordinator if she can confirm if termination was due to a medical condition,or other reasons.the benefits coordinator,who worked in the washington,office of venable,not in new york,reportedly answered that she thinks it was other reasons,but will need to make some additional phone calls.the record indicates that principal left two voicemail messages with the benefits coordinator,neither of which was returned.
miles offer to be examined 
october,marked the end of the day elimination period under the policy,and miles attorney contended that miles was entitled to benefits beginning one month after that date.on october,the attorney,frustrated by the fact that he had not heard from principal for about two months,asked why principal had not simply sent miles for an examination.principal explained that it typically did not do that,but rather relied on the information from treating physicians and exercised its discretion to schedule an examination only if that information proved inadequate.
the october letter principal informs miles that it needs additional information in order to complete its evaluation 
on october,principal sent miles a letter indicating that it had received medical records from all of the physicians,but it lacked information from them regarding specific restrictions and limitations they have placed upon you that would prevent you from continuing to perform your occupation.letter from principal.the letter further stated that the testing that has been performed,other then sic the auditory testing we recently received from etra,indicates normal findings.id.although principal acknowledged that miles had provided them with his occupational functions with venable,the letter concluded that it is unclear what specific functions you are precluded from performing as an attorney,or what are of the severity to prevent you from performing your own occupation id.under the heading information needed to continue our evaluation,principal stated as follows 
medical documentation to support the severity of symptoms you experience related to your condition,and confirmation from your treating physician regarding what specific restrictions and limitations they have imposed,which prevent you from performing your own occupation effective april,through the present time.
id.the letter also informed miles that principal had asked an ent specialist and a neurologist to review the claim.
miles response to the october,letter 
in a letter dated november,miles attorney disputed principal assertions that the specific functions miles could no longer perform and the conditions that prevented him from performing them were unclear.citing the evidence already submitted to principal,counsel asserted that miles suffered from intractable tinnitus,vertigo,severe hearing loss,ear pain,and headaches,and that those conditions prevented miles from communicating with others including lengthy negotiation sessions,reading and understanding complex documents,drafting and revising such documents,memorizing numerous factual details,thinking about and devising solutions for difficult legal and transactional problems,and supervising associates,all of which tasks sometimes required working late into the night.the attorney expressed confusion why this clear proof was insufficient to satisfy the specific language of the policy.counsel letter also asked for an opportunity to review and comment on any reports from the neurology and ent specialists principal had stated it would retain.
principal retains independent medical evaluators to review miles file 
on november,principal engaged two specialists from reliable review services neurologist bruce leforce and otolaryngologist,ent specialist thomas klein to conduct a peer file review.principal specifically instructed leforce to call haimovic,miles treating neurologist,to discuss his findings and find out what he feels is impeding work.though leforce attempted to do so twice,haimovic indicated that he had not been provided with a release,so he could not discuss miles with leforce.in his assessment,leforce stated that t here are no objective findings to support impairment from a neurological perspective.there are no restrictions or limitations supported by the information provided.he is capable of full time work.lead advisory report.
klein completed a secondary advisory report.whereas leforce had been unable to consult with the treating neurologist,klein consulted with miles treating ent physician,etra.klein report attributed to etra the impression that the tinnitus was subjective and the vertigo was not a real problem and the headaches were not related to ear,nose or throat nor was the fogginess related to ear,nose or throat.secondary advisory report.when asked about restrictions and limitations,klein concluded that t here is a lack of objective findings to support the need for restrictions and limitations on work activities from an otolaryngology prospective sic.he also noted a lack of objective findings to support the claimant subjective complaints.id.at.in conclusion,klein emphasized that the file lacked observable,objective information confirming that miles is disabled 
while the claimant has a history of hearing loss,vertigo and ear pain,with the exception of the hearing loss there is no clinical documentation from the treating provider that clearly details any significant or severe positive objective findings or significant severe functional limitations occurring that would have prevented his return back to his regular job.the observeable sic information provided does not clearly support severity of impairment with significant limitations of functioning.
principal initial denial of miles claim 
principal did not respond to miles attorney november letter or allow counsel to comment on the reports from leforce and klein.rather,on december,it informed miles that it had completed its review of his claim and decided to deny it.see initial denial.principal provided a series of reasons for this decision.first,it pointed out that etra had indicated none in the portion of the work status sheet which asks the physician for specific restrictions.id.at.specifically,etra wrote none in a box asking whether he had restricted the number of hours miles can sit,stand,stoop,use his hands to push or pull.immediately above this box on the work status sheet,etra stated that miles was unable to work due to hearing loss,vertigo,and tinnitus.work status sheet.however,principal did not mention the latter information in its initial denial.
second,principal denial stated that a lthough etra work status sheet primarily outlines physical restrictions,etra did not identify other conditions,such as concentration,headaches,or hearing loss as being of the severity these sic would preclude you from returning to your own occupation.initial denial,emphasis added.actually,as mentioned above,etra work status sheet states unequivocally that miles is unable to work due to hearing loss,vertigo and tinnitus.work status sheet.
third,principal indicated that i t is not clear what transpired on april,to prevent you from returning to work following this date.initial denial.fourth,principal noted that its claims examiner did not have difficulty with verbal communication with miles during the august,phone interview.id.fifth,principal quoted klein summary of his conversation with etra according to klein etra also felt that the tinnitus was subjective,the vertigo was not a real problem,and the headaches were not related to ear,nose or throat nor was the fogginess.id.
principal initial denial acknowledged that the reviewing neurologist,leforce,had not discussed miles case with the treating neurologist,haimovic.however,principal placed the blame for that as follows haimovic would not discuss you as he indicated he did not have proper authorization.but,leforce had forwarded an authorization to haimovic on two separate occasions.id.emphasis added.this was inaccurate.in fact,leforce report states only that he had asked rrs the service through which he had been retained to send the release to haimovic 
in summary,principal stated as fol 
while you have a history of hearing loss,vertigo and ear pain,with the exception of the hearing loss there is no clinical documentation available for review from the treating providers that clearly states any significant severe functional limitations that would have prevented you from returning back to your regular job.the observable information provided does not clearly support the severity of impairment with significant limitations of functioning.therefore,we are declining your claim for long term disability benefits as the information we have received does not support the severity of symptoms related to a that would prevent you from performing your own occupation.
initial denial.
after laying out the above reasons for denying his claims,principal informed miles that he had the right to appeal.principal directed that miles provide m edical information,testing,and results to meet his burden of proof on appeal.id.at.specifically,it indicated that he should provide testing to support the severity of your an explanation from his treating doctors outlining upon what medical basis they would support your inability to perform your occupation m edical records,testing and results that supports sic your inability to return to your own occupation with the use of a hearing aid.r esults of cognitive testing with findings of the severity that they sic impact your ability to concentrate,and a physician who will support that these results would have prevented you from performing your own occupation as of april,and s pecific restrictions and limitations from your treating physician with a diagnosis or symptoms includ ing medical documentation to support these restrictions and sustained functional limitations due to your disabling diagnosis.id.
miles requests review of the denial 
on september,miles sought review of the denial of his claim.he argued that principal reasons for denying his claim were not supported by the record proof and submitted more than pages of additional information in support of the claim.specifically,he included updated reports from etra and haimovic both dated september,and the results of videonystagmography vng testing in his report,etra explained that tinnitus was miles most significant issue and elaborated on his clinical findings 
it is a roaring tinnitus which is constantly in miles head.in addition,he has significant ongoing headaches due to the tinnitus.he has been fully worked up and has had all treatment modalities that are available,yet despite this,the hearing loss has remained profound the tinnitus is a subjective complaint.it clearly is completely consistent with the degree of hearing loss.patients who have this degree of tinnitus have significant inability to concentrate and perform ongoing significant mental tasks that require this prolonged concentration.
letter from etra,
miles also included records related to injuries that occurred in february,a report from physical therapist sheetal desai,who summarized objective in support of miles diagnosis and opined that miles significant pain in neck,headaches,tinnitus,ringing in ears and loss of hearing limit his ability to sit through lengthy negotiation sessions sit at a desk and read for an extended period of time and writ e and draft papers,a physical residual functional capacity questionnaire completed on march,by haimovic,which indicated,inter alia,that miles symptoms interfere with attention and concentration c onstantly,a new medical report from michael gordon,an ent specialist,who stated his impression that miles has objective evidence of conductive hearing loss in his left ear as well as evidence of probable vestibular dysfunction in his right ear,and further indicated that miles is experiencing troublesome tinnitus in both ears,which can not be measured objectively.gordon opined that miles constant headaches can not be explained on the basis of otologic disease,but it is possible that his tinnitus and vestibular function resulted from systemic factors that also cause the headaches,and gordon opinion that a hearing aid would not alleviate miles disequilibrium or tinnitus.
miles also objected to principal focus on the lack of objective information confirming the cause of miles tinnitus,noting that the plan language requires that miles prove that he suffers from a sickness but does not also require that he prove the cause of that sickness.miles pointed out that the initial denial did not dispute the truthfulness of any of miles symptoms,including their persistence,severity intensity,and duration.id.at.in fact,principal denial letter did not state that the plan did not credit miles statement about his symptoms and,thus,miles argued that his symptoms ought to be considered undisputed.id.at emphasis in original.miles also objected to the fact that principal did not identify any objective findings or limitations that,considering miles undisputed symptoms,the plan would reasonably have expected to see.id.finally,miles argued that principal express reliance on the absence of restrictions and limitations violated principal fiduciary duty to decide miles claim in accordance with the terms of the plan.id.at.
miles is awarded disability benefits from the social security administration 
after miles appeal letter was sent to principal,the social security administration ssa found that he had been disabled since april.miles sent the ssa decision to principal and asked it to consider the decision in its review.the commissioner of ssa concluded that miles has the following severe impairments hearing loss vertigo tinnitus and cervical impingement with radiculopathy.miles was found to be disabled at step three of the commissioner disability inquiry decision of the ssa.specifically,the commissioner concluded that miles impairments meet the criteria of listing disturbance of function including meniere disease,characterized by a history of frequent attacks of balance disturbance,tinnitus,and progressive loss of hearing.in reaching this conclusion,the commissioner specifically found that miles was credible 
after considering the evidence of record,the undersigned finds that the claimant medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged symptoms,and that the claimant statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are generally credible.in evaluating the record,i note that the clamant has a long work history,which enhances his credibility.

principal requests additional independent medical evaluations 
as mentioned above,in october principal declined miles lawyer suggestion that principal conduct an examination of miles during the initial review of his claim.however,a year later,in connection with miles request for review of the initial denial of benefits,principal requested that miles submit to physical examinations.principal asserts that miles refused to submit to these exams,but the record reveals a more nuanced dispute over their permissible scope.we need not decide here whether principal had an unfettered right to require such exams 
principal retained additional independent experts to review miles file.ent specialist robert carpenter from reliable review services and neurologist leonid topper from mes solutions reviewed the file and submitted written reports in response to questions posed by principal.carpenter reported that the diagnoses on which miles claim rested were in fact substantiated by objective findings left mixed hearing loss,mostly conductive right vestibular weakness and cervical disc disease,and that there are no objective tests for tinnitus.carpenter advisory report.carpenter further stated that miles stopped working because of the headaches and foggy feeling along with the loud tinnitus.it was his prognosis was that,absent successful treatment miles would suffer a continuation of the same symptoms.id.at.nevertheless,in response to the question what restrictions and limitations would you recommend,carpenter responded from the objective data in the medical records,there appear to be no physical limitations or restrictions.id.emphasis added.
topper stated that t he medical records fail to document any specific neurological diagnosis that would explain at least a larger part of the claimant symptoms.specifically,the claimant difficulty concentrating and daily headaches are essentially peer review report.he opined that the complaints can not be explained by any known neurological condition.peer review report.finally,topper opined,inter alia,that miles headaches were reported to happen in the claimant fifth decade of life,which is not typical for primary headaches t he claimant headaches do not match a typical pattern of migraine and t hese headaches have multiple symptoms which are not typically seen in migraines peer review report.
principal final decision denying miles claim 
on february,principal issued a final decision reaffirming its decision to decline miles claim for benefits.principal explained that t he medical documentation received does not support a medical condition that would preclude miles from performing his occupation.it again stated that it was unclear what changed in miles condition in april of,to prevent him from working,noting that it had attempted to get this information about his employment history but venable had declined to discuss this with us.it summarized the medical reports to date,and noted that t he tinnitus did not find an explanation by ent or by neurology and m any of the complainant complaints do not match the findings of neurological examination.id.it concluded that miles description of his symptoms does not match any recognizable pattern of any primary or secondary headaches syndrome known to neurologists,and therefore rejected his claim for ltd benefits.id.at.
c.the procedural history of this case 
miles brought this action challenging principal denial of his claim,asserting that he met all of his obligations under the terms of the policy and the plan,and that principal arbitrarily and capriciously denied his claim for benefits and then arbitrarily and capriciously failed to provide a full and fair review of that denial.am.compl.
the parties consented to a bench trial on a stipulated administrative record pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the district court reviewed principal initial determination and concluded that it was supported by substantial evidence and that it was neither arbitrary nor capricious.miles,d at.specifically,it held that principal reasonably relied on miles failure to demonstrate restrictions and limitations as a basis to deny his claim did not err by failing to expressly state whether it credited miles subjective complaints and reasonably required objective proof of a significant impairment.
because the district court concluded that the initial denial was neither arbitrary nor capricious,it reviewed the final determination solely to determine if principal afforded miles a full and fair review of the initial denial decision.miles,d at.concluding that the final decision considered and addressed both the proof submitted before the initial determination and the additional proof submitted during the appeal,the court concluded that miles was accorded the full and fair review to which he was entitled prior to the final determination denying his claim.accordingly,it directed the entry of judgment dismissing the complaint.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
this appeal centers on the legal significance of the facts in the administrative record that was jointly submitted to the district court.the district court did not hear witness testimony or make any credibility determinations rather,it reviewed the record and made legal conclusions based on its contents.accordingly,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.lopresti terwilliger,cir.
judicial review of a plan administrator underlying benefits determination is reviewed de novo unless,as here,the plan grants the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch.since the parties agree that principal has such discretionary authority,this court applies a more deferential standard,seeking to determine only whether the administrator decision was arbitrary and capricious.celardo gny auto.dealers health welfare trust,cir p lans investing the administrator with broad discretionary authority to determine eligibility are reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.thus,despite our de novo review of the district court decision,we accord substantial deference to principal underlying determination denying miles claim.however,courts may dial back deference if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest.bruch,at

principal failed to properly consider miles subjective complaints 
this court has long recognized that subjective complaints of disabling conditions are not merely evidence of a disability,but are an important factor to be considered in determining disability.connors.life ins,cir quoting mimms heckler,cir.in connors,the district court described a claimant alleged disability as a subjective matter,and disregarded subjective evidence of pain in its assessment of the disability claim.we reversed,concluding that the court erred in discounting connors complaints of pain as merely subjective,and holding that courts may not dismiss complaints of pain as legally insufficient evidence of disability.id.at.connors and other decisions by this court have made it clear that it is arbitrary and capricious to disregard evidence simply because it is subjective.see,thurber aetna life ins,cir noting that the plan administrator must give sufficient attention to subjective complaints krizek cigna grp,cir noting that it is error to reject subjective evidence simply because it is subjective marcus califano,cir t he subjective evidence of appellant pain,based on her own testimony and the medical reports of examining physicians,is more than ample to establish her disability,if believed.
thus,a reviewing court is obliged to determine whether a plan administrator has given sufficient attention to the claimant subjective complaints before determining that they were not supported by objective evidence.thurber,at.if the subjective evidence is not credited,section of erisa mandates that the plan administrator provide the claimant with adequate notice in writing setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.this notice requirement is essential to fair claims administration,as it is meant to provide claimants with enough information to prepare adequately for further administrative review or an appeal to the federal courts.hobson metro.life ins,cir quoting juliano health maint.org.of,cir.
looking to the record before us,we conclude that principal did not give adequate attention to miles subjective complaints,as it failed to either assign any weight to them or to provide specific reasons for its decision to discount them.instead,in its initial denial,principal cited etra statement that the tinnitus was subjective as a reason for denying miles claims.see initial denial,appellee br.at.pointing out that evidence is subjective is not,by itself,a proper basis to reject evidence.connors,at.moreover,principal failed to mention that etra himself had found these subjective complaints credible,concluding that miles appears to be with significant tinnitus,hearing loss,and intractable head pain.claim form.as principal cites to no reason to discount the evidence other than its subjective nature,we conclude that principal arbitrarily rejected miles subjective evidence of disability.
in its final determination,principal continued to point to the subjective nature of miles complaints as the only basis for disregarding the evidence.for example,principal stated that miles loss of orientation and concentration was never verified by objective testing and remained only,and pointed out that m any of the claimant complaints were never observed by his neurologist and were never confirmed by exams.final determination internal quotation marks omitted.however,as discussed above,pointing out that evidence is subjective is not,standing alone,a reasonable basis on which to accord that evidence limited weight.since subjective evidence is more than ample to establish miles disability,if believed,marcus,at,principal must do more than simply point to the subjective nature of the evidence when denying his claim.it must either assign some weight to the evidence or provide a reason for its decision not to do so 
principal has identified nothing in the present record that would support a rejection of miles subjective complaints.though there is no objective evidence of tinnitus,multiple specialists have said there is no objective test for it.see infra section.tinnitus is consistent with hearing loss,for which there are objective tests,and the record indicates that there is undisputed objective evidence of such hearing loss in miles case.see,carpenter advisory report,klein secondary advisory report.finally,as the commissioner of social security observed in crediting miles account of his symptoms,miles long history of hard work supports his credibility on this issue.decision of the ssa.we do not mean to suggest that principal is required on remand to credit miles statements regarding the nature and severity of his subjective symptoms.however,considering the present record as a whole,we conclude that principal acted arbitrarily and capriciously by disregarding miles subjective complaints without providing any reason for this decision.
principal request for objective evidence proving that miles suffered from tinnitus was unreasonable 
in its final decision,principal relied on the lack of an objective proof of tinnitus as a basis to deny the claim.the tinnitus did not find an explanation by ent or by neurology.specifically,neurologically there was no vascular lesion on sic imaging to explain audible tinnitus.the district court held that this insistence on objective evidence to establish the existence of a disabling impairment was reasonable.miles,d at.although acknowledging that tinnitus may be difficult to prove,the district court held that it was not unreasonable for principal to require proof of significant impairment beyond etra diagnosis.id.at.considering the issue de novo,we disagree.a claimant bears the burden of proving that a disability is covered,see mario p c food mkts,cir,but plan administrators may not impose unreasonable requests for objective evidence.here,the record suggests that there is no objective test to prove the presence of tinnitus.it was unreasonable for principal to request objective evidence of impairment when it had not identified any such test that exists.accordingly,we conclude that principal arbitrarily and capriciously relied on miles failure to provide objective evidence of tinnitus as a reason to deny his ltd claim without specifying the objective evidence it would expect to see.
in hobson metropolitan life insurance,cir,this court held that a plan administrator may accord less weight to subjective complaints where the claimant is unable to produce objective corroboration.hobson,at.in hobson,a plan administrator informed a claimant that trigger point tenderness was a major criteri on for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia,and requested objective evidence of tenderness in assessing the disability claim.id.the claimant failed to produce the objective evidence after being notified of the need to do so.this court concluded that,i n light of this notification,the plan acted within its discretion in denying benefits.id.
here,in contrast to hobson,the evidence in the record suggests that tinnitus may not be amenable to objective verification.indeed,the independent evaluator whom principal retained carpenter concluded that there are no objective tests for tinnitus,see carpenter advisory report.this conclusion was repeated by michael gordon,an ent specialist retained by miles,who stated that miles is experiencing troublesome tinnitus in both ears,which can not be measured objectively.
whether an alleged impairment lends itself to objective clinical findings is a factual determination to be made by the plan administrators.see,martucci hartford life ins,d,noting that is reasonable to require objective evidence documenting the amount of debilitation caused by a particular illness where tests for such evidence exist.unlike in hobson,principal did not identify any objective findings that,considering miles symptoms,it would reasonably have expected to see.under these circumstances,we conclude that it was unreasonable for principal to rely on the lack of objective evidence of tinnitus to deny miles claim.see,magee metro.life ins,d,ignoring metlife erroneous objective evidence requirement where in a catch,metlife acknowledges that there is no test for chronic fatigue syndrome,but metlife nevertheless rejected plaintiff claim because he failed to provide objective evidence,establishing that he was suffering from a disabling impairment fitzpatrick bayer,civ.rjs,wl,at,distinguishing the question of whether a person suffers from a particular impairment from the question of whether that person is disabled as a result see also salomaa honda long term disability plan,cir holding that a plan administrator abused its discretion when it demanded objective tests to establish the existence of a condition for which there are no objective tests cusson liberty life assurance of boston,cir drawing a distinction between requiring objective evidence of the diagnosis,which is impermissible for a condition that does not lend itself to objective verification,and requiring objective evidence that the plaintiff is unable to work,which is allowed.
principal erred by selectively considering evidence in the record 
principal failed to support many of its assertions with sound reasoning in the record and,in some instances,made assertions that are contradicted by the record.for example,in both the initial and final denials of miles claim,principal stated that i t not clear what changed in miles condition in april of,to prevent him from working.see also.but the record before principal could hardly have been clearer on the subject.before the initial denial,etra informed principal that miles difficulties began eight months earlier with bilateral ear pain,tinnitus,and hearing loss.then,just before miles ceased working
