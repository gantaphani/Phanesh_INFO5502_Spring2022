surely,if there is any moral to this story,it is to get it in writing.it is astounding in this day and age to find it necessary to repeat this admonition,but no less so than to find a sophisticated party willing to leverage an agreement involving multiple years and millions of dollars solely on the enforceability of a simple handshake.yet that is precisely what has happened in this case.plaintiff trustmark insurance company trustmark brought suit against defendant general cologne life re of america cologne,another insurance company,over an alleged reinsurance deal that was not committed to writing.
nonetheless,trustmark presses its claims under theories of breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and promissory estoppel,alleging that cologne breached an unwritten agreement and amorphous promises to acquire a block of individual disability insurance idi policies.the district court granted partial summary judgment in cologne favor on the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims,finding no because the parties did not exercise mutual control over a joint enterprise.the court further found,in entering final judgment in favor of cologne after a subsequent bench trial,that plaintiff promissory estoppel claim was barred by the statute of frauds.because we find that plaintiff has failed to proffer sufficient evidence of mutual control over a,and that the availability of an adequate remedy at law precludes trustmark from invoking the partial performance exception to the statute of frauds,we affirm both rulings.
background 
in early,trustmark and cologne jointly investigated,with a view toward acquiring,a block of idi policies offered for sale by hartford life insurance hereinafter,the hartford block or the block.in the course of their investigation,the record suggests that these parties talked about a lot of things that would happen in the event of a successful purchase of the block.they talked about sharing profits and the risk of loss.they even talked about trustmark taking on the responsibility for administering claims on the purchased policies,as cologne lacked the capacity to do so itself.the problem is,none of this talk was committed to writing.
despite having no written as to how this investigation itself would parties together performed the actuarial work and due diligence necessary to determine a purchase price for the proposed acquisition.negotiations over the purchase,however,took place solely between trustmark and hartford.these negotiations bore fruit on october,when,after some back and forth,trustmark and hartford signed a letter of intent on the sale of the block.although cologne had reviewed,commented on,and approved this letter of intent,it did not sign the letter and its name is not mentioned anywhere.on its face,the letter sets forth a relationship solely between trustmark and hartford.
in conjunction with the letter of intent,trustmark also entered into a separate agreement with hartford,immediately conferring upon trustmark the responsibility for administering claims on the purchased policies after signing the letter of intent.trustmark did not consult cologne regarding the terms of this separate agreement,nor did it seek the defendant approval of the document prior to its execution.this separate agreement makes no mention of cologne whatsoever.
notwithstanding cologne omission from the operative paperwork,over the next ten months while the final purchase documents were being drafted,representatives of cologne and trustmark continued to speak as if the defendant was still a part of the deal.for example,in sales pitch letters to third parties dated december,and february,andrew perkins,senior vice president of cologne individual health group,referred to the cologne and trustmark as successful partners in the purchase of the hartford block.on february,perkins sent a draft of the reinsurance agreement between trustmark and hartford to his assistant with a handwritten note stating we end up with a retro to us from trustmark,following this language.in addition,cologne made several reassurances to trustmark between february and july the face of mounting losses on the hartford it remained committed to sharing the risk on the hartford block.but,throughout all this,the final purchase agreement with hartford had yet to be finalized and signed,and cologne name had yet to appear formally on paper.
on september,after learning of additional and substantial losses on the block,but prior to final consummation of the acquisition,cologne informed trustmark that it would not go forward with the purchase.cologne claims that its decision to renege was based on trustmark poor ability to administer policy claims the failure of the parties to agree upon or even discuss trustmark compensation for administering claims a figure that would determine how much premium cologne would receive on the back end and the delay of trustmark and hartford,by the terms of their own letter of intent,in entering into a definitive agreement on the block purchase.each of these items,according to cologne,were understood conditions to its involvement in the deal.trustmark claims the decision to renege came upon cologne discovery that hartford block was losing a lot of money.whatever the reason,cologne was out,and trustmark was unhappy.notwithstanding this abandonment,trustmark went on to finalize the purchase from hartford on december.
in february,trustmark brought suit against cologne under five counts.under count i,trustmark sought a declaratory judgment that cologne was obliged to reinsure trustmark on the hartford block in accordance with an alleged agreement.count ii sought specific performance on this alleged agreement.count iii sought damages for breach of the alleged agreement,while count iv sought damages for breach of fiduciary duty.count v claimed damages under a theory of promissory estoppel.in october,the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment as to counts i through iv,rejecting those counts premised on the existence of a agreement as a matter of law.in particular,the court found that trustmark had failed to show that the parties had maintained joint control over an idi policy purchasing enterprise.the court also denied a motion by trustmark to amend its complaint to add a claim of equitable estoppel,finding that the plaintiff failed to show good cause to add the claim more than nine months after the deadline for amending pleadings,and that such a late amendment would prejudice the defendant by necessitating additional discovery.
this left trustmark with only its promissory estoppel claim,which survived cologne statute of frauds challenge at summary judgment only by virtue of the potential applicability of the doctrine of partial performance.otherwise,the district court determined that the statute of frauds applied to the alleged promise at the heart of trustmark promissory estoppel claim,and there was no writing to satisfy the statute prescriptions.with the statute of frauds bar so avoided,however,the district court found that trustmark had created a genuine issue of fact as to whether trustmark entered into the letter of intent with hartford in reliance on cologne alleged promise to join in the purchase of the block.
in june,however,cologne requested that the district court reconsider its october order with respect to trustmark promissory estoppel claim.in particular,the defendant noted that the doctrine of partial performance,upon which the plaintiff only surviving claim relied,is an equitable doctrine.trustmark promissory estoppel claim,in contrast,explicitly sought damages.though the court agreed that the doctrine of partial performance could not save trustmark promissory estoppel claim to the extent it sought monetary damages,it found the claim could nonetheless survive because it had incorporated the requests for equitable relief sought in the other dismissed the declaratory judgment and specific performance sought in counts i and ii,respectively.accordingly,the promissory estoppel claim received a bench trial in april.
after the bench trial,the district court entered final judgment in favor of cologne on august,finding that the ability to quantify the extent of trustmark loss on the hartford block left the plaintiff with an adequate remedy at precluding equitable relief and reliance on the equitable doctrine of partial performance to preserve the promissory estoppel claim.trustmark appeals both this final entry of judgment,and the prior grant of partial summary judgment.
ii.analysis 
cologne and trustmark did not exercise sufficient mutual control to establish a 
trustmark first challenges the district court entry of partial summary judgment on its claims counts i through iv.we review a district court decision to grant a motion for summary judgment de novo,construing all facts,and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts,in favor of the nonmoving party.telemark dev.group,mengelt,cir.summary judgment is properly granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
in granting partial summary judgment,the court found that the parties were not engaged in a when they worked in concert to acquire the hartford block.to establish a under governing illinois law,a party must prove 
an express or implied agreement to carry on some enterprise a manifestation of intent by the parties to be associated as joint venturers a joint interest as shown by the contribution of property,financial resources,effort,skill,or knowledge a degree of joint proprietorship or mutual right to the exercise of control over the enterprise and provision for joint sharing of profits and losses.
minyo minyo,d,citing ambuul swanson,d.here,the controversy centers around the fourth control over a joint enterprise.
as a threshold matter,there is some discrepancy as to the scope of the enterprise over which the parties allegedly exerted control.trustmark insists that the at the heart of its claim extended only to the purchase of the hartford block,and not,as the district court reasoned,to the purchase of idi policies in general.indeed,the size of the enterprise may bear on a plaintiff burden in establishing the control element,for the bigger the enterprise,the more sweeping the requisite control and the more sweeping the control,the more the plaintiff would have to establish to survive summary judgment.thus,trustmark argues that the district court erred when it grounded its dismissal of the breach of contract claim in part on the parties inability to control each other activities in pursuing idi policies in general.this argument,however,belies the allegations of trustmark own complaint,which by its own terms describes the as existing for the purpose of acquiring large blocks of idi policies from various insurance companies.compl.at emphasis added.in any event,how great or small the scope of the averred enterprise is of little consequence here,for,whether the enterprise end be idi policies in general or merely the hartford acquisition in particular,the record remains devoid of any evidence of mutual control.
trustmark only hope to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding mutual control rests on cologne involvement in drafting the letter of intent that bound trustmark to proceed with the acquisition of the hartford block.cologne was unquestionably involved in the letter drafting the company reviewed,commented on,and ultimately approved the terms reflected in the letter of intent,and its subsidiary,jha,is credited with determining the purchase price for the block provided in the letter.but this involvement does not,as trustmark contends,exhibit cologne control over the purchase of the block.cologne asserted involvement here occurred well before trustmark entered into the final purchase agreement with hartford,during the preliminary stages of the purchase negotiations.indeed,illinois allows parties to approach agreement in stages,without fear that by reaching a preliminary understanding they have bargained away their privilege to disagree on the specifics.empro,cir.cologne consultations and involvement at this stage,while not insignificant,remain best characterized as its thorough investigation of a business opportunity,and its approval of terms as a preliminary understanding of that opportunity contours.review and comment on documents that shape preliminary understandings of deals yet to be finalized do not amount to an exercise of control.
trustmark next cites herst chark,d,for the proposition that mutual control necessary to establish a will be found where the parties divide responsibilities along functional lines.reading herst so,trustmark argues that such responsibility divisions were made cologne performing due diligence on the underwriting of the hartford block cologne subsidiary jha determining the acquisition purchase price trustmark and jha undertaking due diligence on hartford claims handling and trustmark taking sole responsibility for claims administration upon consummation of the purchase.with this division of responsibilities in mind,the plaintiff insists that a factual issue remains as to mutual control.
even assuming this division of responsibilities to be accurate,however,trustmark fundamentally misconstrues the holding of herst.the case does not stand for the proposition that mutual control exists wherever parties divide responsibilities along functional lines.rather,the case merely notes that the fact that one party was not involved in every aspect of an enterprise does not preclude the finding of a.id,at.nothing in herst holds that mutual control could exist notwithstanding the inability of either party to exercise control over the other toward achieving the object of the alleged.
in the final analysis,neither trustmark nor cologne could force the other party to enter into an idi policy it in general or merely for the hartford could they compel the use of each other employees or resources toward such ends.these parties could not exercise any control over each other operations or policies whatsoever,and therefore we affirm the district court grant of partial summary judgment on the claims for lack of mutual control.
trustmark proffers no writings that could satisfy the statute of frauds 
turning to its promissory estoppel claim,the plaintiff next contends that the district court erred in finding that it had proffered no document to satisfy the writing requirement of the statute of frauds.because the court made this finding in its october,partial summary judgment ruling,which tied the fate of trustmark promissory estoppel claim to the applicability of the doctrine of partial performance,our review is de novo.telemark,at.
the illinois statute of frauds provides that 
n o action shall be brought upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof,unless the promise or agreement upon which such action shall be brought,or some memorandum or note thereof,shall be in writing,and signed by the party to be charged therewith,or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.
ilcs.it is undisputed that trustmark and cologne have not entered into a written contract.furthermore,trustmark does not dispute the district court finding that cologne alleged promise to reinsure the hartford block can not be performed within one year.and it is clear that u nder illinois law,the statute of frauds is applicable to a promise claimed to be enforceable by virtue of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.fischer first chicago capital,cir citing architectural metal,consolidated,cir mcinerney charter golf,p romissory estoppel does not bar the application of the statute of frauds in illinois.thus,the issue here is whether trustmark has proffered a writing sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.
