stephen ward appeals a declaratory judgment to the effect that west coast life insurance wcl properly rescinded a life insurance policy covering the life of his wife,lois ward,after receiving a claim for payment following her death.we affirm.
procedural background 
the declaratory judgment action concerned two inaccuracies in the application dated august,which lois ward submitted to wcl for a life insurance policy.question of the application asked if the proposed insured had any application for other life insurance then pending.the applicant responded no.question asked for life insurance in force and pending on the proposed insured.the application did not disclose any policies but listed pending insurance coverage with cna and jackson national,each in the amount of million.
wcl issued a policy to lois ward on october,naming stephen ward as beneficiary.she died on december,somewhat more than two months later.after receiving a claimant statement from stephen ward,wcl rescinded the policy on the ground that the insurance application contained material misrepresentations about other insurance in force and tendered a check for the amount of all premiums paid plus interest.on september,wcl filed a complaint for declaratory relief seeking a declaration that the policy was duly rescinded and is null and void and of no further force or effect.following discovery,it filed a motion for summary judgment,which the trial court granted.stephen ward hereafter stephen or appellant now appeals from the summary judgment.
to review the issue of misrepresentation,we must first examine the record pertaining to insurance coverage of lois ward hereafter lois.the record discloses that at the time she applied for the wcl policy on august,lois had three insurance policies providing a total of million in coverage.american republic life insurance company issued her a policy on february,in the amount of and northwestern mutual life insurance company issued her a policy on september,in the amount of.both policies were still in effect on august.
a third policy came into force shortly before lois submitted the wcl application.according to stephen,he and his wife decided they wanted to increase the amount of life insurance on each of their lives in july,and they each submitted two separate applications through an insurance agent named bruce goldsmith for million of life insurance coverage.one of these applications submitted by lois was to transamerica and was dated and delivered to goldsmith on july.stephen executed a check for the first policy premium of the transamerica policy on august.lois received the policy and signed a delivery receipt on august,the same day that she submitted the wcl application.
on august,lois and stephen met with another agent,william wee,who acted as a writing agent for a general agent,capital synergies.wee advised them to apply to several companies for coverage and select the one that would offer the best rates.accepting this advice,lois applied to wcl,jackson national,and cna for separate life insurance policies in the amount of million each.stephen testified that wee filled out and completed an application to wcl dated august,and dropped it off at their home or stephen office on that same day.the record reveals that lois signed the application bearing that date and that it was received by wcl shortly thereafter.the application was for a term policy with coverage of million.lois was then years old.though the policy was dated october,the chief underwriter for wcl testified that it actually went into effect on october,when all the conditions for its issuance were satisfied.
in the course of processing lois ward application,wcl employed first financial underwriting services,to investigate the application.the firm prepared a report that was dated september.the wcl underwriting department logged the receipt of the report on september.according to the chief of the wcl underwriting department,the report would have been reviewed as a matter of routine by the employee assigned to the application.in this appeal,appellant emphasizes that,under the heading other insurance in force,the report stated,applicant has a policy with northwest mutual in the amount of.appellant also produced evidence that at this time the writing agent,william wee,had copies of lois ward transamerica application.
the application that lois ward submitted to jackson national also led to issuance of a million insurance policy.the record reveals only two pertinent facts about the chronology of this coverage the insurer received the application on august,and wcl apparently had not learned of the insurance coverage on september,the date that the report was prepared.
while the wcl application for a million policy was pending,lois requested an increase in coverage to million.wcl maintains that it only agreed to increase her coverage from million to million on the representations on her behalf that she would cancel the one jackson national policy of which wcl was aware.stephen denies that either he or his wife ever represented that they would cancel the jackson national policy and points to the absence of any written representation of this sort.the record,however,discloses that lois and her agent,wee,both signed and sent to capital synergies a replacement form relating to the substitution of wcl coverage for that of jackson national.internal documents of both wcl and capital synergies reveal an assumption that lois had agreed to replace the jackson national policy with the million wcl coverage.before action was taken on this request,lois asked for a further increase in coverage to million.wcl approved in principle the increase to million and then to million.nevertheless,wcl claims that neither the million nor million increase in coverage went through the necessary steps to go into effect.in this appeal,stephen claims only coverage by the million policy.
in its statement of undisputed facts,wcl maintains that it would not have issued any insurance on lois life if it had known she already had million in insurance and,again,if it had known as of october,that she had in force million of insurance it would not have agreed to insure her or increase her insurance coverage.at his deposition,steven hetherington,the chief underwriter of wcl,was questioned concerning wcl willingness to approve a million insurance policy for her.hetherington insisted,it was our absolute outside number.wcl possessed guidelines for its underwriting practices,entitled guide to initial underwriting requirements,which it distributed to insurance agents for their use.the financial underwriting section of this document stated that personal insurance of insureds between the ages of and should not exceed times earnings.lois application listed annual income of plus.the report of first financial underwriting services,reported only the couple joint income as being.
discussion 
steven challenges the judgment of rescission on the ground that the record presents a triable issue of waiver under insurance code section and two early precedents from this court,rutherford prudential ins.d.and dipasqua california.life ins.d.we will review the general principles governing rescission and then consider the issue of waiver.
the rule in insurance cases is that a material misrepresentation or concealment in an insurance application,whether intentional or unintentional,entitles the insurer to rescind the insurance policy ab initio.federal kemper life assurance cal th,d,barrera state farm mut.automobile ins.cal d,fn.wilson western national life ins.d,d.the rule has been codified in express provisions of the insurance code that place heavy burdens of disclosure upon both parties to a contract of insurance and permit rescission for a failure to provide requested information.imperial casualty indemnity sogomonian d.thus,section provides concealment,whether intentional or unintentional,entitles the injured party to rescind insurance.concealment is defined in section as n eglect to communicate that which a party knows,and ought to communicate.section states more clearly the requirement of materiality each party to a contract of insurance shall communicate to the other,in good faith,all facts within his knowledge which are or which he believes to be material to the contract see also.
materiality is determined solely by the probable and reasonable effect which truthful answers would have had upon the insurer.thompson occidental life ins.cal d,freeman allstate life ins.cir.section explicitly provides materiality is to be determined not by the event,but solely by the probable and reasonable influence of the facts upon the party to whom the communication is due,in forming his estimate of the disadvantages of the proposed contract,or in making his inquiries.
the fact that the insurer has demanded answers to specific questions in an application for insurance is in itself usually sufficient to establish materiality as a matter of law.citation.other cases,however,inquire into the nature of the information withheld,and the likely practice of the insurance company had the concealed facts been truthfully disclosed citations.old line life ins.superior court d.the test is a subjective one the critical question is the effect truthful answers would have had on the particular insurer,not on some average reasonable insurer.imperial casualty indemnity sogomonian,supra,d.
a summary judgment of rescission may be properly granted for the insurer where the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the undisputed evidence presented is that the false negative answers and omissions of the applicant were material to the insurer decision to provide insurance coverage.imperial casualty indemnity sogomonian,supra,d.see also lunardi life assurance th,d wilson western national life ins,supra,d,d.as in other cases,a plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment if he has proved each element of the cause of action entitling him to judgment on that cause of action.code civ,subd.p.once the plaintiff has made this evidentiary showing the burden shifts to the defendant who must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
in this appeal,appellant does not contest the trial court ruling that lois failure to disclose other current insurance policies in her application was material to wcl decision to issue the policy but instead relies entirely on a theory of waiver.the statutory basis for waiver is section,which provides in pertinent part the right to information of material facts may be waived,by neglect to make inquiries as to such facts,where they are distinctly implied in other facts of which information is communicated.
the factual basis for appellant claim of waiver rests on evidence that,before issuing the insurance policy in question,wcl received information through first financial underwriting services that lois response to question contained an omission it failed to list an insurance policy of northwestern mutual life insurance company in the amount of.appellant also notes that the face of the insurance application displayed an inconsistency between the answers to question and question.the former answer denied the existence of pending insurance policies while the later answer listed two pending insurance policies.these discrepancies,appellant argues,implied that the answer to question was in error and should have prompted wcl to inquire as to the actual facts.instead,the insurer issued the million policy and later approved in principle increases in coverage to million and then million.
appellant suggests that wcl could easily have discovered the existence of the million transamerica policy because the writing agent,william wee,possessed a copy of the policy.appellant appears to concede,however,that wee acted solely as the insureds agent in dealing with the general agent,capital synergies,and therefore his knowledge would not be imputed to wcl.the record contains no evidence that capital synergies possessed information of the undisclosed policies.
our analysis of appellant claim of waiver begins with the concept of materiality.we see significance in the fact that it was the total amount of other policies that was material,not the existence of a single policy with coverage.hetherington testified that million would have been the outside limit of insurance for which lois would have qualified under wcl underwriting guidelines reflected in its guide to initial underwriting requirements.with other coverage of million,the issuance of a million policy to lois would have caused her insurance to exceed this limit and to violate the company underwriting guidelines.in contrast,the existence of a single policy of did not implicate the underwriting guidelines and was not material to wcl decision to issue the policy.
since the existence of the policy was not in itself material to wcl decision to issue the policy to lois,the question becomes whether the discovery of this immaterial omission implied the existence of other material nondisclosures.we think the answer is surely no.communication of information regarding an immaterial omission of a insurance policy,which wcl gained from the report,did not imply the existence of a material omission,the existence of other insurance that in total exceeded wcl underwriting guidelines.similarly,the failure to list pending policies in answer to question did not imply the existence of distinct material omissions regarding policies in answer to question.
we find old line life ins.superior court,supra,d,to be instructive.the insured was a heavy cigarette smoker who purchased a nonsmoker life insurance policy through an insurance broker.the practice of the insurance company was to deny a nonsmoker policy to persons who smoked cigarettes during the months preceding the date of application.the smoking of cigars and pipes did not disqualify an applicant for a nonsmoker policy,but the insurance application still questioned applicants about current use of cigars and pipes to avoid needless suspicion in the event a urine or blood test indicate d the presence of tobacco,at.
the insured falsely indicated on her life insurance application that she had not smoked cigarettes during the past months and also stated that she did not currently smoke pipes or cigars.old line life ins.superior court,supra,d.after receiving her completed application,the insurance broker also gave her a declaration to fill out.contradicting the application,she checked i do after a question inquiring whether she smoked pipes or cigars.it was undisputed that the broker did not send the declaration to the insurance company until after her death of cancer about a year and a half after issuance of the policy.
the insurance company sought to rescind the insurance policy.when the trial court denied its motion for summary judgment,it sought a writ of mandate to reverse the order denying summary judgment.the appellate court issued the writ on the ground that the insured false denial of smoking cigarettes in her application was a material misrepresentation entitling the insurance company to rescission.the portion of the decision discussing the inconsistent nonsmoker declaration is most relevant to the present case.the court found that the insurance company had no direct information that the insured smoked cigarettes,thus implicitly recognizing that the broker was not its agent,and it attributed no significance to the speculative possibility that the insurance company might have learned of the inconsistent nonsmoker declarations through the broker and then initiated a broad investigation of the applicant smoking.old line life ins.superior court,supra,d.the court observed that,even if the insured was a current smoker of pipes and cigars,she would have been entitled to a nonsmoker policy.ibid.hence,even if the insurance company discovered the inconsistent declaration,the discovery would not fall into the category of obvious leads that should lead the insurance company to make inquiries or suffer waiver under section,at.
wcl cites two earlier decisions for the proposition that discovery of a minor error in an application does not necessarily put the insurer on notice of a material misrepresentation.in lathing penn ins.d,the insured died of
