zurich american insurance zurich contends the trial court and the discovery referee whose reports it adopted used the wrong standard in overruling its claim of privilege in this discovery dispute with watts industries,watts.we agree that the challenged orders employed an overly restrictive definition of the privilege,and grant relief on that basis.we decline to consider the privacy argument raised by zurich for the first time in this court.
factual and procedural summary 
watts admitted many of the allegations of zurich petition for mandate.we take much of our factual and procedural summary from those uncontested facts.
the parties have been embroiled in litigation for the last nine years over the underlying actions,state of california ex rel.nora armenta james jones company and los angeles department of water and power et ex rel.nora armenta james jones company et collectively,the armenta litigation.the instant action,watts industries,zurich american insurance company,no.was brought by watts.it pleads various causes of action arising out of zurich allegedly bad faith breach of its duty to defend and to provide coverage for watts in the armenta litigation.zurich then filed a declaratory relief action against watts and others,seeking a determination of its rights and duties under the policies.zurich american insurance company watts industries,et,no.this action was consolidated with the watts bad faith action.meanwhile,zurich instituted arbitration over separate deductible agreements in illinois.
during discovery in the instant action,watts requested production of various zurich documents,including documents from its claims file.zurich objected,invoking the privilege and the attorney work product doctrine.through a process,the parties narrowed their dispute from over documents to about.watts moved to compel production,claiming that the documents sought were not protected by the privilege or the work product doctrine.zurich opposed the motion,arguing that some documents were protected and objecting to discovery of documents involving other insureds.
the trial court granted the motion to compel in part,ordering zurich to produce for in camera inspection documents withheld on the grounds of the privilege,the work product doctrine,or the civil code section litigation privilege.a further effort reduced the number of contested documents to.of these,contained reserve or reinsurance documents,as well as documents zurich contended were protected by the privilege and work product doctrine.it is these documents which were addressed in the trial court orders that are the subject of this writ petition 
the discovery dispute was referred to honorable lester olson ret.for in camera inspection of the documents.it was agreed that the referee would first review some documents identified by zurich as claim file documents.after a tentative ruling and telephonic hearing,the referee issued a report and recommendations for a court order.the trial court adopted the referee report and issued the proposed order.we therefore examine the findings of the report in detail.
in paragraph of the report,the referee rejected the broad privilege claimed by zurich for all internal documents concerning reserves and reinsurance matters.these were described as the disallowed documents.the referee concluded that e xcept for the items in the claim file that contain actual copies of letters or communications from outside counsel,or documents that have been created by counsel,or received by counsel,or that contain direct communications from counsel,as indicated in the comment section of the attached listing of documents,the documents are not protected by the privilege nor the work product privilege.
the referee recognized that many of the disputed documents indicate internal litigation plans and strategy with respect to the cases in dispute,but the privilege is limited to communications by counsel to a client,and by a client to counsel.the fact that many of the disputed items contain discussion of legal matters,strategy,and status of the bad faith litigation can not be used to cloak them with either the privilege or the work product privilege for that reason alone.
the referee viewed the supreme court decision in white western title ins.cal d,white,to be controlling and supportive of his conclusion that the disallowed documents are not privileged.the referee also concluded that zurich litigation privilege claim is not recognized in california law.instead,the only litigation privilege recognized in california is civil code section hereafter section,and the disputed documents examined do not fall within the scope of that protection.the referee found that only the privilege and work product doctrine apply.
the referee relied on insurance of north america superior court d.ina and ranch superior court th,d ranch for his conclusion that documents concerning loss reserves and reinsurance were discoverable.
the trial court adopted the referee recommendation that zurich be directed to produce the disallowed documents and incorporated the referee work sheet in its order.documents marked sustain were held not subject to production.
following this order,the referee issued a second report covering the balance of the reserve and reinsurance documents.he applied the same test for privilege that he used in the first report,ruling that only documents that contain actual copies of letters or communications from outside counsel,or documents that have been created by counsel,or have been received by counsel,or that contain direct communications from counsel are protected by the privilege.thus,the privilege applied only to communications by counsel to a client,and by a client to counsel.as in the first report,the referee concluded that t he fact that many of the disputed items contain discussion of legal matters,strategy,and status of the bad faith litigation can not be used to cloak them with either the privilege or the work product privilege for that reason alone.the referee also repeated his view that white,supra,cal d,ina,supra,d,and ranch,supra,th,d,supported his conclusion that some documents were not privileged.
the parties stipulated that zurich further production of documents be stayed pending resolution of this petition,and asked the court to adopt the referee second report and deem it a final order for purposes of writ review.the trial court issued the requested order.
zurich then sought a writ of mandate or prohibition from this court,asking that we compel the trial court to vacate its orders compelling production and to enter a new order denying discovery of what zurich regarded as privileged documents and documents revealing confidential litigation and or settlement strategies,including documents containing reserve and reinsurance information.we also were asked to direct the trial court to examine the remaining disputed documents in conformance with the principles we articulate concerning the privilege or right to privacy.
after preliminary opposition and additional briefing,we issued an order to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue directing the trial court to vacate its orders and enter a new order determining that the following material is protected from discovery portions of written internal communications between employees of zurich that reveal zurich evaluation of,or its litigation or settlement strategies concerning,the watts bad faith action which transmit or discuss underlying legal advice received by zurich for the purpose of defending against or settling the action portions of written communications from zurich to its reinsurer on the watts liability policy that reveal zurich evaluation of,or its litigation or settlement strategies concerning,the action and that also transmit or discuss underlying legal advice received by zurich for the purpose of defending against or settling the action and portions of zurich internal loss reserve documents that reveal zurich evaluation of,or its litigation or settlement strategies concerning the watts action and that also quote,summarize or discuss underlying legal advice received by zurich for the purpose of defending against or settling the action.we informed the parties that we were particularly interested in whether,and to what extent,the privilege applies to such information.
discussion 
extraordinary review of a discovery order will be granted when a ruling threatens immediate harm,such as loss of a privilege against disclosure,for which there is no other adequate remedy.superior court th,d.we review discovery orders under the abuse of discretion standard,and where the petitioner seeks relief from a discovery order that may undermine a privilege,we review the trial court order by way of extraordinary writ.citation.tien superior court th,d.a trial court abuses its discretion when it applies the wrong legal standards applicable to the issue at hand.paterno state of california th,d.doe superior court th,d abuse of discretion where trial court applied wrong standard on claim of privilege,writ relief granted see also venture law group superior court th,d writ relief granted where discovery order erroneously ordered attorney to violate privilege in answering deposition questions.
here,we are asked to decide whether the corporate privilege extends to confidential communications between agents of the client regarding legal advice and strategy,in which the corporation attorneys are not directly involved or which do not include excerpts of direct communications from the attorneys.
the privilege has been a hallmark of jurisprudence for almost years.mccormick,evidence ed,wigmore,evidence mcnaughton,pritchard sic cir,aff.baird koerner cir.the privilege authorizes a client to refuse to disclose,and to prevent others from disclosing,confidential communications between attorney and client,et clearly,the fundamental purpose behind the privilege is to safeguard the confidential relationship between clients and their attorneys so as to promote full and open discussion of the facts and tactics surrounding individual legal matters.citation.in other words,the public policy fostered by the privilege seeks to insure the right of every person to freely and fully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law,and skilled in its practice,in order that the former may have adequate advice and a proper defense.baird koerner,supra,at.solin myers th,d,quoting mitchell superior court cal d.
evidentiary privileges are creatures of statute,roberts city of palmdale cal th,d.moeller superior court cal th,d.california courts are powerless to judicially carve out exceptions.titmas superior court th,d.evidence code section provides that a client has a privilege to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication between the client and lawyer.evidence code section defines client as a person who,directly or through an authorized representative,consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity.italics added.
confidential communication between client and lawyer is defined in evidence code section to mean information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which,so far as the client is aware,discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted,and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.the privilege covers all forms of communication,including transactional advice and advice in contemplation of threatened litigation,so a party should not ordinarily formulate a discovery request seeking all documents transmitted to responding party attorney.wellpoint health networks,superior court th,d wellpoint.titmas superior court,supra,th,d.
the fundamental issue in this case is whether corporate communications not directly involving an attorney,but which discuss legal advice,come within this privilege.as we have seen,the discovery referee and trial court adopted a definition of the privilege limited to items in the claim file that contain actual copies of letters or communications from outside counsel,or documents that have been created by counsel,or received by counsel,or that contain direct communications from counsel,as indicated in the comment section of the attached listing of documents,this definition is inadequate because it fails to take into account language of evidence code section expressly contemplating that confidential communications include information transmitted to persons to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information,and those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted.section expressly includes legal opinions and advice given by a lawyer within the definition of confidential communication.
those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation include a spouse,parent,business associate,joint client or any other person who may meet with the client and his attorney in regard to a matter of joint concern.cal.law revision com.com.to,west ann.ed.benge superior court d.california courts have held that the privilege extends to communications which are intended to be confidential,if they are made to attorneys,to family members,business associates,or agents of the party or his attorneys on matters of joint concern,when disclosure of the communication is reasonably necessary to further the interest of the litigant.ina,supra,d,quoting cooke superior court d.while involvement of an unnecessary third person in communications destroys confidentiality,involvement of third persons to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary to further the purpose of the legal consultation preserves confidentiality of communication.insurance of north america superior court,supra,d at.oxy resources california llc superior court th,d,first third italics added.
a corporation is a person whose confidential communications with its attorney are protected by the privilege,chadbourne,superior court cal d,national football league properties,superior court th,d.venture law group superior court,supra,th at,d.chadbourne,superior court,supra,cal d,chadbourne is the landmark california case on corporate privilege.its analysis of the policies underlying the extension of the privilege to corporations is instructive.
the supreme court recognized that a corporation can speak only through an officer,employee,or some other natural person.certainly,this fact should not result in an absolute denial of the privilege,nor should it lead to the conclusion that the privilege attaches to every report or statement made by a corporate agent and furnished to the corporation attorney.chadbourne,cal d at.certainly the public policy behind the privilege requires that an artificial person be given equal opportunity with a natural person to communicate with its attorney,within the professional relationship,without fear that its communication will be made public.id.at.
the chadbourne court acknowledged that there are circumstances in which the privilege may be waived by the corporation thus,where the client communicates with his attorney in the presence of other persons who have no interest in the matter,or where he communicates in confidence but later breaches that confidence himself,he is held to have waived the privilege mcknew superior court cal d,marshall marshall d,and cases cited at.chadbourne,supra,cal d at.but it cautioned of course,this does not mean that the privilege is waived simply because the communication was made through an agent of the client or of the attorney citation.chadbourne,at,italics added.
in chadbourne,a husband and wife sued when the wife suffered a fall on a sidewalk which she claimed was caused by the negligence of chadbourne.a witness who had performed work on the sidewalk gave a statement to an investigator of the defendant insurer about the accident,and that statement was transmitted to the attorney for the defendant.the supreme court recognized the problem inherent when communications are passed through a corporation and its agents w here,as here,there was not a direct chain of communication,we must ask ourselves to what extent the corporation should be allowed to disseminate the privileged information and still claim confidentiality.chadbourne,supra,cal d at.
the chadbourne court identified principles governing corporate privilege in the context of an employee statement regarding circumstances giving rise to litigation against the employer.principle is that for such purpose an insurance company with which the employer carries indemnity insurance,and its duly appointed agents,are agents of the employer corporation but the extent to which this doctrine may be carried,and the number of hands through which the communication may travel without losing confidentiality must always depend on reason and the particular facts of the case.cal d at,italics added.principle states and in all corporate situations it must be borne in mind that it is the intent of the person from whom the information emanates that originally governs its confidentiality and hence its privilege thus where the employee who has not been expressly directed by his employer to make a statement,does not know that his statement is sought on a confidential basis or knowing that fact does not intend it to be confidential,the intent of the party receiving and transmitting that statement can not control the question of privilege.id.at,italics added.
the california supreme court also has cited upjohn united states,d upjohn in discussing the purpose of the privilege.roberts city of palmdale cal th,d.in upjohn,the supreme court reiterated its view that the privilege rests on the need for the advocate and counselor to know all that relates to the client reasons for seeking representation if the professional mission is to be carried out.id.at,quoting trammel united states,d.the court recognized that in a corporate setting,the privilege may extend to communications involving middle and employees in the case of the individual client the provider of information and the person who acts on the lawyer advice are one and the same.in the corporate context,however,it will frequently be employees beyond the control group as defined by the court below officers and agents responsible for directing the company actions in response to legal advice who will possess the information needed by the corporation lawyers.indeed can,by actions within the scope of their employment,embroil the corporation in serious legal difficulties,and it is only natural that these employees would have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is adequately to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential difficulties.upjohn,supra,at.
the upjohn court also acknowledged the importance of legal advice to corporate employees at all levels the attorney advice will also frequently be more significant to noncontrol group members than to those who officially sanction the advice,and the control group test makes it more difficult to convey full and frank legal advice to the employees who will put into effect the client corporation policy.see,duplan deering milliken,after the lawyer forms his or her opinion,it is of no immediate benefit to the chairman of the board or the president.it must be given to the corporate personnel who will apply it.upjohn,supra,at.
it follows that in order to implement the advice of lawyers,the advice must be communicated to others within the corporation.it is neither practical nor efficient to require that every corporate employee charged with implementing legal advice given by counsel for the corporation must directly meet with counsel or see verbatim excerpts of the legal advice given.but that is what the approach adopted by the referee and trial court would require in light of the narrow construction of evidence code section they adopted.
the upjohn court rejected an argument that a wider application of privilege in a corporate setting would create a broad zone of silence over corporate affairs.the privilege only protects disclosure of communications,it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney.upjohn,supra,at.
in state farm fire casualty superior court th,d,we considered application of the privilege in a coverage dispute between homeowners and their insurer.on reconsideration of a motion for summary judgment,the homeowners submitted two declarations by a former employee of the insurer.she disclosed litigation strategy in connection with document disclosure and witness preparation and she reiterated conversations with other state farm employees and inside and outside counsel relating to discovery and litigation strategy.the former employee had worked in a unit charged with providing liaison with the insurer outside counsel.her responsibilities included evaluating bad faith claims,responding to discovery,monitoring litigation,and advising the company and outside counsel as to which company employees would be appropriate witnesses at deposition or trial.these duties included communicating with outside counsel and other employees of the insurer concerning the litigation at issue.id.at,d.
the plaintiffs sought discovery of documents reflecting the insurer practices in handling applications for insurance and claims for coverage.we concluded that to the extent the former employee had knowledge about the practices and procedures of state farm,or the existence of claims manuals and other documents utilized in the normal operation of the business,the information was not privileged.portions of the former employee declarations contained material that was within the scope of the privilege because they reflected communications with counsel.state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at,d.in addition,we concluded that portions of the declaration describing witness preparation meetings involving outside counsel,a consultant,the witness,and a member or members of the insurer litigation unit were within the privilege.see also lipton superior court th,d privilege may preclude discovery of loss reserve and reinsurance documents even if relevant.
the american law institute also recognizes the need for corporate employees to have access to privileged material in order to implement legal advice.section of the restatement third of law governing lawyers restatement provides when a client is a corporation,the privilege extends to a communication that otherwise qualifies as privileged under is between an agent of the organization and a privileged person as defined in concerns a legal matter of interest to the organization and is disclosed only to a privileged persons as defined in and b other agents of the organization who reasonably need to know of the communication in order to act for the organization.italics added.the restatement employs a broad definition of privileged persons privileged persons within the meaning of are the client including a prospective client,the client lawyer,agents of either who facilitate communications between them,and agents of the lawyer who facilitate the representation.rest d,supra.comment f to section explains that a client confidential agent for communication is determined by examining a number of factors,including the client need for the third person presence to communicate effectively with the lawyer or to understand and act upon the lawyer advice,com.f,italics added.
comment g to section of the restatement addresses application of the privilege to communications involving corporate personnel the limitation of subsection b permits disclosing privileged communications to other agents of the organization who reasonably need to know of the privileged communication in order to act for the organization in the matter.those agents include persons who are responsible for accepting or rejecting a lawyer advice on behalf of the organization or for acting on legal assistance,such as general legal advice,provided by the lawyer.access of such persons to privileged communications is not limited to direct
