the issue presented in this appeal is whether the for subscribers of reciprocal insurance exchanges may be sued by the subscribers to recover alleged excessive fees the collected in breach of their fiduciary duty to the subscribers.the fees were collected from premiums the subscribers paid to the exchanges.the premiums were based upon rates approved by the commissioner of the department of insurance the commissioner.the contend the fees the aif fees are a component of that approved rate and,therefore,the subscribers lawsuit is barred under walker allstate indemnity th,d walker which held that insurance code section precludes claims challenging an approved the filed rate doctrine,because the lawsuit improperly seeks to recoup premiums charged in accordance with an approved rate.we hold that neither walker,section,nor the filed rate doctrine apply to this lawsuit against the,because the are entities distinct from the exchanges,with fiduciary relationships with each of the subscribers.accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment in favor of the and direct the trial court to enter an order denying defendants motion and granting plaintiff motion to summarily adjudicate defendants exhaustion of administrative remedies affirmative defense.
background 
before discussing the allegations of the complaint and the procedural aspects of this case,we must first provide some background on reciprocal insurance exchanges and insurance rate regulation.

insurance rate regulation in california 
before,insurance regulation in california operated under the open competition system,under which rates were set by insurers without prior or subsequent approval by the insurance commissioner.century ins.garamendi cal th,d,century.that changed after the general election in november,when the voters of california approved an initiative that was designated proposition.proposition required insurers to reduce their rates immediately,and instituted a prior approval system,which requires insurers to submit a rate application to the commissioner for approval before changing any rates.id.at,d,subd.b.under the new system,insurers may charge only approved rates,subd.c,although they are permitted to return savings or unabsorbed premiums to policyholders see also lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d directors of interinsurance exchanges may,but are not required to,return savings or credits to the subscribers delos farmers insurance group,supra,d at.if the amount of premiums deposited is not fully required for the purposes mentioned,to pay losses and costs,and to maintain reserves and surpluses,the excess,called savings,is returned in whole or in part as dividends.
among other things,proposition enacted a statutory scheme governing the rate approval process,which provides for hearings before an administrative law judge in certain circumstances and allows for consumer participation see.the key provision is found in subdivision a of section.that provision states that rates can not be approved or remain in effect if they are excessive,inadequate,unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of chapter of division,part of the insurance code,governing rates and rating organizations hereafter chapter,subd.a.
to implement the rate setting component of proposition,the commissioner adopted regulations establishing the process and policies to be employed to determine whether rates are excessive or inadequate,tit,et the rate regulations define as excessive a rate that is expected to yield the reasonably efficient insurer a profit that exceeds a fair return on the investment used to provide the insurance in light of the competing interests of consumers in lower prices and of investors in prices that yield high returns and the fact that insurance is imbued with the public interest and is sometimes legally required,tit.they define as inadequate a rate under which a reasonably efficient insurer is not expected to have the opportunity to earn a fair return on the investment that is used to provide the insurance in light of the considerations identified above,tit.lastly,they define a fair return as the profit that an investor can reasonably expect to earn from an investment in a business other than insurance subject to regulation thereunder presenting investment risks comparable to the risks presented by insurance subject thereto,tit.century,supra,cal th at,d.
the regulations also include ratemaking formulas,which calculate the maximum and minimum permitted earned premiums for each line of insurance offered by the insurer,tit,century,supra,cal th at,d.the formulas take into account the insurer losses,expenses,ancillary and investment income,as well as certain factors such as a profit factor that incorporate generic determinations made by the commissioner that apply to all insurers,tit,through.century,supra,cal th at,d.the formula is designed to yield a premium that the insurer should receive from its insureds in order to earn a sum amounting to the reasonable cost of providing insurance and the capital used and useful for providing insurance multiplied by a fair rate of return.century,supra,cal th at,d.
under the prior approval system now in operation,the insurer is free to choose any rate that is neither excessive nor inadequate and submit an application for approval.century,supra,cal th at,d.based upon the information provided by the insurer,the commissioner applies the ratemaking formulas to determine the maximum and minimum permitted earned premium,and must approve the rate if it falls between them.id.at,d,see also id.at,d.any person may request a hearing before an administrative law judge on a rate change application or an approved rate alleged to be excessive or inadequate or otherwise in violation of chapter.see also,tit.the hearing has two purposes one is to determine whether the insurer has properly applied the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions,including generic determinations,in calculating the maximum or minimum permitted earned premium,tit,subd.b.the other is to determine whether the resulting maximum or minimum permitted earned premium should be adjusted,tit,subd.b.century,supra,cal th at,d.following the hearing,the commissioner may adopt,amend,or reject the decision of the administrative law judge.the commissioner decision is subject to judicial review under an independent judgment standard of review.
as part of the change in the insurance rate regulation system,proposition added two statutes to chapter regarding the applicability of other laws to the business of insurance and consumer participation in the rate making process.section provides in part that t he business of insurance shall be subject to the laws of california applicable to any other business,including,but not limited to,the unruh civil rights act sections to,inclusive,of the civil code,and the antitrust and unfair business practices laws parts commencing with section and commencing with section of division of the business and professions code,subd.a.section provides in part that a ny person may initiate or intervene in any proceeding permitted or established pursuant to this chapter,challenge any action of the commissioner under this article,and enforce any provision of this article,subd.a.
but even though proposition repealed several sections of chapter that were inconsistent with the new statutory scheme,it left intact a provision of the former is at issue in this case.section provides no act done,action taken or agreement made pursuant to the authority conferred by this chapter shall constitute a violation of or grounds for prosecution or civil proceedings under any other law of this state heretofore or hereafter enacted which does not specifically refer to insurance.this statute was enacted as part of the insurance regulatory act of,to exempt insurers from federal regulatory legislation,including antitrust laws,and to authorize cooperation between insurers in rate making and other related matters.donabedian mercury ins.th,d.
with this background in mind,we turn to the facts of this case.
factual and procedural background of this case 
plaintiff and appellant benjamin fogel holds automobile,homeowners,and umbrella insurance policies issued through farmers insurance exchange,fire insurance exchange,and truck insurance exchange collectively the exchanges.the exchanges are reciprocal insurance exchanges.
in august,fogel,on behalf of all policyholders of the exchanges,filed a class action lawsuit against farmers group,fgi which fogel alleged was the for the policyholders of all three exchanges and the exchanges.the original complaint alleged that the exchanges required all policyholders to appoint fgi as their and that fgi breached its fiduciary duty to the policyholders and committed fraud by,among other things,charging excessive aif fees.the original complaint also alleged that fgi and the exchanges engaged in unlawful unfair business practices within the meaning of business and professions code section et,based upon two exchanges requiring policyholders to appoint fgi as their and fgi charging excessive aif well as other conduct.
the first status conference was held in march.at that status conference,the parties agreed that defendants would file a motion for summary judgment summary adjudication by june,and that discovery would be stayed in the interim.the trial court calendared august,to hear defendants motion,to give fogel an opportunity to review the motion to determine what,if any,discovery he might need for his opposition.
defendants filed their motion on june.in it,defendants emphasized that fgi,doing business as farmers underwriters association,was only for farmers insurance exchange policyholders,and that truck underwriters association and fire underwriters association serve as for policyholders in truck insurance exchange and fire insurance exchange,respectively.one of the other arguments they made in the motion was based upon the form subscription agreement that defendants asserted each of the policyholders signed when they applied for insurance.defendants submitted with its motion copies of the form subscription agreement used by each of the exchanges.each agreement provided that the relevant entity was appointed as the policyholder,described the scope of its power to act on behalf of the subscriber,and stated that the subscriber agreed that the entity would collect a certain percentage of the premium as compensation for acting as defendants argued that fgi did not breach its fiduciary duty because it was undisputed that it collected less than percent of the premiums as aif fees during the period at issue.
upon receiving defendants motion,fogel attorneys sought to obtain copies of any subscription agreements purportedly signed by fogel.fogel apparently did not recall signing any such agreement,and defendants did not produce any in response to fogel informal request.in light of the apparent absence of signed subscription agreements,fogel sought leave to amend the complaint to add allegations regarding the agreements.he also sought to join fire underwriters association and truck underwriters association as defendants to ensure that all of the proper parties would be included.finally,he asked to dismiss the exchanges and withdraw the fraud claim in order to streamline the case to permit the parties and court to focus on the central issues before the court.the trial court granted fogel request to amend the complaint,over defendants objection.
the first amended complaint,which is the complaint at issue in this appeal,alleges that although all three have a form subscription agreement containing a power of attorney,defendants do not actually require the policyholder to sign the agreement.the amended complaint also alleges that fgi,which includes its subsidiaries fire underwriters association and truck underwriters association,as well as fgi doing business as farmers underwriters association,earned billions of dollars in aif fees in,and,resulting in profit margins of between percent and percent and a profit margin of percent for the first nine months of.
the amended complaint asserts two causes of action on behalf of all policyholders in the exchanges.first,it alleges that each of the breached its fiduciary duty owed to the policyholders by collecting excessive aif fees.second,it alleges that the practices of collecting aif fees without a signed power of attorney and collecting excessive fees are unlawful unfair within the meaning of business and professions code section et.the amended complaint seeks disgorgement,fee forfeiture,restitution,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.
a week after defendants filed their answer to the amended complaint,fogel moved for summary adjudication of four issues that he was entitled to recover the aif fees defendants collected because he had not signed a power of attorney appointing them his that his claims were not barred by various sections of the insurance code and code of regulations,or by the approved rate rule that his claims were not barred by the exhaustion of administrative remedies rule and that his claims should not be abated or dismissed under the primary jurisdiction rule.the latter three issues were raised by defendants as affirmative defenses.the evidence in support of fogel motion included his declaration,in which he stated that he did not sign a subscription agreement or power of attorney in connection with the insurance policies he holds from the exchanges and he did not authorize defendants to collect any fee in connection with those policies.
in opposition to fogel motion,defendants presented several documents that purport to have fogel signature on them,including two applications for insurance.one of those applications appears to be a application for homeowners insurance,marked closed,that seems to include a subscription agreement the document in the record is for the most part illegible,and the other is an application for personal umbrella liability insurance with truck insurance exchange,dated,with a signed subscription agreement.defendants also submitted declarations from two agents for the exchanges,who were fogel insurance agents from to and from to the present.each agent stated that it was his practice to ask the insured to sign all required documents related to insurance policies issued by the exchanges,including the subscription agreements 
defendants also filed their own motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.their primary arguments were that california law does not permit recovery of premiums based upon approved rates and the lack of a signed subscription agreement does not entitle fogel to a refund of the aif fees defendants collected because the agreement was incorporated into his policies,or because he waived is estopped to avoid the terms of the agreement in addition,defendants presented issues for summary adjudication,in which they sought to separately adjudicate the claims against each defendant and to adjudicate the claims of each subset of putative class members,policyholders who signed a subscription agreement,policyholders who did not sign one,claims against one of the exchanges by members who did not hold policies in that exchange.
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied fogel motion for summary adjudication.the court found that fogel lawsuit challenges an approved rate and seeks a partial refund of premiums,and therefore is precluded under walker,supra,th,d.in addition,the court found there was a triable issue of fact regarding whether fogel signed any subscription agreements.the court concluded that the issue was moot in light of walker,but in any event,the issue was irrelevant because the subscription agreements were incorporated by reference into his policies.the court entered judgment against fogel.
fogel appeals from the judgment,challenging both the grant of summary judgment and the denial of his motion for summary adjudication as to two issues regarding whether he signed subscription agreements and whether exhaustion of administrative remedies applies.defendants,challenging the trial court ruling allowing fogel to file an amended complaint.
discussion 
fogel appeal from the summary judgment 
as noted,defendants motion for summary judgment raised two issues of law based upon undisputed facts whether fogel claims are barred by walker,section,the filed rate doctrine and assuming fogel did not sign a subscription agreement,whether his claim that he did not authorize defendants to collect aif fees is barred by waiver,estoppel,or incorporation by reference rules.the trial court ruled in favor of defendants on both issues,which are subject to independent review on appeal.city of malibu santa monica mountains conservancy th,d.we hold that fogel claims are not barred and reverse the summary judgment.by its plain language,section does not apply here because chapter does not authorize the collection of aif fees,and a key distinction between our state prior approval system and the federal filed rate system precludes application of the filed rate doctrine.in addition,although the language of the policies is insufficient to find the subscription agreements were incorporated by reference,it is sufficient to find that fogel waived or is estopped to argue that defendants are not entitled to some amount of aif fees.
walker and section 
in walker,plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against more than insurers and the insurance commissioner,seeking damages or disgorgement of allegedly excessive premiums that the insurers had been authorized to collect.walker,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs alleged the commissioner failed to make the generic determinations and adopt the factors needed to apply the ratemaking formulas to determine whether rates were within the range allowed by section,subdivision a.id.at,d.they supported their claims that the rates were excessive with allegations regarding industry trends and rates of return,and sought the redetermination of all rates in effect since september,and a refund of the premiums collected in excess of the redetermined maximum permitted earned premium.ibid.
the court of appeal held that section barred plaintiffs claims,stating if section has any meaning whatsoever,the section must bar claims based upon an insurer charging a rate that has been approved by the commissioner.walker,supra,th at,d.it pointed to the language of the statute,which states that an action taken pursuant to the authority conferred by chapter can not constitute grounds for civil proceedings,and reasoned that w hatever else chapter does,it definitely confers authority upon the commissioner to approve rates.moreover,an insurer action of collecting premiums consistent with an approved rate is certainly done pursuant to the authority conferred on the commissioner by chapter.id.at,d.thus,the court concluded that plaintiffs civil action challenging the approved rates was barred by section.
fogel and amicus contend that walker misconstrued section,arguing that the statute does not apply to cases involving the conduct of a single actor.their argument is based upon the origin of section was enacted to prevent the application of antitrust laws to concerted action among insurers that was deemed necessary for making insurance the supreme court opinion in state comp.ins.fund superior court cal th,d,in which the court interpreted a statute that applied to workers compensation insurance and was virtually identical to section.after examining the history of the enactment of both statutes,the supreme court held that the workers compensation insurance statute immunizes insurers only from antitrust or other claims related to cooperation between insurers,rating organizations,and advisory organizations in the context of ratemaking.id.at,d.fogel and amicus argue this same reasoning applies to section.we note,however,that the supreme court did not disapprove walker.rather,the court distinguished it,explaining that the plaintiffs in walker were attempting to challenge the method by which the rates were set.id.at,d.
we need not resolve whether section applies to immunize only concerted action,because we find that fogel claims are not within the scope of section immunity under the plain language of the statute.fogel alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duty as and committed unfair business practices by collecting excessive aif fees collecting aif fees without a signed subscription agreement.section states that only those civil proceedings based upon an act done,action taken or agreement made pursuant to the authority conferred by chapter are precluded.thus,fogel claims will be precluded only if defendants collection of aif fees is an act done or action taken under the authority conferred by chapter.
defendants do not identify any specific provision of chapter that authorizes them to collect aif fees.in fact,chapter does not refer to at all.instead,defendants argue that their collection of aif fees is authorized by chapter because those fees came out of the insurance premiums that fogel and other insureds paid to the exchanges and are listed as expenses in documents the exchanges submitted to the commissioner as part of their rate change applications,which were approved.
defendants reasoning is flawed.the mechanism by which defendants collect the aif a percentage of the premiums paid to the not dispositive.defendants right to collect fees from premiums does not arise from any authority granted under chapter.it arises from their agreements with each subscriber to act as the subscriber the terms of those agreements are not regulated by chapter indeed,there is no requirement that the terms even be disclosed during the rate approval process.no doubt,the collection of premiums by the exchanges based upon approved rates is an act authorized by chapter.but the fact that the agreements between defendants and the subscribers allow defendants to pay themselves aif fees from those premiums does not render defendants collection of aif fees an act authorized by chapter.
nor does the fact that the approved rate change applications disclosed expenses that included the amounts collected as aif fees render defendants collection of those fees an act authorized by chapter.as a preliminary matter,we note that defendants are incorrect when they repeatedly at oral the documents submitted in support of the exchanges rate change applications listed the amounts the collected in aif fees.in fact,the aif fees are not listed anywhere in the voluminous documents submitted to the commissioner for approval.those documents simply list total expense amounts under the designations other acquisitions,field supervision,and collection expenses incurred and general expenses incurred for the various lines of insurance.apparently the amount of aif fees is included in the total expense amounts listed,but in no way is it identifiable as a separate expense item relating to aif fees,management fees,or any other similar designation.nor is there any evidence that the commissioner would interpret the expense listings as designating aif fees.moreover,even if the documents clearly listed the aif fees as such,the commissioner approval of the rate change applications does not authorize defendants to collect the aif fees.
as noted,under the chapter rate approval process,the commissioner determines whether a proposed rate is excessive by determining whether the rate is expected to yield the reasonably efficient insurer a profit that exceeds a fair return on the investment used to provide the insurance,tit,italics added.in other words,the purpose of the approval process is to examine and regulate the insurer expected profit to ensure a fair,rather than excessive,rate of return.nothing in chapter directs or authorizes the commissioner to examine or regulate an expected profit or rate of return defendants argument for immunity fails because they treat the insurer and the as a single entity that is regulated by the commissioner,rather than separate and distinct entities,only one of which is regulated.while it might make sense to preclude lawsuits by policyholders challenging an insurer rate of return as excessive,because that is something regulated by the commissioner,it makes little sense to immunize the unregulated from a lawsuit by a purportedly excessive rate of return.
the filed rate doctrine 
defendants also argue that,because california prior approval system is analogous to the federal filed rate doctrine,fogel lawsuit is barred because the relief he seeks is effectively a premium refund.we disagree,because defendants underlying the two systems are incorrect.
the filed rate doctrine derives from the requirements of the federal communications act of.under the act,a common carrier is required to file with the fcc and keep open for public inspection schedules also known as tariffs showing all charges and showing the classifications,practices,and regulations affecting such charges.citation.under this doctrine,once a carrier tariff is approved by the fcc,the terms of the federal tariff are considered to be the law and to therefore conclusively and exclusively enumerate the rights and liabilities as between the carrier and the customer.not only is a carrier forbidden from charging rates other than as set out in its filed tariff,but customers are also charged with notice of the terms and rates set out in that filed tariff and may not bring an action against a carrier that would invalidate,alter or add to the terms of the filed tariff.citation.thus,the filed rate doctrine bars not only lawsuits challenging filed rates or seeking to enforce rates different from the filed rates,but also lawsuits challenging services,billing or other practices when the challenge,if successful,would effectively result in a modification of the filed tariff through the award of damages.citations.gallivan v.at t th,d.
although there are some similarities between the federal tariff system and california prior approval system governing insurance rates,there is a key distinction.under the federal system,once the filed tariff is approved,the carrier must charge that tariff and can not offer rebates to its customers.see,american telephone telegraph central office telephone,d duggal capital communications services,th,d.it logically follows that customers can not be allowed to effectively obtain rebates through lawsuits seeking damages.but under california system regulating insurance rates,insurers are allowed to rebate excess premiums to their policyholders.thus,even if the filed rate doctrine applied in the context of a rate approved by a state regulatory agency defendants have pointed to no cases in which it was,it nevertheless would have no application here.
waiver,estoppel,and incorporation by reference 
the other issue raised in defendants motion for summary judgment addressed fogel claim that he was entitled to recover all of the aif fees defendants collected because he did not sign any subscription agreements.the trial court found that fogel authorized defendants to collect aif fees because the subscription agreements were incorporated by reference into fogel policies,and that fogel waived or is estopped from complaining that he did not authorize the collection of those fees.on appeal,fogel contends the evidence shows that the subscription agreement was not incorporated by reference into the policies,and that waiver and estoppel do not apply.although we agree the evidence does not support the trial court finding that the subscription agreement was incorporated by reference,the evidence does support the court finding regarding waiver and estoppel.the latter finding does not justify summary judgment in favor of defendants,however,because it does not resolve whether defendants collected excessive fees in breach of their fiduciary duty to fogel.
the evidence presented to the trial court established that each of the policies issued to fogel contained the following language this policy is made and accepted in consideration of your premium payment to us.it is also in consideration of the power of attorney you signed as part of your application and the information you gave to us on your application.some of your statements actually become a part of the policy which we call the declarations.when you signed the power of attorney authority on your application,you authorized the relevant to execute interinsurance policies between you and other subscribers.
defendants argued in support of their summary judgment motion that this language incorporated the subscription agreement into the policy,citing shaw regents of university of california th,d.as the court in shaw explained,in order for a document to be incorporated by reference into a contract,the reference must be clear and unequivocal,the reference must be called to the attention of the other party and he must consent thereto,and the terms of the incorporated document must be known or easily available to the contracting parties.id.at,d.defendants contended that all of the elements were met in this case because fogel is deemed to have read his policies hadland nn investors life ins.th,d,the reference to the subscription agreement was clear,and the subscription agreement was easily available to fogel.
fogel argued in the trial court,and argues here,that the subscription agreement could not be incorporated by reference into the policies for several reasons.we need address only two.
first,fogel contends the department of insurance requires a appointing an for a reciprocal insurance exchange to be in writing and signed by the subscriber,and forbids policy language indicating that a subscriber is deemed to have complied with that requirement by accepting the policy.as support for his contention,fogel points to a memorandum from the commissioner,in which the commissioner states,it is a fundamental principle of law and the unvarying policy of the insurance department that each and every subscriber to a reciprocal exchange must execute a power of attorney upon a form approved by this department and in every case in writing signed by the subscriber.as to signature this means literally by the subscriber no policy forms of reciprocal exchanges are to contain any provision to the effect that by the acceptance of a policy the subscriber is deemed to have complied with the above stated requirements as to the actual execution in writing of a power of attorney.underlining omitted.while this appears to be an internal directive to department employees regarding a special investigation to be conducted,the approval of policy forms,and other suggests that the subscription agreements in this case should not be found to be incorporated by reference into fogel policies,it is insufficient to establish that such incorporation is precluded as a matter of law.fogel points to no applicable statute or regulation that requires the to be in writing,and we have found none.
second,fogel argues that,in any event,the policy language at issue does not satisfy the elements required to incorporate by reference the subscription agreement.we agree.contrary to defendants assertions,the policy language does not clearly and unequivocally refer to the subscription agreement.it refers to a.moreover,it states only that the authorized the to execute interinsurance policies between the policyholder and other subscribers.thus,the reference not only did not identify the subscription agreement by its title,it inaccurately stated the scope of authority the agreement gave to the.therefore,we hold the subscription agreement was not incorporated by reference into the policies.see chan drexel burnham lambert d.
this is not to say that th
