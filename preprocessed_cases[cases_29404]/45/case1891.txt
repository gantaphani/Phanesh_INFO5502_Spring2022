i.the district court properly dismissed suit as an impermissible attempt to split a cause of action barred by res judicata.
splitting the cause of action 
to determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment,federal courts look to state law.palomar mobilehome park ass city of san marcos,cir.res judicata precludes parties or their privies from relitigating a cause of action that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.rice crow,th,d internal quotation marks omitted.since an,its subrogated privies,see ferraro cal.gas,d,the privity requirement is met here.ami dismissal of its california superior court complaint with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits.rice,th at,d.the only disputed issue is whether action against crest is the same cause of to vindicate the same primary right as ami action against crest in state court.
the district court properly dismissed suit as an impermissible attempt to split a single cause of action.partially subrogated its rights to ami.disputes this and claims that ami was acting as a partial subrogee of kr precision,which was the only entity which received atlantic mutual funds.pl.br.at emphasis in original.not only is this a misunderstanding of subrogation but it contradicts own complaint,which alleged that ami was its insurance carrier and that plaintiff received partial indemnity from ami for the identification,recall,and return of finished baseplates manufactured,distributed and shipped by plaintiff and for suspension assemblies manufactured by krp incorporating finished baseplates manufactured by plaintiff.compl.
thus,it is clear that had an insurance policy with ami and pursuant to the insurance policy,ami paid for loss that sustained as a result of crest defective air dryers and filters,and loss that krp sustained as a result of receiving defective baseplates from.we are persuaded by crest argument that 
when an insurer settles a claim brought against its insured,it becomes subrogated to the rights that its insured may have against third parties.it does not become subrogated to the rights of the insured third party claimant.this is no less true when the benefit that the insured receives from its insurer is a payment directly to a third party to avoid the third party claim.atlantic mutua
