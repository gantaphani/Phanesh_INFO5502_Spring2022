linda pralutsky filed an action against metropolitan life insurance company metlife under a b seeking to enforce a claimed right to benefits under metlife disability plan.after both sides moved for summary judgment,the district court granted pralutsky motion and ordered metlife to pay benefits to pralutsky and to reinstate her in the plan as a participant entitled to benefits.the court also awarded attorneys fees to pralutsky.metlife appeals,and we reverse.
in,linda pralutsky was a health unit coordinator at the woodwinds health campus,where her duties included clerical and receptionist activities,such as answering phones,greeting visitors,filing,and distributing mail.in january,pralutsky began suffering from chest pain and leg weakness,and reported seeing spots in front of her eyes.she was hospitalized with these symptoms,but tests performed during her stay did not lead to a diagnosis.although she reported gradual improvement after leaving the hospital,in july,she began suffering the same symptoms again and was for evaluation.again,no diagnosis was made,but on july,pralutsky ceased working.she applied to metlife for disability benefits in november.
in support of her application for disability benefits,pralutsky was required by metlife plan to provide documented proof of her disability,and proof was defined to include the date disability started,the cause of disability,and the prognosis of the disability.at.to meet this requirement,pralutsky provided an attending physician statement by her primary care physician,omar tveten,and a supplementary statement by a neurologist,charles ormiston,both of these documents generally attested to pralutsky inability to work ormiston opined that she simply ca work,but that he was hopeful that in weeks she be better,and tveten stated that she was unable to do duties and indicated that he had not advised her to return to work.at.both documents also reported pralutsky subjective complaints of pain.neither physician provided any lab results,office notes,or other clinical findings with the forms,although both forms requested copies of such materials.
in addition to the supplementary form,ormiston wrote a letter to tveten,which was provided to metlife,describing pralutsky complaints and examination results.ormiston described pralutsky pain as starting in her legs,then moving to her arms,or starting in her hips and moving down her legs.he reported that s he is better lying on her back than on her side,that i t is worse at night,and that she wakes up feeling totally exhausted.at.on examination,however,ormiston reported that her cranial nerves were normal motor strength,tone,and bulk were normal reflexes were symmetric and cerebellar,sensory,station,and gait testing were all normal,except that pain interfered with pralutsky ability to walk on her toes and heels.testing to that point,including a bone scan and abdominal pelvic ct scan,was all negative.ormiston opined that the symptoms seem to fit best in a chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia category,but that he would do an mri scan to make sure we are not missing a demyelinating disease or similar problem.at.
after the mri,ormiston wrote to tveten again to inform him that the mri showed one demyelinating lesion,which raised suspicions of multiple sclerosis,but that mri scans of her cervical and thoracic spine were essentially negative.at.he also noted a thyroid lesion,but left evaluation of that to tveten.after a spinal fluid evaluation,ormiston wrote to tveten a third time and indicated that,with her completely normal spinal fluid evaluation,he was of the opinion that pralutsky did not have multiple sclerosis.he suggested that she might pursue a sleep study or further trials with medication,but believed that because there was no neurologic abnormality,he had nothing further to offer her as a neurologist.at.
pralutsky claim was also supported by several handwritten notes from tveten to metlife indicating that pralutsky was disabled and that she had seen specialists but had not yet been definitively diagnosed with a particular illness.tveten also reported that pralutsky suffered from recurrent pain,migratory in nature and feelings of extreme weakness,such that she could not force herself any more than two hours out of the day.at.
in addition to her doctors opinions,pralutsky submitted a form that she filled out independently,which reported weakness,fatigue,pain,and severe headache,and stated that she had about hrs of energy each day.at.pralutsky indicated that she was able to do some housework,but that it might take her all day to dust and vacuum,and that her children helped her run the household.at.she indicated that she did not have sleeping problems,but also noted that head pain recently had prevented her from sleeping well.in two telephone conversations with representatives from metlife,pralutsky repeated her complaints of pain and weakness,and again noted that she needed assistance from her family in household chores.she also indicated that she takes walks,and that she drove her children to and from school,and cooked when feeling energetic enough.pralutsky was not using medicine for her pain,was not taking drugs,and was not otherwise treating her symptoms.
metlife representative advised pralutsky to seek a referral to a rheumatologist and to consider whether physical therapy or aquatherapy would be appropriate.after its conversations with pralutsky,metlife faxed a fibromyalgia initial functional assessment form to ormiston,seeking specific examination information about symptoms,severity,and treatment.metlife also inquired about pralutsky treatment,whether she had reached her maximum medical improvement,and whether ormiston believed she might return to work gradually.ormiston did not answer those inquiries or return the assessment form.
after reviewing the information from pralutsky and her doctors,metlife denied pralutsky claim in a letter dated december.after summarizing the evidence that it had received,metlife wrote that 
w e are unable to substantiate disability so severe to preclude you from returning to your own occupation on a full time basis throughout the elimination period and beyond.medical documentation does not support severity of diagnosis for fibromyalgia nor does it support you are aggressively treating and under appropriate care for said diagnosis.therefore,benefits are denied.
on january,pralutsky wrote to metlife indicating that she wished to appeal the denial of benefits,and metlife responded that in order to support your claim of disability,we will need treatment records from your treating physicians that indicate your current treating diagnosis,restrictions and limitations,and ongoing current treatment plans.metlife also added that your doctor must provide his clinical findings and rationale which supports your claim that you are functionally precluded from performing your own occupation for any employer.at.
in response to this request for more information,tveten submitted another handwritten opinion letter to metlife,in which he again suggested that pralutsky was suffering from pain and fatigue that left her totally disabled.he indicated that the working diagnosis was fibromyalgia but that there were elements of chronic fatigue syndrome,and that and had been tried without success.at.no other medical information or clinical reports were submitted.
metlife sought an independent review of pralutsky entire file by a physician consultant,chou.chou,a physician in internal medicine and rheumatology,was asked to define pralutsky current level of functionality,to address whether her functional ability was sustained by clinical documentation,and to opine whether her diagnosis was supported by clinical objective findings.
chou reviewed pralutsky file and responded that e ven though there is no documentation of the typical multiple tender points more than out of fibromyalgia tender points the diagnosis of fibromyalgia is supported,based on the description of her symptoms and the exclusion of other diagnoses.at.but in chou view,this diagnosis was insufficient to show that pralutsky was totally disabled.chou opined that she had only a mild impairment,and that the record did not contain any objective medical findings to support more significant impairment.at.therefore,chou believed that pralutsky should still be able to perform her current sedentary work.in addition,chou noted that she was receiving appropriate and regular medical care,but that she has not exhausted all of her treatment options and she has not reached maximum medical improvement.id.
in a letter dated april,metlife informed pralutsky that after review,it was upholding the previous denial of benefits.metlife said that pralutsky had self reported significant functional inability to work,but that this was without substantiation from the medical records.at.aside from her complaints,metlife found there were essentially no objective medical findings to support the pathology in the musculosketal sic or neurological systems.id.
pralutsky then filed the instant action,alleging that metlife breached its fiduciary duties under the employee retirement income security act of erisa the district court found that metlife had committed an egregious procedural irregularity in denying benefits to pralutsky,and therefore reviewed the denial of benefits without the deference normally accorded to a plan administrator.the court concluded that substantial evidence bordering on a preponderance the heightened review standard it not support the denial of benefits,and ordered metlife to pay benefits,including benefits and prejudgment interest.after a motion by pralutsky,the court also awarded attorneys fees and costs to pralutsky in the amount of.
under erisa,a plan participant may bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.where the plan reserves discretionary authority to the plan administrator,we apply a deferential standard of review,considering whether the administrator abused its discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d king hartford life accident ins,cir en banc.we have said that this deferential standard is not applicable,however,if the claimant demonstrates that a serious procedural irregularity existed and caused a serious breach of the plan administrator fiduciary duty to the claimant.buttram cent.states,areas health welfare fund,cir.we review de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment.
pralutsky argues that metlife committed a serious procedural irregularity in her case by insisting that she provide objective evidence of her disability.according to pralutsky,this requirement was not justified by the plan terms,and therefore indicates that the administrator decision was arbitrary and not entitled to deference.the district court agreed,and required instead that the record contain substantial evidence bordering on a preponderance to support the denial of benefits.pralutsky,d at.
we disagree that metlife reliance on the absence of objective evidence for its denial of benefits constitutes a serious procedural irregularity that justifies abandoning the deference normally accorded an administrator decision under erisa.when we introduced this concept,we explained that under the common law of trusts,which is our guide in reviewing the benefits determinations of erisa plan trustees,heightened scrutiny may apply where the plan trustee labors under a conflict of interest,or where,in the exercise of his power,he acts dishonestly,or from an improper motive,or he fails to use judgment in reaching his decision.buttram,at internal citations omitted.when we speak of procedural irregularity in this context,therefore,we refer to the sorts of external factors that are sufficient under the common law of trusts to call for application of a less deferential standard of review.before such heightened review applies,the claimant must show that a serious procedural irregularity existed,which caused a serious breach of the plan trustee fiduciary duty to the plan beneficiary.id.
while the parties hotly contest whether the administrator decision in this case was reasonable,we are not persuaded that the decision was made without reflection or judgment,such that it was the product of an arbitrary decision or the plan administrator whim.buttram,at restatement second of trusts cmt.h.this is not a case where the plan trustee failed to inquire into the relevant circumstances at issue,or never offered a written decision that can be reviewed,or committed irregularities so severe that the court has a total lack of faith in the integrity of the decision making process.buttram,at.what we have here is a dispute over whether the administrator reasonably interpreted the plan to require objective medical evidence to prove the claimant disability,and whether the record supports the administrator exercise of judgment that benefits should be denied based on the evidence that was presented.the administrator right or wrong,reasonable or not made without knowledge of or inquiry into the relevant circumstances and merely as a result of its arbitrary decision or whim.restatement second of trusts cmt.h.the normal standard of review is thus appropriate.
under that standard,we consider whether the administrator abused its is,whether its interpretation of the plan was reasonable,and whether its decision was supported by substantial evidence.king,at.we have said that in some circumstances a plan administrator insistence on objective medical evidence can be unreasonable.in house paul revere life insurance,cir,we concluded that it was an abuse of discretion for a plan administrator to insist on objective medical evidence of heart disease,where the plan documents advised only that the administrator may require medical exams or written proof of financial loss,and stipulated that if a medical exam was required,the administrator would pay for it.id.at emphasis added.there may be other cases in which objective evidence simply can not be obtained,and it would be unreasonable for an administrator to demand the impossible.see brigham sun life of,cir.and it may well be unreasonable for an administrator to expect a claimant to provide objective evidence if the administrator does not provide an adequate explanation of the information sought.
we have held elsewhere,however,that i t is not unreasonable for a plan administrator to deny benefits based upon a lack of objective evidence,mcgee reliance standard life insurance,cir,and house does not state a universal rule that an administrator is precluded from insisting on objective medical evidence when it is appropriate under the terms of a plan and the circumstances of the case.see also hunt metro.life ins,cir per curiam upholding a denial of benefits where objective medical evidence did not support claimed disability from restless leg syndrome and related problems coker metro.life ins,cir finding denial of benefits not unreasonable where objective medical evidence did not support claimant contention that he was disabled by diabetes and syncopal episodes.the plan in this case states that the claimant must provide,at her own expense,documented proof of her disability,and that if the claimant does not provide satisfactory documentation within days after the date we ask for it,the claim may be denied.at.the plan does not define what sort of proof or documentation is sufficient to establish a disability,and the administrator is entitled to define those ambiguous terms as long as its interpretation is reasonable.see king,at finley special agents mut.benefit ass n,cir.in view of our precedent affirming the reasonableness of a plan administrator denying benefits based on a lack of objective evidence,we can not say,as a general matter,that it is unreasonable for metlife to interpret the plan to require provision of objective evidence as part of the proof and documentation that a claimant must submit.
having examined the circumstances of this particular case,we also believe it was reasonable on the facts presented here for metlife to request clinical and objective evidence,and to deny the claim when pralutsky failed to provide it.metlife communications with pralutsky support its contention
