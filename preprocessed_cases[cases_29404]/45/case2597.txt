in this insurance coverage dispute,stuchbery others syndicate,as underwriters at lloyds,london subscribing to policy no.ba stuchbery,insured m m luxury shuttle,m m,a shuttle service operator,and mostafa tehrani tehrani,an officer and director of m m,under a general liability policy.stuchbery defended and ultimately indemnified these insureds in a lawsuit filed by a passenger the victim who alleged she had been sexually assaulted by m m driver.redland insurance company redland also insured m m and tehrani under a business automobile policy and,following the conclusion of the passenger lawsuit the underlying action,stuchbery filed an action against redland,seeking reimbursement or equitable contribution for its defense costs and indemnification payment.
stuchbery appeals a summary judgment entered in favor of redland after the trial court determined that redland had no duty to defend or indemnify m m or tehrani in the underlying action,and therefore stuchbery was not entitled to reimbursement or equitable contribution from redland.we conclude that,as a matter of law,the victim injuries did not result from the use of the m m shuttle and affirm the trial court judgment.
factual and procedural background 
stuchbery concedes that the material facts in this case are undisputed.the underlying action was filed against m m,tehrani and one of m m drivers,collie george downer downer.the plaintiff in that case the victim,who was years old at the time of the incident,alleged that at or about on january,while at the civic center in san francisco,she asked downer to transport her to a teen shelter.he agreed,but instead of taking her there,downer drove her to his apartment and raped her.the complaint alleged causes of action for common carrier liability childhood sexual abuse assault battery sexual battery intentional infliction of emotional distress negligent hiring retention of an unfit employee negligent training and supervision false imprisonment and violation of civil code section.
the victim testified in a concurrent criminal action,and her testimony was submitted in the motion for summary judgment in this insurance dispute.she had run away from home because she needed a break from her parents and did not want to go to school.after arriving at the civic center in san francisco,she kept walking as she looked for a shelter for people,homeless people,until she saw downer in front of a diner with his shuttle.downer asked the victim what she was doing out and how old she was,and suggested she call her mother.the victim became concerned that downer would call the cops and she would be sent home.she asked him to take her to a shelter,and he agreed.she testified she approached downer in his capacity as a driver of a shuttle,and would not have entered the shuttle if she believed it was a private vehicle.
the victim testified that the shuttle stopped in front of downer apartment.downer told her the shelters were closed until,and that she could sleep in his apartment while he returned to work.the victim responded,fine,because she figured she would sleep at downer apartment for a few hours and have him take her to the shelter in the morning.the two went through the entryway,went up at least one flight of stairs and walked inside.according to the complaint,downer caused the victim by threat of intimidation and physical violence to remain in his apartment for a period of approximately five hours.during this time downer sexually assaulted and battered the victim 
in june,m m and tehrani tendered their defense and indemnity in the underlying action to stuchbery,which agreed to defend subject to a reservation of rights.in january,m m and tehrani tendered their defense and indemnity to redland,which initially accepted the tender under a reservation of rights,but after conducting a coverage investigation declined to defend or indemnify.stuchbery incurred in attorney fees and costs in defending m m and tehrani in the underlying action,of which was incurred after m m and tehrani tendered to redland.stuchbery also incurred in settling the victim claims against m m and tehrani 
in april,stuchbery filed this action against redland,asserting it was entitled to reimbursement from redland because redland alone was responsible for defending and indemnifying m m and tehrani.in the alternative,stuchbery claimed that both stuchbery and redland had a duty to defend and indemnify and stuchbery was entitled to equitable contribution from redland.
redland filed the instant motion for summary judgment,asserting there was no potential for coverage under its policy.the trial court agreed and concluded that because redland had no duty to defend or indemnify m m and tehrani,redland owed no reimbursement or equitable contribution to stuchbery stuchbery filed a timely notice of appeal.
