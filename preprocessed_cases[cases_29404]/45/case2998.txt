insurance code section section,in part,governs insurance companies in providing uninsured motorist coverage umc.subdivision c of section authorizes an insurer to exclude umc for bodily injury of its insured if the insured is in,upon,entering into,or alighting from,a motor vehicle that is not described in the insured auto policy and the owner of that vehicle has insurance similar to that provided in this section.
we conclude that where the insured has in umc and the owner of the vehicle has in umc,the owner does not have insurance similar to that provided in this section.consequently,the exclusion authorized by subdivision c of section does not apply,and we affirm the judgment.in referring to this statutory language,we will refer to the insured as the injured insured and to the owner as owner.
background 
on january,defendant daniel wolf wolf was a passenger in a car driven by richard morgan morgan.they were by an uninsured drunk driver going approximately miles per hour.morgan had umc through state farm insurance company,with a coverage limit of.the limit amount was paid to wolf.
wolf had umc through plaintiff calfarm insurance company calfarm,with a coverage limit of per person.wolf made a umc claim under his calfarm policy.calfarm and wolf disputed whether wolf umc applied,and calfarm filed a declaratory relief action to resolve the coverage dispute.
the trial court ruled in wolf favor in a summary judgment motion on the issue of coverage.this appeal ensued.wolf and calfarm had previously arbitrated the issue of damages in binding arbitration.the arbitrator awarded wolf in damages,subject to a reduction for amounts paid by other insurance the arbitrator found the credit that calfarm is entitled to receive is leaving a net recovery to wolf of.the arbitration award was expressly made subject to determination of the coverage dispute.as the arbitrator explained,t he court ruling will be dispositive on the issue of coverage.if no coverage exists,wolf has received all he will for this accident.if coverage does exist,then the findings herein would be binding upon the parties.
discussion 
two subdivisions of section are pertinent here,subdivisions c and d hereinafter,subdivisions c and d,or section c and d.they state respectively 
c the insurance coverage provided for in this section including umc does not apply either as primary or as excess coverage 
to bodily injury of the insured while in or upon or while entering into or alighting from a motor vehicle other than the described motor vehicle if the owner thereof has insurance similar to that provided in this section.
d subject to paragraph of subdivision c,the umc policy or endorsement may provide that if the insured has insurance available to the insured under more than one uninsured motorist coverage provision,any damages shall not be deemed to exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages,and the damages shall be prorated between the applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the limits.
pursuant to section c,wolf umc policy with calfarm contains the following exclusion which we will refer to as exclusion 
exclusions 
this insurance umc does not apply either as primary or as excess coverage to 
bodily injury of an insured while occupying 
defined in accord with section c as while in or upon or entering into or alighting from a motor vehicle other than a motor vehicle specifically described in the declarations as a covered auto you own,if the owner thereof has uninsured motorists insurance which applies to that motor vehicle.
pursuant to section d,wolf umc policy with calfarm contains the following provision which we will refer to as provision 
other uninsured motorists insurance 
subject to paragraph of.exclusions in this endorsement,if an insured has insurance available under any other uninsured motorist coverage provision of any other policy,any damages shall not be deemed to exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages and the damages shall be prorated between the applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of all available limits.
thus,exclusion and provision,respectively,do not mirror the language of section c and d.exclusion has deleted subdivision c s key term similar so that if the owner has any umc regardless of coverage applies and the injured insured can not look to his own umc.provision specifies,if an insured has insurance available under any other uninsured motorist coverage provision of any other policy,in place of subdivision d phrase,if the insured has insurance available to the insured under more than one uninsured motorist coverage provision.
section specifies the minimum in umc that an insurer can offer the insurer is free to offer more in the way of umc,but can not offer less our concern is with the section c phrase similar to that provided in this section.if the term similar refers simply to type of coverage,refers simply to the owner having any umc,assuming mandatory statutory minimum limits are met,then exclusion accords with section.but if the term similar also encompasses amount of coverage,also refers to the owner having umc of similar or greater policy limits,then exclusion,in this case,impermissibly offers less than what section requires an insurer to offer.the issue before us is what the phrase similar to that provided in this section in subdivision c means,in the context presented here of widely disparate umc limits of on the owner policy and on the injured insured.
this issue is one of statutory interpretation.our objective in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent in determining intent,we look first to the statute words if those words are clear,there is no need for construction when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,however,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the object to be achieved,the evil to be remedied,public policy,the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,and legislative history 
the section c phrase similar to that provided in this section can be reasonably interpreted to encompass the type of coverage provided.however,it can also be reasonably interpreted to encompass the amount of coverage provided.since the phrase is ambiguous,we will turn to extrinsic aids.
we first examine the object to be achieved,the evil to be remedied,and public policy.s ection is a remedial statute enacted for the purpose of forcing insurers to make available coverage by which insureds can protect themselves from the menace of uninsured motorists.ambiguous language in the statute must be given a construction that advances,not thwarts,its remedial purpose.
construing the term similar in section c to encompass similar amount of coverage advances the remedial purpose of protection from the uninsured motorist menace,a menace that has grown in recent times with the high cost of auto insurance.it also assures that umc will be provided in an amount at least similar to the injured insured umc.
limiting the term similar to the type of coverage thwarts this remedial purpose by providing umc only in the amount the owner has purchased,which,as in this case,may be much lower than the injured insured umc.
furthermore,as noted,section was enacted to force insurers to make umc available the legislature wanted to encourage the purchase of this coverage all auto liability policies issued in california must contain umc with certain minimum limits,but an insurer and an insured may agree to waive this coverage limiting an injured insured to the owner much lower umc limits would discourage its purchase by making such coverage less attractive to the injured insured.
o ne of the most basic tenets of law is that the insured should get that which he bargained for.this is why courts interpret the uninsured provisions in a manner which places the insured in the same position he would have been in had he been driving his own vehicle when the accident occurred.
wolf paid umc premiums for per person and per accident.he was an auto passenger involved in an accident with a liable uninsured motorist.according to calfarm,under section c,wolf in umc is unavailable because the owner had umc for.under this view of section c,wolf does not get that which he bargained for.
it is said that,the purpose of the uninsured motorist statute is not to make all drivers whole from accidents with uninsured drivers,but to make sure that they are protected to the extent that they would have been protected had the driver at fault carried the statutory minimum of liability insurance.citation.the law is not designed to provide the insured with greater insurance protection than would be available under a policy containing minimum statutory limits.citation.this may be the minimal purpose of the umc law,but if an insurer offers and sells a umc insurance policy for greater than the statutory minimum the umc law allows the minimal purpose of the umc law has been met and the more protective purpose of the umc insurance policy must be effectuated.a n insurance policy which on its face provides more than the minimum coverage required by law will not be read so as to eliminate that extra coverage.
our view that the term similar in subdivision c encompasses amount of coverage,and not just type of coverage,is further supported by looking at the statutory scheme and the specific purposes of subdivisions c and d.subdivision c states that an injured insured umc does not apply if the owner has similar insurance.the primary purpose of subdivision c is to prevent double recovery by the injured insured where more than one umc policy may be implicated subject to paragraph of subdivision c,subdivision d applies if more than one umc policy applies subdivision d prevents the cumulative stacking of multiple umc limits by stating the insured damages shall not be deemed to exceed the highest single umc limit available,and provides that the insured damages shall be prorated between the policies as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the limits.
if similar encompasses amount of coverage,there is a nice fit between the statutory scheme and the purposes of subdivisions c and d.if the owner umc limits are similar to the injured insured,the exclusion of c applies to the injured insured umc subdivision d and its focus on more than one umc policy do not apply.there is no possibility of double recovery because only the owner umc policy applies.this view also dispenses with any argument that if similar encompasses amount of coverage,the subdivision c exclusion is nullified.if the owner umc limits,however,are much lower than the injured insured,the subdivision c exclusion does not apply to the injured insured umc because the owner does not have umc similar to that of the injured insured.in that instance,subdivision d applies because more than one uninsured motorist coverage provision applies,the owner umc and the injured insured umc.subdivision d provisions on capping the injured insured damages highest applicable limit and prorating those damages then come into play this focus on the injured insured damages also helps to foreclose the possibility of double recovery.
contrast this nice fit with the interplay of subdivisions c and d if the term similar in subdivision c means only the type of coverage.in that instance,if the owner has any umc,regardless of the amount of coverage assuming it meets mandatory statutory minimums,the subdivision c exclusion applies to the injured insured umc the injured insured can look only to the owner umc.under these circumstances,the question arises as to when subdivision d will apply,given its to subdivision c and its focus on more than one umc policy.as the court in national auto recognized,w ith the addition of the subdivision d to subdivision c,it becomes harder to reconcile the two provisions,since subdivision d purports to be overridden by subdivision c,leaving unclear what,if anything,remains of subdivision d.
the insurer in national auto attempted to explain this quandary by noting that subdivision d covers only the situation where the injured insured is injured while a pedestrian,or while an occupant of someone else car not covered by uninsured motorist coverage procured by its owner,and the injured insured himself also has a second uninsured motorist policy.the national auto court dismissed this feeble explanation as less than,adding,it is hard to swallow insurer characterization of such a situation as a much broader,even universal one compared with the injured insured owner situation.in national auto,an injured insured had umc and the owner had 
calfarm has learned a lesson in rhetoric from the insurer in national auto.it tenders another claim for when subdivision d applies in light of subdivision c.calfarm notes that the subdivision c exclusion applies to the injured insured whenever the owner has umc insurance.subdivision d applies when subdivision c does not apply,for example,when the injured insured is injured while occupying his own vehicle,but another uninsured motorists insurance policy is available.calfarm bolsters this claim by citing to several cases where a single household has separate insurance policies covering separate vehicles,arguing that,it is quite common for a person to have more than one uninsured motorists insurance policy available under circumstances that would not invoke the subdivision c exclusion.
there are two problems with this interpretation of when subdivision d applies.first,with subdivision d to subdivision c,the two subdivisions are a statutory couple,but calfarm argument has them more estranged than joined.under calfarm scenario,subdivision c covers its an owner has any umc,an injured insured can not look to his or her umc.subdivision d covers a separate an injured insured himself has more than one umc policy and he is in one of his own vehicles,the highest umc limit will apply and apparently the policies will be prorated.second,in all but one of the cases calfarm cites for its argument on subdivision d applicability single household with separate policies insuring separate vehicles,the insurance policies were issued by the same insurance company.there is no proration problem,of course,where multiple insurance policies are issued by the same insurer in such cases,that subdivision d is merely liable for the highest limits under any applicable policy calfarm argument on subdivision d applicability,then,reads one of the two major provisions of subdivision d of the subdivision.
calfarm reading of subdivisions c and d is also oddly limited.under that reading,wolf has in umc if he is injured in his car,on foot,on a bicycle,in an uninsured car belonging to someone else,or in a car belonging to someone else who has automobile insurance without umc.but if wolf is injured in a car belonging to someone else who has umc,wolf umc policy provides no protection whatsoever this reading does not comport with the remedial purpose of section to make coverage available by which insureds can protect themselves from the menace of uninsured motorists it also deprives wolf of the benefit of his bargain 
there is little in the way of legislative history regarding subdivisions c and d.both subdivisions were enacted in in essentially the same form as they appear today the phrase either as primary or as excess coverage to was added to the introductory clause of subdivision c in it can be argued that the addition of the term excess coverage,as applied to subdivision c,implies a meaning that if an owner umc is not similar to an injured insured umc because the owner carries much lower limits,the injured insured umc can serve as excess coverage to the owner umc.
this view finds support in the genesis of section.section enactment was prompted by a legislative subcommittee report on the consequences of traffic accidents,including the menace of uninsured drivers that report proposed the enactment of section,including the following within subdivision d the applicable umc limits hereunder shall apply only as excess insurance over any other liability insurance available to such insured,and this insurance shall then apply only in the amount by which the applicable limit of liability under this endorsement exceeds the sum of the applicable limit
