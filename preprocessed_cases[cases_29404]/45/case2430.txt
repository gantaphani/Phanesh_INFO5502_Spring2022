palp,dba excel paving excel paving and its commercial general liability cgl insurer virginia surety company,virginia surety appeal from a judgment after the trial court granted williamsburg national insurance company williamsburg summary judgment motion in this insurance coverage case.williamsburg provided commercial lines automobile trucker insurance on a dump truck owned by its insured,reh trucking,reh,which was providing hauling services on excel paving parking lot demolition jobsite.excel paving was a named additional insured on the williamsburg policy.an excel paving employee struck the cab of the reh dump truck with the bucket of an excavator being used to load broken asphalt into a different vehicle,not the dump truck,injuring the dump truck driver and damaging the truck.
the dump truck driver sued excel paving and its employee for negligence.the insurer of the dump truck sued excel paving and its employee in subrogation.virginia surety agreed to defend and indemnify excel paving and its employee in both lawsuits under the cgl policy,but it and excel paving also tendered defense to williamsburg under the dump truck automobile insurance policy.williamsburg declined the tender.virginia surety and excel paving filed the instant action against williamsburg for declaratory relief,equitable contribution,equitable indemnity,breach of the contractual duty to defend and indemnify,and bad faith.
the trial court granted williamsburg summary judgment motion,agreeing with williamsburg there was no possibility of coverage because the automobile policy excluded coverage for claims of bodily injury or property damage resulting from the movement of property by a mechanical device other than a hand truck unless the device is attached to the covered auto.although the excavator was not involved in loading or unloading the damaged dump truck,the trial court agreed the exclusion did not require a relationship between the property being moved and the covered vehicle,only that the injury result from an unattached mechanical device that was moving property.we conclude the exclusion did not apply under the circumstances.we reverse the judgment and,for reasons explained in the unpublished part of our opinion,remand to the trial court with directions to grant williamsburg alternative motion for summary adjudication of virginia surety equitable indemnification cause of action and excel paving bad faith cause of action.
a.the accident 
on july,reh was performing services for excel paving,hauling away loads of excavated asphalt from a parking lot excel paving was demolishing.christian suarez,an reh employee,was driving an dump truck that was being loaded.
excel paving employee,robert schroeder,was using a hydraulic excavator to demolish the parking lot surface,scoop up broken pieces of asphalt,and load them into some of the trucks.excel paving employee,pat lapaglia,was using a loader to similarly load asphalt into other waiting trucks.lapaglia had finished loading suarez truck with asphalt,and suarez was waiting to leave the job site.as suarez was preparing to drive away,the boom arm of the excavator being operated by schroeder swung around,and the bucket at the end of the boom arm struck the cab of suarez dump truck.the excavator bucket was empty when it struck suarez dump truck.suarez was injured,and the dump truck was damaged.
b.the insurance policies 
when the accident occurred excel paving was insured for liability arising out of its operations under a cgl policy issued by virginia surety.the virginia surety policy provided million in coverage for bodily injury or property damage for which excel paving was liable arising out of its paving operations including from its use of mobile equipment defined as,among other things,v ehicles designed for use principally off public roads v ehicles that travel on crawler treads and v ehicles,whether or not,maintained primarily to provide mobility to permanently mounted r oad construction or resurfacing equipment such as graders,scrapers or rollers 
reh was insured for liability also million in coverage arising out of its trucking operations under a commercial lines policy for truckers issued by williamsburg.excel paving was named an additional insured under the williamsburg policy on an additional insured endorsement with respect to liability arising out of operations performed for excel paving by or on behalf of reh subject to the terms,conditions,agreements,and limitations of th e policy.the williamsburg policy provided liability coverage for damages an insured must pay because of bodily injury or property damage to which its insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.the dump truck suarez was driving was a covered auto under the policy.
the williamsburg policy also contained a mechanical device exclusion.it excluded coverage for bodily injury or property damage resulting from the movement of property by a mechanical device other than a hand truck unless the device is attached to the covered auto.
c.the lawsuits,tenders and settlements 
suarez sued excel paving and schroeder for bodily injuries he sustained in the accident.his complaint alleged schroeder negligently operated the excavator and excel paving failed to maintain appropriate safety procedures.in their answer,excel paving and schroeder raised suarez comparative negligence as an affirmative defense 
lloyd of london lloyd,reh property damage insurer,filed a subrogation action against excel paving and schroeder.lloyd alleged excel paving and schroeder negligence caused damage to the truck,and it sought to recover the it paid out to reh.the suarez and lloyd actions were eventually consolidated hereafter collectively referred to as the underlying action.
virginia surety accepted the tender of excel paving and schroeder defense in both actions,without a reservation of rights,but it and excel paving also tendered excel paving defense in both actions to williamsburg.williamsburg declined the tender based on the exclusion in the williamsburg policy.virginia surety paid all defense costs and eventually settled suarez bodily injury claim for.
current judgment motions 
virginia surety and excel paving filed this action against williamsburg.the operative complaint,the second amended complaint,contained causes of action for declaratory relief on behalf of both virginia surety and excel paving,breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing on behalf of excel paving,and equitable indemnity and equitable contribution on behalf of virginia surety.
on the parties cross motions for summary judgment,or in the alternative summary adjudication,the trial court granted williamsburg summary judgment motion and denied virginia surety and excel paving motion as moot.the trial court concluded,based on the undisputed facts,the mechanical device exclusion eliminated any potential for coverage under the williamsburg policy and therefore williamsburg had no duty to defend or indemnify excel paving in the underlying actions.
general legal principles 
a n insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.citations.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,waller.the insurer must defend any claim that would be covered if it were true,even if it is groundless,false or fraudulent.gray zurich insurance cal d,gray.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.horace mann ins.barbara cal th.thus,when a suit against an insured alleges a claim that potentially could subject the insured to liability for covered damages,an insurer must defend unless and until the insurer can demonstrate,by reference to undisputed facts,that the claim can not be covered.in order to establish a duty to defend,an insured need only establish the existence of a potential for coverage while to avoid the duty,the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.citation.ringler associates maryland casualty th,fn.omitted.doubts concerning the potential for coverage and the existence of duty to defend are resolved in favor of the insured.montrose chemical superior court cal th,montrose.

an insurer is entitled to summary judgment that no potential for indemnity exists if the evidence establishes no coverage under the policy as a matter of law.county of san diego ace property casualty ins.cal th,ace.we apply a de novo standard of review to an order granting summary judgment when,on undisputed facts,the order is based on the interpretation or application of the terms of an insurance policy.ace,supra,cal th at see also founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th,when no extrinsic evidence is introduced,or when the competent extrinsic evidence is not in conflict,the appellate court independently construes the contract.
interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law and follows the general rules of contract interpretation.mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,mackinnon.the fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.
an insurance policy provision is considered to be ambiguous when it is capable of at least two reasonable constructions.ace,supra,cal th at mackinnon,supra,cal th at.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists.waller,supra,cal th at.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.citation.citation.citation.ace,supra,cal th at.
an insurance policy coverage provisions must be interpreted broadly to afford the insured the greatest possible protection,while a policy exclusions must be interpreted narrowly against the insurer.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.the exclusionary clause must be conspicuous,plain and clear.state farm mut.auto.ins.jacober cal d.this rule applies with particular force when the coverage portion of the insurance policy would lead an insured to reasonably expect coverage for the claim purportedly excluded.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.
the insured has the burden of establishing the claim comes within the scope of coverage,and the insurer has the burden of establishing the claim comes within an exclusion.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.to prevail,the insurer must establish its interpretation of the policy is the only reasonable one.id.at.even if the insurer interpretation is reasonable,the court must interpret the policy in the insured favor if any other reasonable interpretation would permit coverage for the claim.ibid.
with the above principles in mind we turn to the issue at hand whether excel paving had any possibility of coverage under the williamsburg policy for the damages caused to suarez and the reh dump truck.we conclude there was coverage and the trial court erred by granting williamsburg summary judgment motion.
we first consider whether the claim came within the scope of the coverage clause of the williamsburg policy.the burden on this issue was on the insured.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.we need not spend undue time on this point as williamsburg does not seriously dispute the accident fell within the policy insuring clause the williamsburg policy states it will pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.the accident arose out of reh ownership,maintenance or use of the covered dump truck given that the dump truck was on the excel paving jobsite having been engaged by excel paving to haul away demolished asphalt.
furthermore,excel paving was an additional insured on the policy with respect to liability arising out of operations performed for excel paving by or on behalf of reh so it is also an insured.we additionally observe that because excel paving was an additional insured under a blanket additional insured endorsement,one that was not limited to coverage for the additional insured vicarious liability for negligent conduct by the named insured,excel paving is provided coverage by the policy for accidents falling within the coverage clause without regard to whether injury was caused by reh the named insured or excel paving the additional insured.see vitton construction,pacific ins.th,the fact that an accident is not attributable to the named insured negligence is irrelevant when the additional insured endorsement does not purport to allocate or restrict coverage according to fault fireman fund ins.atlantic richfield th,where additional insured endorsement did not contain language limiting coverage to vicarious liability,coverage existed regardless of additional insured fault acceptance ins.syufy enterprises th,additional insured is covered without regard to whether injury was caused by the named insured or the additional insured see also hartford casualty ins.travelers indemnity th,same pardee construction insurance of the west th,no coverage for additional insured because endorsement contained language limiting coverage to additional insured vicarious liability for named insured negligence.
we next consider whether the mechanical device exclusion relied upon by williamsburg excludes coverage.as already noted,the burden in this regard is with the insurer.mackinnon,supra,cal th at.exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly.garvey state farm fire casualty cal d.although when the meaning is clear,such a clause will be enforced california state auto.inter ins.bureau warwick cal d,fn,where there is ambiguity the clause must be construed in the insured favor consistent with its reasonable expectations.gray,supra,cal d at see montrose,supra,cal th at.
excel paving argues the mechanical device exclusion does not apply to the undisputed facts of this case.the primary gist of its argument is the exclusion must be narrowly interpreted to apply only when the movement of property,the asphalt by the mechanical device not attached to the covered vehicle,the excavator,was in relation to the loading or unloading of the covered vehicle,the reh dump truck.it is undisputed the excavator was not loading or unloading suarez truck that task was performed by a different mechanical device the loader,and,furthermore,suarez truck was finished being loaded when the accident occurred.williamsburg argues no interpretation of the mechanical device exclusion is needed its meaning is clear and unambiguous on its face.it contends the mechanical device exclusion applies whenever an accident involving a covered vehicle results from the movement of property by a mechanical device that is not attached to the covered vehicle,period.there is no requirement the movement of the property have anything to do with loading or unloading the covered vehicle.
we can not agree with williamsburg broad reading of the 
exclusion such a construction could lead to exclusion of coverage for the most random of acts simply because a mechanical device that was moving property was involved.the exclusion applies to damage resulting from the movement of property by a mechanical device other than a hand truck unless the device is attached to the covered auto.but movement where and movement why an exclusion must be read narrowly and in accordance with the reasonable expectations of an insured.the references in the exclusion to hand trucks and mechanical devices that are attached to the covered vehicle both support that the movement of property must be in relation to the covered auto,damage resulting from the movement of property to or from the covered auto by a mechanical device other than a hand truck unless the device is attached to the covered auto.
there is no reported california case considering the mechanical device exclusion.there are,however,numerous decisions from sister states and federal courts,all of which discuss the mechanical device exclusion in the context of the movement of property in relation to the covered vehicle more specifically the loading or unloading of the covered vehicle.see travelers indem.star indem.d,forklift loading steel into covered vehicle mechanical device exclusion applies assicurazioni generali public serv.mut.ins,freight elevator operator injured by bed frame unloaded from insured delivery truck mechanical device exclusion not applicable because elevator mechanical device stationary at time of accident so no movement of property by mechanical device truck ins.exchange home ins,mechanical loading device loading cylinders onto covered vehicle but mechanical device exclusion violates state mandatory coverage laws cont l ins.am.motorist ins,hydraulic pallet jack being used to unload truck mechanical device exclusion applies cobb county hunt,pipe being loaded onto covered vehicle by loader mechanical device exclusion applies dauthier pointe coupee wood treating,so d,pilings being unloaded from covered vehicle with forklift mechanical device exclusion applies sonoco products,fire cas.ins.of connecticut,forklift unloading pallets from insured tractor trailer but mechanical device exclusion violates state mandatory coverage laws parkway iron metal new jersey mfrs.ins,crane unloading sheet metal from covered truck but mechanical device exclusion violates state mandatory coverage laws general accident ins.united states fidelity guar,water softener tank being unloaded from covered vehicle by push cart mechanical device exclusion inapplicable because push cart could be included in definition of hand truck sellie north dakota ins.guar.ass,luggage cart being used to unload luggage from insured bus mechanical device exclusion not applicable because luggage cart was a hand truck shell oil employers ins.of wausau,forklift loading oil drums onto covered truck mechanical device exclusion applies sisson hansen storage,forklift being used to unload covered truck mechanical device exclusion applies.
williamsburg does not assert the excavator was involved in loading or unloading the dump truck and cites no published case in which the mechanical device exclusion was applied to an accident that was not related to the covered vehicle by use of the mechanical device in connection with loading or unloading the vehicle.williamsburg cites travelers indem.star indem,supra,d at page,cont l ins.am.motorist ins,supra,at pages,and dauthier pointe coupee wood treating,supra,so d at pages,for the proposition the mechanical device exclusion is clear and unambiguous and therefore enforceable.but in each of those cases the injury was related to loading or unloading the covered vehicle with the unattached mechanical device.because the movement of property by the excavator bore no relationship to the reh dump truck,it was not,and had not been,loading or unloading the dump truck,the mechanical device exclusion does not apply.accordingly,there was coverage for the accident under the williamsburg policy and summary judgment for williamsburg was improper 
williamsburg argues in the alternative even if there is coverage for the accident under its policy,it is nonetheless entitled to summary adjudication on most of the complaint causes of action.williamsburg agrees that if there is coverage virginia surety may proceed with its cause of action for equitable contribution from williamsburg towards defense and indemnification costs,but it argues the equitable indemnity cause of action is barred because virginia surety had its own independent duty to defend and indemnify excel paving.it also contends excel paving breach of contract and bad faith causes of action can not be proven for the simple reason that excel paving has suffered no damage because virginia surety fully defended and indemnified it and schroeder.in the alternative,williamsburg argues excel paving bad faith cause of action is barred because there was a genuine dispute as to coverage.
although virginia surety and excel paving respond to williamsburg arguments in their reply brief,they suggest in passing we should not address them because the trial court never ruled on williamsburg request for summary adjudication for obvious reasons granting summary judgment obviated the need to rule on the alternative summary adjudication motion.they further assert that if we are inclined to address the issues,they should be permitted to file supplemental briefing.code civ,subd.m.we may affirm a summary judgment if it is correct on any ground that the parties had an adequate opportunity to address in the trial court,regardless of the trial court stated reasons.blanco baxter healthcare th,california school of culinary arts lujan th.these issues were all raised in the trial court in williamsburg summary motion and addressed in virginia surety and excel paving opposition.they were directly raised in williamsburg respondent brief on appeal and briefed by virginia surety and excel paving in their reply brief.accordingly,we may address the issues here.see bains moores th,fn.where defendants directly addressed issue in respondent brief and plaintiffs addressed in reply brief,purpose of code of civil procedure section,subdivision m,is met byars scme mortgage bankers,th,fn.supplemental briefing not required pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision m,where issue raised below and on appeal.
virginia surety equitable indemnification cause of action 
williamsburg contends if there is coverage for the accident under its policy,then it and virginia surety are both primary insurers each had the duty to defend and indemnify.accordingly,williamsburg asserts virginia surety may pursue equitable contribution from williamsburg to recover a share of the defense costs,but it may not seek equitable indemnification to recover all those costs.we agree.
equitable indemnity applies in cases in which one party pays a debt for which another is primarily liable and which in equity and good conscience should have been paid by the latter party.citation.united states auto alaska ins.th.f or instance,an excess insurer who defends and indemnifies the insured following the primary insurer wrongful refusal to do so may seek equitable indemnity from the primary insurer for amounts paid in defense and settlement of the claim.croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.primary insurance provides coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches immediately upon the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to liability.north american capacity ins.claremont liability ins.th.primary insurers have a duty of defense.ibid.
by contrast,equitable contribution applies when the insurers level of risk is the same.equitable contribution is the right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk,each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured.equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,fn.omitted.
the williamsburg policy states its coverage is primary for any covered auto while hired or borrowed by you and used exclusively in your business as a trucker and pursuant to operating rights granted to you by a public authority.this c overage is excess over any other collectible insurance for any covered auto while hired or borrowed from you by another trucker.the provision further states this c overage provides primary insurance for any covered auto you own and excess insurance for any covered auto you do own.
virginia surety is also a primary of the risk because the virginia surety policy provides coverage for bodily injury or property damage for which excel paving was liable arising out of its operations including its use of its mobile equipment such as the excavator.virginia surety defended and indemnified excel paving and schroeder without reservation of rights thus acknowledging its duties.
virginia surety and excel paving point out the virginia surety policy states its coverage is excess if there is other insurance available.the virginia surety policy states its coverage is primary unless subdivision b applies,and subdivision b provides,as relevant here,that the virginia surety insurance is excess insurance over a ny other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations,or the products and completed operations,for which you have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.
but under california law equitable contribution applies when there is the same level of insurance,both primary or both excess,for the same risk,regardless of any other insurance policy language.see dart industries,commercial union ins.cal th,dart industries edmondson property management kwock th,edmondson cse ins.group northbrook property casualty th.in dart industries,our supreme court stated,t he modern trend is to require equitable contributions on a pro rata basis from all primary insurers regardless of the type of other insurance clause in their policies.dart industries,supra,cal th at see also edmondson,supra,th at.this is because public policy favors apportionment among coinsurers.edmondson,supra,th at.accordingly,we agree with williamsburg that equitable contribution applies in this instance,not equitable indemnification.
excel paving breach of contract and bad faith causes of action 
williamsburg contends excel paving can not prevail on its breach of contract or bad faith causes of action because it was defended and indemnified by virginia surety and thus suffered no damages as a matter of law.we conclude there is a triable issue of fact as to whether excel paving was damaged.
breach of an insurer duty to defend violates a contractual obligation and,where unreasonable,also violates the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,for which tort remedies are appropriate.citation.amato mercury casualty th.the general measure of damages for a breach of the duty to defend an insured,even if it is ultimately determined there is no coverage under the policy,are the costs and attorney fees expended by the insured defending the underlying action.citations.emerald bay community golden eagle ins.th,emerald bay.
in a summary adjudication motion,the pleadings define the issues.scott united states fidelity guaranty ins.th,disapproved on another point in le francois goel cal th,fn.here,excel paving alleged it was damaged by payment of defense costs in the underlying action,including payment of its deductible on the virginia surety policy.in its motion for summary adjudication,williamsburg asserted excel paving could not prove damages as a matter of law based on two facts that were undisputed by excel paving virginia surety provided excel paving and schroeder with a defense in the underlying litigation and agreed to pay to suarez to settle his claim against excel paving and schroeder although excel paving alleged it was damaged by paying its insurance deductible under the virginia surety policy,williamsburg asserted excel paving payment of the deductible was not compensable damage as a matter of law because excel paving was contractually obligated by the virginia surety policy to pay the deductible.
we agree with excel paving that williamsburg failed to establish excel paving did not suffer compensable damage as a result of williamsburg breach of its contractual duty to defend and indemnify.williamsburg correctly states the general law that w here more than one insurer has a duty to defend an insured,each insurer duty is separate and independent from the others citation.however,a n insured is entitled to only one full defense.citation.an insurer that has allegedly breached its duty to defend may demonstrate that its insured suffered no damages from its alleged breach by demonstrating that its insured received a full and complete defense,notwithstanding its breach.citation.risely interinsurance exchange of the automobile club th,italics added see also emerald bay,supra,th at horace mann ins.barbara th,ceresino fire ins.exchange d.but none of those cases considered whether the insured payment of its deductible under the defending insurer policy was a recoverable item of damage against another insurer that is also on the risk but which refuses to defend or indemnify.
in its respondent brief,williamsburg criticizes excel paving for claiming its deductible constitutes compensable damage d espite adverse case authority in a footnote,williamsburg makes its only mention of the adverse authority,tradewinds escrow,truck ins.exchange th tradewinds escrow,which it describes as affirming a summary judgment for the nondefending insurer due to lack of compensable damages even though the insured paid a deductible to the defending insurer.but williamsburg has not accurately described the case,and it is easily distinguishable.in tradewinds escrow,the first insurer provided the insured with a defense under an errors and omissions policy but refused to reimburse in legal fees the insured incurred before the insured tendered its defense to the first defending insurer,which included the insured deductible and in disputed fees.id.at.over a year and a half after the litigation had commenced,the insured tendered its defense to defendant cgl insurer,and the defense was denied.the court held the cgl insurer was not responsible for any of the defense costs incurred by the insured because the cgl policy contained a no voluntary payments provision.such clauses bar reimbursement for expenses based on the reasoning that until the defense is tendered to the insured,there is no duty to defend.citation.id.at.there is no suggestion here that excel paving deductible was a voluntary payment.
williamsburg also argues excel paving failed to present evidence it in fact paid the deductible under the virginia surety policy.it contends excel paving mere allegation of payment is not evidence the deductible was paid.see college hospital,superior court cal th,fn.a party can not rely on the allegations of his own pleadings,even if verified,to make or supplement the evidentiary showing required in the summary judgment context.w
