this case involves a dispute over insurance coverage for flood loss.the insurance contract between the insured,mark andy,and the insurer,hartford fire insurance,stated it was for million in flood coverage.on the basis of the jury findings of fact in answers to special interrogatories,the district court reformed the contract to provide million in coverage,and entered judgment in favor of mark andy on its claim for breach of contract.we hold that the district court erred in reforming the contract,and we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
mark andy manufactures commercial printing presses.its main facility is located in the chesterfield valley area of louis county,missouri,an area designated as a zone.mark andy regularly purchases various types of insurance,including workers compensation,general liability,and property insurance.its insurance policies expire each march.each year since,mark andy had carried million in flood insurance for the chesterfield valley property.
in,hartford competed for the mark andy account.because the chesterfield valley facility was a risk,and because hartford louis office did not have underwriting authority for the full million in flood coverage sought for that facility hartford requested flood reinsurance from industrial risk insurers iri and hartford specialty,an affiliate of hartford.iri offered million and hartford specialty offered million in reinsurance.hartford then gave mark andy a quote that included million in flood coverage for the chesterfield valley facility.the premium for the property insurance component of the quote was.hartford did not get the mark andy account that year.
in march,lockton insurance agency of louis,became mark andy insurance broker lockton provides a variety of services,including serving as a broker or agent for both insureds and insurance companies.hartford was one of the insurance companies for which lockton served as an agent lockton did not approach hartford for a quote for the mark andy account.
in february,lockton prepared a document for submission to various insurance companies,listing the types and amounts of coverage that mark andy wanted for the year.this document reflected mark andy continuing desire for million in flood coverage for the chesterfield valley property.hartford was one of thirteen insurance companies that lockton invited to submit a quote on the mark andy account.
upon receiving the submission that lockton had prepared,hartford assigned three underwriters in its louis office to work on preparing a quote.robert settle was assigned to respond to the property insurance portion,which included the flood insurance.as in,settle contacted iri and hartford specialty about providing reinsurance for the flood coverage of the chesterfield valley property settle asked iri and hartford specialty to quote the full limits for flood insurance reflected in the lockton submission.
settle received a written quote from iri on march,day the hartford quote was due to lockton for the mark andy account.the written iri quote for flood reinsurance for the chesterfield facility was for only million.upon receiving iri quote,settle informed hartford specialty that he would not require its assistance and that it did not need to submit a quote.he then incorporated the iri quote into the full insurance package he was preparing to give to lockton encompassing all the insurance coverages sought by mark andy.the total premium for the package was of this,the premium was.

settle and two other hartford representatives orally presented hartford quote to lockton personnel at an meeting.there was evidence from which the jury could have found that no one at the meeting noticed the difference between the flood coverage mark andy had requested,and the coverage that was reflected in the actual hartford quote.the focus of the meeting was on the workers compensation component of the quote,which was the largest component.
in addition to the hartford quote,lockton received quotes from other insurance companies to which it had sent its submission.lockton compiled a summary and comparison of different quotes.in making this summary,lockton used its own submission document,and not the actual hartford quote.thus,lockton summary indicated wrongly that the hartford quote included million in flood coverage for the chesterfield valley property.
the next day,march,lockton presented its summary report to mark andy.in deciding which insurance company to use,mark andy did not review the actual hartford quote,but relied on the lockton summary.mark andy chose to accept the hartford quote.it is undisputed that lockton and mark andy believed mark andy was receiving million in flood coverage for the chesterfield valley property.on that same day,lockton informed hartford that its quote had been accepted by mark andy.
lockton,on behalf of hartford,then prepared and gave insurance binders to mark andy,effective march.a binder is a preliminary arrangement that provides temporary protection for the insured until the insurer issues a formal policy.the binders indicated that the different coverage amounts were specified in an attachment.lockton attached its original submission,not the actual hartford quote,to the binders.as a result,the binders indicated that the flood coverage was for million.hartford also received a copy of these binders.neither lockton,mark andy,nor hartford realized there was a difference between the flood coverage in the hartford quote and that reflected in the binders.the binders expired on june.hartford delivered the actual insurance policy,which provided for million in flood coverage for the chesterfield valley facility,to lockton on may.on july,lockton delivered the hartford policy to mark andy.
on july,the missouri river flooded the chesterfield valley,causing substantial damage to mark andy facility,as well as interruption of its business.hartford and iri started adjusting the loss,based on flood coverage of million.mark andy made a claim for million.hartford paid million and denied being obligated to pay more,whereupon mark andy filed this suit against hartford in a missouri state court,seeking reformation of the insurance contract.mark andy also sought damages for breach of contract,estoppel,and negligence.hartford removed the action to the district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,and brought a complaint against lockton for indemnification and negligence 
the case proceeded to a jury trial.in response to special interrogatories submitted to the jury pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,the jury made the following findings 
hartford intended to provide million in flood insurance for the chesterfield valley property when it made its quote to lockton on march.
lockton intended that hartford would provide million in flood insurance for the chesterfield valley property,and lockton acted as hartford agent,when lockton a made the presentation of its insurance proposal to mark andy on march,b issued the property insurance binder,and c delivered to mark andy the hartford property insurance policy.
when lockton presented the insurance proposal to mark andy on march,lockton represented to mark andy,orally or in writing,that hartford would provide million in flood insurance for the chesterfield property and mark andy reasonably relied upon this representation in not obtaining other flood insurance for a total amount of million.
when lockton issued the binders,lockton thereby represented to mark andy that hartford would provide million in flood insurance for the chesterfield property and mark andy reasonably relied upon this representation in not obtaining other flood insurance for a total amount of million.
the jury further found that as a result of the july flood,mark andy sustained property damage to its chesterfield valley premises in the amount of and damages in the amount of.
the district court issued findings of fact,consistent with the jury,and conclusions of law and reformed the contract to provide for million in flood coverage.the district court eventually entered judgment in mark andy favor for million taking into account the million hartford already paid mark andy,and the losses up to the extent of the limit as reformed plus prejudgment interest.the district court denied mark andy motion for judgment as a matter of law,and mark andy request for an additional award to cover the full amount of losses found by the jury.finally,the district court dismissed hartford claim against lockton.hartford filed the instant appeal,and mark andy.
hartford argues that the district court erred in reforming the contract.under missouri law,reformation of a written agreement is an extraordinary equitable remedy that should be granted with great caution and only in clear cases of fraud or mistake.secura ins.saunders,cir.reformation is appropriate if the parties have entered a definite and explicit agreement about which both parties had the same understanding,but by mutual mistake concerning a material provision,the written contract fails to express their agreement.thus the nature of the mistake and whether there was a prior agreement are the primary factual issues in determining whether reformation is appropriate.kopff economy radiator.
hartford first challenges the finding that lockton was acting as hartford agent when it presented mark andy with the competing insurance proposals.hartford argues that as a matter of law,lockton was mark andy agent at this point,and not hartford.lockton actions all objectively communicated that hartford was offering million of flood coverage.thus if lockton represented hartford,then mark andy and hartford,through lockton,had an agreement,with objective manifestations of intent,for million in flood coverage.the contract could be reformed to conform to that objective manifestation of intent.but if lockton acted as mark andy agent in presenting the proposals,then hartford could not be bound by lockton actions.
hartford concedes there might have been a need for some.however,once the basic facts were established,hartford argues,it was error to allow the jury to conclude that lockton was hartford agent for purposes of the transaction at issue.hartford then argues that once it is established that lockton was not its agent,reformation is not possible,because hartford itself never agreed to,or objectively communicated an offer for,flood coverage of million.
mark andy responds that lockton agency was a question of fact that was properly submitted to the jury.it argues that the jury factual finding must be upheld because it was supported by substantial evidence,and the court factual finding on the same subject must be upheld because it is not clearly erroneous.finally,mark andy contends that hartford waived its right to challenge this finding,because it did not object to the court instructions and special interrogatories as required by federal rule of civil procedure.
we agree with hartford that the court erred in submitting the question of lockton agency to the jury,and that the court erred in its legal conclusions based on that.there was a need for some.the agency status of a broker such as lockton involves questions of fact as to what conduct occurred.the facts here were that lockton had agency agreements with both mark andy and hartford,and that lockton was searching to fulfill mark andy insurance needs among several insurance companies.given these facts,the question of whether lockton was hartford agent when it presented hartford quote to mark andy should have been determined as a matter of law.
under missouri law,when a broker,such as lockton,acts on behalf of an insured to shop around for insurance among multiple insurance companies,the broker is the agent of the insured.see secura ins,at electro battery commercial union ins,lampkin kelly.any mistakes made by the broker are attributable to its principal,the insured,and not to the insurance company.this is true even when there is an agency agreement between the broker and a particular insurance company.electro battery.at.the fact that lockton was permitted to issue binders for hartford does not necessarily render lockton hartford agent as opposed to mark andy.see secura ins,at.furthermore,the fact that lockton previously obtained coverage for the property in question through a different insurer weighs against concluding that it was hartford agent on the mark andy account.see id.
there are special circumstances that allow a broker to be an agent for both the insured and the insurer when the broker is procuring insurance.if a broker is acting under a directive from the insured to obtain insurance from a particular insurance company,then the broker can be considered an agent for the insurance company.schimmel fur american indem.this exception does not help mark andy.lockton sought and received bids from multiple insurers,and aided mark andy in weighing them to select the best possible bid.
therefore,the contract could not have been reformed on the basis of any objective manifestation of intent by lockton,because lockton was mark andy agent at the time the contract was formed.mark andy argument that hartford waived this argument by not objecting to the special interrogatories and instructions at trial does not trouble us.hartford did move for judgment as a matter of law,raising a claim.this was adequate to preserve this issue for appeal.
the only other basis for reformation would be an objective manifestation of intent on hartford part,through its own employees,to offer million in flood coverage for the property in question.without an objective manifestation of intent at the time the contract was formed,it can not be said that the parties had a definite and explicit agreement for million in flood insurance.see continental ins.cotten,cir without an objective manifestation of mutual intent there is no mutual agreement that a reformation could express.
the jury found that when hartford gave its insurance quote to lockton,hartford intended to provide million in flood insurance.we interpret this finding to mean that hartford subjectively intended to provide million in flood coverage.this finding is supported by the record.settle,the hartford underwriter,told iri to quote him the full limits for the property insurance.settle communication with hartford specialty indicates that he believed wrongly that he had received the full limits from iri.
however,settle subjective intent is legally irrelevant.the important inquiry is what hartford communicated to lockton and therefore to mark andy,not what settle thought.in our opinion,the evidence does not support a finding that hartford objectively manifested an intent to offer million in flood coverage.the only written offer ever communicated to lockton was for million in flood coverage.hartford never orally communicated that it was offering million.the policy itself unambiguously stated that the flood coverage was for million.
nevertheless,mark andy argues that hartford objectively manifested an intent to offer million in several ways.first,the cover letter of hartford quote to lockton stated,as set forth above,that the quote was competitively priced based upon the exposures and information provided.at trial,mark andy introduced some evidence intended to show that the industry custom would have been for hartford to explain clearly in its cover letter if its offer differed in any material way from lockton submission.mark andy also argues that the actual premium hartford charged for million is not so different from what hartford would have charged for million as to put mark andy or lockton on notice that there was a discrepancy.finally,mark andy argues that the insurance binders lockton gave to both mark andy and hartford provided for million in flood coverage.
the most persuasive argument in support of the verdict and judgment is based on hartford cover letter to lockton.typical of mar
