background 
on august,niki applied for a life insurance policy with conseco,requesting and naming her sons eric williams eric and harold williams as primary beneficiaries of the policy.niki subsequently developed breast cancer and underwent treatment from october through the beginning of march.following her discharge from the hospital niki lived with eric until march.on march,following a disagreement between eric and niki,eric returned niki to the house that she owned with her boyfriend.niki lived at her house in april.sometime in early may,niki was briefly hospitalized and upon release niki lived at buckley house until niki death on june.
prior to niki death,buckley and niki took several steps ultimately designed to change the beneficiary of niki policy from the appellants to buckley.first,buckley asked niki insurance agent,jarvis thorn,for instructions on how to properly change the beneficiary designation.conseco subsequently sent buckley a change in ownership form.niki,however,allegedly had limited use of her extremities and could not sign the form.conseco would not permit the insurance forms to be signed with an on the advice of conseco,niki executed a power of attorney poa in favor of buckley.this poa allowed buckley to change the ownership of the policy,which then empowered buckley to change the beneficiary designation of the policy from her nephews to herself.
niki executed the poa naming buckley as her on may.buckley daughter,sherita smith,and william rutledge witnessed niki execution of the poa.buckley,using this poa,then changed the ownership of the policy from niki to herself on may.conseco received the change of ownership form on may,and subsequently approved the change in writing.on june,buckley,as owner of the policy,then changed the beneficiary designation from the appellants to buckley.conseco received the form on june,and later approved the change.
on june,niki died.on july,conseco received a claim from buckley for the proceeds of the policy.conseco also received a written demand from the appellants not to pay buckley the proceeds.by letter dated august,conseco informed buckley that the current beneficiary of record on the insurance policy was not valid under arkansas law,citing arkansas code annotated buckley contends conseco relied upon this statute in error,however,because buckley did not use her poa to make herself beneficiary rather,she used the poa to change ownership,which is permitted under arkansas law.then,as owner,she properly changed the beneficiary.
according to buckley,before her death niki expressed to several people her desire to change the policy beneficiary designation from the appellants to buckley.in support of her summary judgment motion,buckley submitted three robert mcgruder,shelton pitre,and support buckley contention that niki desired the change in beneficiary.
according to his affidavit,pitre niki boyfriend stated that the appellants were very neglectful to their mother and had treated her dismissive sic for many years.he stated that buckley was niki only sibling and that niki told him that she wanted to name ellen buckley as beneficiary of her life insurance policy and that under no circumstances were her sons,eric williams and harold williams,to receive any of this money.pitre also stated that niki told him that eric had become irate and very angry with her because she was not going to change her will to make him beneficiary so eric dropped her off at her house with her clothes in a garbage bag.pitre testified that the appellants were notified that niki was near death and yet neither came to see her before she died.
similarly,mcgruder,who represented that he had known niki for many years,asserted in his affidavit that niki expressly stated to him that she was embarrassed about the way the appellants had treated her for many years.niki told mcgruder that she had tried to live with eric following her discharge from the hospital in march but that eric constantly badgered her to change her will and to sign over all her property to her sons.mcgruder stated that he always told niki not to tell the appellants that she intended to change her policy beneficiary for fear of them becoming angry and retaliating against her.mcgruder reported that niki told him that eric became irate and very angry about her not changing her will.mcgruder testified that eric took her in his car over to her house and dropped her off with her clothes in a garbage bag.finally,mcgruder stated that after the march incident with eric,niki called and told him that she for sure was going to change the beneficiary on her life insurance policy to ellen buckley.
thorn affidavit stated that he recalls having a conversation with niki in april and that she requested that her beneficiary be changed on her policy to buckley because her son had given her many problems and did not take care of her.thorn testified that niki voice was well known to him and that she sounded alert and intelligent at the time she made the declaration.
the appellants moved for summary judgment on grounds that the poa does not state that niki intended,or even knew,that buckley would acquire niki insurance proceeds and that absent express intention an agent may not utilize her position for her personal benefit in a substantially gratuitous transfer.
buckley filed a cross motion for summary judgment with the supporting affidavits of thorn,pitre,and mcgruder attached.buckley argued that she changed ownership of niki policy to herself using the poa according to the express wishes of niki.once she obtained ownership of the policy,buckley contended,she named herself beneficiary of the policy not as an agent of niki but in her own capacity as owner of the policy,which is not prohibited by law.
the district court granted buckley motion for summary judgment finding in part on the intended to change the beneficiary and there was no evidence of overreaching the appellants failed to meet buckley proof with proof because mere suspicions were not evidence the appellants rebuttal was illogical and there was no evidence that niki was incompetent.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to buckley for two primary reasons.first,the appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion by admitting and crediting the affidavits that thorn,pitre,and mcgruder submitted.the appellants argue that these affidavits are impermissible parol evidence and therefore not competent evidence to overcome buckley presumption of overreaching beyond a reasonable doubt.the appellants seek to distinguish the holding in primerica,which addressed the issue of whether such parol evidence may be admitted.see sw d at.the parties disagree sharply about the precise meaning of the primerica holding.
buckley asserts that the holding of primerica is directly on point and controlling.relying upon that holding,buckley asserts that niki made statements to many people indicating her intention to change the beneficiary designation from her sons to buckley,as ev
