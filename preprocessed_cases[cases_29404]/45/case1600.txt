in august,john delcastillo was severely injured while working at a glnx rail car repair facility in omaha owned by houston corporation.he began receiving health insurance benefits under a group policy issued by united healthcare insurance company.his benefits continued after integrated rail products irp purchased the assets of glnx in october.however,further benefits were denied after irp replaced the united healthcare policy with a health care plan provided by reliance insurance company.
delcastillo and his wife diane commenced this action against multiple defendants under the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,as amended by the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra.after other defendants were dismissed,the district court held a bench trial and concluded that odyssey resource management and odyssey group are jointly and severally liable to the delcastillos for breach of erisa fiduciary duties and for failure to provide the notices of their right to continuation coverage mandated by cobra.the court awarded a total of for cobra statutory penalties and compensatory damages and in attorneys fees and costs.delcastillo odyssey resource,d.the odyssey defendants appeal.we conclude that the delcastillos were covered by the reliance plan at its inception.therefore,they may be entitled to recover unreimbursed medical expenses under erisa but are not entitled to recover statutory penalties under cobra.accordingly,we reverse and remand.
factual background 
when john delcastillo was injured in,odyssey management,served as of the glnx employees under a staff services agreement with houston corporation.as,odyssey management was responsible for complying with cobra and erisa for any plans that it administered however,odyssey management did not administer the united healthcare health plan for glnx employees.delcastillo was a participant in that plan.glnx was the policyholder of the united healthcare group health policy.
delcastillo did not return to work after his accident.he and his wife continued receiving health care benefits under the united healthcare policy.in november,after irp purchased the glnx assets,delcastillo received the following letter from irp manager of benefits administration 
this letter is to let you know that was sold effective october.as of that date all employees of were terminated.
no longer exists as of the aforementioned date.houston will pay your health insurance coverage until you have reached mmi maximum medical improvement.
the delcastillos continued to receive health care benefits from united healthcare.the explanation of benefits forms from united healthcare identified irp as the policyholder of the same group policy previously held by glnx.
when it acquired glnx,irp engaged odyssey resource management to serve as of glnx employees under a staff services agreement virtually identical to the agreement between odyssey management and houston corporation odyssey became responsible to irp for complying with cobra and erisa for any plans it administered.however,odyssey did not administer the united healthcare plan for irp,and the delcastillos continued to receive benefit payments from united healthcare.
in january,irp engaged odyssey to sponsor a health care plan.odyssey terminated the united healthcare policy and purchased a group health care policy from reliance.odyssey as served as the plan sponsor.see b i.the loomis company served as a administrator responsible for paying claims on behalf of reliance to enroll eligible participants in the new health care plan,an odyssey account manager,linda reyna,went to the irp work site,where active employees filled out application forms that odyssey sent to loomis.the disabled delcastillo was not at the work site and therefore was not enrolled in the plan.
shortly thereafter,when diane delcastillo was denied coverage for a prescription drug,she called irp to inquire.irp human resources director called reyna,told her that irp had missed an employee when we did the enrollment,and instructed reyna to send enrollment forms to delcastillo.the delcastillos promptly filled out and returned the forms and received health insurance cards from odyssey.when diane continued to be denied coverage,she called loomis and was told she had coverage.when she asked the nebraska department of insurance to investigate,reliance assured the department that delcastillo was a covered employee and sent delcastillo a certificate of coverage in august.however,odyssey pursued the coverage question internally,and loomis pended approximately of claims submitted by the delcastillos because of the lingering coverage uncertainty.ultimately,odyssey and reliance concluded that delcastillo was not eligible for coverage and refused to pay the claims.on july,odyssey sent loomis a notice that delcastillo coverage was canceled effective june.on july,loomis sent delcastillo a cobra notice explaining that his group health coverage terminated on june and that he was eligible for continuation coverage for up to eighteen months following this qualifying event.
the delcastillos filed this action against odyssey resource management,odyssey group,loomis,and reliance.after dismissing reliance apparently because of insolvency,they filed an amended complaint against the odyssey defendants and loomis seeking statutory penalties for their failure to give continuation coverage notices mandated by cobra,reimbursement of medical expenses incurred,and an injunction granting future health insurance coverage.the delcastillos dismissed loomis prior to trial.
after trial,the district court held the odyssey defendants jointly and severally liable for statutory penalties based on their failure to give both an initial cobra notice of the delcastillos statutory right to continuation coverage after a qualifying event,and their failure to give timely notice of a qualifying event.the court further held the odyssey defendants liable for the delcastillos unpaid medical expenses based on affirmative misrepresentations as to coverage made after the plan took effect on february.
ii.coverage under the reliance plan 
odyssey defense to all the delcastillos claims is premised on the contention that john delcastillo was never covered under the health care plan because the reliance group policy provided that only an irp employee who works regularly throughout an employer entire work week at any of the employer business locations is eligible for coverage.as delcastillo was not working regularly when odyssey began providing health care benefits to irp employees through the reliance policy,the odyssey defendants argue,there was no coverage and the delcastillos benefit claims were properly denied.see turner safeco life ins,cir.moreover,the argument concludes,odyssey did not become responsible for any required cobra notices.
the delcastillos do not seriously challenge odyssey interpretation of the eligibility provisions of the reliance group policy.but they do argue that delcastillo was initially covered under the reliance policy by reason of the following provision 
replacement of coverage 
this provision shall apply when this policy is replacing a prior plan of similar group coverage that the employer had with another insurer.when this happens,the following provisions apply 
a this policy will cover all persons who were covered under the previous policy on the date it was discontinued 
we interpret the terms of the policy de novo when,as here,there is no claim that the erisa plan granted any fiduciary discretionary authority to construe the policy.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.
in our view,the replacement of coverage provision describes precisely the situation here.the reliance policy replaced irp prior plan of similar group coverage with united healthcare.united healthcare benefit statements in the record are uncontroverted proof that the delcastillos were covered under the previous policy on the date it was discontinued.in these circumstances,it does not matter whether john delcastillo was working regularly when the reliance policy was issued,or whether he was even an irp employee at that time.it is enough that he was a covered pl
