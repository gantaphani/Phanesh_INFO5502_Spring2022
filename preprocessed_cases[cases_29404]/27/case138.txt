an attorney represents an elderly client and does not disclose his conflict of interest and its consequences.as this case demonstrates,the attorney brings financial harm to his client,institutional harm to his profession,and catastrophic harm to himself.

donald and merle peterson had been married for years.a few months prior to the incidents leading to this lawsuit,the petersons only child died and donald peterson moved into an alzheimer facility.
shortly after her son death and her husband move to the alzheimer facility,merle peterson peterson,then years old,met patrick mccomb.mccomb told peterson he was her nephew.in fact,he was not related to her.over the next few weeks,mccomb convinced peterson to transfer approximately to him in a series of transactions.mccomb also convinced peterson,in her capacity as trustee of the peterson trust,to obtain a loan secured by her primary residence.mccomb told peterson that the money would be invested in a night club joint venture.

discussion 
jamison contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on evidence.
the alleged evidence is a document that purports to reflect the bargain between mccomb and peterson for the formation of the night club.jamison refers to the document as the key club agreement.a paragraph of the agreement provides,in part agrees that eddie jamison is solely patrick attorney and that merle will have this agreement reviewed by independent counsel before the loan closing in order to protect her interests.merle agrees that if she hires eddie jamison to organize her estate,that eddie jamison would still first and foremost be patrick attorney and that patrick interest comes first.merle agrees to let patrick have a third party attorney review her retainer agreement with eddie jamison in the event she hires eddie jamison to organize her estate.merle acknowledges that eddie jamison is representing patrick interest only pertaining to this venture and that merle will have this agreement reviewed by a third party attorney before the loan signing that should happen in the next two weeks.patrick agrees to waive any conflict of interest that arises in the future if merle hires eddie jamison to organize her estate.both parties agree that each of them have performed an independent investigation of all matters which are subject to this agreement or will have been considered to have chosen not to if not done before the loan closing.each party represents that they have made an informed consent decision on every point contained within this agreement 
the agreement was purportedly signed by mccomb and peterson with jeff hoffman as a witness.
jamison claims he received a copy of the agreement in the mail,approximately seven months after the close of trial,from an anonymous source.in support of the motion,jamison submitted an affidavit from jeff hoffman declaring that mccomb and peterson signed the document in his office when they came to inquire about a loan on september.jamison also submitted an affidavit by a questioned document expert who declared that,in her opinion,the signatures appear to be genuine.
in opposition,wood challenged jamison attempt to authenticate the document.wood also submitted an affidavit from his legal malpractice expert,who testified at trial,declaring the agreement would not have changed his opinion that jamison committed malpractice and breached his fiduciary duty.
the trial court denied the motion,stating that the agreement is not material to the case.
the trial court may grant a new trial on the basis of evidence where the moving party shows the evidence is newly discovered,reasonable diligence has been exercised in its discovery,and the evidence is material to the moving party case.code civ,subd.sherman kinetic concepts,th,d.here the trial court found the evidence was not material.in the context of a motion for a new trial,material means likely to produce a different result.sherman,supra,at,d.
jamison cites sherman kinetic concepts,supra,th at page,d,for the proposition that we must make an independent determination whether an error in denying a motion for new trial was prejudicial.but sherman involved a jury trial.in this case,trial was by the court.there is always some conjecture in determining whether evidence was likely to produce a different result where the case was tried to a jury.no one can say with certainty what the jury might have thought about the evidence.but where,as here,the same trial court to which the case was tried determines the new evidence was unlikely to have made a difference,there is no conjecture.we simply have no basis for contradicting the trial court.
indeed,the document came from an unknown source.there is no evidence as to the circumstances of its making.there is no showing peterson had any legal advice about the complex matter of conflict of interest.most importantly,jamison subsequent actions appear to belie the words of the agreement that jamison does not represent peterson.the evidence is anything but compelling.
this case is not like furia helm th,d.furia was an appeal from a judgment after the trial court sustained the defendant demurrer without leave to amend.the court determined the complaint did not allege the defendant was the att
