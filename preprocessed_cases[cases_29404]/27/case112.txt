the plaintiffs in this lawsuit are the heirs in lay terms to the alta dena dairy fortune built by the stueve family.they include a multitude of individuals and entities and a successor trustee of numerous trusts collectively,the stueves.the stueves have sued many parties,including several attorneys and law firms,on a plethora of grounds.the stueves generally assert that they have been wrongfully deprived of their fortunes through a seemingly endless series of nefarious devices.in short,attorney raymond novell,a lifelong friend of the stueve family,allegedly teamed up with estate planning attorney jay wayne allen to drain off the family assets through a pandora box of actionable wrongs.over the years,attorney allen jumped from one law firm to another,perchance to avoid detection or perhaps because of detection.one of the law firms to which attorney allen took his tantalizing book of business was berger kahn.if the allegations are to be believed,berger kahn turned its back and happily collected fees while allowing attorney allen to help himself to its clients assets.
berger kahn filed two demurrers to the second amended complaint,one of which was sustained without leave to amend,as to the trust and entity stueves,and the other of which was sustained in part with leave to amend and in part without,as to the individual stueves.in this opinion,we address only the ruling on the demurrer to the second amended complaint as it affects the trust and entity stueves.we reverse.
we can not conclude that the stueves alleged no facts sufficient to state a viable cause of action against berger kahn,when they alleged that attorney novell,as the original trustee of the trusts,engaged in acts tantamount to breach of trust and that attorney allen and berger kahn knowingly participated in those acts to their benefit.furthermore,as stated in our opinion in the companion appeal,case no,the court erred in striking all of the stueves conspiracy allegations,which formed the primary underpinnings of their fraud and misrepresentation causes of action.it is premature to conclude that the stueves are unable to allege facts sufficient to state a viable cause of action based on fraud or misrepresentation.finally,we can not agree that the statute of limitations bars all causes of action as a matter of law.
the stueves filed a page second amended complaint against attorney novell,attorney allen,berger kahn,and dozens of others.the stueves described therein a spider web of nefarious transactions so thick as to block out the sun,and detailed how the defendants purportedly drained million off the composite family estate.the eleven causes of action against berger kahn included fraud by intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,fraud by concealment,constructive fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,professional negligence,negligent hiring and retention,violation of the prudent investor rule,violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico et,and financial elder abuse.
berger kahn filed a motion to strike and a demurrer to the second amended complaint.the court granted,in part,berger kahn motion to strike all conspiracy allegations against it,due to the stueves failure to comply with civil code section.it also sustained berger kahn demurrer,without leave to amend,as to the claims of the trust and entity stueves.an order of dismissal of berger kahn was filed with respect to the trust and entity stueves.
appeals were taken from the order granting the motion to strike and from the order of dismissal.this opinion addresses only the appeal from the order of dismissal.the appeal from the ruling on the motion to strike is at issue in companion case no.

allegations of second amended complaint 
the allegations of the second amended complaint include the following 
brothers harold,edgar and elmer stueve founded the alta dena dairy in.attorney novell was a friend of the stueve family since.he became legal counsel for the stueve family in the.
in,attorney novell teamed up with attorney allen and devised a complex plan to defraud the stueves.they convinced the stueves that their fortunes would be eaten up by taxes unless they set up a multitude of trusts.attorney allen then drafted the trusts and the stueves assets were transferred to attorney novell as trustee.the trusts were drafted so as to provide attorney novell,as trustee,with the discretion to do whatever he chose with the assets,thereby giving the defendants the means to liquidate the assets for their own benefit.in practice,attorneys novell and allen used the trust assets to engage in business transactions benefitting themselves,and thereby obtained undisclosed profits,and they also transferred trust assets to entities they owned or controlled.
to facilitate the plan,various entities were also established beginning in.attorneys allen and novell became the attorneys for these entities and attorney novell became their manager.through the use of these entities,together with the trusts,attorneys novell and allen operated a ponzi scheme based on money laundering activities and the issuance of sham loans.stueve monies were loaned to various entities,and the loans were repaid,if at all,with other monies also taken from the stueves.
from february,through june,attorney allen was employed by,and was an agent of,berger khan.while he was at that firm,attorney allen provided legal representation to all of the stueves except michael meyer and sbf delano.the actions of berger kahn were taken by and through attorney allen as its partner,attorney and employee,and attorney allen had actual ostensible authority to act on behalf of berger kahn.
berger kahn undertook the representation of the stueves in february,when attorney allen joined the firm.soon afterward,berger kahn acquired actual or constructive knowledge that serious allegations of misconduct had been leveled at attorney allen previously and that three lawsuits had been filed against him.an attorney who testified in one of those lawsuits specifically told berger kahn managers not to keep attorney allen,because it was too risky to do so.berger kahn failed to inform its clients of the allegations against attorney allen.
in april,attorney allen,as president of a limited liability company,took out a loan from sbf partners,gp which was his client and was owned by certain of the stueve trusts,which were also his clients.he did not disclose this loan to the stueves either in their individual capacities or as owners of beneficial interests in the trusts and sbf partners,gp.a title company satisfied the note in october.in january,attorney allen borrowed from sbf partners,gp,due and payable in june.the loan was secured by property in anaheim,california.shortly after he borrowed the money,attorney allen transferred title to the security to his wife as her sole and separate property.he defaulted on the loan on june.
also while at burger kahn,attorney allen conspired with attorney novell and other defendants to further defraud the stueves of hundreds of thousands of dollars or more via a series of transactions effectuated through a to step plan.to facilitate the plan,in december,attorney allen formed an entity known as gsf acquisitions,of which he was chief executive officer,chief financial officer,and treasurer.he also formed clarke novell llc,in december,and firma funding llc,in june.these three entities were among those formed as vehicles to siphon off stueve assets.in addition,attorney allen prepared promissory notes,loan purchase agreements,loan assignments and other documents used to effectuate the plan.furthermore,attorney allen and berger kahn participated in mail and wire fraud.
in furtherance of the ponzi scheme,attorneys novell and allen and berger kahn intentionally concealed both the nature of the transactions and the conflicts of interest,with the intention that the stueves rely upon the concealments and omissions.attorneys novell and allen and berger kahn,on various occasions,advised members of the stueve family not to disclose information about the estate plan to outsiders for privacy reasons.the stueves reasonably relied upon the concealments and omissions,with the result that they suffered both financial harm and delay in the discovery of the facts giving rise to their claims.
after june,attorney allen left berger khan and went to work for buchalter nemer.in december,earl stueve died and his wife,kim,asked about life insurance proceeds.attorney novell informed her that there was no money in the estate.she became alarmed and contacted meyer.the nefarious transactions remained undiscovered until january,when meyer reviewed the documents provided to him.attorney novell was removed as trustee of the trusts and meyer was appointed successor trustee in march,by court order.only thereafter did the scope and magnitude of the problem come to light.the defendants caused at least million in losses.
demurrer,ruling,and issues presented 
berger kahn attacked each of the causes of action brought by the trust and entity stueves.those causes of action are for fraud by intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,fraud by concealment,constructive fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,professional negligence,negligent hiring and retention,violation of the prudent investor rule,and rico.
berger kahn asserted that the statute of limitations barred each of those causes of action.it also asserted that the trust and entity stueves had failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the allegations were uncertain.code civ,subds.e,f.berger kahn argued,inter alia,that none of the misrepresentation based causes of action would lie because attorney novell,as trustee of each stueve trust and manager of each stueve entity,could not have been misled by attorney allen representations made in connection with plan that the two of them jointly concocted.
the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,holding that the statute of limitations barred all causes of action.it also expressed its agreement with berger kahn position that none of the misrepresentation claims were viable because attorney novell could not have been misled by attorney allen.in addition,the court noted the cause of action for conversion would not lie because the facts alleged did not constitute conversion.finally,it concluded no other cause of action would lie because each one was based on the purported fraudulent scheme orchestrated by attorneys allen and novell,which was not actionable.
in their opening brief,the trust and entity stueves argue the statute of limitations does not bar any of their claims the misrepresentation claims are sufficiently alleged,but if this court should determine otherwise,then leave to amend should be granted the conversion cause of action is sufficiently alleged and the court erred in concluding that each of the remaining causes of action failed as being based on the purported fraudulent scheme orchestrated by attorneys allen and novell.we address these issues in turn.
statute of limitations 
code of civil procedure section 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides a an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first i n no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury.the attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.the attorney willfully conceals the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission when such facts are known to the attorney,except that this subdivision shall toll only the limitation.the plaintiff is under a legal or physical disability which restricts the plaintiff ability to commence legal action.italics added.
a demurrer on the ground of the bar of the statute of limitations does not lie where the complaint merely shows that the action may have been barred.it must appear affirmatively that,upon the facts stated,the right of action is necessarily barred.citations.citations.baright willis d.
outside limitations period 
we address the outside limitations period first.the stueves contend their initial complaint was filed within four years of the occurrence of berger kahn wrongdoings,so their causes of action are not barred by the limitations period.they emphasize that the statute of limitations did not begin to run when the trusts were set up in,which was before they were harmed through the diversion of assets.
moreover,in their second amended complaint,they alleged that berger kahn committed particular misdeeds in and.for example,the stueves alleged that attorney allen engaged in the following wrongdoings while at berger kahn the formation of clarke novell llc and gsf acquisitions in december to siphon off assets the formation of firma funding llc in to divert assets the borrowing of or more,from companies owned by the stueves,in april and again in january and the preparation and effectuation of a to step plan to divert assets through a series of promissory notes,loan purchase agreements,loan assignments and other documents.furthermore,the stueves alleged that attorney allen made false representations at meetings with the stueves on february,and february.
although the record on appeal does not contain a copy of the original complaint,the parties agree that the complaint was filed on september.it is simple to see that,at a minimum,the statute of limitations did not begin to run as to against berger kahn in,before the firm entered the picture,and that the outside limitations period did not bar all claims,inasmuch as many of the alleged wrongdoings took place within four years of the filing of the initial complaint.it is not necessarily the case,however,that every alleged wrong was committed within four years of the filing of the lawsuit.this being the case,we turn to the tolling issues.
tolling during continued representation 
under california law,the statute of limitations for attorney malpractice claims arising from a given matter is tolled for the duration of the attorney representation of the client in that matter.code civ,subd.a.beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp cal th.berger kahn,relying upon beal bank,says that code of civil procedure section,subdivision a did not continue to toll the statute of limitations after attorney allen left the firm.berger kahn is correct.
the supreme court in beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp,supra,cal th,in analyzing code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,made clear that w hen an attorney leaves a firm and takes a client with him or her,the tolling in ongoing matters does not continue for claims against the former firm and partners.beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp,supra,cal th at.it further stated that an action against a law firm is tolled so long as that firm continues representation,just as an action against an attorney is tolled so long as that attorney continues representation,but representation by one attorney or firm does not toll claims that may exist against a different,unaffiliated attorney or firm.id.at.as applied to the facts before us,this means the statute of limitations against berger kahn was tolled under subdivision a only until attorney allen left the firm at the end of june.
tolling during willful concealment 
the stueves contend that the running of the code of civil procedure section statute of limitations was also tolled under subdivision a thereof applicable only to the outside limitations period,because of willful concealment by attorney allen and berger kahn.berger kahn,however,maintains that any tolling period can not have lasted longer under subdivision a than under subdivision a.in other words,it asserts,for both factual and legal reasons,that even if the running of the statute of limitations had been tolled due to fraudulent concealment,the period of the tolling would have ended no later than the date attorney allen left the firm.
this is a matter we need not resolve.because the limitations period was tolled under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a until the date attorney allen left berger kahn,and the lawsuit was filed within four years of that date,the causes of action to which section applies were timely under its limitations period,unless its limitations period expired sooner.that is a matter that will need to be determined on remand,as we discuss below.
limitations period 
code of civil procedure section a makes the plaintiff actual or constructive discovery of the defendant wrongdoing an element of its limitations defense,it does not nor does any other law make the plaintiff actual or constructive discovery of the defendant wrongdoing an element of a prima facie claim for attorney malpractice.citations.samuels mix cal th.put another way,defendant,if he is to avail himself of the statute limitation defense,has the burden of proving,under the traditional allocation of the burden of proof citations,that plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the facts alleged to constitute defendant wrongdoing more than one year prior to filing the action.id.at.
furthermore,t he question of when there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action,especially in malpractice cases,is essentially a question of fact and i t is only where reasonable minds can draw but one conclusion from the evidence that the question becomes a matter of law.citations.citations.further,where there is a professional relationship,the degree of diligence in ferreting out the negligence for the purpose of the statute of limitations is diminished.citation.citations.baright willis,supra,d at.
a knowledge of buchalter nemer 
berger kahn contends that upon attorney allen hiring by buchalter nemer in july,the stueves knew or should have known of the facts constituting berger kahn allegedly wrongful acts or omissions.as a corollary,berger kahn argues the statute of limitations ran in july,more than two years before the stueves filed their original complaint.
in fashioning this argument,berger kahn first says that buchalter nemer knowledge should be imputed to the stueves.berger kahn cites laukkare abramson d,which states it is well established that the knowledge of an agent is imputed to his principal and also that the knowledge of an attorney is imputed to his clients.id.at.however,in none of the cases berger kahn cites was the attorney knowledge that he had wronged his client imputed to his law firm and reimputed to the client.rather,in those cases,the attorney knowledge was imputed to the client where the actions of an unaffiliated third party gave rise to a cause of action on behalf of the client.see stalberg western title ins.d attorney knowledge of title company misconduct imputed to client laukkare abramson,supra,d attorney knowledge of rejected creditor claim imputed to client.
moreover,where a malevolent agent actions are hostile to his principal,we neither presume that the agent will disclose those actions to his principal nor impute the agent knowledge of his own misdeeds to his principal.witty clinch cal.applying the same logic,we see no reason to impute attorney allen knowledge of the misdeeds of kahn to buchalter nemer as the new agent of the stueves any more than we would impute that knowledge directly to the stueves.
furthermore,the double imputation rule berger kahn suggests would eviscerate the code of civil procedure section knew or should have known rule.in other words,in every case where the client had no actual knowledge of the attorney misdeeds,the own attorney knowledge would be imputed first from himself or herself to the law firm and second from the law firm to the client,such that in all events it would be said that the client should have known what his or her malfeasant attorney knew.were that the correct application of the rule,the legislature might as well have said that the statute of limitation begins to run from the date the attorney commits the misdeed,whether the client has actual knowledge or not,at least in every case in which the attorney is not a sole practitioner.clearly,this is not what the legislature intended.see baright willis,supra,d at,fn.not the case that plaintiff should have known about malpractice cause of action just because he asked a second attorney about his rights.
on a different point,berger kahn says the stueves are bound by their own judicial admissions to the effect that buchalter nemer had actual and constructive knowledge of attorney allen wronging.berger kahn cites three provisions of the second amended complaint in support of its position.
it cites the portion of the second amended complaint wherein the stueves say attorney allen became affiliated with buchalter nemer in july and that buchalter,by and through its attorney employee allen,conspired and agreed to conspire or lent material support in conjunction with novell to defraud the stueves and stueve estate.additionally,buchalter knew or should have known allen was engaged in a scheme to defraud the stueves.buchalter employed a team of professionals including employees anne danley and george kunzelman who had independent knowledge and assisted allen and buchalter in this scheme.these allegations do not state,however,that buchalter nemer or its employees knew or should have known that attorney allen conspired with attorney novell to defraud the stueves during the time that attorney allen was affiliated with berger kahn.
berger kahn also cites a portion of the second amended complaint wherein the stueves allege that buchalter nemer was liable for the negligent hiring,supervision and retention of attorney allen because buchalter nemer knew or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that attorney allen lacked integrity,honesty competence because lawsuits against attorney allen were a matter of public record,such that buchalter nemer was on constructive notice.
however,the cases berger kahn cites do not stand for the proposition that when a law firm is alleged to have constructive notice that an attorney in its employ has been sued previously,this constructive knowledge should be imputed to the client such that it can be said the client knew or should have known the attorney had committed a wrong against him or her.if anything,the client would only be deemed to have the same constructive notice as the law firm notice that the attorney was alleged to have wronged someone else not notice that the attorney had wronged the client.
finally,berger kahn insists that,because the stueves alleged that,for the purposes of the negligent hiring cause of action,buchalter nemer had constructive notice of lawsuits of record,they concede that with reasonable diligence they themselves could have discovered the facts upon which their own lawsuit was based.we must disagree.even assuming the prior lawsuits against attorney allen were matters of public record that should have been discovered by buchalter nemer a matter we do not decide,the stueves only allege this means the law firm should have known he was lacking in integrity and should not have hired him.it does not follow from this allegation that the stueves themselves,as lay persons,should have discovered such lawsuits and also should have known they showed attorney allen had wronged both the plaintiffs in those lawsuits and the stueves themselves as well.berger kahn citation to wilshire westwood associates atlantic richfield th does not convince us otherwise.
in any event,there is a difference between alleging facts and propounding legal theories.the stueves alleged as a matter of fact that there were lawsuits of record before buchalter nemer hired attorney allen.they are bound by this factual allegation.this does not mean that they are bound by a legal theory that lawsuits of record in the courthouse put all members of the public on constructive notice of their existence akin to a lis pendens.although t he admission of fact in a pleading is a judicial admission valerio andrew youngquist construction th,the offering of one legal theory in a pleading does not necessarily preclude the pleader from offering a different legal theory as well dang smith th.
b knowledge of attorney novell 
as a general rule,the trustee is the real party in interest with standing to sue and defend on the trust behalf.citations.estate of bowles,supra,th at.here,attorney novell,as trustee,was the person with the power to bring suit on behalf of the trusts.berger kahn says that attorney novell knew of the purportedly wrongful acts or omissions of attorney allen at the time those acts or omissions were committed.consequently,berger kahn argues,the statute of limitations against it must necessarily have run no later than a year after the tolling period under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a ended that is,a year after attorney allen left the firm.in other words,under berger kahn view,a law firm that engages in a breach of trust together with its client,a trustee,is off the hook if the trustee does not report the mutual wrongdoing to the trust beneficiaries for a year after legal representation ends.
in support of this viewpoint,berger kahn cites security first nat.bank ross d.that case is not dispositive.there,the,in his capacity as trustee of his wife testamentary trust,held title to a interest in a piece of property.he,in his individual capacity,acquired the remaining interest in the property at a tax sale.id.at.the beneficiaries of the trust filed objections to an accounting and report filed by the in the probate court,in which he stated that he individually owned of the property.id.at.
the probate court settled the accounting and report and appointed a new trustee.it also ordered the to turn over the trust assets to the new trustee and file a supplemental accounting and report.the supplemental accounting and report described the trust assets as including the interest in the property,but not the other interest.the supplemental accounting and report was contested but ultimately approved by the court.security first nat.bank ross,supra,d at.
sometime thereafter,another successor trustee of the trust was appointed the.the filed a partition action against him with respect to the interest in the property.the filed a for constructive trust and quiet title,seeking to relitigate the ownership of the interest in the trust.security first nat.bank ross,supra,d at.
as a defense,the raised the statute of limitations.the claimed the statute of limitations for fraud did not begin to run before he personally had any knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing by the.the court responded that the predecessor trustee,the trust beneficiaries and the probate court all had knowledge of the facts at least eight years earlier and the statute of limitations was not tolled just because the was not personally aware of the facts at that time.security first nat.bank ross,supra,d at.it further stated that constructive notice of any wrongdoing was given to all interested persons by the nature of the tax sale,the recordation of the tax deeds,and the prior trust proceedings.in addition,it stated that a cause of action for constructive trust due to fraud arises upon acquisition of the property by the wrongdoer.id.at.
despite berger kahn entreaty,we do not read too much into the statement of the court in security first nat.bank ross,supra,d to the effect that there was no tolling of the statute of limitations while the was unaware of the facts.after all,the first successor trustee and the trust beneficiaries had become aware of the facts many years earlier and had had every opportunity to litigate the matter.id.at.there was no reason to resurrect a dead statute of limitations just because a second successor trustee entered the picture.in the matter before us,in contrast,the party seeking to pursue the litigation on behalf of the trusts is the first successor trustee appointed to replace attorney novell,not a second successor trustee seeking to relitigate.
more importantly,as the stueves point out,our supreme court has stated that since the rule imputing to the principal the knowledge of the agent rests upon the presumption that the agent will communicate his information,the rule is inapplicable where the facts are such that the presumption of communication does not exist,as where the agent,in the particular transaction in question,is acting in an adverse interest to that of his principal.in such transactions the attitude of the agent is one of hostility to the principal,and it would be absurd to suppose that he would communicate to the principal any facts within his private knowledge affecting the subject of his dealing,unless it would be his duty to do so if he were wholly unconnected with the principal.witty clinch,supra,cal.at.
clearly,it would be absurd to presume that attorney novell would disclose attorney kahn misdeeds to the stueves,inasmuch as the disclosure would expose his own wrongdoings as well.in this context,we do not impute attorney novell knowledge to the stueves.witty clinch,supra,cal.at.
berger kahn citation to sanfran rees blow pipe d does not change our analysis.in that case,a defendant corporation was sued for nondisclosure of the fact that the building located on property it sold to the plaintiff did not comply with building code requirements.id.at.because the corporate representative who had pulled the building permit was bound to know the contents of the permit and the fact that the building was out of compliance,his knowledge was imputed to the defendant corporation.id.at.
that case is distinguishable from the matter before us.here,the entities in question,stueve brothers farms,llc and stueve.farms of delano,llc,are the plaintiffs who have filed suit against a third party,berger kahn.the question is whether the knowledge of their manager,attorney novell,about the actions of attorney kahn should be imputed to the plaintiff entities,where the manager attorney novell was allegedly conspiring with attorney kahn to deprive the entities of their assets.in this context,sanfran rees blow pipe,supra,d is inapposite and we follow the viewpoint of witty clinch,supra,cal,that the knowledge of the conniving agent is not imputed to the principal.
c reasonable diligence 
berger kahn also asserts that the stueves,through the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have discovered the alleged wrongdoings earlier.it says,for example,that family members boyd and noah clarke had involvement with one of the trusts and noah clarke was involved in clarke novell llc.it also says that harold and david stueve were officers and directors of certain entities at issue in the litigation.similarly,berger kahn takes issue with the assertion that the stueves had no reason to know about any wrongdoings before earl stueve died in and his widow asked about life insurance.it says that other senior stueves had died earlier and the plaintiffs should have been tipped off then,when no life insurance proceeds were paid.
this may turn out to be the case in the end we do know.a demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,but is not n
