we have for review a decision of a district court of appeal on the following question,which the court certified to be of great public importance 
if a plaintiff files a lawsuit seeking to enforce only those rights enumerated in section,must the plaintiff comply with the presuit conditions in section 
integrated health care services,so d,dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
from october to february,albert redway was a resident at an integrated health services ihs nursing home.immediately thereafter,he resided at the bon secours maria manor bon secours until his death in april of.pauline,the personal representative for the estate of albert redway,sued ihs and bon secours,alleging that both nursing homes violated redway statutory rights as provided under section,florida statutes.relative to defendant bon secours the complaint alleged that bon secours violated section when it failed to assure that redway received adequate health care and support services,prevent his pressure sores and treat such sores after they occurred,maintain accurate medical or clinical records including its failure to adequately document redway injuries,protect him from unexplained injuries and prevent him from falling at the facility,adequately monitor his nutritional intake,adequately monitor significant signs and symptoms of infection,and train,supervise,and retain a proper staff.the complaint specifically stated that it was founded on duties imposed by section.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on several grounds,including the allegation that despite the fact that the plaintiff had fulfilled the presuit requirements under section,she had failed to fulfill the presuit requirements under chapter,florida statutes a necessary step before bringing a medical negligence action.the trial court denied the motion to dismiss,and bon secours appealed.the second district court of appeal affirmed,noting that 
the complaint alleges violations of redway rights as a nursing home resident exclusively under section.it includes a claim for wrongful death and,in the alternative,a claim for damages if the defendant negligence did not cause redway death.however,both claims are based upon a violation of a statutory right instead of a common law right.the complaint does not name or identify any physician or other health care provider as a defendant.see.stat.citing b.stat.although the complaint alleges that redway did not receive adequate and appropriate health care at the facilities as a statutory claim under section l,the plaintiff does not allege any common law theory attempting to make the defendants vicariously liable for a breach of a professional standard of care by a health care provider.
in cases involving vicarious liability of nursing homes for the actions of their employees,determining whether the presuit requirements of chapter are invoked has been a difficult task for the judiciary.see weinstock groth,so d nme properties,mccullough,so d dca liles medfield,so d dca.in general,a plaintiff must comply with these conditions if it seeks to make a defendant vicariously liable for the actions of a health care provider under the medical negligence standard of care set forth in section.see weinstock,so d at lake shore,clarke,so d dca.this complaint does not seek vicarious liability for the actions of a health care provider under a medical negligence standard.
the defendants arguments in this case are based,in part,upon a misunderstanding of dicta contained in nme properties.in that case,we suggested that a nursing home could be liable under a professional standard of care for the actions of a licensed nurse.see nme properties,so d at.such a nurse is a health care provider for the purposes of section,and we continue to believe that a nursing home could be liable,on a common law claim,for the actions of such a licensed nurse.thus,if a complaint contained both a count alleging a violation of chapter and a separate claim for professional malpractice under the common law,the presuit requirements of chapter would probably apply to the lawsuit.
the defendants misread nme properties as requiring compliance with the presuit requirements of chapter when a plaintiff alleges only a breach of the statutory right to receive adequate and appropriate health care and protective and support services under section l w e reject such a requirement.
integrated health care services,so d,dca footnote omitted.the district court of appeal then recognized that this issue,whether the presuit conditions in chapter apply to claims filed under chapter has been a difficult issue of statewide concern and,accordingly,certified the above question as one of great public importance.
discussion 
stated simply,the issue presented in this case is whether a plaintiff alleging that a nursing home violated its statutory duty to provide adequate and appropriate health care must comply with two separate presuit requirements.before answering this question,we first examine the relevant statutory provisions of chapter and chapter,florida statutes.chapter provides certain statutory prerequisites to the filing of a lawsuit involving a medical malpractice claim while chapter sets forth statutory prerequisites for filing a suit against a nursing home.
in,the legislature made explicit findings,recognizing that medical malpractice claims resulted in increased medical care costs for most patients and prevented some physicians from being able to obtain malpractice insurance.in an attempt to alleviate these problems,the legislature structured a statutory scheme that would encourage the early settlement of meritorious claims while screening out frivolous claims.see ch,at,laws of.
pursuant to section,presuit investigation requirements apply to all medical negligence claims,a term which is defined as medical malpractice,whether grounded in tort or in contract.stat.the claimant bringing such an action must investigate and corroborate that there are reasonable grounds to believe that all named defendants were negligent in the care and treatment and that such negligence resulted in the claimant injury 
presuit investigation of medical negligence claims and defenses pursuant to this section and ss.shall apply to all medical negligence,including dental negligence,claims and defenses 
prior to issuing notification of intent to initiate medical malpractice litigation pursuant to,the claimant shall conduct an investigation to ascertain that there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
a any named defendant in the litigation was negligent in the care or treatment of the claimant and 
b such negligence resulted in injury to the claimant.
corroboration of reasonable grounds to initiate medical negligence litigation shall be provided by the claimant submission of a verified written medical expert opinion from a medical expert as defined in,at the time the notice of intent to initiate litigation is mailed,which statement shall corroborate reasonable grounds to support the claim of medical negligence.
stat.after the claimant completes the presuit investigation,she or he must then notify each prospective defendant of the intent to initiate litigation prior to filing a claim for medical malpractice.see a.stat.if the defendant is a licensed physician,osteopath,chiropractor,podiatrist,or dentist,the plaintiff must also notify the department of business and professional regulation.after the presuit investigation is complete,the parties may elect to enter voluntary binding arbitration pursuant to sections.
in reviewing chapter,courts have been plagued by a lack of comprehensive definitions including a definitive statement as to who are considered health care providers covered by chapter presuit requirements.for example,throughout chapter,the term health care provider has three different definitions,the broadest of which defines health care provider as 
hospitals licensed under chapter physicians licensed under chapter osteopaths licensed under chapter podiatrists licensed under chapter dentists licensed under chapter chiropractors licensed under chapter naturopaths licensed under chapter nurses licensed under chapter clinical laboratories regi
