defendant glenn andrew neasham,a licensed insurance agent,appeals his conviction for committing theft from an elder and dependent adult by selling her an annuity policy which the prosecutor argued to the jury was an unsuitable product for her age despite its approval for sale to such a person by the california department of insurance.although there was conflicting evidence as to the elder inability to understand the nature of the transaction,there was no evidence that defendant appropriated the elder funds to his own use or to the benefit of anyone other than the elder herself,nor was there evidence that defendant made any misrepresentations or used any artifice in connection with the sale.moreover,the jury was incorrectly instructed that to convict it need find only that the purchase of the annuity deprived the elder of a major portion of the value or enjoyment of her property,eliminating the necessity of proving that defendant had any such intention.hence,defendant conviction must be reversed.
background 
in early february,year old fran schuber and the year old man with whom she had been living for years,louis jochim,made an unsolicited visit to defendant office to discuss the purchase of an annuity by schuber.jochim had been a client of defendant for some years and had previously purchased an annuity from him,which he considered a good investment.according to jochim,fran thought she wanted to do the same thing i was doing.
the particular annuity that was discussed and which schuber purchased is labeled a masterdex annuity and is issued by allianz life insurance company of north america allianz.the annuity is approved by the california department of insurance for sale to persons through the age of years.the premium schuber paid for the annuity was,to which allianz adds a premium bonus if the policy is annuitized after the fifth year,so that the annuitization value of the policy becomes plus accrued interest.under the terms of the policy,interest on the principal accrued at percent per annum the first year and at no less than percent per annum thereafter.except in the event of the annuitant extended confinement to a hospital or certain care facilities after the policy has been in effect for one year,the policy imposes a substantial penalty for the withdrawal of more than percent of the principal during the first five years of the policy thereafter,installments are paid to the annuitant over the following years.as of the time of trial in october,the policy had a secondary market value of.at the expiration of the waiting period in february,the value of the policy would be,with the right to receive monthly payments of,totaling over the year period.
the policy authorizes the annuitant to assign or transfer ownership rights of the policy and permits the annuitant to borrow up to half of the cash surrender value of the policy,not to exceed,at an interest rate of percent in advance.in the event of the death of the annuitant,the beneficiary named in the policy here jochim receives all remaining unpaid benefits.
defendant received a commission of approximately percent from allianz upon the purchase of the annuity.
there was evidence that when schuber and jochim met with defendant on february,defendant explained the terms of the masterdex annuity,contrasted those terms and benefits with the terms of certificates of deposit,and that schuber signed,among other documents,a form acknowledging that she had read the information setting out the values and factors that affect the value of the annuity,that the information had been explained to her by defendant,and that she understood that the values shown,other than the guaranteed minimum values,were not promises or guarantees.jochim testified that schuber was very clear in her mind at that time.defendant former assistant who was present for much of the conversation testified that s he seemed like a very competent woman to me.she knew what she was doing and what she was signing and everything that entailed that.she did seem like somebody who did understand what she was doing.another former assistant,who was present when defendant conducted a subsequent review of the policies with schuber and jochim,testified that schuber told defendant she definitely understood the policy.at one point,the examination continued 
and was she asked any questions during that interview if you remember 
defendant always asked,are you sure you understand what you sic choices are what going on and those are the kinds of questions that were asked and she answered.
and then did she repeat back her understanding besides just saying yes 
a.a couple times,yes,and she did understand.
okay.what did she say 
a.she explained to defendant she understood that if she takes out early there going to be a big surrender penalty 
from defendant office,schuber and jochim went to the bank to withdraw from a certificate of deposit that schuber held.defendant called the bank before schuber arrived to advise that she was coming and told the bank employee,susie robinson,that he would report the matter to the district attorney if there was any delay in making the withdrawal.from past dealings,robinson believed that schuber had memory problems,schuber having come to the bank many times to inquire who the beneficiary of her certificate of deposit was,and several times to change the beneficiary.robinson testified that when schuber and jochim arrived at the bank after defendant call,she became concerned that schuber was confused and was being influenced by jochim robinson telephoned defendant and told him that schuber did not understand the transaction but issued her a check for payable to allianz,which schuber brought to defendant.when defendant delivered the annuity policy to schuber on february,both she and jochim signed a handwritten statement prepared by defendant confirming that schuber purchased a tax deferred fixed indexed annuity,that jochim was her chosen beneficiary,and that she knew certain of its terms.
after schuber left the bank with the check on february,robinson contacted a social worker at the department of social services,advising that schuber had withdrawn and the bank felt that her boyfriend was exerting undue influence on her.as a result of this alert to potential elder abuse,over the succeeding months schuber and others were interviewed by several government investigators who testified at trial.in short,these investigators and others,including schuber son and,testified that in their interactions with schuber both before and after her purchase of the annuity,schuber was generally confused,forgot what she had just been told,and indicated in many ways that she was suffering from dementia.the people evidence included a video recording of an august,conversation between schuber and an investigator from the district attorney office reflecting schuber condition at that time,which the investigator compared to what he testified was her appearance when he interviewed her in april and which other witnesses compared to the condition they testified she reflected when they spoke with her on earlier occasions.
by a complaint filed on december,and an information filed on april,defendant was charged with committing a violation of s ection d of the california penal code,in that said defendant on or about the day of february,to the day of february,committed theft and embezzlement with respect to the property of an elder and dependent adult,said property having a value exceeding,and knew and reasonably should have known that said person,fran schuber,was an elder and dependent adult.the information also contained special allegations under sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a that the theft was of property in excess of and,respectively.
at the conclusion of trial,the jury was instructed that to find defendant guilty of violating penal code section the prosecution must prove,among other elements,that the defendant committed theft.to find defendant guilty of grand theft by larceny in violation of section,it was necessary that the prosecution prove the following.the defendant took possession of property owned by someone else.the defendant took the property without the owner consent.when the defendant took the property he intended to deprive the owner of it permanently or removed it from the owner possession for so extended a period of time that the owner would be deprived of a major portion of the value or enjoyment of the property and.the defendant moved the property,even a small distance,and kept it for any period of time,however brief.the jury was also instructed that to consent to an act or transaction,a person must act freely and voluntarily and not under the influence of threats,force or duress must have knowledge of the true nature of the act or transaction involved and must possess the mental capacity to make an intelligent choice whether or not to do something proposed by another person.merely being passive does not amount to consent.consent requires a free will and positive cooperation in act or attitude.
the jury was further instructed that if the defendant obtained property under a claim of right,he did not have the intent required for the crime of theft.the defendant obtained property under a claim of right if he believed in good faith that he had a right to the specific property or a specific amount of money,and he openly took it.in deciding whether the defendant believed that he had a right to the property and whether he held that belief in good faith,consider all the facts known to him at the time he obtained the property,along with all the other evidence in the case.the defendant may hold a belief in good faith even if the belief is mistaken or unreasonable.but if the defendant was aware of facts that made that belief completely unreasonable,you may conclude that the belief was not held in good faith.finally,the jury was also instructed that if you find that the defendant believed that fran schuber had the ability to consent to the contract into which she entered with him,he did not have the specific intent or mental state required for theft from an elder adult.
the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of violating section,subdivision d,but found that the amount of the theft was not over or following the denial of motions,defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
section,subdivision d prescribes the punishment for any person not a caretaker who violates any provision of law proscribing theft,embezzlement,forgery,or fraud with respect to the property of an elder or a dependent adult,and who knows or reasonably should know that the victim is an elder or a dependent adult.the provision of law that now proscribes theft and embezzlement is section,subdivision a,which provides in relevant part that e very person who shall feloniously steal,take,carry,lead,or drive away the personal property of another,or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her,or who shall knowingly and designedly,by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense,defraud any other person of money is guilty of theft.since,section has thus incorporated into a single statute what formerly were the three separate offenses of a larceny,the common law crime involving a trespassory violation of possession b embezzlement,the statutory offense of appropriation by a fiduciary in lawful possession and c obtaining title to property by false pretenses witkin epstein,law ed.crimes against property,people williams cal th,d,people brock th,d.the consolidation did not create new crimes or enlarge the scope of any of the three old ones.hence,it is necessary to prove the substantive elements of one of the offenses,and prior decisions on the elements of larceny,embezzlement,and false pretenses are still authority.witkin epstein,supra,at people davis cal th,d.recognizing that the elements of the former offenses differ,the standard criminal instructions approved by the judicial council contain several different instructions defining the elements of theft that may be appropriate in particular cases calcrim,entitled theft by larceny the instruction given in the present case in modified form,as discussed below calcrim,entitled theft by false pretense calcrim,entitled theft by trick and calcrim,entitled theft by embezzlement.
the elements of theft by larceny are well settled the offense is committed by every person who takes possession of personal property owned or possessed by another,by means of trespass and with intent to steal the property,and carries the property away.citations.the act of taking personal property from the possession of another is always a trespass unless the owner consents to the taking freely and unconditionally.people davis,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
under the instructions that were given in this case,to convict it was necessary that the jury find defendant took possession of schuber funds knowing that she did not have the ability to make an intelligent decision to purchase the annuity.defendant and the amici argue that the evidence was insufficient to support findings that schuber did not understand the essential terms of the annuity when she decided to purchase it or that defendant should have realized her incapacity.there is some force to this argument since all of the witnesses to the discussions between schuber and defendant confirm schuber apparent comprehension at the time of their conversations,and prosecution witnesses acknowledged that persons with dementia can have periods of apparent lucidity.nonetheless,we shall assume the testimony that before and after the purchase of the annuity,investigators and family members observed schuber as confused,forgetful,and giving indications of dementia was sufficient to support findings that schuber was incapable of giving informed consent to the transaction and that her condition at that time was such that it should have been apparent to defendant but people brock,supra,th,d reversing conviction for elder abuse by theft based on instruction that weakness of mind could render ineffective elder consent to delivery of funds to defendant the people provide no reason in law or logic for concluding that the same factors that make a contract voidable or a will ineffective should,without more,justify a criminal conviction for theft.
even assuming that schuber was incapable of giving effective consent to the purchase of the annuity,defendant acceptance of payment for the annuity can not be considered a trespassory taking of possession of her property within the meaning of the larceny instruction.this instruction applies to situations where a defendant physically takes property from another actual or constructive possession.people beaver th,d.defendant received schuber cashier check payable to allianz and transmitted it to the insurance company,which issued her the annuity policy.he did not take her funds or convert her property for his own use or the use of any other person as the amici argue,he did not deprive her of any property but instead placed her funds into an investment instrument of equal value to the monies withdrawn from her certificate of deposit.the annuity was issued in schuber name and she at all times was the owner of that policy.for days after its issuance,she had the unqualified right to cancel the policy and receive back the full price paid for the policy.while the prosecution placed great emphasis on the penalty she might have incurred had she withdrawn more than percent of the policy value within five years of its issuance,there was no evidence that schuber had any intention or need to make such a withdrawal,the penalty did not apply if she became hospitalized or moved to a care facility and,most importantly,there was no evidence that this standard term reduced the value of the policy to less than she paid for it 
the prosecutor argued,and the jury apparently agreed,that transferring her funds from a certificate of deposit to the annuity was not in schuber best interests because of her age that,however,is a matter of judgment over which reasonable persons can,and the witnesses did,disagree.whether or not in schuber best interests,the policy was approved by the california department of insurance for sale to persons of schuber age.treating the sale to schuber as a trespassory ta
