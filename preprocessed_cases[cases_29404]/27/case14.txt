if the beneficiary of an erisa plan has lost her status as a beneficiary,due to what she claims is the plan administrator breach of fiduciary duty,does she then have standing to sue the administrator under erisa a,a appellant jean mikulis retired early from blue cross,relying on what she claims was a promise from blue cross to provide her with lifetime health benefits.appellant elizabeth melley is the widow of a blue cross retiree.both women lost their lifetime health benefits when the blue cross plan was retroactively changed on january.after their benefits had been terminated,they intervened in a class action that had been brought by other plan participants and beneficiaries to challenge the retroactive changes.the district court dismissed mikulis and melley suits under.b for lack of statutory standing.although appellants may have made retirement decisions based on a belief that their retirement medical benefits would continue for their lifetimes,we agree with the district court determination that they do not have statutory standing to bring this action.we will,therefore,affirm.
background 
blue cross blue shield of northeastern pennsylvania blue cross administers the blue cross of northeastern pennsylvania retiree health insurance plan the plan,a welfare benefits plan for blue cross retirees.the plan is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.blue cross is a plan fiduciary under a originally,the plan provided blue cross retirees with lifetime health insurance coverage.blue cross altered the plan in,and then again in and.starting in,the plan coverage changed to a formula that provided a percentage of the cost of the health care plan,based on the number of years of service that an employee had on retirement.the formula required a minimum of years of service.the formula was changed in to require a minimum of years of service.the and changes were applied prospectively to new retirees the benefits of former retirees were not changed.on january,blue cross again amended the plan to provide for a graduated dollar contribution toward health insurance coverage for retirees with at least years of service and to eliminate coverage for surviving spouses of retirees.blue cross applied the plan amendment retroactively to all retirees.
retired blue cross employees have brought a class action against blue cross for breach of fiduciary duty stemming from various changes made in the plan coverage elizabeth melley and jean mikulis are intervenors in the action.mikulis was an employee of blue cross for almost years.she retired at age on february,after being notified by blue cross that,unless she retired by april,her future retirement health benefits would no longer be guaranteed at lifetime but would be subject to a percentage formula based on years of employment.as a result of early retirement,mikulis received a smaller pension from blue cross and reduced social security benefits.mikulis received benefits under the plan until january,when she ceased to be eligible for any benefits under the amended plan.she claims to have relied on having lifetime health coverage in her savings and spending decisions.
melley is the widow of a blue cross retiree.the record does not indicate when melley late husband retired from blue cross,what his age was at retirement,or if he had other employment thereafter.melley received benefits under the plan until january,when she ceased to be eligible for any benefits under the amended plan.
mikulis and melley claim that blue cross knowingly made various material misrepresentations and omissions about plan benefits and amendments.in particular,they maintain that they had no notice before the plan amendment that blue cross could alter the plan.they also allege that blue cross practice of applying plan changes only prospectively led them to believe that any future changes would be prospective.they further claim that they relied upon blue cross misrepresentations and omissions to their detriment.mikulis contends that,but for blue cross misrepresentations and omissions,she would not have taken early retirement.melley alleges that her late husband made retirement and insurance decisions based upon the promise of continuing lifetime health benefits for his spouse,even in the event of his death.
mikulis and melley brought an action under erisa a,a,in which they allege that blue cross breached its fiduciary duties under erisa a,a by amending the plan in and by failing to disseminate accurate information about the terms of retiree medical benefits under the plan.they are seeking either reinstatement in the plan as it existed prior to the amendments,comparable coverage,or its monetary equivalent.
blue cross moved to dismiss pursuant to fed.civ.b,b.the district court construed the motion as a motion to dismiss under rule b because the parties submissions did not include matters outside of the pleadings.the district court found that mikulis and melley did not have standing because they were neither plan participants nor beneficiaries at the time they commenced their suit.accordingly,the district court dismissed both complaints for lack of standing.the district court certified its judgment as final under fed.civ.b.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
erisa statutory standing requirements provide in a and that a civil action may only be brought 
by a participant or beneficiary b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan 
by a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan,or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
the terms participant and beneficiary are defined in erisa 
the term participant means any employee or former employee of an employer,or any member or former member of an employee organization,who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer or members of such organization,or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.
the term beneficiary means a person designated by a participant,or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.
the supreme court has held that 
the term participant is naturally read to mean either employees in,or reasonably expected to be in,currently covered employment,or former employees who have a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or who have a colorable claim to vested benefits.in order to establish that he or she may become eligible for benefits,a claimant must have a colorable claim that he or she will prevail in a suit for benefits,or that eligibility requirements will be fulfilled in the future.this view attributes conventional meanings to the statutory language since all employees in covered employment and former employees with a colorable claim to vested benefits may become eligible.

thus,to bring a civil action under erisa,melley and mikulis must have a colorable claim to plan benefits as the result of their suit.we have interpreted the colorable claim requirement as a lower burden of persuasion than showing likelihood of success on the merits.daniels thomas betts,cir.
mikulis and melley have raised four arguments as to why they fall within the definition of participant or beneficiary and have statutory standing.first,they maintain that they have standing because they are within the zone of interest protected by erisa.second,they claim that they have standing because they have a colorable claim to receive plan benefits in the future as part of an equitable remedy.third,they argue that they have standing because they formerly received plan benefits and they detrimentally relied on blue cross misrepresentations.finally,mikulis contends that she has standing because,but for blue cross misrepresentations and omissions,she would not have retired when she did.
for the reasons stated below,we reject these arguments.
zone of interest 
to bring a civil action under erisa,a plaintiff must have constitutional,prudential,and statutory standing.there is no question of mikulis and melley constitutional standing in this case.they argue,however,that they have prudential standing because they are within the zone of interest that erisa was created to protect and that prudential standing gives them statutory standing.
whether a party has prudential standing depends on whether a plaintiff grievance arguably fall s within the zone of interest protected or regulated by the statutory provision or constitutional guarantee invoked in the suit.bennett spear,d.as a general matter,we have found that statutory standing requirements can eliminate prudential standing restrictions but are presumed not to 
because prudential standing doctrine is and not the product of constitutional restraints on the power of the federal courts to hear claims,congress can eliminate prudential restrictions on standing if it so desires.as a matter of statutory interpretation,however,congress is presumed to incorporate background prudential standing principles,unless the statute expressly negates them.
conte,quaker,cir.the first inquiry,then,is whether congress expressly negated the prudential standing doctrine in passing the statute at issue.id.
we extensively addressed the interplay of prudential and statutory standing in erisa cases in rite aid.we remarked there that in past decisions we had stated that f ar from abrogating the prudential standing doctrine erisa a restricts civil actions brought against a plan administrator to actions brought by a participant or beneficiary.at quoting saporito combustion eng g,cir,vacated on other grounds by combustion eng g,saporito,d.in other words,the language of a sets forth the standing requirements to bring such an prudential and statutory standing 
in that sense,the zone of interest inquiry in the prudential standing analysis for a claims is inextricably tied to the question of whether a plaintiff can meet the definitions of either a participant or beneficiary.
rite aid,at.
rite aid opened the door to some confusion,however,by citing in support of the above quotation on zone of interest the case of vartanian monsanto,cir.in the citation,the rite aid court quoted vartanian parenthetically 
in determining who is a participant,for purposes of standing,the definition found in must be read in the context of traditional concepts of standing the ultimate question is whether the plaintiff is within the zone of interest erisa was intended to protect.
at quoting vartanian,at emphasis original to vartanian.
mikulis and melley have focused on this citation and quotation of vartanian to interpret rite aid to support the proposition that the analysis for statutory standing under erisa is actually the prudential standing zone of interest analysis.
this interpretation is not correct.when we stated in rite aid that the zone of interest inquiry in the prudential standing analysis for a claims is inextricably tied to whether a plaintiff can meet the definitions of either participant or beneficiary,at,we meant that statutory standing requirements in erisa a were essentially a codification of erisa zone of interest we did not mean the inverse,that prudential standing suffices for statutory standing.indeed,it would make little sense for congress to have enacted erisa a to define who may bring suit against a plan administrator if standing to sue were to be determined by the traditional zone of interest prudential standing test.
moreover,despite the citation to vartanian,we did not undertake a zone of interest analysis in rite aid.instead,we focused solely on whether the plaintiff met the erisa definition of participant.this focus is consistent with the conclusion that erisa statutory standing requirements are a codification of the zone of interest analysis.mikulis and melley zone of interest argument does not prevail.
colorable claim to a remedy under erisa 
erisa and define participants and beneficiaries as those who are or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan tracking this language,mikulis and melley second argument is that they have standing because they are plan and they qualify as because they have a colorable claim to receive plan benefits in the future via equitable relief ordering the restoration of the plan to its,status or enjoining the retroactive application of the january,amendment.
blue cross contends that mikulis and melley waived this issue by not raising it before the district court.we do not agree.we find sufficient reference before the district court by mikulis and melley to a colorable claim to vested benefits to convince us that this argument was not waived.
turning to the merits of the colorable claim to benefits argument,blue cross made four objections to it.first,blue cross contends that mikulis and melley have not asserted any claim for reinstatement in the plan under erisa a b but have merely requested monetary damages.blue cross is incorrect.mikulis and melley joint amended class action complaint specifically requested that the court order the defendant to reinstitute the plan as it was in existence prior to the change complained of,enjoin defendant from implementing the revised plan,not to mention award such other legal and equitable relief as the court may deem just and necessary.mikulis second amended complaint only requests any other legal and equitable relief as the court may deem just and necessary.although this is boilerplate,it tracks the language of erisa a b,a b,which provides for participants and beneficiaries to bring suit to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress erisa violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.
second,blue cross argues that under our decision in daniels,at,equitable relief is not a plan benefit.thus,the right to equitable relief can not give standing.this is not a correct reading of daniels.daniels merely determined that monetary damages are not plan benefits.it did not address the question of whether equitable relief could constitute a benefit under a plan.here,mikulis and melley are requesting equitable relief including reinstatement of the plan as it was in existence prior to the changes complained of.the sine qua non of benefits of the plan is to be covered by the plan.
third,blue cross remonstrates that mikulis and melley can not have standing as a result of possible equitable relief because standing must exist at the time a suit is commenced,not at the time of judgment.for constitutional and prudential standing it is well established that standing must exist at the time the suit is commenced and throughout the suit.see,friends of the earth laidlaw envtl,d lujan defenders of wildlife,d pirg magnesium elektron,cir.we have not addressed this issue in regard to statutory standing moreover,because a decision on this issue is not necessary for the outcome of this case,we do not express an opinion on it now 
fourth,blue cross maintains that because the amendment of erisa plans is not a fiduciary act,equitable relief is not available.erisa a,a,authorizes equitable relief only for violations of erisa provisions.the amendment of an erisa plan is not a fiduciary act governed by erisa.lockheed spink,d walling brady,cir.therefore,as the district court correctly noted,blue cross did not violate erisa by amending the plan.
mikulis and melley,however,alleged breaches of fiduciary duty that included not only the amendment of the plan,but also misrepresentations about future plan benefits and coverage.unlike the amendment of the plan,the provision of information about plan benefits and coverage is a
