we granted review in this matter to resolve a conflict among the courts of appeal as to whether the procedural prerequisites to seeking punitive damages in an action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,codified at code of civil procedure section,subdivision a section a,apply to punitive damage claims in actions alleging elder abuse subject to heightened civil remedies under the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act welf,et elder abuse act or act.the court of appeal concluded section a does not apply.we agree,finding nothing in the text,legislative history,or purposes of either section a or the elder abuse act to suggest the legislature intended to afford health care providers that act as elder custodians,and that egregiously abuse the elders in their custody,the special protections against exemplary damages they enjoy when accused of negligence in providing health care.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
lourdes inclan and juan inclan plaintiffs sued covenant care california,and covenant care,defendants,for damages caused by defendants care and treatment of their father,juan inclan decedent,during the approximately eight weeks that decedent,an elder resided at defendants skilled nursing facility in los angeles.more than two years after filing their initial complaint,plaintiffs moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.in their proposed fourth amended complaint,plaintiffs sought damages,including general damages for pain and suffering according to proof,for willful misconduct,intentional infliction of emotional distress,constructive fraud,fraud,battery,false imprisonment,elder abuse,and wrongful death.they also sought punitive damages.
plaintiffs fourth amended complaint contained detailed and specific factual allegations of elder abuse.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that decedent suffered from parkinson disease.plaintiffs contracted with a managed care organization to oversee decedent care,to act within plaintiffs directives,and to inform plaintiffs of any change in decedent condition or other situation requiring their attention.the managed care organization,however,assumed rights and usurped powers over decedent neither contemplated nor agreed to by decedent or plaintiffs.the managed care organization,sometimes in conspiracy with defendants,admitted and ordered the discharge of decedent,without his consent,from various health care facilities,including a convalescent hospital owned and operated by defendants,and withh e ld essential care,treatment and medical services from decedent including food,fluids,medicine,and basic nursing care including basic palliative care.
plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired and otherwise acted with malice and oppression in moving and treating decedent in order to maximize revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs and to avoid regulatory penalties for noncompliance with certain federal and state regulations.at one point,decedent was compelled to transfer to defendants skilled nursing facility.at that facility,defendants provided decedent only with hospice services and deprived him of skilled nursing services to which he was legally entitled.decedent subsequent injury and death flowed in part from defendants actions.
while decedent was at defendants nursing facility,plaintiffs further alleged,defendants knew he was suffering from parkinson disease and was unable to care for his personal needs.defendants nevertheless failed to provide decedent with proper care,nutrition,hydration,and medication.defendants conduct was in conscious disregard of decedent rights and safety.decedent was left in his bed,unattended and unassisted,for excessively long periods.although decedent increasingly could not feed or hydrate himself,he was for long periods not provided assistance with these activities.as a result,decedent was inadequately stimulated,became malnourished,and lost much of his body weight.decedent was left in his excrement for long periods he developed ulcers on his body that exposed muscle and bone and became septic and he also became severely dehydrated.
as decedent deteriorated,he manifested signs and symptoms of starvation,dehydration,neglect,and abuse.plaintiffs alleged that defendants deliberately failed to report such symptoms,neglect,and abuse to public authorities as they were legally required to do.moreover,defendants misrepresented decedent condition and failed to inform plaintiffs of his true condition,thus concealing his deterioration from plaintiffs.
when decedent was transferred out of defendants nursing facility to another facility where he died approximately a week later,plaintiffs alleged,decedent was in such condition that without immediate intervention and aggressive care he would surely die from the effects of starvation,dehydration,and infection.decedent,however,was not transferred to an acute care facility but,rather,to a care setting where,without any care for his acute needs,he languished and deteriorated further.as a direct and proximate result of defendants neglect and abuse,decedent sustained personal injury,including severe emotional distress,and died.
plaintiffs filed their motion for leave to file the fourth amended complaint claiming punitive damages on may.defendants opposed the motion,arguing that under section a,which requires such a motion be filed within two years after the complaint or initial pleading is filed,this was too late.the trial court granted plaintiffs motion,ruling plaintiffs were not required to comply with section a because the causes of action alleged in the fourth amended complaint go beyond mere or simple professional negligence.the court of appeal summarily denied defendants petition for writ relief,and we denied review.
subsequent to the trial court ruling,a different district of the court of appeal issued an opinion in community care rehabilitation center superior court th,d community care.the court in community care held that section a applies to elder abuse actions in which punitive damages are sought,whenever the gravamen of an action is professional is,malfeasance in the provision of health care services.community care,supra,at,d.defendants moved the trial court for reconsideration in light of community care,but the court denied the motion.
the court of appeal again denied defendants petition for writ relief.rejecting community care,the court of appeal ruled that plaintiffs elder abuse claim was exempt from the procedural hurdles created by section.we granted review.
discussion 
as originally enacted in,the elder abuse act established requirements and procedures for mandatory and nonmandatory reporting to local agencies of elder abuse,as defined and the abuse of other dependent adults.the act also addressed local agency investigation and criminal prosecution of such cases.see stats,ch.the act continues to contain such provisions.see generally welf,et 
in,in order to enable interested persons to engage attorneys to take up the cause of abused elderly persons and dependent adults welf,subd.j,the legislature added welfare and institutions code section to the act.that section makes available,to plaintiffs who prove especially egregious elder abuse to a high standard,certain remedies in addition to all other remedies otherwise provided by law welf.specifically,a plaintiff who proves by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for physical abuse,neglect,or financial abuse as these terms are defined in the act,and that the defendant has been guilty of recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice in the commission of such abuse,may recover attorney fees and costs,subd.a,incorporating by reference welf.on the same conditions,a plaintiff who brings suit as the personal representative of a deceased elder is partially relieved of the limitation on damages in a decedent action imposed by code of civil procedure section and thus may recover damages up to for emotional distress suffered by the decedent prior to death.welf,subd.b.
section a provides,in relevant part,that i n any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,no claim for punitive damages shall be included unless the plaintiff within two years after the complaint or initial pleading is filed or not less than nine months before the date the matter is first set for trial,whichever is earlier files a motion demonstrating a substantial probability he or she will prevail on the claim the question presented is whether plaintiffs elder abuse claim is one arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider for the purposes of section a.we have not previously addressed whether a plaintiff seeking heightened remedies under the elder abuse act must comply with section in order to claim punitive damages.
plaintiffs assert that our reasoning in delaney baker,supra,cal th,d,delaney,precludes application of section to elder abuse act causes of action.in delaney,we held unanimously that a cause of action seeking the act heightened remedies for reckless,oppressive,fraudulent,or malicious elder abuse is not based on professional negligence within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section a section of the act that excludes from its purview causes of action based on such negligence.delaney,supra,at,d.our rationale,which we derived from the language and history of the act,was that the legislature intended section to clarify that the acts proscribed by the act do not include acts of simple professional negligence,but refer to forms of abuse or neglect performed with some state of culpability greater than mere negligence.delaney,supra,at,d.
observing that the relevant language in section arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider is similar to the welfare and institutions code section language we construed in delaney based on the health care provider alleged professional negligence,plaintiffs argue we should rule here,as we did there,that causes of action against health care providers that otherwise come within the scope of the elder abuse act are not within the meaning of the section language.delaney,supra,cal th at,d.
factually,as noted,plaintiffs alleged their decedent suffered bodily injury,pain,and suffering including severe emotional distress at defendants hands.more specifically,plaintiffs alleged decedent injuries were caused by defendants willful misconduct in violation of the elder abuse act,consisting in fraudulent business practices,intentional infliction of emotional distress,battery upon,and false imprisonment of decedent.in describing defendants abuse of decedent,plaintiffs specifically alleged despicable and deceptive business practices,as well as other unlawful conduct by defendants,some of which constituted conspiracy and all of which was reckless,intentional,deliberate,or knowing.plaintiffs also alleged that in abusing decedent,defendants consciously disregarded his rights and safety,acting with fraud,oppression,and malice.
in its ordinary sense,professional negligence is failure to exercise knowledge,skill,and care ordinarily employed by members of the profession in good standing.delaney,supra,cal th at,d.hence,such misconduct as plaintiffs,egregious elder be described as mere professional negligence in the ordinary sense of those words.but as defendants point out,in light of our prior pronouncements respecting section a,that fact is not necessarily dispositive.see central pathology service medical clinic,superior court cal th,d,central pathology.
in central pathology,a patient sued a physician and a laboratory,alleging they failed to notify her she was developing cancer when a pap smear the physician performed and sent to the laboratory for analysis revealed the presence of abnormal cells.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d.the patient initial complaint was for negligence in the provision of medical services,but she moved to amend it to add causes of action for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress and to seek punitive damages in connection with those claims.construing section a reference to any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,we concluded the statute applied to the proposed additional intentional tort causes of action,as well as to the ordinary negligence causes of action already contained in the complaint.central pathology,supra,at,d.were we to hold otherwise,we reasoned,injured patients seeking punitive damages in an action involving professional negligence could readily assert that their health care providers committed an intentional tort and thus by artful pleading effectively annul the protection afforded health care providers by that section.id.at,d.
relying primarily on central pathology,defendants argue in effect that even egregious elder abuse arises out of professional negligence a when such abuse is directly related to the professional services provided central pathology,supra,cal th at,d,by a health care provider.defendants acknowledge that,on its face,section a applies only to causes of action arising from negligence,and that in delaney we distinguished between professional negligence and statutory elder abuse.nevertheless,defendants point out,health care providers can at once be subject to liability under the elder abuse act and protected by section a restrictions on the pleading of punitive damages.because central pathology broad phrasing potentially supports this possibility and delaney does not expressly bar it,defendants urge that we declare it to be the law.
notwithstanding the parties focus on central pathology and delaney,resolution of the issue here is not simply an exercise in conforming our result to our previous phraseology.judicial precedent on similar facts may be relevant,but e stablishing terminological uniformity throughout our codified law is less important than discerning the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of each individual statute.delaney,supra,cal th at,d.ultimately,the ascertainment of legislative intent is the paramount principle of statutory interpretation.in re michael cal d.for the following reasons,we agree with the court of appeal that section limitations on actions for damages arising out of professional negligence a were not meant to burden those who pursue the cause of abused elderly persons welf,subd.j under the elder abuse act.
plain language.first,nothing in the text of either section a or the elder abuse act suggests the legislature meant to link the two statutes.while section by its terms applies only to causes of action arising out of negligence a,every cause of action seeking the act heightened civil remedies,by definition,arises out of recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice welf.the earlier enacted section a,of course,contains no reference to the elder abuse act or to elder abuse neither does the subsequently enacted act contain any reference to section a.
it is true that statutory elder abuse includes neglect as defined in section welf,which in turn includes negligent failure of an elder custodian to provide medical care for the elder physical and mental health needs,subd.b.but as we explained in delaney,neglect within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section covers an area of misconduct distinct from professional negligence.as used in the act,neglect refers not to the substandard performance of medical services but,rather,to the failure of those responsible for attending to the basic needs and comforts of elderly or dependent adults,regardless of their professional standing,to carry out their custodial obligations.delaney,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the statutory definition of neglect speaks not of the undertaking of medical services,but of the failure to provide medical care.ibid.notably,the other forms of abuse,as defined in the abuse and fiduciary abuse welf,are forms of intentional wrongdoing also distinct from professional negligence.delaney,supra,at,d.
as we determined in delaney,if the neglect or other abuse is reckless or done with oppression,fraud,or malice,then the action falls within the scope of welfare and institution code section and as such can not be considered simply based on professional negligence that only these egregious acts were intended to be sanctioned under section is further underscored by the fact that the statute requires liability to be proved by a heightened clear and convincing evidence standard.delaney,supra,cal th at,d.
because in delaney we were construing the term professional negligence as used in the elder abuse act,our actual holding did not impinge on the holding of central pathology that professional negligence within the meaning of section can encompass intentional torts.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,our conclusion that the legislature intended the elder abuse act to sanction only egregious acts of misconduct distinct from professional negligence contravenes any suggestion that,in defining elder abuse to include failure to provide medical care,the legislature intended that health care providers,alone among elder custodians,would enjoy under the act the procedural protections they enjoy when sued for negligence in their professional health care practice.see delaney,supra,cal th at,d,discussing the anomaly of such a result.
legislative history.second,nothing in the legislative history of either section a or the elder abuse act suggests the legislature meant to link the two statutes.our past pronouncements succinctly describe the relevant history.see central pathology,supra,cal th at,d,delaney,supra,cal th at,d.
section was added to the code of civil procedure in.as originally enacted,the section was not limited to medical malpractice.the statute provided,no claim for punitive damages against a health care provider shall be included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be filed.stats,ch.the next year the legislature amended the section by incorporating former section into new subdivision a of that section and by altering the first sentence to read,in any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,no claim for punitive damages shall be included stats,ch.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
the legislature enacted the elder abuse act heightened civil damage remedies for egregious elder abuse three years later,in.stats,ch,enacting bill reg.sess.as we recounted in delaney,in the amendments to the act,the legislature shifted the focus in protecting vulnerable and dependent adults from reporting abuse and using law enforcement to combat it,to private,civil enforcement of laws against elder abuse and neglect.t he legislature declared that infirm elderly persons and dependent adults are a disadvantaged class,that cases of abuse of these persons are seldom prosecuted as criminal matters,and few civil cases are brought in connection with this abuse due to problems of proof,court delays,and the lack of incentives to prosecute these suits.welf,subd.h,added by stats,ch.citation.citation.as was stated in the senate rules committee analysis of senate bill,in practice,the death of the victim and the difficulty in finding an attorney to handle an abuse case where attorneys fees may not be awarded,impedes many victims from suing successfully.this bill would address the problem by authorizing the court to award attorney fees in specified cases and by allowing pain and suffering damages to be awarded when a verdict of intentional and reckless abuse was handed down after the abused elder dies.rules,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.delaney,supra,cal th at,d.
as we determined in central pathology,the legislative history of section demonstrates that the legislature intent in enacting the statute was to protect health care providers or practitioners only in their professional capacity as providers there was no intent to protect them in any other capacity.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d.without question,health care provider and elder custodian capacities are conceptually distinct.health care provider means any person licensed or certified pursuant to specified licensing provisions and any licensed clinic,health dispensary,or health facility and their legal representatives,subd.b.neglectful elder abuse,by contrast,as noted,is the failure of those responsible for attending to the basic needs and comforts of elderly or dependent adults,regardless of their professional standing,to carry out their custodial obligations.delaney,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
moreover,the legislative history of the elder abuse act indicates that those who enacted the statute thought that the term professional negligence,within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section,was mutually exclusive of the abuse and neglect specified in welfare and institutions code section as actionable under the act.delaney,supra,cal th at,d.as we have noted,the legislature apparently concluded that the high standard imposed by section and convincing evidence of i liability and ii recklessness,malice,oppression or protects health care providers from liability under the statute for acts of simple or even gross negligence.delaney,supra,at,d.we are not authorized to gainsay that legislative judgment 
defendants argue the legislature failure expressly to exempt elder abuse actions from section obliges us to construe the section as including such actions.in support,they contend that elder abuse,when committed by a health care provider,is an injury that is directly related to the professional services provided by a health care provider acting in its capacity as such central pathology,supra,cal th at,d.defendants argument fails on three counts.
first,the rules of statutory construction defendants,that presumably the legislature knew how to create an exemption if it wished to do so and that courts generally may not insert what the legislature has omitted from a statute see california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d,have no application unless one assumes,at the outset,the facial applicability of section.but section a,which references professional negligence,is not facially applicable to claims for heightened civil remedies under the elder abuse act,which entail recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice welf,subd.a.
second,elder abuse as defined in the act,even when committed by a health care provider,is not an injury that is directly related to the provider professional services.that statutory elder abuse may include the egregious withholding of medical care for physical and mental health needs is not determinative.as a failure to fulfill custodial duties owed by a custodian happens also to be a health care provider,such abuse is at most incidentally related to the provider professional health care services.
that is,claims under the elder abuse act are not brought against health care providers in their capacity as providers but,rather,against custodians and caregivers that abuse elders and that may or may not,incidentally,also be health care providers.statutorily,as well as in common parlance,the function of a health care provider is distinct from that of an elder custodian,and the fact that some health care institutions,such as nursing homes,perform custodial functions and provide professional medical care delaney,supra,cal th at,d,italics added does not mean that the two functions are the same.
third,the legislature did not have the benefit of our opinion in central pathology either when it limited section a to damage actions arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider stats,ch,or three years later when it added heightened civil remedies to the elder abuse act stats,ch.accordingly,regardless of its language,central pathology affords no basis for concluding the legislature intended its reference in section a to professional negligence to encompass elder abuse,let alone as yet uncreated statutory causes of action for elder abuse committed with recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice welf.nor does the opinion afford any basis for deeming the legislature to have intended,when adding heightened civil remedies as an incentive to the prosecution of elder abuse actions,that section a restrict the availability of those remedies 
statutory purposes.the fundamental legislative purp
