opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before the court on an appeal by sandra register,grace merchant,susan wilson,kristina beckman,john daggett,and richard rhoades,appellants,from the district court order entered on november,granting pnc financial services group,pnc bank,na,pension committee of pnc financial services group.pension plan,and pnc financial services group.pension plans collectively pnc motion to dismiss appellants amended complaint.see register pnc fin.serv.group,civ,wl.the dismissed amended complaint alleged that pnc conversion of its pension plan from a traditional defined benefit plan to a cash balance plan violated certain provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the most significant issue on this appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that the pnc cash balance plan does not discriminate against older employees on the basis of their age.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court november,order in all respects.
ii.facts and procedural history 
the relevant facts,except in one respect that we discuss later when dealing with the adequacy of a summary plan description that pnc supplied to plan participants,are not in dispute.before,pnc maintained a traditional defined benefit pension plan for its employees providing that a participant normal retirement age benefit was calculated by multiplying a fixed percentage for service up to and including years and for service in excess of years with the participant years of service and final average pay.the plan also provided that if the employee retired after age but before age,he could obtain early retirement benefits consisting of a portion of his normal retirement benefits.
as of january,pnc switched to a cash balance plan,which is a particular form of defined benefit plan.under the cash balance plan,pnc established a bookkeeping account known as a cash balance account for every participant.the new plan took the benefits that accrued under the traditional plan and restated them as opening hypothetical cash balance accounts for each participant.the accounts were hypothetical because they did not reflect actual contributions to accounts or actual gains and losses allocable to the accounts,but,instead,reflected a value pnc imputed to the hypothetical accounts in the form of annual credits.
when pnc converted its traditional plan to a cash balance plan,the early retirement benefits of the old plan were frozen and the participants were given the option of either receiving the accrued but frozen early retirement benefits or the benefit they would have accrued under the cash balance plan,whichever was greater.the benefits for those participants that chose to receive the accrued early retirement benefits were frozen from the date of conversion until their account balances under the cash balance plan exceeded the accrued early retirement benefits.
the pnc cash balance plan provides for two types of credits to participants earnings or pay credits and interest credits.the plan states the earnings credit as a percentage of compensation determined by allocating points for combined age and years of service.the earnings credit ranges from of compensation for participants with less than years of combined age and years of service to of compensation for participants with years or more of combined age and years of service.the second component of the hypothetical account,the interest credit,is determined using an annual interest rate based on the treasury rate.the interest credit accrues at the same time that the underlying earnings credit accrues and is projected through age to offset things such as increased cost of living,inflation,when a participant employment with pnc ends,the participant may withdraw his hypothetical account balance as a lump sum,convert the account balance into an immediate life annuity,or defer the receipt of a lump sum payment or life annuity until a later date.
in,a group of plan participants who were current and former pnc employees and pension plan beneficiaries brought suit against pnc claiming that the pnc cash balance plan violated various erisa provisions.first,they alleged that the plan violated the erisa provision,b b,because the participants that chose to retain the accrued but frozen early retirement benefits did not receive additional benefit accruals until the cash balance plan benefit caught up to their frozen prior plan benefit count i.second,they contended that an employee benefit accrual decreases because of age in violation of the erisa defined benefit plan provision,id.at b h i count ii.third,they alleged that pnc violated erisa notice,id.at h,and fiduciary duty requirements,id.at counts 
on may,pnc filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.the district court granted pnc motion to dismiss all counts for failure to state a claim under.b.appellants have appealed from that order to this court.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under and e.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and.in reviewing a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,our review is plenary and we apply the same test as the district court.maio aetna,cir.a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b may be granted only if,accepting all allegations in the complaint as true,and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,plaintiff is not entitled to relief.id.at quoting in re burlington coat factory,cir.the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.id.at quoting burlington coat factory,at internal quotations omitted.
iv.discussion 
a.the pnc cash balance plan does not violate erisa provision.what is a plan 
there are two general types of pension plans defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.a defined contribution plan is a pension plan in which an individual account is established for an employee to which his employer and sometimes the employee too contributes a specific amount.see hughes aircraft jacobson,d.the employee is entitled to whatever assets are dedicated to his individual account.id.at.at.the employee bears the investment risks and the employer does not guarantee a retirement benefit to the employee.see.at 
a defined benefit plan,on the other hand,is any plan that is not a defined contribution plan.it is generally a pension plan where the employee is promised a retirement benefit based on a formula the plan sets forth.the plan consists of a general pool of assets rather than individual dedicated accounts.hughes aircraft,at.at.participants in a defined benefit plan have no claim to any particular asset that composes a part of the plan general asset pool,but,instead,receive an annuity based on the retiree earnings history,usually the most recent or highest paid years,and the number of completed years of service to the company.depenbrock cigna,cir quoting campbell bankboston,cir.under a defined benefit plan the entity funding the plan,the employer,bears the investment risks.
the pension plan at issue in this case is a cash balance plan.a cash balance plan,by law,is a form of defined benefit plan and must comply with the statutory regulations applicable to defined benefit plans.see,esden bank of boston,cir.however,in actuality,a cash balance plan is a hybrid between a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan as it contains attributes of both.see,id.at.
a cash balance plan is classified as a defined benefit plan because cash balance plans,like traditional defined benefit plans such as the plan pnc maintained before january,are required to offer payment of an employee benefit in the form of a series of payments for life burstein ret.account plan for employees of allegheny health educ.research,cir quoting dep t of labor,employee benefits sec,frequently asked questions about cash balance pension plans,at,available at.nevertheless,a cash balance plan differs from a traditional defined benefit plan in that traditional defined benefit plans define an employee benefit as a series of monthly payments for life to begin at retirement,but cash balance plans define the benefit in terms of a stated account balance,albeit a hypothetical account.id.thus,cash balance plans are like defined contribution plans in that both define the employee benefit in terms of a stated balance.
cash balance plan accounts are often referred to as hypothetical accounts because they do not reflect actual contributions to an account or actual gains and losses allocable to the account.id.instead,the employer imputes value to the hypothetical account in the form of annual credits.cooper ibm pers.pension plan,cir,cert.denied,d.as is the case here,there are typically two types of credits pay credits or earnings credits,which are hypothetical contributions an employer makes usually expressed as a percentage of wages or salary and may vary with employee tenure,and interest credits,which are hypothetical earnings either a fixed or variable rate linked to an index such as the treasury bill rate on the account balance.see berger xerox.ret.income guarantee plan,cir esden,at.
employers design cash balance plans so that when a participant receives a pay or earnings credit for a year of service,he also receives the right to future interest credits projected out until normal retirement age.when a participant becomes entitled to receive benefits under a cash balance plan,his benefits are defined in terms of an account balance,which then may be converted actuarially into an annuity at the option of the participant.as is true in the case of traditional defined benefit plans,the employer funding the plan bears the investment risks associated with the plan.this risk could be considerable because,unlike in the case of defined contribution plans,cash balance plans accounts grow on the basis of a predetermined formula rather than on the basis of actual earnings.
the competing positions.
in order to understand this case it is essential to recognize that,as we already have indicated,cash balance plans are a type of defined benefit plan.this point is crucial because the classification of cash balance plans as defined benefit plans triggers a host of regulatory provisions applicable to defined benefit plans but not to defined contribution plans.application of the provisions,however,may be difficult because congress enacted erisa and the administrative agencies adopted the defined benefit plan regulations before the creation of cash balance plans and thus before employers such as pnc began converting their extant plans to cash balance plans.thus,the original rules for defined benefit plans simply did not address the unique features and hybrid nature of cash balance plans.this circumstance has required courts,and no doubt persons designing and administering cash balance plans,to face the unenviable task of trying to fit cash balance plans,pension plans with fundamental differences from traditional defined benefit plans and with many attributes of defined contribution plans,within the defined benefit plan framework,a process somewhat similar to placing a round peg into a square hole.as might be expected this task has proven not to be easy,and,as will be seen below,has led courts throughout the country to reach diametrically opposed conclusions with respect to applying erisa provisions to cash balance plans 
one such troublesome provision is erisa defined benefit plan age provision which states 
a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if,under the plan,an employee benefit accrual is ceased,or the rate of an employee benefit accrual is reduced,because of the attainment of any age.
b h i emphasis added.
this provision is the partial source of the disagreements in this case and,indeed,the outcome of this appeal largely is dependent on the meaning of benefit accrual within section b h i.appellants argue that the term benefit accrual refers to the employee retirement benefit the annuity,the output from the plan.appellants contend that the pnc plan is discriminatory because interest credits used to determine the annuity are based on future interest credits projected through the participant normal retirement date.as such,they allege in their amended complaint that the interest credits decrease in value as participants move closer to the normal retirement date.appellants argue that this consequence results in the reduction in the annuity based solely on age in violation of section b h i.
a reader of this opinion might wonder how interest credits could be said to decrease in value with the passage of time as everybody knows that the longer a sum of money draws interest the greater the accumulated interest will be.accordingly,we will explain appellants position by way of example.it really is quite simple.someone who leaves pnc at age after years of service will have a larger annual benefit at age than someone whose years of service conclude with retirement at age because the former receives years more interest than the latter.see cooper,at.
for support of their definition of benefit accrual,appellants point to a,which defines accrued benefit as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.appellants ask us to equate the terms benefit accrual and accrued benefit.thus,the argument goes,when the definition of accrued benefit is inserted into section b h i,the provision invalidates cash balance plans the pnc plan as well as any other conceivable cash balance plan because interest credits,which are projected to age,will have reduced value in terms of the annuity for older employees because they have less time to accrue interest.it should be obvious that the potential impact of this appeal therefore is enormous with respect to cash balance plans indeed,the district court stated its view,with which we agree,that appellants argument,if accepted,would mean that all cash balance plans violate the erisa age discrimination provision by virtue of their design.register,wl,at 
appellants also point to the parallel provision applicable to defined contribution plans,b a,which prohibits reductions based on amounts allocated to the employee account.appellants argue that allocat ions as used in the defined contribution plan provision refers to contributions or inputs and congress used a different phrase benefit accrual in the defined benefit plan provision to refer to something else,the annuity or outputs.in addition,appellants emphasized at oral argument that defining benefit accrual in terms of the annuity is consistent with employee expectations.
pnc,on the other hand,argues that benefit accrual refers to the employer contributions in the form of credits to the hypothetical accounts,the inputs to the plan.thus,according to pnc,because all participants receive the same interest credit,there is no discrimination against older participants and any increase in the value of the annuity results from the time value of money,not discrimination,and thus is entirely appropriate.
for support,pnc relies on the fact that a cash balance plan,while classified as a defined benefit plan,differs from a traditional defined benefit plan in that an employee benefit in a cash balance plan is set forth in terms of a stated account balance while a traditional defined benefit plan is defined in terms of an annuity.see burstein,at.thus,they urge us to look at the inputs into the account,not the outputs represented by the payment of the annuity.additionally,pnc points to the parallel provision applicable to defined contribution plans,section b a,which legitimizes equal contributions made to defined contribution plans that grow to greater amounts for younger workers because of the time value of money.it argues that congress could not have intended to make the same economic consequence legal for one type of pension plan but illegal for the other 
last year the court of appeals for the seventh circuit became the first court of appeals to confront squarely the discrimination issue raised on this appeal.see cooper.making an argument similar to that that the appellants advance here,the plaintiffs in cooper argued that the ibm cash balance plan at issue in cooper was discriminatory because,regardless of equal employer credits put into the account,benefit accrual refers to what the employee takes out upon retirement,and thus,younger employees receive interest credits for more years.id.at.the court rejected this argument because it concluded that the phrase benefit accrual as used in the defined benefit plan provision reads most naturally as a reference to what the employer puts in the account,not what an employee takes out upon retirement.id.at.
the court of appeals compared the parallel provisions applicable to defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans,and concluded that they proscribe the same conduct even though the rule for defined benefit plans indicates what is prohibited and the rule for defined contribution plans indicates what is permitted,the employer ca stop making allocations or accruals to the plan or change their rate on account of age.id.at.the court reasoned that given the similarity of the subsections in both function and expression,it would be incongruous to say that the differences in the accumulation of interest on equal employer cash contributions made to defined contributions plans are not discriminatory while the differences in interest that accumulates on equal credits made to hypothetical cash balance accounts are discriminatory.id.at.rather,the court concluded that the computation of interest in both situations is not indicative of age discrimination as nothing suggests that congress set out to legislate against the fact that younger workers have statistically more time left before retirement,and thus a greater opportunity to earn interest on each year retirement savings.treating the time value of money as a form of discrimination is not sensible.id.at citing hazen paper biggins,d 
the majority of district courts that have confronted this issue,including the district court in this case,have reached the same result that the court of appeals reached in cooper.see drutis quebecor world usa,d laurent pricewaterhousecoopers llp,d hirt equitable ret.plan for employees,managers agents,d register pnc fin.serv.group,wl tootle arinc,eaton onan,d.
yet the court of appeals view in cooper is not unanimous as certain district courts within the second circuit disagree with the result that the court of appeals reached in cooper,and these courts have held that cash balance plans are discriminatory.see parsons pension benefit plan,wl,slip op.in re citigroup pension plan erisa,d,wl,in re morgan chase cash balance,d richards fleetboston fin,d 
the second circuit district courts that found discrimination in the circumstances that we face relied on three basic rationales in reaching their conclusion.first,they relied on either the statutorily defined term of accrued benefit or the dictionary definition of benefit accrual in concluding that benefit accrual refers to the outputs of the cash balance plan,the annuity.second,they found it significant that as a form of defined benefit plan,participants in a cash balance plan are promised a benefit upon retirement,not contributions in an account,and thus,the court in considering the discrimination issue should focus on the plan outputs.lastly,they believed that congress,in choosing to prohibit discriminatory allocat ions in the defined contribution plan provision but discriminatory benefit accrual s in the defined benefit plan provision,must have intended to proscribe different conduct.appellants arguments here echo these considerations.
it is that t he role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give effect to congress intent.rosenberg xm ventures,cir.when interpreting statutes or regulations,the first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning.dobrek phelan,cir.because it is presumed the congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of its language,every exercise of statutory interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute.rosenberg,at.t he plain meaning of statutory language is often illuminated by considering not only the particular statutory language at issue,but also the structure of the section in which the key language is found,the design of the statute as a whole and its object alaka attorney general,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also king vincent,d a statute is to be read as a whole since the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context ex rel.sch.dist.of newark,cir holding that it would be a mistake to squint myopically at the phrase in question and interpret it in isolation rather than in the context of the text and structure of the statute as a whole.where the statutory language,on examination of the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole is plain and unambiguous,further inquiry is not required.rosenberg,at.
the requirement that s tatutes must be interpreted to receive a sensible construction,limiting application so as not to lead to injustice and oppression also guides us.evcco leasing ace trucking,cir.in this light,s tatutes should be interpreted to avoid untenable distinctions and unreasonable results whenever possible.american tobacco patterson,d.
with these principles in mind,we again set forth the defined benefit plan provision at issue 
a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if,under the plan,an employee benefit accrual is ceased,or the rate of an employee benefit accrual is reduced,because of the attainment of any age.
b h i emphasis added.as we discussed at length above,the age discrimination component of this case comes down to the meaning of benefit accrual as applied to cash balance plans.erisa does not define the phrase,and its plain meaning is not evident from the particular language at issue.however,while the meaning of that phrase may not be evident from a reading of the words benefit accrual in isolation,a consideration of the context in which congress used the words and the object of the erisa provisions makes its meaning clear.
by engaging in this exercise in considering context,we reach the same conclusion as that of the court of appeals in cooper for the reasons that follow.first,as we have explained,cash balance plans define the benefit in terms of a stated account balance,not as a series of monthly payments for life to begin at retirement like a traditional defined benefit plan.burstein,at.thus,the benefit as used in the phrase benefit accrual refers to the stated account balance as that is how the benefit is defined by cash balance plans.once this proposition is grasped,it becomes clear that the accrual of benefit in section b h i refers to the credits deposited into the participant cash balance accounts,the inputs.if we concluded otherwise we simply would ignore the characteristic of a cash balance plan distinguishing it from a traditional defined benefits plan,that a cash balance plan account is defined in terms of a stated account balance.contrary to appellants assertions,we do not believe that a cash balance plan technical classification as a defined benefit plan compels us to disregard this critical distinction and thereby unreasonably interfere with employers in the crafting of pension plans 
second,a comparison of the parallel defined benefit plan and defined contribution plan provisions reinforces our interpretation.this comparison is particularly relevant in that both cash balance plans and defined contribution plans are defined in terms of their stated account balances,albeit one is hypothetical and the other is cash.in comparing the two provisions,we agree with the analysis and conclusion reached by the court of appeals in cooper.the provisions are nearly identical and prohibit the same behavior,the employer ca stop making allocations or accruals to the plan or change their rate on account of age.cooper,at.in this regard we point out that under erisa section b a a defined contribution plan is not age discriminatory if the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee account is not reduced,because of the attainment of any age.b a.the pnc plan does not make such a reduction.rather,the pnc plan calculates earnings credits based on points allocated for combined age and years of service and interest credits with identical rates credited into the participants accounts regardless of their age.
contrary to appellants assertions,there is simply no evidence that,by prohibiting discriminatory allocat ions in one provision and accrual s in the other,congress intended to provide different metrics for detecting discrimination.such a construction would lead to a result that is not sensible.the effect of the cash balance design that appellants challenge the accumulation of interest is identical to the accumulation of interest on employer contributions under defined contribution plans.accordingly,employer contributions in both instances ultimately are more valuable when those contributions are made to younger employees as the contributions have a longer time to grow.that unremarkable consequence of a contribution growing in value because of earnings on it is no different than that when a bank deposit is drawing interest.the longer the deposit remains in the bank in an interest bearing account,the more it is worth.we do not find any support for appellants argument that congress wanted to prohibit such a consequence with respect to cash balance plans,but legitimize it for defined contribution plans.rather,the similarities of the provisions governing defined benefit and defined contribution plans suggest that congress was not seeking to prohibit the consequences of the time value of money in either circumstance,and appellants have not offered a reasonable explanation of why congress would have wanted to do so.
while we agree with appellants that we are not permitted to rewrite a statute and we must adhere to the statutory text applicable to defined benefit plans,we have not rewritten anything here.the fact is that even though a cash balance plan classification as a defined benefit plan is important,it is also important that it be understood that cash balance plans include attributes of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.it seems to us that when dealing with a hybrid plan subject to defined benefit plan rules,a court should look to the parallel defined contribution plan provision to clarify the meaning of benefit accrual within the cash balance plan context.contrary to appellants assertions,in doing so,we are not reclassifying cash balance plans as defined contribution plans nor are we ignoring the language of the statute,but,instead,we are looking to the parallel provisions because the plain meaning of statutory language is often illuminated by considering not only the particular statutory language at issue,but also the structure of the section in which the language is found,the design of the statute as a whole and its object alaka,at internal quotation marks omitted.this is a fundament of statutory interpretation.
finally,in our analysis of the discrimination issue we address appellants remaining arguments and those accepted by the minority courts.first,contrary to appellants contention,accrued benefit,which section a,defines as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,is simply not the same thing as benefit accrual.we find no indication that congress intended that courts and administrators use these phrases interchangeably.additionally,we agree with the court of appeals in cooper that t he phrase benefit accrual reads most naturally as a reference to what the employer puts in,while the defined phrase accrued benefit refers to outputs after compounding.cooper,at.
moreover,we are not persuaded by the appellants position that the result we reach runs contrary to employee expectations,which,according to appellants,focuses on their retirement annuity and not their account balance.we have examined the summary plan description pnc distributed relating to the cash balance plan as this document provides the best insight into what the employees should expect from the plan.the plan description reveals the following.each quarter,the employees will receive a statement showing the value of their account s,including earnings credits and interest credits,app.at,which allows the employees to watch their retirement benefits grow from year to year,just as they do with their incentive savings plan account,id.at.at the time an employee leaves pnc,so long as he is vested he has immediate access to his account balance and may take the cash balance account value either in the form of a lump sum payment subject to income taxes and possibly penalties or,at his election receive monthly annuity payments.id.at.it is clear from the summary plan description that the credit accruals in the cash balance account provided to each employee on a quarterly basis,and not the prospective and optional conversion to an annuity,best defines what the employees should expect from the pnc plan.in sum,we find that pnc cash balance plan does not discriminate against participants because of age in violation of section b h i.as the district court put it in eaton,t he concept of the benefit of accrual rate does not have a single,meaning,especially in the complex world of pension plan regulation.eaton,d at.
in applying the provision in the context of cash balance plans,which defines the benefit in terms of the cash balance account,we are concerned with what pnc puts into an employee account,not what the employee eventually may obtain from the plan on retirement.in evaluating the plan inputs,pnc does not reduce contributions in the form of either earnings or interest credits to older employees.the circumstance that the same contribution in the form of interest credits may result in a more valuable annuity for a younger employee is not discrimination in whole or in part based on age rather it is the completely appropriate consequence of the application of an principle to an accumulating account of the time value of money.the fact is that rather than we rewriting the statute,it is the appellants that are doing so in order to accommodate their position.as is our obligation we are honoring the intent of congress in reaching our result.
b.the pnc plan does not violate erisa rules.
erisa contains three alternative tests,each of which specifies how much of the pension benefit must accrue each year the rule,the rule,and the fractional accrual rule.b a.in this case,it is undisputed that the only test that applies is the rule because the pnc cash balance plan is calculated using a career pay history the applicable provision states 
a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year.for purposes of this subparagraph 
i any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years 
b b.it is clear from this section that erisa requires that the value of the benefit accrued in any year may not exceed the value of a benefit accrued in any previous year by more than.esden,at.
the purpose of the provision is to prevent an employer from avoiding the vesting requirements through minimal accrual of benefits in early years of employment,followed by larger benefit accruals as an employee nears retirement.hoover cumberland.area teamsters pension fund,cir.congress intended by the provision to prohibit an employer from providing inordinately low rates of accrual in the employee early years of service when he is most likely to leave the firm and concentrating the accrual of benefits in the employee later years of service when he is most likely to remain with the firm until retirement.langman laub,cir quoting,at,reprinted in.
appellants argue that the pnc
