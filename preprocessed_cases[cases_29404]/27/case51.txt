plaintiffs louis miller and richard royals,ages eighty and years old respectively,have sued their former employer,american airlines,for failing to offer them a position with salary comparable to that of their previous job of flight engineer,which they held until may of.because the arbitrator determined that the collective bargaining agreement did not entitle the plaintiffs to positions of equal pay and the plaintiffs also have not shown that their age was the reason that they were offered inferior positions,summary judgment was appropriate on their claims under the age discrimination in employment act adea.additionally,the plaintiffs can not challenge the facial validity of the collective bargaining agreement because this claim was not properly raised in their charges filed with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.therefore,we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of american airlines in its entirety.
background 
in the,the plaintiffs began working as flight engineers for american airlines.american airlines historically operated aircrafts that required three individuals in the captain,first officer,and the flight engineer.as technology became more advanced,there was less need for flight engineers to occupy the third seat in the cockpit.additionally,airlines began hiring certified pilots,rather than flight engineers,to occupy the third seat.in,american airlines and its two employee unions entered into a collective bargaining agreement,the tripartite agreement agreement,that preserved the rights of flight engineers to occupy the third seat of a three crew aircraft,but also recognized the right of american airlines to no longer hire flight engineers.in the years following the agreement,american airlines began to retire its aircraft,and in,the agreement was amended to reflect this change.the new provision,supplement u,provides that 
in the event a surplus of flight engineers exists,each flight engineer so affected,who is qualified or trainable,will be guaranteed placement within the company american airlines at the time of his placement,the employee monthly salary will be fixed based on the average of his earnings for the previous twelve months as a flight engineer.if the employee average monthly earnings as a flight engineer exceed the total monthly compensation actually earned in his new job,the employee will be paid such flight engineer guaranteed monthly earnings.such guarantee will be in effect until his normal flight engineer retirement date,and thereafter,his salary will be governed by the compensation plan applicable to the new position.
supplement u was negotiated due to concerns that new technology would make flight engineers obsolete prior to the vesting of their pensions.the provision was designed to ensure that flight engineers would continue to receive the flight engineer rate of pay until the normal flight engineer retirement date,which the american airlines retirement benefit plan sets as age.
in may,american airlines grounded the last of its three crew airplanes,and the plaintiffs and one other individual were the only three active flight engineers at the time.prior to the grounding of the fleet,american airlines sent the three remaining flight engineers a letter offering them staff assistant positions in its publications department,positions which paid less than their salaries as flight engineers.at that time of this offer,plaintiff royals was seventy years old and plaintiff miller was years old.
the plaintiffs filed charges with the eeoc against american airlines,alleging that they were discriminated against because of their age in violation of the adea,et,when the defendant did not offer them a position of comparable salary which,they maintained,was required by supplement u of the tripartite agreement.the plaintiffs filed suit,and the district court initially found that the plaintiffs claims involved a minor dispute over terms in a collective bargaining agreement and therefore were preempted by the railway labor act rla,et.the district court then ordered the case stayed until the parties completed arbitration.
during arbitration,the plaintiffs filed a grievance with american airlines,making essentially the same allegations that they made in their adea complaint.the arbitrator determined that the grievance was untimely because it was filed more than days after the occurrence being grieved.the arbitrator further determined that american airlines was not obligated by supplement u to offer alternative employment at a salary comparable to that of a flight engineer.the american airlines retirement benefit plan provides that the normal retirement age is,and the arbitrator found that the plaintiffs were only guaranteed flight engineer pay until that age.
following the arbitration decision,the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment.the district court adopted the arbitrator findings that supplement u did not guarantee flight engineer pay past the age of.it also found that the plaintiffs claim that supplement u was facially discriminatory fell outside the scope of their eeoc charge,and even if the merits could be reached,the claim failed because there was no evidence that supplement u was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.the plaintiffs appeal.

the plaintiffs first claim can be characterized as an as applied challenge to supplement u.the plaintiffs contend that american airlines discriminated against them in the terms and conditions of their employment by failing to provide them with comparable pay as required by supplement u of the tripartite agreement.supplement u states in relevant part that such guarantee of a flight engineer guaranteed monthly earnings will be in effect until his normal flight engineer retirement date and,thereafter,his salary will be governed by the compensation plan applicable to the new position.emphasis added.in the arbitration proceedings,the arbitrator interpreted this sentence to mean that following the termination of the flight engineer positions,the collective bargaining agreement did not guarantee positions of comparable pay to the plaintiffs after they reached normal retirement age of.
the district court deferred to the arbitrator interpretation of this key language,correctly finding that resolution of the plaintiffs adea claim is dependent upon the interpretation of supplement u of the agreement and therefore governed by the arbitration provisions of the rla.the rla provides for mandatory arbitration over labor disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements in the railway and airline industries.hawaiian airlines norris,d.the rla defines two categories of disputes major disputes that relate to the formation of collective bargaining agreements or efforts to secure them and minor disputes that grow out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay,rules,or working conditions.id.the plaintiffs all
