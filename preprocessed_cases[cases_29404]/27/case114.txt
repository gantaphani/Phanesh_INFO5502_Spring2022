background 
in,frances created the frances mcarthur living trust,and provided that upon her death the trust estate would be divided equally among her three daughters or their issue.in january,the trust was amended to provide that,upon frances death,the trust estate would instead be distributed in accordance with a schedule of specific bequests with kristi receiving the remainder.the amended trust document trust designated kristi as a cotrustee and added a christian dispute resolution provision that required mediation and if necessary arbitration of any claim or dispute arising from or related to the trust as amended.
frances died on august.in january,pamela filed a petition and action contesting the trust,seeking removal of the trustee kristi,and suing for damages based on financial elder abuse.the pleading alleged that kristi exercised undue influence over frances when the trust was executed,that frances lacked testamentary capacity when she executed the amendment,and that kristi committed financial elder abuse by wrongfully taking property from frances by way of donative transfer and testamentary bequests.pamela sought a declaration that the trust was void,compensatory and punitive damages,replacement of kristi as trustee,and an order disqualifying kristi as a trust beneficiary pursuant to probate code section 
kristi filed a verified response and objections supported by multiple exhibits.she described a long history of deborah and pamela hostility toward her and mistreatment of frances,which purportedly explained frances revision of her estate plan in january.kristi and the attorney who drafted the trust averred that frances was mentally lucid when she executed the amendment and clearly communicated her testamentary wishes.in june,frances reportedly met with the attorney and confirmed her estate plan with a certificate of independent review.
kristi moved to compel arbitration of pamela claims pursuant to the arbitration provision in trust.the trial court issued a tentative decision,without receiving opposition briefing from pamela,denying the motion because t here is no evidence that the beneficiaries gave either their consent or consideration to the arbitration clause in order to achieve the status of beneficiary.thus there is no binding agreement between the parties compelling arbitration.kristi then filed a reply to the tentative decision,citing suh superior court th,suh nonsignatories to an arbitration agreement may be bound by the agreement by equitable estoppel or on a third party beneficiary contract theory and estate of bodger d,a trust is a third party beneficiary contract.on the eve of the hearing,pamela filed an opposition brief citing schoneberger oelze schoneberger which held that arbitration clauses contained in trust instruments are generally not enforceable against nonsignatory beneficiaries.
after the hearing on kristi motion to compel arbitration,the california supreme court decided pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th pinnacle,which permitted enforcement of an arbitration provision in a condominium development recorded declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions.id.at pp.kristi filed a supplemental brief addressing the new decision and the trial court heard further oral argument.the court then issued a september,written order denying the motion the doctrine of delegated authority to consent articulated in pinnacle is inapplicable to the case of a trust instead,kristi argued there was implied in fact consent.no facts were presented to support such a claim,and this court does not find that pinnacle went that far in its decision.because there was no evidence that the beneficiaries of this trust gave either their consent to or consideration for the arbitration provision in order to become beneficiaries,the motion to compel arbitration must be denied.the court denied kristi motion for reconsideration.
ii.discussion 
a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.code civ.a party seeking to compel arbitration of a dispute bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement,and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense,such as unconscionability.citation.where the evidence is not in conflict,we review the trial court denial of arbitration de novo.citation.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.
there are circumstances in which nonsignatories to an agreement containing an arbitration clause can be compelled to arbitrate under that agreement.suh,supra,th at.whether an arbitration agreement is operative against a nonsignatory is likewise reviewed de novo.id.at.
out of state authority 
no published california decision addresses the precise issue before us whether an arbitration clause in a trust document can bind a beneficiary nor is there a great deal of case law on the subject from other jurisdictions.two relatively recent decisions,however,address the issue and may provide useful guidance.the arizona court of appeal held that,although a trust instrument required arbitration,the beneficiaries were not bound to arbitrate because the trust document was not a contract subject to the state general arbitration statute schoneberger,supra,at.the texas supreme court held,based on the wording of that state arbitration law,that a trust beneficiary can be bound to arbitrate whether or not the trust document is considered to be a contract.rachal reitz,rachal.
schoneberger arose from a suit by two beneficiaries of irrevocable inter vivos trusts against the settlors and trustees,alleging mismanagement and dissipation of trust assets.schoneberger,supra,at pp.as we have noted,the court held an arbitration provision in the trust documents was unenforceable under the arizona general arbitration statute,which applied with respect to predispute arbitration agreements to a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties,italics added schoneberger,at.the court found the statutory language determinative consistent with the wording of arizona revised statutes section,arizona courts have recognized that the fundamental prerequisite to arbitration is the existence of an actual agreement or contract to arbitrate.citations.schoneberger,at.the court further noted that under arizona law,an inter vivos trust is not a contract,and that it had previously discussed the distinctions between a trust and a contract.we explained that a beneficiary of a trust receives a beneficial interest in trust property while the beneficiary of a contract gains a personal claim against the promissor.moreover,a fiduciary relationship exists between a trustee and a trust beneficiary while no such relationship generally exists between parties to a contract.citation.drawing on the restatement second of trusts,we further noted the creation of a trust is conceived of as a conveyance of the beneficial interest in the trust property rather than as a contract.citation.schoneberger,at pp.since the arbitration provision was contained in a trust,it was not enforceable against the nonsignatory beneficiaries under then applicable state law,regardless of the settlor intent or the trustee consent to arbitration id.at pp.
the texas supreme court reached a different conclusion based on statutory language and trust beneficiary conduct in a case where an irrevocable inter vivos trust beneficiary sued the trustee for misappropriation of trust assets.rachal,supra,at.the court held that an arbitration provision in the trust was enforceable against the beneficiary under the texas arbitration act,which applied,like california statute,to a written agreement to arbitrate.rachal,at pp,quoting.civ.prac.a rachal,at noting similarity between cal.arbitration laws.noting that the texas statute elsewhere referred to the law of contract,the rachal court concluded that the legislature intended written agreement to have a different meaning from contract.rachal,at.it reasoned that written agreement was broader than contract and included any agreement that was supported by mutual assent.ibid.
the rachal court then found the necessary element of mutual assent not in the written agreement itself,but under the doctrine of direct benefits estoppel.rachal,supra,at pp.a beneficiary who attempts to enforce rights that would not exist without the trust manifests her assent to the trust arbitration clause here,the plaintiff beneficiary both sought the benefits granted to him under the trust and sued to enforce the provisions of the trust this conduct indicated acceptance of the terms and validity of the trust.id.at,fn.omitted.
other courts have similarly concluded that a beneficiary who seeks to enforce rights under a trustee contract with a third party may be compelled to arbitrate the dispute pursuant to an arbitration clause in the contract the beneficiary can not simultaneously assert a claim against the third party based on the contract and seek to repudiate the arbitration clause in the contract.in re blumenkrantz,see also in re jean gardner amended blind trust,smith multi financial securities.the schoneberger court also recognized that a nonsignatory may be barred from avoiding arbitration if he has claimed or received some direct benefit from the agreement containing the arbitration clause.schoneberger,supra,at.
here,pamela has not accepted benefits under the trust nor has she attempted to enforce rights under the amended trust instrument.instead,pamela argues the trust is invalid and seeks to have it set aside.rachal acknowledges that a beneficiary may disclaim an interest in a trust.citations.and a beneficiary is also free to challenge the validity of a trust conduct that is incompatible with the idea that she has consented to the instrument.citation.thus,beneficiaries have the opportunity to opt out of the arrangement proposed by the settlor and consequently to not be bound by the arbitration provision.rachal,supra,at.we agree.
kristi argues that pamela has accepted the benefits of the trust pamela manifested implied consent through the trust contest itself.she could have chosen to take nothing from the trust instrument,attacking it in its entirety.instead,she sought to establish the trust terms prior to its last amendment.this argument conflates the trust created by frances in with the trust the only trust instrument containing an arbitration clause.it is illogical to suggest that pamela claim of entitlement to benefits under the trust as it existed before the amendment amounts to acceptance of an arbitration clause first appearing in the amendment,a document she specifically challenges as invalid.
kristi also argues that she produced undisputed evidence establishing the validity of the trust in support of her motion to compel arbitration and,because pamela failed to dispute kristi evidence or produce conflicting evidence,pamela has forfeited her opportunity to contest the validity of the trust.but the validity of the trust has not been adjudicated by virtue of the motion to compel arbitration or otherwise.and even assuming the validity of the trust were to be upheld,the arbitration clause in the trust would nevertheless be unenforceable against pamela unless and until she accepts or seeks to enforce benefits under the trust.insofar as the record before us discloses,she has not done so.since pamela has done nothing to manifest her assent to the terms of the trust,we find that she can not be bound to its arbitration provision by estoppel.
application of pinnacle 
we next must complete the assignment originally given by the supreme court to our colleagues in diaz bukey,supra,consider the application of pinnacle to these circumstances.kristi insists that pinnacle mandates that arbitration be compelled here because the supreme court held that an entity was bound by an arbitration clause even though the entity did not exist when the clause was promulgated and did not subsequently consent to the clause.we agree with the trial court that pinnacle is materially distinguishable 
in pinnacle,the arbitration provision appeared in a recorded declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions cc r for a condominium development.pinnacle,supra,cal th at pp.consistent with a detailed statutory scheme,the davis stirling common interest development act davis stirling act the development project cc r were approved by a state regulator,and each condominium owner agreed to be bound by the recorded cc r at the time of purchase.the cc r provided for the creation of a homeowners association consisting exclusively of the condominium owners who had assented to the cc r,and the arbitration provision purported to bind the association as well as the individual condominium owners in any construction defect suit against the developer.the association opposed the developer motion to compel arbitration of construction defect claims.pinnacle,at pp.
although the supreme court discussed in some detail the contractual nature of the cc r pinnacle,supra,cal th at,the holding of pinnacle rests heavily on elements of the davis stirling statutory scheme,including consumer protection elements t he legislature has crafted a statutory scheme providing for the capacity of a developer to create a condominium development subject to covenants and restrictions governing its operation and use.there appears no question that,under the davis stirling act,each owner of a condominium unit either has expressly consented or is deemed by law to have agreed to the terms in a recorded declaration.as the exclusive members of an owners association,the owners have every right to expect that the association,in representing their collective interests,will abide by the covenants in the declaration,including any covenant to invoke binding arbitration as an expeditious and judicially favored method to resolve a construction dispute,in the absence of unreasonableness.that a developer and condominium owners may bind an association to an arbitration covenant via a recorded declaration is not unreasonable indeed,such a result appears particularly important because the davis stirling act confers standing upon an association to prosecute claims for construction damage in its own name without joining the individual condominium owners,former and as between an association and its members,it is the members who pay the assessments that cover the expenses of resolving construction disputes.given these circumstances,an association should not be allowed to frustrate the expectations of the owners and the developer by shunning their choice of a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.likewise,condominium owners should not be permitted to thwart the expectations of a developer by using an owners association as a shell to avoid an arbitration covenant in a duly recorded declaration.citation.pinnacle,supra,cal th at,italics added.
the supreme court analogized the pinnacle case to ruiz podolsky cal th ruiz another case kristi relies on in this appeal,which also involved a statutory scheme that justified flexibility in binding nonsignatories to arbitration clauses.t he legislature can provide for the reasonable delegation of authority to consent.ruiz,at pp.in ruiz we addressed the operation of code of civil procedure section,which allowed,but did not require,a patient to contract with a health care provider to resolve all medical malpractice claims through binding arbitration.the question presented was whether an arbitration agreeme
