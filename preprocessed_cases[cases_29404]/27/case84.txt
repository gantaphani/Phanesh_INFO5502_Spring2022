robert gomez,a and barnette immediate supervisor,served as ado until customs promoted him to director of field operations in,thus creating the vacancy at issue in this case.but gomez served as ado at the grade,once he left the post customs advertised it at the level.
although barnette had spent years in administrative personnel her first seven years at the time she applied for the ado she was a serving as an operations specialist at the south atlantic cmc,her second operations position since her transfer from personnel.as an operations specialist,her responsibilities included executing,managing,coordinating and overseeing some of the same atlantic cmc core processes managed by the ado.barnette ado application.unlike her last personnel position,a supervisory post,barnette permanent operations positions were all.she nonetheless acquired supervisory experience in operations when,following gomez promotion,she served a detail as acting ado.while serving in operations positions,barnette received several performance awards.
after reviewing all ado applications,george heavey,executive director of field operations in washington and gomez supervisor,recommended to the selecting official,bonni tischler,assistant commissioner for field operations,that she choose michelle james,not barnette,to fill the ado position.tischler did so based solely on heavey recommendation.heavey,a white man,explained that after consulting gomez,a white hispanic man,he recommended james,a white woman fifteen years younger than barnette,based on her reputation as a key player,a dynamic leader,and a good communicator,as well as on gomez opinion that james front line operations experience would be valuable in the ado post.heavey dep.unlike barnette,james had spent her entire career at customs in operations positions such as customs inspector,program officer,supervisory customs inspector,and chief inspector at the south atlantic cmc.
following james selection,barnette filed a complaint in the district court for the district of columbia alleging that customs denied her the promotion because of her race and age in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of as amended,a,and the age discrimination in employment act adea,a.later,after customs denied her a temporary promotion to customs port director for the port of atlanta,barnette amended her complaint to include a charge of retaliation in violation of title vii.following full discovery,the district court found that barnette had failed to present evidence sufficient to negate customs proffered reason for selecting it preferred james greater operations experience over barnette greater personnel and supervisory experience.barnette,wl,dist.lexis,at.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to the government and,for reasons not at issue here,dismissed barnette retaliation claim.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
on appeal,barnette challenges only the award of summary judgment regarding the ado promotion.barnette argues that she provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that customs proffered reason for james selection was pretext for discrimination.reviewing the district court summary judgment award de novo,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to barnette,the party.borgo goldin.we will affirm the award of summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
title vii requires that a ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment in executive agencies be made free from any discrimination based on race.a.the adea requires that a ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least years of age in executive agencies be made free from any discrimination based on age.a.given that barnette offers no direct evidence of discrimination,to survive summary judgment and earn the right to present her case to a jury,she must resort to the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d.cones shalala,see also carter george washington,explaining that the mcdonnell douglas framework applies to adea claims.under mcdonnell douglas,barnette bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case,meaning she must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she is a member of a protected class she suffered an adverse employment action and the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination.brown brody.
because the district court found that barnette successfully made out a prima facie case,barnette,wl,at,dist.lexis,at finding undisputed on proceed directly to mcdonnell douglas second step at which the burden shifts to customs to articulate a reason for its decision to select james rather than barnette for the ado position.mcdonnell douglas,at.customs burden,however,is one of production,meaning it need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons.it is sufficient if customs evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against barnette.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d citation omitted.
in the district court,customs advanced two explanations for james selection.first,pointing out that the ado position had been downgraded to after gomez promotion,customs claimed it was agency policy to consider internal applicants seeking promotion to a higher graded position like james,then a over applicants seeking a lateral transfer like barnette,then a.second,customs asserted that although both candidates were qualified,it preferred james greater operations experience over barnette greater administrative and supervisory experience.given customs minimal burden of production,and given that each of these two explanations is both reasonable and,they may serve as legitimate,reasons for james selection and are enough to take us to the third step under mcdonnell douglas.fischbach dep t of.at that stage,barnette must be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that customs proffered preference for james qualifications was not its true reason,but w as a pretext for discrimination.reeves sanderson plumbing,d internal quotation marks omitted.
