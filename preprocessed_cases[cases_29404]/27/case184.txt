in this medical malpractice action,the,beebe medical center,and lewes convalescent center,appeal a million dollar verdict for the,anthony bailey,individually,and as the administratrix of julie bailey estate,christopher bailey,shawn connaway,and elberon connaway while in beebe care,julie bailey was locked in a freezer for over four hours,suffered from frostbite,and died a few weeks later.because beebe conceded that julie bailey injuries and death resulted from their negligence,the trial focused solely on damages.bailey estate brought claims for pain and suffering and punitive damages.the surviving family members individually sought damages under delaware wrongful death statute.before trial,beebe moved to have the damage claims trifurcated to prevent jury confusion resulting from hearing different kinds of damage evidence on each claim in the same hearing.the trial judge denied the motion.after trial began and the jury heard substantial evidence about damages,the parties settled the punitive damage claim,and the trial continued on the remaining damage claims.
beebe argues on appeal that the trial judge abused his discretion when he denied their motion to try the claims separately merely because of the inefficiency that would result from doing so and further claims that he ignored the unfair prejudice to beebe that resulted.we find that the trial judge correctly considered and applied all relevant factors under superior court civil rule before denying beebe motion to trifurcate.although he denied the motion,the trial judge did offer to consider a limiting instruction designed to assure that the jury considered only evidence relevant to each separate category of damage claim in order to avoid or minimize any potential prejudice to beebe.we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying beebe motion to trifurcate.
beebe also argues that the trial judge erred by permitting the surviving family members to recover damages for emotional distress they suffered as a result of beebe negligent treatment of julie bailey.beebe argues that the scope of damages for mental anguish permitted under the delaware wrongful death statute and the common law precludes a recovery for the survivors emotional distress.beebe contends that allowing the jury to consider evidence of the survivors emotional distress under the rubric of mental anguish after the punitive damage claims had been settled,unfairly prejudiced them.after reviewing the record,we find that beebe waived this argument.beebe counsel made sound,understandable tactical decisions that allowed the jury to hear evidence relating to punitive damages.beebe counsel did not submit detailed limiting instructions that may have aided the jury to compartmentalize evidence of emotional distress from the evidence of punitive damages.beebe counsel had several opportunities to object to overlapping damage evidence during the trial or to request limiting instructions,yet did not do so.
lastly,beebe further contends that the trial judge improperly instructed the jury because the instruction invited the jury to base its wrongful death award on the punitive damages evidence.beebe argues that this constituted plain error.after reviewing the instructions,we find that they were adequate.the trial judge repeatedly told the jury that they would no longer be considering the punitive damages claim.the trial judge also gave limiting instructions,albeit general in nature,regarding certain documents and testimony that could arguably be construed as evidence of emotional distress overlapping the evidence relevant to punitive damages.we conclude that the trial judge instructions were sufficient,and did not constitute plain error.accordingly,the superior court judgments are affirmed.
facts and procedural history 
julie bailey was a woman who suffered from alzheimer disease.because of her disease,she functioned at the intellectual level of a.on december,she suffered from stomach problems,and went to beebe for treatment.on december,beebe transferred her to lcc,a nursing care facility that beebe owns.julie bailey arrived at approximately and approximately four to five hours later,lcc staff discovered that she was missing from her room.after searching the facility and surrounding areas for approximately four and a half hours,lcc staff found julie bailey locked in a freezer room in the kitchen.julie bailey was frozen to the floor of the freezer by her own urine.she suffered severe injuries as a result of this incident,including frostbite to her hands,feet,and nose.julie bailey obtained treatment for her injuries at beebe however,beebe staff did not provide her with pain medication before administering frostbite treatments.that failure prolonged julie bailey suffering.on january,julie bailey suffered a pulmonary embolism,and died a short time later.
on april,bailey estate and surviving family members filed an action against beebe.julie bailey estate asserted claims for pain and suffering and punitive damages related to beebe negligent treatment of her.her surviving family members individually sought damages under delaware wrongful death statute in a pretrial motion in limine,beebe moved to have the trial trifurcated to separate the estate claim,the wrongful death claims and,the punitive damages claim.the trial judge denied beebe motion to try these claims separately.
the superior court held a jury trial from march,through march.during bailey case,bailey submitted evidence of both punitive and compensatory damages.the parties settled the punitive damages claim on march.the parties met with the trial judge on march and,to discuss various trial issues,including jury instructions and the exclusion of evidence relating to punitive damages.on march,bailey called their final witness and rested their case.the trial judge then told the jury that the punitive damages claim was no longer an issue in the case,and beebe stated that they were not calling any witnesses because the punitive damages claim was no longer an issue.the trial judge then instructed the jury.the jury returned a verdict for compensatory damages in the amount of to julie bailey estate,to her husband,anthony bailey,and to each of her three sons,for a total of.beebe filed a motion for a new trial or remittitur.the trial judge denied the motion,and beebe appealed.
discussion 
the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying beebe motion for separate trials.
beebe argues that the trial judge abused his discretion by denying their motion to trifurcate or hold separate trials on the damages claims and,as a result,unfairly prejudiced beebe.beebe contends that the superior court in denying the motion to trifurcate ignored the potential prejudice to the defendants from a consolidated trial and focused solely on the potential for overlapping witnesses and concerns for efficiency.
we review a decision denying a motion to try claims separately for abuse of discretion this court will not reverse the trial judge determination unless one of the parties has been unfairly prejudiced 
delaware superior court civil rule b states 
the court,in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice,or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy,may order a separate trial of any claim,counterclaim or claim,or of any separate issue or of any number of claims,counterclaim,or claims or issues 
in the past,trial judges have decided whether or not to try claims separately by considering the witnesses that would need to testify and the evidence that would be presented at trial.for example,in union mutual life insurance,dewey,the trial judge denied a motion to separate claims because it was likely that the same witnesses would be needed to testify on both claims and the documents introduced would be the same for both the trial judge held that s eparation of the cases for trial would require duplication,double expense and would not be conducive to the expedition of the trial and economy.on a motion for separate trials on liability and damages in a negligence case,the superior court also has declined to separate the issues for trial where the same witnesses would have to testify at length on both the issue of liability and damages the trial judge also reasoned that motion s for separate trials of liability and damages in negligence suits should be carefully considered and sparingly granted.the trial judge explained that separation may be beneficial in multiparty litigation where many plaintiffs are joined and an issue of liability is common to all of them but damages differ for each party other situations that may warrant separation are cases containing diverse claims,such as permissive counterclaims,which are unrelated to the principal cause of action 
in their motion for trifurcation,beebe contended that the jury anticipated anger in response to the punitive damages evidence would potentially inflate any compensatory damages award based on passion and prejudice that bears no relationship to the actual damages suffered by the plaintiffs.beebe purported to support their position by arguing that the evidence that would establish compensatory damages was totally independent of the evidence that would ultimately be used to establish punitive damages.beebe conceded in their motion,however,that evidence of the impact of some of the alleged conduct which forms the punitive damage claim may be relevant to the plaintiffs individual mental anguish claims under the wrongful death statute.
in response,bailey estate and surviving family members argued that separating the claims for trial was not feasible because evidence of both the compensatory damages and punitive damages claims would be intertwined and could not be neatly divided.in addition,trifurcation would be inefficient and counter to the interest of judicial economy.lastly,bailey estate and surviving family members urged that it would be an emotional hardship for julie bailey family to have to testify multiple times.
in deciding to deny the motion to try the damages claims separately,the trial judge considered several factors enumerated in delaware superior court civil rule,including convenience,avoidance of prejudice,and judicial economy the trial judge considered the evidence that would be presented at trial,the potential prejudice to beebe,and the risk of inefficiency.the trial judge reasoned that the evidence could not be neatly segregated and presented in a manner consistent with the defendants request for trifurcation.the trial judge stated,i simply see no practical way for the witnesses to divide up their testimony to fit into the defendant request t he evidence in this case on both compensatory and punitive damages is so interwoven that much of it would have to be repeated again in different phases of the trial.the trial judge also pointed out that beebe acknowledged the overlap of punitive and compensatory damages evidence in their own motion,and that he the trial judge was reluctant to require julie bailey family members to testify multiple times,which he suspected would be very difficult for them.it would also be difficult and expensive to have expert witnesses testify multiple times.as the trial judge stated,i think trifurcation of this particular case would turn this trial into a much larger,inefficient,and more difficult case to manage for the court and for the parties and for all the participants.the trial judge did,however,state his willingness to consider any jury instructions that would clarify what evidence the jury may consider and for what purpose it may be considered his offer to consider limiting instructions for the jury specifically demonstrates that the trial judge completely appreciated beebe concerns and offered a solution designed to minimize any prejudice while maximizing the efficient management of the trial.
the record does not demonstrate that the denial of the motion to separate the damages claims for trial prejudiced beebe.the trial judge reviewed the jury award after the trial,found that the evidence overwhelmingly supported the award and did not support the supposition that the jury was motivated by anger towards beebe.those findings are not clearly erroneous.accordingly,we hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying beebe motion to hold separate trials on the damages claims.
beebe waived their argument that the trial judge erred by not narrowing the scope of mental anguish for the compensatory damage claims.
beebe next argues that the trial judge erred by permitting julie bailey family members to recover for emotional distress they suffered as a result of beebe negligent treatment of julie bailey.they maintain damages for emotional distress are not recoverable either under delaware common law or delaware wrongful death statute.beebe contends that the scope of potential recovery for mental anguish under delaware wrongful death statute is limited,and that by allowing the jury to consider the survivors emotional distress,the trial judge erroneously permitted the jury to base its wrongful death award on punitive damages evidence,instead of the more narrow evidence of mental anguish.as a result,beebe maintains,the jury improperly inflated their compensatory damages award.
delaware rule of evidence requires a party to raise a contemporaneous objection to evidence presented during trial or risk losing the right to raise that issue on appeal.a waiver occurs where a party fails to object or raise that issue on appeal,unless the error is plain therefore,where a party advances an argument on appeal,we must determine whether that argument precludes waiver.if we conclude that the party has waived its argument for purposes of appeal,the argument can survive only if plain error occurred in the court of first instance.
we have reviewed the record to determine whether beebe have waived their argument on appeal.beebe counsel represented both beebe and lcc on both the compensatory and punitive damages claims.that required beebe counsel to make several strategic decisions regarding representation,because his clients had potentially conflicting interests.we reasonably can infer from the record that any insurance carrier would be,in part,responsible for compensatory damages,and that beebe and lcc would be individually responsible to pay any punitive damages awarded.at the beginning of the trial,when both punitive and compensatory damages were at issue and bmc,lcc,and their probable insurance carriers were all involved in the case,beebe counsel did not raise any argument concerning the scope of a claim for mental anguish under the delaware wrongful death statute indeed,beebe opening argument is inconsistent with their present argument on appeal regarding the scope of a claim for mental anguish 
so what are punitive damages and the best way to discuss punitive damages is to compare it with compensatory damages.remember,compensatory damages is a given in this case.so what is compensatory damages for the top part is a given.the goal just and full compensation for the losses of the plaintiffs.that what you definitely going to do in this case.negligence goes to compensatory damages.pecuniary is actually negligence.that part of the compensation,a given part of the case.
you may say to yourself,the warning signs were there.why did they do something about it that a conclusion that you can reach from the evidence.and if you consider and you conclude from that evidence that they just did get it,that they made some wrong decisions that were unreasonable reactions,i saying that the case.but you may conclude that that goes to compensatory damages,not punitives.not because i say so,but because the delaware supreme court says that the standard.
we infer that a reasonable tactic for with its have been to urge the jury to consider the broadest possible scope of the evidence for the inevitable compensatory damages award so that the award would be covered by any available insurance.
thus,beebe did not object to the introduction of broadly cast evidence of damages during trial,nor did beebe request limiting instructions during the testimony of bailey witnesses or at the trial conclusion.tony bailey,julie bailey husband,testified about julie battle with alzheimer disease,about what happened on the evening she was locked in the freezer,and how the details he later learned regarding the deficiencies at lcc affected his grieving beebe counsel did not object,nor did he request limiting instructions suggesting that the jury should only be permitted to use that testimony for a particular purpose.julie bailey sons also testified about how they were affected after learning of the problems with lcc and beebe again,beebe did not object during their testimony,nor did they ask the trial judge to give instructions limiting the scope of the evidence of emotional distress the jury could consider in determining the appropriate compensation for the surviving family members mental anguish.although beebe neither objected to this evidence as it was admitted nor requested limiting instructions,they now assert that the trial judge improperly allowed the jury to consider the evidence.
beebe did not preserve that argument for appeal simply by asking that the plaintiffs damages claims be trifurcated only after the parties had settled the punitive damages claim did beebe,for the first time,raise concerns that the overbroad scope of the evidence of mental anguish created the risk of an inappropriately large compensatory damage award while we can appreciate beebe concern,beebe expressed that concern too late in the trial.
the trial judge repeatedly attempted to solicit beebe suggestions for limiting instructions so that the jury would know specifically what evidence they could and could not consider when contemplating compensatory damages.in a march,conference,the trial judge suggested that it may be beneficial for beebe to refer specifically to certain pieces of evidence for the judge limiting instructions.instead,beebe advised that counsel would use his closing to help clarify issues for the jury,stating a s i see it,what it may come down to is general instructions to the jury,and then it may come down to what i say on rebuttal.
beebe also acknowledged that it was their burden to prepare a request for jury instructions and present it to opposing counsel and the trial judge for approval on march,the trial judge reminded beebe 
but i said i certainly amenable to any kind of limiting instruction,taking a look at it.and you beebe said you beebe would take the heavy load and go back,and it would be your beebe burden,to some degree of specificity,to say these were the things,ladies and gentlemen of the jury,that you should not pay any attention to.and you beebe have in your instruction mentioned some things,but that kind of where we are.
the trial judge clarified that he had decided to exclude certain documents containing flat numbers regarding beebe net worth because they were relevant only to the punitive damages claim,which was no longer part of the trial.the trial judge reiterated,however,that much of the evidence in the trial regarding compensatory and punitive damages overlapped,and that beebe conceded this fact in their pretrial motion for trifurcation.the following discussion then took place 
the trial judge 
you know,i guess your point is you agree with me about the overlap of evidence for compensatory and punitive damages,but that it is unfairly prejudicial.i simply do not think that it is unfairly prejudicial.
i am willing to sit here and go document by document to make sure that we do not let in something that had we taken the time to look at it,i might have kept it out.i think we talked about money in a general sense yesterday.bailey estate and surviving family members counsel said,i not going there,i not going to get up there and say beebe was rich with a net worth of million dollars or whatever it was,and therefore,that something you folks ought to think about.
the relevancy is that beebe,regardless of how much money it had had some money to do some things and did do it.that is to me a little more relevant.the dollars are not.
bailey estate and surviving family members counsel 
i just want to bring up one thing for the record on this taking the time to go through the documents 
but when we had your motions to exclude some of the evidence,your honor indicated on the record,and i sure that the transcript will bear this out,that you had been put in a difficult position because there are so many surveys and no one has taken out which ones are objectionable,which ones there are objections to,and which ones there would be objections to on relevance to the punitive which is one of the objections for compensatory.and you made that statement and you said i would like to have a specific objection to which of those there is a specific objection to.but your general ruling is that they come in,absent a specific objection.now,that what you said.
and at no time was there ever any objection raised to any specific survey for any purpose.and so,judge,to now say let go through and start climbing through them and start figuring out which ones are objectionable,judge,it would be the plaintiffs position that any objections were waived because they were never brought.they were never raised.they were waived and i think the record is going to bear that out clearly.
beebe counsel 
we did object to all records,all hss surveys that postdated the julie bailey incident and the fact the jury has seen them.so that not an issue.i am not applying for a review.because the facts remains sic,given the court ruling,and my objection is noted.i think that the only documents we have to be concerned with are the ones that mention specific numbers.and only one or two,that document,maybe the one with the mri,maybe the at lcc.none of the hss reports fall under that issue.none of the incident reports fall into that issue.
the trial judge then further explained his ruling as follows 
i know how these things are examined six months from now,a year from now.little things will be picked to pieces.long briefs will be written on a document or two documents or three documents.
in my world,it is never too late to fix a problem.the opportunity is there,and it is not always that i am just a nice guy giving you a chance.i am always thinking ahead about how this is going to look when the supreme court say,well,judge name omitted,what were you thinking you talking about generalities,you did even have that document before you.
and the other side will say,well,judge name omitted did give the parties a chance to bring it forward,they elected not to,they waived it.
so it is not always that unpleasant,it that,i thinking about the quality of my rulings as well.so that why i do what i do.
beebe responded that they would not be prejudiced if they declined an opportunity for a review to determine whether any documents should be excluded or explained in a limiting instruction later in the conference,the trial judge told beebe that there was some confusing language in beebe request for a limiting instruction.beebe counsel responded,i have to confess that i wrote this instruction with the hopes that my motion for reconsideration would be granted.the trial judge again told beebe that he was looking to beebe to focus on the evidence that you beebe clearly think is excluded by those rulings,because we are talking in generalities to some extent.
the trial judge gave beebe ample opportunity to request detailed limiting instructions for the jury.it was beebe responsibility,as beebe conceded,to request limiting instructions from the trial judge that would fully inform the jury and protect beebe interests.the trial judge offered to examine each piece of evidence to determine what should be addressed in the limiting instructions or excluded from the jury deliberation room,but beebe refused that option.apparently beebe did not want the jury to hear more specific damages instructions therefore,beebe waived any claim that the trial judge erred by not independently crafting and giving his own limiting instructions.beebe remarks during their opening statement,their failure to object during bailey witnesses testimony on mental anguish,their failure to request limiting instructions at the time of that testimony,and their failure to request specifically detailed damage instructions at the trial conclusion,amount to waiver of their present argument on appeal regarding th
