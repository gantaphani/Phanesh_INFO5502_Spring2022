background 
personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act.
in,congress passed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act prwora.et prwora severely restricted the eligibility of legal immigrants for benefits otherwise provided to needy persons,including benefits under the federal supplemental security income ssi program for the aged,blind,and disabled.many legal immigrants lost their eligibility for such benefits as of august,the effective date of prwora.teytelman wing misc d,teytelman,kurzban,kurzban immigration law sourcebook ed,kurzban.in particular,with limited exceptions,immigrants who were not qualified aliens as of that date were denied eligibility for any federal public benefits.teytelman,supra,at,subd.a.
congress enacted prwora in part to promote and to discourage aliens from immigrating to the united states just to avail themselves of welfare or other public resources.aliessa ex rel.fayad novello.in prwora,congress expressly authorized the states to fund their own public benefit programs for immigrants who no longer qualified for federal benefits and authorized them to establish their own eligibility criteria,kurzban,supra,at.
in,the california legislature enacted capi to provide benefits to qualifying aged,blind and disabled legal immigrants who,as a result of prwora,are no longer eligible for federal ssi benefits due solely to their immigration status.welf,subd.a stats,ch.capi provides a monthly subsistence grant to persons who would have been eligible for federal ssi under the immigrant rules in effect before enactment of prwora,and who otherwise meet the criteria for ssi benefits.welf,subd.a.eligible immigrants include lprs immigrants permanently residing in the united states under color of law prucols,residing in this country with the knowledge and permission of immigration authorities who do not plan to deport them mpp,supra,p and other qualified aliens.mpp,supra.
eligibility for capi benefits is determined in part by section statute at issue in this case.section sets forth three eligibility groups based in part on whether the applicants entered the united states before august,or on or after that date immigrants who entered before that date immigrants who entered on or after that date and whose sponsors are dead,disabled,or abusive and other immigrants who entered on or after that date.welf,subd.a.the group an immigrant falls into is relevant because it determines which rules for income apply.welf,subd.b.a sponsor is a person who signs a contract or affidavit of support agreeing to support an immigrant as a condition of his or her admission for permanent residence in the united states.mpp,supra,s.under rules,the income and resources of an immigrant sponsor are added to that of the immigrant in determining whether the immigrant is eligible for capi or federal ssi benefits.mpp,supra,subd.a.these rules can render an immigrant ineligible for capi for a specified number of years by attributing to him or her a greater income than is allowed under the program.
capi provides that applicants in the first two who entered before august,or whose sponsors are dead,disabled or governed by federal ssi rules.welf,b.under the federal rules,the number of years of sponsor deeming depends upon the type of affidavit of support the immigrant sponsor signed.depending on the affidavit,immigrants are either subject to three years of sponsor deeming old affidavit of support,or subject to deeming until they become citizens or secure credit for quarters of work history new affidavit of support which is required for all applications for immigrant visas or for adjustments of status filed on or after december,subd.a,subd.a,b mpp,supra,a see also wheeler,immigration act imposes new sponsorship requirements,modifies restrictions on benefits,bender immigration bulletin,vol.because many immigrants eligible for capi may never become citizens or be able to complete quarters of work due to their age or disability,those whose sponsors signed the new affidavit of support could be subject to indefinite sponsor deeming.
immigrants in the third who entered on or after august,and whose sponsors are not dead,disabled or not affected by which federal affidavit of support their sponsor signed.instead,they are subject to ten years of deeming of their sponsors income and resources,regardless of the affidavit signed.capi deeming period starts from the date the sponsor signed the affidavit of support or the date of the immigrant arrival in the united states,whichever is later.welf,b.
the dss determines when an immigrant entered the united states for purposes of determining eligibility for capi under sections and based not on the date an immigrant physically arrived in the united states,but on the effective date of the current immigration status as determined by the immigration and naturalization service.mpp,supra.there are two exceptions.first,if the immigrant is a current capi recipient whose immigration status was adjusted after he or she began receiving capi benefits,then the dss continues to use the same entry date that was used to determine his or her initial capi eligibility.mpp,supra.second,if the immigrant was a qualified alien,lpr as of august,and has maintained continuous residence in the united states since that date,then the effective date of the qualified alien status held on august,will be deemed to be his or her entry date even if he or she later adjusts his or her immigration status.mpp,supra.
the dss implemented the capi program in december.since may,the interpretation set forth above of section has consistently been dss policy.by september,the dss interpretation had appeared in an administrative decision not involving respondents.the dss designated the portion of the decision containing its interpretation a precedential decision,subd.b an agency may designate as a precedent decision a part of a decision that contains a significant legal or policy determination of general application that is likely to recur.the interpretation became an emergency regulation about four months later.by october,it had become a permanent dss regulation.mpp,supra.
iii.facts relating to respondents and their administrative records.
the facts relating to the respondents are undisputed.they are two elderly,immigrant couples,each of whom physically arrived in the united states on tourist visas before august.they all became lprs after august.after they applied for capi benefits,the dss determined they entered the united states on or after august,for purposes of section based on the dates they obtained their lpr status.relying on their date of entry and sponsor circumstances,the dss concluded respondents were not then eligible for capi benefits.
iv.writ of mandate proceedings.
on september,respondents filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the dss director to cease denying capi benefits to eligible applicants as a result of the dss interpretation of section,and to overturn the administrative decisions denying respondents capi benefits.code civ,power to issue writ of mandate,writ issued regarding validity of administrative decision.on september,judgment was entered in respondents favor.on the same date,the trial court issued a writ of mandate commanding the dss director to interpret the phrase entered the united states on or after august,in section in the same way the social security administration interpreted that same phrase albeit in present tense in title united states code section,to mean physical entry.soc.sec,program operations manual system si poms.the dss director timely filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review of the trial court judgment.
the underlying facts are undisputed in this case,and the issue before us is one of law.we review the trial court judgment independently.helene curtis,assessment appeals bd.th,d helene curtis ramirez yosemite water,cal th,d,ramirez.
ii.standard of review of the dss interpretation of entered the united states on or after august.
a.the legal standard versus interpretive.
there are two classes of rules or and interpretive.because of their differing legal sources,they command significantly different degrees of deference by the courts.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.rules or regulations are the product of a delegated legislative power conferred on the agency to make law.id.at,d.an agency acts in its capacity when it adopts rules or regulations to fill in the details of the statutes enacted by the legislature.helene curtis,supra,th at,d.the scope of review of acts is narrow.if the rule or regulation lies within the lawmaking authority delegated to the agency by the legislature,and it is reasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute,judicial review is at an end.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.
in contrast,we accord considerably less deference to an agency interpretation of a statute when it is merely an agency legal opinion,however expert,rather than the exercise of a delegated legislative power to make law.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis in original.the binding power of an agency interpretation of a statute in this situation depends upon the presence or absence of factors that support the merit of the interpretation.id.at,d.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.id.however,the interpretation is entitled to our consideration and respect.id.
the court in yamaha noted agency rules do not always fall neatly into either the or interpretive category the terms designate opposite ends of an administrative continuum,depending on the breadth of the authority delegated by the legislature.yamaha,supra,cal th at,fn,d.in ramirez,the supreme court addressed the situation where an interpretive regulation falls into both categories due to the authority delegated to the agency.the legislature had delegated to the industrial welfare commission power to make regulations setting minimum wages,maximum hours and standard conditions of labor for all employees.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.this agency had formulated a regulation defining the term outside salesperson in a statute excluding from overtime laws an employee characterized as such.id.at,d.
the supreme court in ramirez observed that regulations have both and interpretive characteristics when an administrative agency exercises a legislatively delegated power to interpret key statutory terms.id.at,d.it concluded the regulation defining outside salesperson was because the legislative authority delegated to the agency included the power to elaborate the meaning of key statutory terms.on the other hand,since the agency is engaged in construing the meaning of a portion of a statute,its regulation is in some sense interpretive.id.at,d.the court then went on to analyze the regulation under both the more deferential standard for regulations,and under the less deferential standard for purely interpretive regulations.id.at,d.
similarly,in this case,the dss interpretation of section had and interpretive characteristics.its interpretation,now embodied in a regulation,was because the legislature gave the dss the power to adopt regulations,orders,or standards of general application to implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced by it,including capi.welf,see also welf,dss given authority to establish and supervise the capi program,allowing dss to implement capi provisions through all county letter or similar instructions from the director requiring dss director to adopt regulations,as otherwise necessary,to implement the applicable provisions of capi empowering director to enact emergency capi regulations.on the other hand,the dss construed the meaning of a portion of a statute,and thus its regulation is in some sense interpretive.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.consequently,we analyze the dss interpretation of section under both the more deferential standard for acts,and under the less deferential standard for purely interpretive ones.id.at,d.we conclude the interpretation is entitled to our deference under both standards.
the dss interpretation was within the scope of the authority conferred upon it.
analyzing the dss interpretation as,we first determine that it is within the scope of the authority conferred on the dss.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.the dss power to implement,interpret,or make specific section was triggered by the ambiguity of the phrase entered on or after august,in that statute.welf,helene curtis,supra,th at,d agency granted powers may adopt regulations to fill in the details of the statutes enacted by the legislature.
this case involves an intersection of federal and state immigration and public benefits laws.in this context,there are varying definitions of entry.the dictionary definition of entry is to go or come into a material place make a physical entrance or penetration.webster third new international dictionary entry is also defined as to come into a group gain admission.id.in immigration law,the term entry also has different denotations.digamon sullivan,digamon see also matter of connelly,entry is a term of art of immigration law.indeed,there is no current federal statutory definition of entry for immigration law.in,shortly after enacting prwora,congress reduced the significance of entry in immigration law by striking the statutory definition of entry and replacing it with a definition for admission.kurzban,supra,subd.a a.moreover,the ambiguity of the term is apparent in the capi provisions themselves.the legislature used entered in section,but section refers to the date of the immigrant arrival in the united states.welf,subd.b.this suggests the legislature meant something other than arrival in the united states when it used entered the united states in section.thus,i n isolation,the term entry is ambiguous.digamon,supra.at.
the ambiguity of the phrase entered the united states is shown by the conflicting definitions courts and agencies have applied to it and similar phrases.in construing the phrase entry into the united states in order to determine when a federal rule for ssi begins to run,the district court in digamon concluded it meant the date the immigrant was admitted to permanent residence in the united states.digamon,supra.at a regulation promulgated by secretary of health and human services providing same interpretation of this statute see also aziz sullivan,aziz construing same phrase in federal sponsor deeming statutes for afdc and food stamp programs to mean date of admission to permanent residence,in context of determining for when ban on federal benefits for immigrants starts to run,interpreting entry into the united states to mean date immigrant attained qualified alien status.
other courts and federal agencies have interpreted similar phrases to mean some form of physical arrival.see,cir,interpreting entry into the united states in the context of a deported alien charged with being found in the united states to mean physically present here and free from official restraint yang maugans cir,entered the united states within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act of means physical presence inspection and admission by immigration officer,or evasion of inspection and freedom from official restraint,in context of determining for when ban on federal benefits for immigrants is triggered,interpreting enters the united states on or after august,to mean physical entry on or after that date.
moreover,contrary to what respondents argue,the dss was not required to follow a federal regulatory interpretation of the phrase entered on or after august.in particular,respondents argue the trial court correctly ordered the dss to adopt the social security administration interpretation of this phrase in section,subdivision a to mean physical entry on or after that date poms,supra,si.
in ramirez,the state agency definition of a statute ambiguous term outside salesperson differed substantially from definitions of the same term found in federal regulations.the supreme court concluded the agency did not exceed its statutory authority when it adopted its own unique definition because there was no indication the legislature intended to incorporate those federal regulations when it adopted the statute at issue.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.similarly,there is no indication in this case that the legislature intended to incorporate federal interpretations of the phrase entered on or after august,as it appears in section.
respondents point out that,in general,federal laws and regulations governing the ssi program also govern capi.welf,subd.a mpp,supra,dss regulation interpreting to mean capi is governed by ssi laws and regulations pertaining to eligibility.however,the regulation interpreting section,is not,strictly speaking,a regulation governing the federal ssi program.the statute this regulation interprets provides that any qualified alien who enters the united states on or after august,is generally ineligible for any federal benefit for a period,subd.a.while the statute has been interpreted to affect entitlement to ssi,it also affects entitlement to medicaid,the state children health insurance program schip,and temporary assistance for needy families tanf.kurzban,supra.
more importantly,section is not analogous to section.consequently,applying a federal regulation interpreting the phrase enters the united states on or after august,in section simply because the same phrase appears in section does not make sense.section determines whether an immigrant will be subject to federal rules or capi rule,and uses the phrase as a means of making this determination.welf,subd.a,subd.b.as the dss points out,there is no counterpart to this statute in the federal ssi program because applicants for that program are subject to federal rules only.and section has nothing to do with rules it uses the phrase enters the united states to determine which immigrants are subject to a ban on all federal benefits,regardless of the income and resources of their sponsors.state,of revenue andrade alaska,phrase lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states in state statute should not be construed identically to federal definition,notwithstanding federal government preeminent role in immigration,where state and federal statutes served different purposes delaney baker cal th,d,a phrase which appears in different statutory schemes with distinct designs and objectives is not presumed to have the same meaning in each instance.
the dss interpretation was reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of section.
we next determine whether the dss interpretation was reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of section.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d,second prong of analysis.as we discuss supra,the dss needed to interpret the phrase at issue because it is ambiguous.furthermore,the dss interpretation is reasonable.see id.at,d,concluding agency interpretation of outside salesperson is reasonable and should not be invalidated.it reasonably addresses a main purpose of the statute to determine which rules apply to an immigrant seeking capi benefits.in fact,the phrase entered the united states on or after august,is only relevant in the statute to determine whether federal rules apply to a particular immigrant,or whether instead capi own rule applies.welf,subd.a,subd.b.
obviously,rules are only relevant to an immigrant who has a sponsor.an immigrant obtains a sponsor when he or she seeks to become a permanent resident obtaining a sponsor is a federal requirement for gaining lpr status.in contrast,at the time an immigrant physically entered the country,he or she may not have had a sponsor.see also aziz,supra.at alien mere physical entry into the united states does not require sponsorship sponsor only necessary when an alien seeks permanent resident status digamon,supra.at same.the purpose of the sponsor requirement is to prevent aliens from becoming public charges.aziz,supra.at.currently,a sponsor must enter into a contract,enforceable by the state or federal government or agency providing public benefits,to provide support for the immigrant applying for permanent resident status until either the immigrant becomes a citizen or the immigrant has worked qualifying quarters approximately years,subd.a kurzban,supra.
in digamon,supra,the district court construed the phrase entry into the united states as used in section,a federal statute for ssi.this statute provides that,f or purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of ssi benefits for an aged,blind or disabled immigrant,the sponsor income and resources shall be deemed to be the income and resources of the immigrant for a period of years after the immigrant entry into the united states,subd.a.in order to determine when the period began to run for the immigrant in the case,the court in digamon had to determine whether she entered the united states when she physically entered the country,or when she was granted an adjustment in status to lpr.digamon,supra.at.the secretary of health and human services had promulgated a regulation defining entry in this statute to mean admission to permanent residence.id.citing,subd.a.the dss relied in part on that regulation in formulating its interpretation of the statute at issue in this case because the regulation interprets entry in a statute which,like section,is about.
in concluding consistent with the federal regulation that entry meant admission to permanent residence,the court in digamon noted that in order for an immigrant to be eligible for federal ssi,he or she must be either an lpr or otherwise permanently residing in the united states under color of law digamon,supra.at citing,subd.a b i.that definition of eligible immigrants excludes illegal aliens but includes aliens who have properly expressed the intent to become permanent residents.the triggering event is permanent residence and not mere physical entry.id.
similarly,it was reasonable for the dss to conclude the triggering event for selection of the appropriate rule under sections and is permanent residence,not physical entry.see id.only immigrants who have permanent resident status are eligible for capi benefits.see welf,subd.a mpp,supra,to be eligible for capi,an immigrant must meet eligibility criteria for federal ssi in effect on august,be a resident with permanent resident status as an lpr,prucol or qualified alien.as explained supra,an alien who does not have permanent resident status may not have a sponsor and,in any event,is not eligible for capi.and for immigrants who are eligible for capi but who do not need sponsors,rules do not apply.for these two categories,the phrase at issue in section,which determines the applicable rule,is irrelevant.
respondents argue the dss interpretation of the phrase entered on or after august,has no fixed meaning,and thus is improper.they incorrectly assert the dss interpreted the phrase to mean the date an immigrant attains lpr status only.in fact,the dss interpretation is the effective date of the current immigration status,whether that status be lpr,prucol,or some other qualified alien status.mpp,supra.these eligible immigrants all have a date when their cu
