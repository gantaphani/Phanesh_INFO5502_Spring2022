in this case pro bono counsel for a number of conservatees incurred expert witness costs without prior approval as required by local rules of court.this case presents the question whether reimbursement of such costs,in nonemergency circumstances,may be conditioned on preapproval by a trial court under its local rules.we hold the trial court may establish reasonable preapproval procedures and that the court has discretion to deny reimbursement when counsel has failed to comply with such procedures.
ben,edward,mary,rafael,stephen,eileen,and fawn conservatees appeal an order denying their petitions for reimbursement of expert costs concerning conservatorship proceedings under the lps act pursuant to welfare and institutions code section et the conservatees contend their appeals of the court order denying their petitions for reimbursement of expert costs was timely and the trial court abused its discretion by denying their petitions for reimbursement because they had established indigency and evidentiary need thereby providing authority for the court to order reimbursement.we affirm the order.

discussion 
ithe conservatees notice of appeal was timely 
the conservatees contend their appeals challenging the trial court september,order denying their petitions for reimbursement are timely.they assert the order was not pronounced in open court until december,and trial counsel had no actual notice that the trial court formal written order had been filed in september.therefore,the time period by when to file the notices of appeal did not begin to run until december.
background facts 
the court set the conservatees petitions for reimbursement of rappaport fees for hearing in august.at the hearing the court took the matter under submission.a minute order generated by the court reflects the hearing was taken off calendar pending the court decision.
on september,judge howard shore filed a written decision denying the conservatees petitions.in the decision the court considered whether there was any authority to support reimbursement.the court noted the san diego superior court local rules hereafter,local rules did provide for reimbursement of costs where counsel is appointed in lps act proceedings.the court,however,stated it had found no authority for the reimbursement of forensic expert fees in lps act cases where counsel was not appointed and where no prior application to the court for forensic services had been made.the court also stated that this court opinion in conservatorship of scharles d.scharles supported its conclusions.a copy of judge shore order was placed in each of the conservatees court files.
in october counsel for the conservatees filed a second set of petitions seeking to recover costs.at a december hearing,judge stephanie sontag denied the second set of petitions,stating judge shore had previously issued a ruling denying the petitions in september and that the ruling was in the court file.
in january ben,edward,mary,rafael,stephen and eileen each filed notice of appeal from judge sontag december order.about one week later edward filed a second notice of appeal from an o rder denying a request for costs made on august,the same day,mary and fawn filed notices of appeal from the september,order denying costs.
failure to provide reasonable notice 
as set forth in california rules of court rule a,appeals in conservatorship proceedings are governed by the rules of court applicable to noncapital criminal cases,rules through.rule a requires that a written notice of appeal be filed within days after the rendition of the judgment or the making of the order being appealed.thus,the question here is whether the conservatees timely filed their notices of appeal within the allotted time after the making of the order being appealed.
the conservatees cite to in re markaus d.markaus in support of the contention that their notice of appeal was timely.in markaus,the court concluded that when an order is pronounced in open court,the
