introduction 
plaintiff gary kusens appeals from the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants in this diversity action stemming from the termination of plaintiff employment.after a full trial on the merits,the district court granted the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on kusens statutory age discrimination and retaliation claims,but denied the motion with respect to plaintiff ohio public policy claim.the public policy claim was sent to the jury,which returned a verdict in favor of kusens.defendants then renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the public policy claim and the district court granted the renewed motion finding that plaintiff had failed to establish at trial that he was an employee,which the court held to be an essential element of a public policy claim under ohio law.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court decisions.
ii.factual and procedural background 
factual background 
plaintiff gary kusens was employed by defendant pascal company,pascal from until october,when his position was eliminated.at that time,plaintiff was years old.
kusens began his employment with pascal as a manufacturer sales representative or territory representative,responsible for selling dental products and developing accounts in his territory,which included chicago,milwaukee and other areas in the midwest.in plaintiff became a regional sales manager which entailed additional supervisory and managerial duties.his base salary increased and his commissions were determined as a fixed percentage of nationwide pascal sales.
during the latter part of the,however,pascal nationwide sales began to decline.to alleviate the company financial difficulties,pascal obtained funding from capco financial.capco,however,conditioned the funding on pascal cutting expenses by eliminating personnel.pascal complied with capco requirement and eliminated two of its four regional sales kusens and jim thorndale.
two of the people responsible for the elimination of plaintiff position were defendant benjamin paschall,the owner and ceo of the company,and defendant janet siwinski,pascal vice president of sales and marketing who was also plaintiff direct supervisor.at the time of the termination of his employment,plaintiff was the oldest of the four regional sales managers at pascal,and jim thorndale,who was terminated the same day as plaintiff,was the second oldest.the youngest two sales managers were retained.following his termination,plaintiff filed suit contending that he was fired because of his age and not because of pascal financial strategy.
to prove his claims of age discrimination and wrongful discharge in violation of public policy,plaintiff offered as evidence the testimony of a number of pascal employees who testified that both benjamin paschall and janet siwinski harbored ageist attitudes,both in general,and with regard to kusens,specifically.
eugene babos,pascal former president,testified that benjamin paschall repeatedly stated that when you are over,you ca sell you are too old to be a salesman.william sam wiebe,one of the retained regional sales managers,testified that defendant paschall told him that he did not like keeping older people because older people were expensive,that older people kind of drove up prices and insurance.
wiebe also testified that janet siwinski made a number of comments directed at plaintiff including gary,you acting old.we need more energy.we need younger people on board.we need some young guns we do need old people out in sales anymore.we need to get younger,and specifically stated to wiebe,that kusens is sure acting like an old man.wiebe further testified that,after plaintiff was terminated,and wiebe still retained,siwinski told him that he was the new way of doing business out with the old in with the new.plaintiff kusens also testified that siwinski called him old on a number of occasions that she would tell him t hat i was acting old.stop acting old.you are old.
plaintiff also offered as evidence that age motivated the decision to terminate him,a memorandum written by defendant siwinski to salli stretti,a sales consultant with holt dental,in which siwinski stated 
we had to release jim and gary october the stress was pretty darn bad,let me tell you anyway,w e did find a young man for the territory.steve zielinski,a pharmaceutical it sure is a lot more fun to hire than fire,and i just love the energy and enthusiasm of young people who want to work instead of oldies who want a free ride 
procedural background 
plaintiff originally filed his complaint on march,in the cuyahoga county,ohio court of common pleas alleging claims of age discrimination under ohio revised code a against his former employer,defendant pascal company count i,the company owner,benjamin paschall count ii,and his former supervisor,janet siwinski count iii.plaintiff also alleged a common law claim against pascal for wrongful discharge in violation of ohio public policy count iv.defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio on the basis of diversity jurisdiction following removal,defendant pascal filed a counterclaim alleging that plaintiff had breached his employment obligations to pascal through the fraudulent use of company funds,equipment,and resources for purposes unrelated to his employment.in response to the counterclaim,kusens filed a supplement to his complaint,adding a retaliation claim under i alleging that pascal filed the counterclaim to retaliate against him for filing his age discrimination claims.
after the close of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs claims.defendants argued that plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie claim of age discrimination or of violation of public policy under either a direct evidence approach or under the mcdonnell douglas standard.defendants further argued that even if plaintiff had made out a prima facie case,defendants offered a reason for their actions,economic necessity and a,and plaintiff failed to establish that the proffered reason was pretextual.with respect to the retaliation claim,defendants argued that i applies only to adverse employment actions and,since plaintiff was no longer employed by pascal when the counterclaim was filed,he could not make out a retaliation claim under the statute as a matter of law.
on october,the district court entered an opinion and order denying defendants motion for summary judgment,finding that issues of material fact existed with respect to whether defendants engaged in age discrimination in violation of ohio law.additionally,the district court found that genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to whether defendants filing of a counterclaim against kusens constituted an unlawful retaliatory act.accordingly,the case proceeded to trial before a jury on november.
after the close of proofs,defendants made an oral motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol on all of plaintiff claims on a variety of bases.first,defendants argued that plaintiff had failed to present direct evidence of discrimination and had failed to meet the mcdonnell douglas test.defendants further argued that plaintiff had failed to show pretext.second,defendants argued that pascal company is not an employer covered by the ohio civil rights statute because it did not have four or more employees within the state of ohio.the court agreed with defendants on this last point and,accordingly,granted defendants motion with regard to plaintiff claims of discrimination and retaliation under the civil rights statute.
the court then asked counsel to address the issue of whether plaintiff remaining claim under ohio public policy should remain and be submitted to the jury.defense counsel argued that the public policy claim was not argued nor even referenced in plaintiff opening statement or at any other time during the course of trial and,therefore,the claim should be dismissed in its entirety.plaintiff counsel countered that the claim should be presented to the jury because 
we certainly made reference to all the pertinent facts which gave rise to all of the claims pled including the wrongful discharge and policy.the fact that we did identify the legal theory,public policy,is no basis to have the direct ed verdict.the facts stated during the open ing statement was sic were sufficient to state the claim.
although the district court indicated that it believed defense counsel was correct in that there had been no argument regarding the public policy claim presented during trial and noted defense counsel exception for the record,it nonetheless ordered that this one claim be submitted to the jury,leav ing th e matter to be reviewed by perhaps others at a later time.
on november,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on his public policy claim,and awarded him in damages.defendants timely filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,for new trial or remittitur,arguing that d uring trial the plaintiff as a matter of law failed to establish a cause of action sounding in wrongful discharge in violation of ohio public policy.defendants detailed this argument in their memorandum in support of the motion pointing out that plaintiff failed to meet his burden to plead and prove all the elements necessary to establish a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of ohio public policy,and specifically enumerated three deficiencies in plaintiff proofs 
the plaintiff failed to plead and prove that he was an employee at will 
the uncontradicted evidence at trial established that the plaintiff position was eliminated for overriding business considerations and 
the plaintiff failed to establish a causal link between what he claimed was evidence of age based animus and the complained of employment decision.
the district court granted defendants renewed motion for jmol in an order and decision entered february,specifically,the court held that 
pascal is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the ground that kusens failed to adequately plead and prove at trial his claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.
order and decision.the court explained the precise basis for its decision 
under ohio law,recovery for tortious violation of public policy is available only to employees.kusens neglected to plead or present any evidence that he was an employee when pascal terminated his position.thus,the jury verdict can not stand.
id.at accordingly,judgment was entered in favor of defendants and against plaintiff kusens.
plaintiff subsequently filed a.e motion to alter judgment,or in the alternative,for a new trial pursuant to.a and c,asking the court to reinstate the jury verdict or in the alternative,to vacate its judgment and order a new trial on the sole issue concerning whether kusens was an employee during his employment with pascal.the district court denied both the rule e motion and the alternative new trial motion in an april,order and decision.plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.
on appeal,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in granting defendants renewed motion for jmol because defendants waived the argument that kusens failed to produce evidence of employment by their failure to raise this issue in their motion for judgment as a matter of law that even if the issue was not waived,employment is not a requirement for ohio public policy claims that if there is a requirement of employment,the presumption of employment should apply in absence of evidence to the contrary that even if evidence should have been produced by plaintiff on the issue of his status as an employee,the district court should have granted a new trial limited to the issue of kusens employment status that the district court erred in granting defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on kusens statutory retaliation claim because the provision of the ohio civil rights statute applies to any person,not just to employers and the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law to the individual defendants on kusens discrimination claims on the grounds that the individual defendants were not employed by an employer under the ohio statute.
in response defendants argue that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal because,when it ruled on defendants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court failed to rule on defendants alternative motion for new trial and that,even if this court does have jurisdiction,kusens waived his right to object to the district court decision to grant defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on kusens statutory discrimination and retaliation claims.finally,defendants arguing that the district court should have granted their motion for summary judgment.
iii.analysis 
a.the court has jurisdiction to hear the instant appeal 
as an initial matter,we will address defendants argument that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.defendants argument is predicated on the fact that although the district court ruled on defendants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,it never expressly ruled on defendants alternative motion for new trial or remittitur.defendants contend that because the district court neither denied nor conditionally granted their alternative motion for a new trial or remittitur as required by.c there has not been a final decision in this case such that jurisdiction over this matter is conferred on the court of appeals under 
in support of their argument,defendants rely upon inge rock financial,cir,in which we stated that a district court decision is final for purposes of when it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.id.at quoting catlin united states.however,neither inge,nor catlin,for that matter,involved a question of appellate court jurisdiction when a renewed motion for jmol is joined with an alternative motion for new trial but only the motion for jmol is expressly ruled upon by the lower court.inge addressed the finality issue only with regard to the timeliness of a notice of appeal and the effect on the time limit of a trial court subsequent decision on a rule e motion to vacate or reconsider the court earlier dismissal order.inge states nothing about whether a trial court failure to explicitly rule on a motion for new trial joined only as an alternative to a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law affects the appellate court jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the jmol there is no precedent in this circuit addressing this precise issue.
the ninth circuit squarely addressed the jurisdictional effect of an undecided alternative motion for new trial in vollrath sammi,cir,cert.denied,d.as in this case,in vollrath,the district court granted the defendant motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict but did not issue a conditional ruling on the defendant alternative motion for new trial as required by.c.the court of appeals found that this was error but determined the mere fact that the district court failed to comply with the requisites of the rule did not answer the question as to whether this error deprived the court of appellate jurisdiction.after careful analysis,the vollrath court ultimately answered this question in the negative.
the court began by noting that rule c does not specify the consequences for failure to issue a conditional ruling on the new trial motion.at.the court further specifically observed that rule c does not indicate that such a conditional ruling is a prerequisite to appellate jurisdiction.
the court,therefore,proceeded to examine rule c and its interplay with fed.a,which governs the time for filing a notice of appeal,and noted that the authorities prior to the amendment adopting subsection of fed.a were in general agreement that the district court failure to rule on a new trial motion in the alternative is,at most,a procedural flaw that does not affect appellate jurisdiction.id.the court then examined the effect of the addition of subsection to fed.a,which,at the time,provided,as follows 
if a timely motion under federal rules of civil procedure is filed in the district court by any party i for judgment under rule b ii under rule b to amend or make additional findings of fact,whether or not an alteration of the judgment would be required if the motion is granted iii under rule to alter or amend the judgment or iv under rule for a new trial,the time for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order denying a new trial or granting or denying any other such motion.a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of any of the above motions shall have no effect.a new notice of appeal must be filed within the prescribed time measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion as provided above 
the court first observed that the express words of rule a do not require an alternate ruling on a motion for new trial before a notice of appeal may be filed and then also noted that the policy behind the rule does not counsel that result 
rule a prevents a party from appealing a judgment when a pending motion renders the judgment.fed.rule a.specifically,the advisory committee note to the amendment to rule a makes clear that the rule was intended to prevent the appellate court from assuming jurisdiction in a case while the district court has before it a motion the granting of which would vacate or alter the judgment appealed from.a advisory committee note to amendment emphasis supplied in original.when a district court grants a motion for jnov,that order is the final judgment of the court.the district court does not have before it in an alternative motion for new trial a motion the granting of which would vacate or alter that judgment.the judgment based on the jnov could be altered only by reversal on appeal,not by any ruling by the district court.
we therefore conclude that we may properly exercise appellate jurisdiction over this case.
at additional emphasis added.
although not squarely addressing the question of jurisdiction,a number of other courts have addressed the question of how to proceed when confronted with an appeal of a decision on a motion for jmol where the district court had failed to rule on an alternate motion for new trial.although not directed toward the precise issue presented the district court failure to rule upon an alternative motion for new trial deprives this court of appellate decisions are instructive as to how appellate courts have viewed such inaction by district courts.
in ellison conoco,cir,cert.denied,d,the fifth circuit affirmed the district court ruling on the defendant motion for jnov,jmol and then found that,in light of that affirmance,the district court failure to rule on the defendant alternative motion for new trial constituted at most harmless error.and,where the district court ruling on a jmol motion could be read as an inferential denial of the alternative new trial motion,appellate courts have found no error in a district court failure to conform with the technical strictures of rule c.see,cleveland home shopping network,cir see also normand research institute of america,cir.
normand is particularly helpful.in normand,although the appellate court noted that the better practice would have been for the district court to have expressly ruled on the defendant new trial motion,at,it determined that an express ruling was not necessary in that case because it found that a denial of the new trial motion could be inferred from the district court ruling on the defendant motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
although the district court did not expressly rule on ria motion for new trial,its unequivocal judgment reflects an intent to dispose of the case completely and,inferentially,to reject the new trial motion.reviewing the motion,and noting that ria never sought a clarification of the judgment that would decide the new trial motion,we are convinced that it was denied.
at footnote omitted.but see havird oil,marathon oil,cir rule c requires an explicit ruling on a motion for new trial a priori,the rule does not permit entry of judgment to dispose of the motion implicitly.
in addressing the question of whether an issue has been preserved for appeal,the fifth,seventh and eleventh circuits take the position that the burden is on the party whose motion invoked rule c in the trial court to pursue a direct ruling on the alternative motion for a new trial when the district court granted the judgment as a matter of law in order to preserve the issue for appeal.see,vera cruz chesapeake,cir,cert.denied,d oberman dun bradstreet,cir edwards board of regents,cir arenson southern university law center,cir.where the moving party did not press upon the lower court the issue of the need for a ruling on the new trial motion after the grant of a motion for jmol,according to the seventh and eleventh circuits it is deemed to have been abandoned.edwards,supra vera cruz,supra.
under this approach,it would have been incumbent upon defendants to file a motion for reconsideration or clarification in the district court if they also wanted a ruling on their alternative new trial motion after the district court granted their renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,and their failure to do so would constitute a waiver of their right to raise this issue as a matter of appeal.
other courts have taken the position that,notwithstanding the language of.c directing that i f the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted,the district court shall also rule on the motion for a new trial,where an appeal is filed in a case where the district court failed to enter a conditional order on a new trial motion,the appellate court has discretion either to remand the matter to the district court to let it decide the new trial motion,or to decide the new trial motion itself in connection with the appeal of the jmol.see,freund nycomed amersham,cir,and cases cited therein,neely martin eby construction,d noting that under rule c,the trial judge should rule conditionally on the new trial motion when he grants judgment but finding implicit in the rule provisions that the appellate court has the right itself to grant or deny a new trial in appropriate cases.
the decisions instruct on our jurisdictional question not only by their content but also by their silence because to have made the rulings they did,the various courts of appeals first would have had to have been satisfied that appellate jurisdiction existed.
it is that the federal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction,city of dallas,d.thus,the courts of appeals have an independent duty to satisfy themselves of their appellate jurisdiction before entertaining an appeal regardless of whether jurisdiction is challenged by the parties.see general acquisition,gencorp,cir.see also,amazon,dirt camp,cir kreider dairy farms,glickman,cir dannenberg software toolworks,cir.accordingly,before the courts in the cases discussed herein could find harmless error or an inferential denial of an alternative new trial motion,for example,they would have had to have determined first that appellate jurisdiction existed.therefore,their substantive rulings arguably also constitute sub silentio findings that the requisites for appellate jurisdiction were satisfied.
guided by the various decisions discussed herein,we conclude that the district court failure to explicitly rule on defendant alternative motion for new trial in this case does not affect our jurisdiction over this appeal.we first note,as did the ninth circuit in vollrath,that a rule c alternative motion for new trial is not one of the motions listed in the current version of fed.a that would render a notice of appeal effective only after the district court enters an order disposing of such motion.thus,under the plain language of rule,there is nothing precluding this court from assuming jurisdiction over this matter.moreover,as the ninth circuit found in vollrath,a conditional ruling on defendants alternative motion for new trial in this case would not vacate or alter the district court decision on the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.the grant of the renewed motion for jmol is the final judgment of the district court.
furthermore,as the fifth circuit found with respect to the district court ruling in normand,in this case,it can be inferred not only from the judgment but also from the district court various rulings that the district court at least implicitly denied defendants alternative new trial motion when it granted defendants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and then expressly denied both plaintiff subsequent motion to alter judgment and his alternative motion for a new trial.additionally,as indicated above,defendants did not pursue the alternative new trial issue in the district court after its renewed motion for jmol was granted.defendants never filed a motion for clarification nor did they request an amendment of the judgment.under these circumstances,we conclude that defendants alternative motion for new trial was implicitly denied and that the district court failure to explicitly rule on the matter was at most a harmless procedural error which does not affect our jurisdiction over this appeal.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.snyder trucking,cir.judgment as a matter of law is proper where there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party on that issue,and where the claim can not under the controlling law be maintained without a favorable finding on that issue.a.in diversity cases,when a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law is based on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,this court applies the standard of review used by the courts of the state whose substantive law governs the action.morales american honda motor,cir k t,zurich ins,cir.

defendants did not waive their jmol argument that plaintiff failed to produce evidence of employment 
plaintiff raises a threshold question with respect to defendants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law plaintiff argues that the district court was without authority to grant defendants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law because defendants failed to raise kusens failure to plead and prove employment in their rule a motion for jmol.plaintiff thus argues that defendants waived their right to raise this issue in a motion.plaintiff contends that defendants oral motion for judgment as a matter of law on the public policy claim was predicated only upon one failure to mention the public policy claim in his opening statement.he claims no argument of failure to prove an essential element of his ever made.
under.a,a motion for judgment as a matter of law must specify the judgment sought and the law and facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.a motion for judgment may not advance additional grounds that were not raised in the motion.american and foreign ins.bolt,cir.however,in stating the grounds in the required motion,technical precision is not necessary.rockport pharmacy,digital simplistics,cir scottish heritable trust,plc peat marwick main,cir,cert.denied,d technical noncompliance with rule b may be excused in situations in which the purposes of the rule are satisfied.
although rule a requires a motion for judgment as a matter of law to state the specific grounds,the rule does not define how specific the grounds must be.anderson united telephone of kansas,cir,cert.denied,d.because the requirement that a rule a motion must precede a rule b motion is harsh in any circumstance,a rule a motion should not be reviewed narrowly but rather in light of the purpose of the rules to secure a just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of the case.id.at.accordingly,where rule a,providing notice to the court and opposing counsel of any deficiencies in the opposing party case prior to sending it to the been met,courts usually take a liberal view of what constitutes a motion sufficient to support a motion.see rankin evans,cir,cert.denied,d collecting cases.
guided by these principles,the court in rockport pharmacy,digital simplistics,supra,found a argument in the defendant motion sufficient to authorize the consideration of the defendant more specifically stated motion.in that tort action,the defendant argued in its motion that,under missouri law,there must be a duty of care owed to the plaintiff and that a mere breach of contract does not establish such a duty.defendant repeated that same argument in its motion,but in a supplemental brief supporting that motion,provided further basis for its claim arguing that there can be no tort liability under missouri law where the plaintiff is seeking recovery solely for economic losses.at.the district court concluded that the only issue preserved for consideration was whether the defendant owed a duty of care that was independent of the parties contractual relationship and,having already found in denying the defendant motion that defendant owed such a duty,defendant motion was denied.id.
the eighth circuit reversed,explaining 
although the economic loss ground advanced in digital motion may have been somewhat different from the ground advanced in the motion,we conclude that those grounds were inextricably intertwined.under missouri law,in any negligence action the plaintiff must first establish that a duty exists by the defendant to protect the plaintiff from the injury suffered.the mere existence of a contract does not give rise to a duty in tort.similarly,there is no duty to exercise reasonable care to protect against a loss that is purely economic in nature.consequently,in determining whether a breach of contract may give rise to tort liability,the nature of the alleged injury is an essential factor that must be considered.
the substance of rockport negligence claim is for the recovery of losses arising out of digital alleged breach of contract.thus,the nature of rockport alleged injury is an essential factor in determining whether digital can be considered to have owed rockport a duty of reasonable care.the district court did not consider the nature of rockport injury in answering the duty question given that the nature of an alleged injury arising from a breach of contract is necessarily subsumed within the duty question,we conclude that the economic loss argument was adequately raised by digital argument.the nature of the claimed injury is a necessary element in answering the question whether digital owed rockport a duty of care that was independent of the parties contractual relationship.accordingly,we conclude that digital economic loss argument is properly before us.
id.at citations and some internal punctuation omitted.see also parkway garage,city of philadelphia,cir holding that an issue raised in a motion,albeit a bit obliquely,sufficed to warrant consideration of a more motion for jmol.
this case is substantially similar to rockport.in rockport,the defendant presented in its motion only a generalized argument challenging the sufficiency of plaintiff negligence claim.then,in its motion,defendant argued with specificity the failure of the plaintiff to establish an essential element of the duty of care.here,defendants motion argument was a general argument made orally that plaintiff failed to argue his public policy claim,at all.the motion,which was made in writing and was fully briefed,presented the failure to establish a public policy claim with specificity.
in making his motion,defense counsel stated 
the public policy claim was not argued,not mentioned in the opening statement.therefore,at that point in time,i was actually entitled to make a directed verdict motion after the opening statement and i am doing that a t this point now,because there been no reference to it in this case.
plaintiff counsel countered 
w e certainly made reference to all the pertinent facts which gave rise to all of the claims pled including the wrongful discharge and policy.the fact that we did identify the legal theory,public policy,is no basis to have the direct ed verdict.the facts stated during the open ing statement was sic were sufficient to state the claim.
after considering the arguments of counsel,the court noted defendants exception for the record and expressly acknowledged,i believe defendants are correct.there has been no argument regarding the public policy claim in this case.nonetheless,the district court determined that the public policy claim should be submitted to the jury and to leave the matter to be reviewed at a later time.defense counsel argument and the court statements and ruling were sufficient to alert plaintiff to the evidentiary insufficiency alleged by failure to plead and prove his cause of action.see generally,gutzwiller fenik,cir a motion must alert opposing counsel to the evidentiary insufficiency with enough specificity to allow counsel the opportunity to correct the deficiency before the matter is submitted to the jury.
after the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff,defendants submitted a written motion and brief arguing that plaintiff failed to meet his burden to plead and prove all the elements necessary to establish a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of ohio public policy,and then argued specifically,the failure to plead or prove three elements in particular,including the element of employment.
although this is a close question,we find no error in the district court conclusion that i n the motion for sic jmol,pascal simply restate d the identical argument raised in its motion in more precise terms.order and decision.accordingly,we find that no waiver occurred.
employment is an essential element of a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of ohio public policy 
plaintiff next argues that the district court erred in determining that employment is an essential element of an ohio public policy claim and that plaintiff,therefore,was required to prove his status as an employee at trial.
the tort action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy had its genesis in ohio in greeley miami valley maintenance contractors,ohio.in that case,a terminated employee brought a complaint alleging that he was discharged as a result of a court order that required his employer to withhold the terminated employee child support payments through wage assignment.at that time in ohio,d prohibited the firing of employees because of court orders to withhold earnings the trial court dismissed the complaint finding that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because no claim sounding in tort existed in ohio for wrongful discharge.the court of appeals affirmed.the ohio supreme court reversed,finding that,although d did not provide for a civil cause of action to be brought by an aggrieved employee,public policy required that the terminated employee be given a cause of action in wrongful discharge to redress a violation of the statute.
accordingly,the greeley court created a public policy exception to the employment doctrine 
we believe that the time has come for ohio to join the great number of states which recognize a public policy exception to the doctrine.the general assembly has expressed its will that employers be prohibited from discharging employees for the reason upon which appellant bases his cause of action.it is our job to enforce,not frustrate,that policy.
therefore,we hold that public policy warrants an exception to the doctrine when an employee is discharged or disciplined for a reason which is prohibited by statute.

it is under this tort theory that plaintiff kusens sued his former employer.however,it is under ohio law that in order for an employee to bring a cause of action pursuant to greeley,supra,that employee must have been an employee.see haynes zoological soc.of cincinnati,ohio,stephenson yellow freight systems,wl,ohio app.dist,app.denied,ohio,edwards dubruiel,wl,ohio app.dist greeley claims are limited to employees woods miamisburg city schools,d,a lthough ohio recognizes claims for discharge in violation of public policy,ohio courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to expand that claim beyond the discharge of an employee.it has further been explicitly held that to establish a claim for tortious violation of public policy,plaintiff had to plead and prove that he was an employee at will.strausbaugh ohio of transportation,ohio app d.where the discharged employee fails to prove at trial that he was an employee,entry of judgment in favor of the is proper.see,ohio app d at,at.
coolidge riverdale local school district did not abrogate the requirement of employment 
plaintiff claims that the rule enunciated in haynes zoological soc.of in order for an employee to bring a cause of action pursuant to greeley,the aggrieved employee must have been an employee overruled by the ohio supreme court in coolidge riverdale local school district,ohio.plaintiff contends,that in coolidge,the ohio supreme court created a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy even though the plaintiff in coolidge was not an employee.plaintiff believes that since coolidge was allowed to pursue her ohio public policy claim even though she was not an employee,a proper inference would be that employment is no longer a prerequisite to establishing a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of a public policy.
plaintiff misconstrues coolidge.in that case,an ohio public school teacher suffered a injury and was receiving workers compensation temporary total disability ttd benefits.when the teacher exhausted all leave available under her employment contract,the school board terminated her due to her continued absence from work following her termination,coolidge filed suit claiming that her discharge contravened the public policy reflected in the ohio workers compensation act ttd provision,and the provision of the statute,which provides 
no employer shall discharge,demote,reassign,or take any punitive action against any employee because the employee filed a claim or instituted,pursued or testified in any proceedings under the workers compensation act for an injury or occupational disease which occurred in the course of and arising out of his employment with that employer.
prior to coolidge,ohio recognized such claims only when the plaintiff claim was predicated upon the filing of a workers compensation claim.in coolidge,the ohio supreme court determined that the public policy embodied within the workers compensation act warranted extending the coverage of the statute to persons already receiving ttd benefits,as well.the coolidge court reasoned 
a temporarily and totally disabled employee is by definition physically unable to perform the duties of his or her former position of employment.considering that the statute is designed to provide the injured worker with the necessary means to subsist during a period of ttd,it would be inconsistent to allow the employer to fire such a worker solely because of the disability for which the employee is being compensated.
in our opinion,the policy of protection embodied in the workers compensation act can be effectuated only if an employer is not permitted to discharge an employee for being absent from work due to an allowed injury for which the employee is receiving ttd compensation.we hold,therefore,that an employee who is receiving ttd compensation pursuant to may not be discharged solely on the basis of absenteeism or inability to work,when the absence or inability to work is directly related to an allowed condition.
ohio at,at citations omitted and emphasis added.see also salyer honda of america,cv,wl,the rule prohibiting the discharge of an employee based on absences for an allowed injury is necessary to protect the right of employees to freely pursue workers compensation benefits without fear of reprisal quoting coolidge,at.
as is evident from the foregoing excerpt,the public policy holding in coolidge was narrowly confined to claims of discharge in contravention of the policy underpinnings of the workers compensation act.nothing
