carolyn burlison,james eady,jerry floyd,robert gunter,and steven reinsch the appellees worked for mcdonald corporation mcdonald for about fifteen years in some cases many more before mcdonald terminated their employment in conjunction with a nationwide restructuring.mcdonald offered its terminated employees severance packages so long as those employees signed releases waiving any claims they might have against the company.each appellee signed the releases but about two years later filed an suit against mcdonald.the district court granted summary judgment to the appellees,concluding that the releases failed to comply with the older workers benefit protection act owbpa informational requirements and were therefore void.f h.mcdonald filed the present interlocutory appeal,arguing that the district court erroneous reading of the owbpa would require employers to provide uncalled for and unhelpful information to departing employees.we agree with mcdonald.accordingly,we reverse the district court order of summary judgment in favor of the appellees and enter summary judgment in favor of mcdonald.
background 
during the fall of,mcdonald substantially restructured its business operations with hopes of increasing efficiency and competitiveness,promoting accountability and enhancing effectiveness at all levels of the company.as part of its restructuring,mcdonald reduced its divisions from five to three and its regions from to.relevant here,the former atlanta region merged with the former nashville and greenville regions to form a new atlanta region.
in addition to the structural reorganization,mcdonald also reduced its workforce by about employees nationwide.to facilitate the,mcdonald provided employees with individualized assessments designed to determine which employees to retain for the new regions.mcdonald selected william lamar,the regional manager of the former atlanta region,to serve as the general manager of the new atlanta region.lamar worked with a group of senior managers to determine which of employees from the former atlanta,nashville and greenville regions to retain for the new atlanta region.lamar and the other managers eventually discharged of the employees,including the appellees.each appellee was at least forty years old at the time his or her employment with mcdonald concluded,and most had worked at the company for at least fifteen years.
mcdonald offered each discharged employee a severance package in exchange for signing a release waiving all claims he or she might have against the company.mcdonald,in a purported attempt to comply with the owbpa,included information sheets with the releases.the information sheet for the regions listed the job titles and ages of employees in the three former regions identified which of those employees had been selected for discharge and offered severance packages and identified which of those employees were not being discharged.
the appellees signed the releases and accepted the severance benefits that mcdonald offered.in,however,the appellees sued mcdonald,alleging age discrimination under the age discrimination in employment act adea.they conceded that they had filed the releases but argued that the releases failed to comply with the owbpa informational requirements and were therefore void.the district court agreed with the appellees that the releases were insufficient and accordingly granted them summary judgment.mcdonald requested permission to file an interlocutory appeal.the district court certified the issue for appeal,which we accepted.mcdonald now argues that the district court erroneous interpretation of the owbpa would require it to provide incompatible sets of data to terminated employees.
ii.analysis 
this case presents a question of pure statutory interpretation.we review a district court interpretation of a statute de novo.united states trainor,cir.although many of our cases have interpreted various provisions of the adea including the owbpa,we have never dealt directly with the owbpa informational requirements.
since this case involves statutory interpretation,the first place we turn is to the statute itself.harry marchant,cir en banc.the adea,as amended by the owbpa,requires that waivers of potential claims be knowing and voluntary.f a h oubre entergy,d.in order to obtain knowing and voluntary releases,employers must meet the owbpa specific requirements,including its requirement that the employer provide information about the ages of discharged and retained workers to employees considering releasing potential adea claims.see also raczak ameritech,cir griffin kraft foods,cir,at,as reprinted in.specifically,employers seeking waivers in connection with group terminations must 
inform the individual in writing in a manner calculated to be understood by the average individual eligible to participate,as to 
i any class,unit,or group of individuals covered by such program,any eligibility factors for such program,and any time limits applicable to such program and 
ii the job titles and ages of all individuals eligible or selected for the program,and the ages of all individuals in the same job classification or organizational unit who are not eligible or selected for the program.
f h.precisely what these subsections require is the focus of this appeal.
the district court interpreted subsection ii to require that mcdonald provide job titles and ages of all employees nationwide who were terminated but the ages of only those employees in the same decisional unit as the terminated employees.mcdonald,on the contrary,argues that the owbpa requires employers to provide information about only those workers within a departing employee decisional unit 
specifically,mcdonald argues that the provisions of the owbpa must be read as a consistent whole and that congress repeated use of the word program indicates that subsection i limits the universe of potential employees in subsection ii to any class,unit,or group of individuals covered by such program.the appellees argue that it is inappropriate to introduce limitations into subsection ii.congress used different words for a reason,they argue subsection ii first clause contains no limiting language and therefore requires that employers provide job titles and information for every single eligible employee in the company.neither interpretation requires much linguistic stretching,and other courts considering related issues have concluded that owbpa is imprecise and ambiguous,raczak,at we unanimously conclude because the nomenclature of f h of title is ambiguous,a rigid and mechanical interpretation of that provision in inappropriate.the only fair conclusion,then,is that the owbpa is ambiguous.
since the owbpa is ambiguous,it is appropriate and necessary to turn to other tools of statutory interpretation,united states dbb,cir royal caribbean cruises,united states,cir.an important tool in this case is the principle that,where statutes are ambiguous,courts will defer to rules and regulations promulgated by the agency charged with administering the statute,so long as that agency does not act arbitrarily or capriciously or exceed the bounds of authority delegated to it in the statute.see chevron natural resources defense council,d royal caribbean cruises,at.here we look to the equal employment opportunities commission eeoc,as congress has charged it with administering the adea.the relevant regulations begin at.
the eeoc regulations contemplate two potential classes of employee discharge programs.the first class is the program,which encompasses voluntary severance packages designed to induce employees to leave their jobs and is not relevant here.f iii a.the second other employment termination programs encompasses those programs applying to employees who are involuntarily terminated and offered additional consideration in exchange for choosing to sign waivers.id.mcdonald program plainly falls within the other employment termination programs category.
as noted above,the district court relied in part on the owbpa use of different terms to conclude that the statute required information other than what mcdonald provided.one clause in subsection ii requires informati
