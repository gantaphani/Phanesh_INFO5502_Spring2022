introduction 
in these original proceedings,we consider an issue of first impression arising from elder abuse litigation whether the statute of limitations applicable to a civil action for damages against a health care provider convicted of felony elder abuse,is code of civil procedure section,which provides a maximum limitations period for medical malpractice actions,or code of civil procedure section which provides a limitations period of at least one year after the judgment of conviction for an action based on the defendant commission of a felony offense.
after petitioner guardian north bay,guardian pleaded no contest to six counts of felony elder abuse of patients,three actions for damages were filed against guardian.the complaints allege that guardian was convicted of violating penal code section by willfully injuring or endangering plaintiffs deceased parents while they were patients in guardian skilled nursing facility.guardian contended in its demurrers to the complaints that the actions are by section,because the actions were not filed within the limitations period for medical malpractice.the trial court agreed with plaintiffs that their actions were timely filed under section within one year of guardian convictions for felony elder abuse,and overruled guardian demurrers on that ground.because we conclude that section is the applicable statute of limitations and therefore the demurrers were properly overruled,we will deny the petitions for extraordinary relief from the trial court orders.
ii.factual and procedural background 
guardian filed a demurrer in response to each of the three complaints filed after guardian convictions for felony elder abuse.when its demurrers were overruled,guardian petitioned this court in each case for a writ of mandate directing respondent court to vacate its order and to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.we summarily denied the three petitions.guardian then petitioned for review by the california supreme court,which granted review as to each petition and ordered this court to vacate its order denying mandate and to issue an order directing respondent court to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.we have complied with the california supreme court order.
additionally,because the writ petitions raise the same statute of limitations issue,we ordered that these original proceedings be consolidated for purposes of the order to show cause,briefing,oral argument and decision.we also issued a temporary stay of all trial court proceedings while our writ review was pending,and granted the application of the california association of health facilities to file an amicus curiae brief in support of petitioner.
our review begins with a summary of the factual and procedural background of each case,guardian demurrers,and the trial court orders.

guardian demurrers 
to each of these very similar complaints,guardian filed a nearly identical demurrer asserting that the complaint was fatally defective,for several reasons.
first,guardian contended that the entire complaint was by section,the statute of limitations set forth in micra the medical injury compensation reform act stats,ch,for actions based on professional negligence by a health care provider.under section,guardian noted,the limitations period for a medical negligence claim expires one year after discovery of the negligently caused injury,with a maximum period of three years from the actual date of injury.guardian argued that because plaintiffs claims arose from the rendering of professional medical services during their decedents admissions to guardian of los gatos,under section the limitations period for each plaintiff claims expired no later than one year after their decedents discharges in and.therefore,guardian asserted that all three complaints were untimely filed in.
second,guardian rejected plaintiffs contention that their complaints were timely filed pursuant to section within one year from the date of guardian convictions for felony elder abuse in may.guardian argued that section was intended to apply only to civil actions filed by victims of violent crimes and can not operate to extend the limitations period for claims of professional medical negligence which are exclusively governed by micra.guardian further argued that section is applicable because it is the specific statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims,while section is a more general statute of limitations.alternatively,guardian contended that because plaintiffs in their personal capacities were not the victims of the felony offenses to which guardian pleaded no contest,they were not entitled to benefit from the longer limitations period which section provides for claims by victims of violent crimes.
finally,guardian argued that the various causes of action in each complaint were improperly pleaded,uncertain or otherwise defective for reasons that need not be discussed here because those grounds are not at issue in the present writ proceedings.based on these arguments and its defense,guardian urged the trial court to sustain its demurrers without leave to amend.
plaintiffs opposition 
in each of their opposition points and authorities,plaintiffs made similar arguments in response to guardian demurrers.regarding guardian defense,plaintiffs argued that the controlling statute is section,because that statute is part of a comprehensive statutory scheme enacted to achieve proposition goal of providing restitution to all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity.under section,plaintiffs asserted,their actions were timely filed less than one year from may,the date of guardian pleas.
plaintiffs explained that micra is inapplicable because micra governs civil liability for professional negligence,and their cases do not involve professional negligence.instead,their complaints allege conduct by guardian which is more egregious than professional negligence and which falls within penal code section,the statute that imposes criminal liability upon a defendant who willfully causes or permits an elder adult in defendant custody to be injured or endangered.further,plaintiffs argued that they are victims within the meaning of section because the statutory definition of victim in government code section provides that any person who sustains a physical or emotional injury as the direct result of a crime is a victim for purposes of restitution.because plaintiffs suffered extreme emotional injury when they observed their parents suffering at guardian of los gatos,plaintiffs contended that each of them is also a victim of guardian criminal conduct.
f.the trial court orders 
in its orders,the trial court sustained in part and overruled in part guardian demurrers.the demurrers to the causes of action for fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment were sustained with leave to amend.the demurrer to the cause of action for unfair business practice was sustained without leave to amend on grounds that plaintiffs did not oppose this demurrer.as to the remaining causes of action,the trial court orders stated that the demurrers to these causes of action were overruled on all grounds.accordingly,we assume that the trial court rejected guardian argument that each complaint on its face is by the section statute of limitations for professional medical negligence.
iii.discussion 
a.the standard of review 
the standard of review for an order overruling a demurrer is de novo.the reviewing court accepts as true all facts properly pleaded in the complaint in order to determine whether the demurrer should be overruled.fed.land bank superior court d.a demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,but is not necessarily,barred.citation.in order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer,the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action may be barred.citation.marshall gibson,dunn crutcher th,d see also childs state of california d.in the present cases,as we will explain,we do not find it clear on the face of the complaints that the actions are pursuant to section.
b.the two statutes of limitations at issue 
to determine whether the trial court properly overruled guardian demurrers on statute of limitations grounds,a threshold question must be addressed whether the applicable statute of limitations is section,which provides a maximum limitations period for medical malpractice actions,or section,which provides a limitations period of at least one year after the judgment of conviction for an action for damages based on a defendant commission of a felony offense.the california supreme court has set forth guidelines for determining which statute of limitations applies when there is an apparent conflict.in seeking to determine which statute of limitations was intended to govern on facts such as those before us,our goal is to discern the probable intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the laws in question.citations.we examine the statutes in their context and with other legislation on the same subject citation.if they conflict on a central element,we strive to harmonize them so as to give effect to each.if conflicting statutes can not be reconciled,later enactments supersede earlier ones citations and more specific provisions take precedence over more general ones.citation.absent a compelling reason to do otherwise,we strive to construe each statute in accordance with its plain language.collection bureau of san jose rumsey cal th,d.following these guidelines,we first examine the plain language and legislative purpose of the two statutes of limitations at issue.
section provides,in pertinent part,that u nless a longer period is prescribed for a specific action,in any action for damages against a defendant based upon such person commission of a felony offense for which the defendant has been convicted,the time for commencement of the action shall be within one year after judgment is pronounced.section is an urgency statute which took effect on september,and was enacted in the implementation of proposition the victims bill of rights,cal,art.i.gallo superior court d.
specifically,section was enacted as part of a statutory scheme to implement proposition constitutional requirement that persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.people broussard cal th,d,quoting cal,art.i,subd.b.the legislative history for section indicates that the legislature proposed a special statute of limitations for felony crime victims in order to facilitate restitution by encouraging civil lawsuits against criminal defendants.the senate committee on the judiciary comment on assembly bill states that t his bill would grant a plaintiff who was the victim of a felony and was suing the person convicted of the felony the following advantages an extension of the period in which suit might be brought until one year after judgment was pronounced in the criminal case.the purpose of the bill is to encourage felony victims to sue those convicted of the felony in order to obtain restitution.on judiciary,com.on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
nothing in the legislative history for section indicates that the legislature intended to exclude any category of felony victim from the advantage of the extended limitations period.to the contrary,our supreme court has stated that proposition constitutional mandate of victim restitution was intended to protect all crime victims,regardless of the nature of their loss.people broussard,supra,cal th at,d.the statutory scheme for restitution also provides a broad definition of victim,which includes a derivative victim.a derivative victim is defined as the parent,sibling,spouse,or child of a victim who sustained injury or death as a direct result of a crime,subds.a,a a.
most importantly,the plain language of section is broad.the statute expressly provides that in any action for damages against a defendant,which is based upon such person commission of a felony offense for which the defendant has been convicted,the applicable limitations period is one year from the date judgment of conviction is pronounced,unless a longer limitations period applies,italics added.thus,for the section limitations period to apply,the action in question must meet only three requirements the action is for damages the action is based upon defendant commission of a felony offense and defendant has been convicted of that felony offense.
in pertinent part,section provides that i n an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person alleged professional negligence,the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for any of the following upon proof of fraud,intentional concealment,or the presence of a foreign body,which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect,in the person of the injured person.a skilled nursing facility is a health care provider for purposes of section.alcott rehabilitation hospital superior court th,d.
by its plain language,section applies to actions based upon a defendant professional negligence.professional negligence is defined as a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services,which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death,provided that such services are within the scope of services for which the provider is licensed and which are not within any restriction imposed by the licensing agency or licensed hospital,subd.
the current version of section was enacted in as part of micra.our supreme court has stated that s ection is part of an interrelated legislative scheme enacted to deal specifically with all medical malpractice claims.young haines cal d.evidently,the legislature found a relationship between the malpractice insurance crisis and the former statute of limitations.commentators had observed that the delayed discovery rule and the resulting long tail claims made it difficult to set premiums at an appropriate level.citations.presumably,the legislative goal in amending section to reduce the maximum limitations period from four to three years was to give insurers greater certainty about their liability for any given period of coverage,so that premiums could be set to cover costs.id.at.
thus,section was enacted as a sharply reduced statute of limitations for malpractice plaintiffs with restricted tolling provisions.young haines,supra,cal d at.our supreme court has ruled that n o tolling provision outside of micra can extend the maximum time period that section establishes.belton bowers ambulance service cal th,d,prevents tolling in prisoner suits beyond the year maximum.accordingly,an action for personal injury or wrongful death,which is based upon a negligent act or omission to act by a skilled nursing facility in the rendering of professional services,is subject to the section maximum limitations period of three years from the date of injury,absent tolling for fraud,intentional concealment,or presence of a foreign body.
section is the applicable statute of limitations 
based on our review,we discern that the purpose of section is to encourage the victim of a crime to obtain restitution by bringing an action for damages against the perpetrator when the perpetrator has been convicted of a felony offense.the minimum limitations period of at least one year from the judgment of conviction allows the victim to sue the defendant when an otherwise applicable statute of limitations has expired.in the cases at bar,the face of each complaint shows that section is the applicable statute of limitations because each of the section criteria is met.plaintiffs are victims for purposes of restitution,and in each case they have brought an action for damages which is based on allegations of defendant guardian commission of a felony offense elder abuse in violation of,and which alleges that guardian was convicted of violating penal code by committing criminal elder abuse with respect to each plaintiff decedent.
however,petitioner guardian rejects this conclusion on grounds that plaintiffs claims are based on professional negligence,consisting of the provision of supposedly inadequate professional services,and therefore the claims are within the scope of micra and section is the applicable statute of limitations.guardian contends that section can not be applied to extend the limitations period for professional negligence actions because that result would be contrary to the purpose of micra.in guardian words,a pplying section could not be more completely at odds with micra,undercutting its core legislative goal.it would reintroduce uncertainty and unpredictability into the limitations process that micra expressly sought to weed out.as long as a criminal charge is pending or could still be filed,as long as a criminal judgment is stayed,the potential for civil litigation would remain.to avoid this result,guardian urges that the micra statute of limitations must apply,in the same way that the procedural limitations of section have been held to apply to a punitive damages claim against a health care provider in an action that alleges intentional tort
