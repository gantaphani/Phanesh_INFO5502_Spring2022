the plaintiff,martha gillmore,as the executrix of mary fillbright estate,appeals the decision of the appellate court d,affirming the decision of the circuit court of menard county in turn confirming the administrative decision of the illinois department of human services dhs.the dhs found fillbright eligible for medicaid,but imposed a penalty period because fillbright had purchased a balloon annuity that the dhs considered an improper transfer of assets pursuant to a state regulation.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
in,congress enacted title xix of the social security act,commonly known as the medicaid act.see et.this statute created a cooperative program in which the federal government reimburses state governments for a portion of the costs to provide medical assistance to two low income groups the categorically needy and the medically needy.the categorically needy are persons who are automatically eligible to receive cash grants under one of the general welfare aid to families with dependent children program afdc et or the supplemental security income for the aged,blind,or disabled program ssi et.see ilcs west et.the medically needy are persons who are ineligible to receive cash grants under afdc or ssi because their resources exceed the eligibility threshold for those programs,but who still lack the ability to pay for medical assistance.see ilcs west et.people who fall into the second category are called mang medical grant recipients.see.a march.to qualify for medicaid as a mang recipient,a person must have low income and low assets,and the person must spend down any resources over the statutory and regulatory limits.see.d march.
states that choose to participate in the medicaid program design their own plans and set reasonable standards for eligibility and assistance.see a.states must comply with certain broad requirements imposed by federal statutes and regulations issued by the united states department of health and human services,which oversees the medicaid program through the health care financing administration hcfa,now called the centers for medicaid and medicare services.see schweiker gray panthers,d,west virginia university hospitals,casey,cir medicaid is basically administered by each state within certain broad requirements and guidelines.each state also must designate a single agency to administer its medicaid plan,though another agency may make eligibility determinations.see a see also a.in illinois,the medicaid agency is the department of public aid dpa.see ilcs west american society of consultant pharmacists garner,d.the dhs makes eligibility determinations in accord with dpa regulations.see ilcs west.
in,congress sought to combat the rapidly increasing costs of medicaid by enacting statutory provisions to ensure that persons who could pay for their own care did not receive assistance.congress mandated that,in determining medicaid eligibility,a state must into a three or period,depending on the asset,before a person applied for assistance to determine if the person made any transfers solely to become eligible for medicaid.see c b.if the person disposed of assets for less than fair market value during the period,the person is ineligible for medical assistance for a statutory penalty period based on the value of the assets transferred.see c a.congress also mandated that a state plan for medical assistance must comply with,inter alia,the provisions of section with respect to transfers of assets and treatment of certain trusts.a.if the person establishes a trust during the period,any portion of such a trust from which no payments could be made to the person shall be considered assets disposed of by that person.see d b ii.that is,any assets disposed of during the period are countable toward medicaid limits and subject to the requirement,if the person resources are over those limits.the term trust includes an annuity only to such extent and in such manner as the secretary of health and human services specifies.d.
in november,the hcfa did just that in a policy document known as transmittal.state medicaid manual,health care financing administration pub,transmittal,b november.transmittal provided guidelines for state medicaid caseworkers on how to evaluate the transfer of assets into trusts and annuities.an annuity is a contract in which a person pays a bank or an insurance company a lump sum in return for fixed periodic payments.if the person dies during the term of the annuity,the remainder is typically converted into a lump sum and paid to a designated beneficiary.see state medicaid manual,health care financing administration pub,transmittal,b november see generally black law dictionary ed.according to the hcfa 
annuities,although usually purchased in order to provide a source of income for retirement,are occasionally used to shelter assets so that individuals purchasing them can become eligible for medicaid.in order to avoid penalizing annuities validly purchased as part of a retirement plan but to capture those annuities which abusively shelter assets,a determination must be made with regard to the ultimate purpose of the annuity,whether the purchase of the annuity constitutes a transfer of assets for less than fair market value.if the expected return on the annuity is commensurate with a reasonable estimate of life expectancy of the beneficiary,the annuity can be deemed actuarially sound.
the average number of years of expected life remaining for the individual must coincide with the life of the annuity.if the individual is not reasonably expected to live longer than the guarantee period of the annuity,the individual will not receive fair market value for the annuity based on the projected return.in this case,the annuity is not actuarially sound and a transfer of assets for less than fair market value has taken place,subjecting the individual to a penalty.state medicaid manual,health care financing administration pub,transmittal,b november.
transmittal included two examples of this rule.if a man with a life expectancy of nearly years purchases a annuity with a term,the transfer of assets is actuarially sound.state medicaid manual,health care financing administration pub,transmittal,b november.however,if an man with life expectancy of nearly seven years purchases the same annuity,a payout of the annuity for approximately years is considered a transfer of assets for less than fair market value and that amount is subject to a penalty.state medicaid manual,health care financing administration pub,transmittal,b november.transmittal dictated that states can not apply periods of ineligibility due to a transfer of resources for less than fair market value except in accordance with these instructions.state medicaid manual,health care financing administration pub,transmittal,b november.
in illinois,mang recipients must not transfer assets for less than fair market value.see ilcs a west.the legislature provided that the dpa shall by rule establish the amounts of assets to be disregarded in determining eligibility for medical assistance,which shall at a minimum equal the amounts to be disregarded under federal law.see ilcs west.in a notice of adopted amendments,the dpa stated 
the dpa has become aware that the marketing of medicaid planning devices sometimes includes plans offering loaded annuities that pay only very small monthly amounts until the final month of life expectancy when a balloon payment reflecting the payout balance is made.such annuity plans are intended to primarily benefit the person heirs.while these annuities are literally consistent with current policy,they are in conflict with the intent of asset consideration for the purpose of equitable assistance eligibility determination.reg.eff.august.
thus,the dpa promulgated a regulation regarding annuity payments 
e a transfer is allowable if 
the transfer was to an annuity,the expected return on the annuity is commensurate with the estimated life expectancy of the person,and the annuity pays benefits in approximately equal periodic payments.e conway greene march.
on january,mary fillbright,a resident in a care facility,applied for medical assistance as a mang recipient.that day,she also bought a balloon annuity for.the annuity would stretch payments over her life expectancy of months it would pay her per month per month principal,plus months and in its final month.the final or balloon payment represented nearly of the purchase price.the annuity also provided 
on any anniversary prior to attaining age,you may request a determination of your then life expectancy.if the period thus determined is greater than the balance remaining for the current period,you may request an amendment to the new period.such amendment will require a change in the monthly payment amount to that for the new period.
on march,caseworkers at the county dhs office found fillbright eligible for medical assistance,but determined that her purchase of the balloon annuity constituted an improper transfer of assets because it violated the equal periodic payment regulation.her benefits,which had been approved effective january,were subject to a penalty from april to january.
fillbright appealed this decision,arguing that the equal periodic payment regulation violated federal law,as enunciated in transmittal.on june,the dhs conducted an administrative hearing,and on july,it considered and adopted the hearing officer findings of fact and affirmed his decision.the dhs determined that,because fillbright would not receive equal periodic payments from the annuity,she did not receive fair market value for it.the dhs rejected fillbright argument that the regulation violated federal law,stating it is bound by its policy and regulations,and those arguments can not be considered in this forum.the order was signed by dhs secretary linda baker and dpa director jackie garner.a cover letter noted that the order was the dhs final administrative decision,as well as the dpa final decision as to medicaid issues.
on august,fillbright filed a complaint for administrative review by the trial court,naming as defendants the dhs,the dhs secretary,and the dpa director.fillbright served summons on the dhs secretary,but not on the dpa or its director.in her complaint,fillbright claimed that the dhs decision was incorrect because the purchase of the annuity was an actuarially sound transfer for fair market value.fillbright again argued that the equal periodic payment regulation violated federal law.
the dhs filed a motion to dismiss the complaint because fillbright failed to serve the dpa,a necessary party,and thus failed to comply with the administrative review law.the dhs argued that the final administrative decision was a decision by both the dhs and the dpa,and that the administrative review law required fillbright to serve both agencies.fillbright responded that the dhs determines issues of medicaid eligibility.the trial court denied this motion,reasoning that the dpa is a part of the dhs,and the dhs was served.the court stated,public aid can clearly come in and defend.they not prejudiced in any way because the dhs had proper notice in a timely fashion.
on september,the trial court confirmed the dhs decision to impose the penalty period.the trial court stated that the question in this case is simple does a medicaid recipient who purchases a annuity payable in full over the of the annuitant within the look back period,engage in a transfer of assets such that payment of benefits is deferred for a penalty period the answer,observed the court,is not so simple.the trial court further noted that,unfortunately,the dhs did not address this question,depriving the court of an agency reading of the equal payment regulation.
the trial court acknowledged a tension between the need to preserve scarce public medical resources for the truly needy and the desire of families to preserve their assets while qualifying for medical assistance through a perceived legitimate loophole.according to the trial court,actuarial soundness and fair market value are distinct requirements an annuity,in order to be considered a proper transfer of assets,must meet both.the court stated 
once the department determined the annuity in this case was not purchased for fair market value,it was incumbent upon fillbright to show that in fact it was a fair market value transfer.plaintiff relied solely on a legal argument for her position and presented no testimony to the hearing officer concerning the fair market value of the transfer.under these circumstances,this court is unable to find that the department erred.
fillbright then appealed again,but died while her case was pending.gillmore was appointed executrix of her estate and proceeded with the appeal.the appellate court affirmed.d.the court initially reviewed transmittal and the equal periodic payment regulation.d at.according to the appellate court,the purpose for the fair market value requirement in transmittal is to provide a reliable indicator for medicaid caseworkers trying to discern whether the annuity was intended for retirement planning or for sheltering assets.d at.like the trial court,the appellate court determined that fair market value and actuarial soundness are distinct concepts.d at.the appellate court concluded that fillbright annuity was actuarially sound,but not purchased for fair market value.d at.it was actuarially sound because the payment term coincided with her life expectancy.d at.it was not purchased for fair market value because,in effect,the balloon payment would extend the term beyond her life expectancy.d at.in theory,fillbright would receive the final payment on the day before her death,and accordingly,t he final payment on her annuity would not be used as her retirement income but as a payment to the designated beneficiary.d at.the court continued 
the purchase of the annuity with a benefit term equivalent to plaintiff life expectancy can not be deemed to be a valid retirement tool when the overwhelmingly substantial portion of the benefit would be paid the day before plaintiff expected death.based upon its terms,this type of plan is more likely viewed as a way to shelter assets for the purpose of medicaid eligibility than as a valid retirement tool.d at.
according to the appellate court,the state regulation did not conflict with federal regulations,but rather provided further guidance on them.d at.the court held that the dhs correctly imposed a penalty period based on fillbright transfer of assets into the annuity.d at.
we allowed gillmore petition for leave to appeal.see a.we allowed the american public human services association to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the dhs.see.on the legal issues in this case,our standard of review is de novo.see carpetland,department of employment security.
in this appeal,gillmore essentially raises a single issue whether the dhs eligibility decision was correct.before we reach that issue,however,we must dispose of an argument made by the dhs.the dhs insists that gillmore appeal must be dismissed because fillbright failed to serve her complaint on the dpa.the trial court found that the dpa was part of the dhs for the purposes of fillbright case and denied the dhs motion to dismiss.the appellate court declined to reach this argument because the dhs never.
initially,we disagree with the appellate court.the dhs could not have the trial court decision on its motion to dismiss because the trial court final judgment on the merits of fillbright administrative review complaint was not adverse to the department.see material service department of revenue.
the illinois public aid code provides that it shall be administered by the department of human services and the illinois department of public aid as provided in the department of human services act.ilcs a west.in,section d of the department of human services act declared that the department of human services is the successor agency to the department of public aid with respect to certain functions.see ilcs d west.the act did not shift responsibility over medical assistance or medicaid to the dhs see ilcs west,but eligibility decisions rest with the dhs.section of the public aid code provides,the amount and nature of medical assistance shall be determined by the county departments in accordance with the standards,rules,and regulations of the illinois department of public aid.ilcs west.until,county department was defined as the county department of public aid thereafter,and in this case,it was the county department of human services.compare ilcs west with ilcs west.
the administrative review law applies to all proceedings in which a party seeks judicial review of an agency decision under article see ilcs west.section a of the administrative review law requires that in any action to review any final decision of an administrative agency,the administrative agency shall be made a defendant.ilcs a west.administrative agency means the department having the power to make administrative decisions.ilcs west.administrative decision means a determination by an agency which affects the rights and duties of the parties and terminates the proceedings.ilcs west.
certainly,where two agencies share the power to make the administrative decision at issue,both must be made defendants and served.see esg watts,pollution control board.but here only one agency,the dhs,had the power to decide fillbright medicaid eligibility.the review of the county dhs office finding that fillbright was eligible for assistance,subject to a penalty,was signed by the dhs secretary and,consistent with federal regulations,the dpa director.see the state medicaid agency must participate in the hearing of an administrative appeal from an adverse eligibility decision,if it did not decide eligibility.we agree with gillmore that the dpa simply endorsed the dhs eligibility decision,and fillbright properly served the dhs.we turn to the merits of gillmore appeal.
gillmore contends that the dhs eligibility decision was incorrect because fillbright annuity satisfied the requirements of transmittal.according to gillmore,the equal periodic payment regulation imposes a requirement which does not exist in federal law,and thus violates federal law.according to gillmore,federal law addresses financial eligibility requirements,and the state can not be more restrictive.gillmore acknowledges that actuarial soundness and fair market value are distinct concepts,but insists that for medicaid eligibility purposes,the sole federal test of whether a transfer of assets into a commercial annuity is permissible is simply actuarial soundness.if the term of the annuity was commensurate with fillbright life expectancy,then it was a transfer for fair market value,and therefore permissible.
gillmore distinguishes between commercial annuities like the one purchased by fillbright from private annuities,which are generally agreements between parents and children where the parents transfer money,often in trust,to the children with an understanding that the children will pay the money back to the parents over their life expectancy.private annuities are like gifts and need not return fair market value.commercial annuities,on the other hand,are purchased on the open market and do return fair market value.gillmore discusses the examples in transmittal and concludes that the only commercial annuity which can be characterized as a transfer for less than fair market value is an annuity whose term extends beyond the purchaser life expectancy.
in response,the dhs agrees that state medicaid plans must comply with the federal statutory and regulatory requirements,but asserts that the medicaid scheme gives the states latitude for implementation.the dhs suggests that the federal definition of fair market value is so broad as to allow the state to create and impose more specific rules.the medicaid act does not define fair market value,but the state medicaid manual defines it as the estimate of the value of an asset,if sold at the prevailing price at the time it was actually transferred.value is based on criteria you use in appraising the value of assets for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility.state medicaid manual,health care financing administration pub,transmittal,a november.according to the dhs,this reference to other criteria leaves room for the equal periodic payment regulation.
the parties have neither cited nor discussed any cases regarding the propriety of balloon annuities under the medicaid act and its regulations.instead,they rely on cases from other jurisdictions that address transmittal in the context of nonballoon annuities.these cases,of course,do not bind this court,but they warrant some discussion.
gillmore principally relies upon mertz houstoun,d,a federal district court case from pennsylvania.in mertz,a husband purchased two actuarially sound,nonballoon commercial annuities for immediately before his wife entered a nursing home that participates in the medicaid program.shortly thereafter,the wife applied for medicaid.the state welfare department determined that she was eligible for medical assistance,subject to a penalty,because the purchase of the annuities violated a state welfare regulation creating a presumption that assets transferred during the period were transferred in order to qualify for medicaid.the wife then filed an administrative appeal of the state welfare department decision,and the department denied her appeal.rather than seeking judicial review in state court,the wife filed a civil rights action in federal court.the wife asked for declaratory and injunctive relief,arguing that the annuities were actuarially sound and purchased for fair market value and,thus,the state welfare department violated federal law when it imposed a penalty period based on the regulatory presumption.
the federal district court reviewed the medicaid act and transmittal,as well as the state medicaid plan.mertz,d at.the court noted that the state welfare department found that the annuities were purchased for fair market value,but still penalized the transfers because the wife had not rebutted the regulatory presumption.mertz,d at.federal law,however,penalizes only transfers made for less than fair market value.mertz,d at.in a footnote,the court explained 
the state welfare department seizes upon the portion of the sentence in transmittal which reads a determination must be made with regard to the ultimate purpose of the annuity but omits the language immediately following which reads,whether the purchase of the annuity constitutes a transfer of assets for less than fair market value.citation.t he critical factor in determining whether the purchase of an annuity may be penalized is whether it was a purchase for fair market value,which is then essentially equated with actuarial soundness.insofar as the state welfare department relies on the statutory presumption to penalize transfers made for fair market value upon a finding they were also made to qualify for benefits,the agency is engaging in a practice inconsistent with federal law.insofar as that regulation is intended not merely to create a rebuttable presumption of an intent to qualify upon a finding of a transaction for less than fair market value but rather to penalize transfers made for fair market value upon a presumption or finding of such intent,the regulation is inconsistent with federal law.mertz,d at.
in closing,the court discussed the loophole in the medicaid scheme which allows a couple to convert countable resources into noncountable income for the noninstitutionalized spouse by purchasing a commercial annuity for the sole benefit of the noninstitutionalized spouse.mertz,d at.this loophole,apparently discerned by lawyers and exploited by issuers who advertise such annuities as a means to qualify for medicaid benefits,is inconsistent with the purpose of the medicaid program to provide assistance to needy persons.mertz,d at.the court acknowledged that this loophole has proven frustrating to state medicaid administrators across the country,but stated it was powerless to help it is not the role of the court to compensate for an apparent legislative oversight by effectively rewriting a law to comport with one of the perceived or presumed purposes motivating its enactment.it is for the congress to determine if and how this loophole should be closed.mertz,d at.
