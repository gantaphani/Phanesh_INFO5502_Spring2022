adult disabled child 
this case involves the interplay of the federal and state statutory provisions relating to special needs trusts and those relating to reimbursement.arnold contends that after hatcher death,the remaining assets of the special needs trust were treated as part of hatcher estate,and the property of an estate that is distributed to a decedent adult disabled child is exempt from reimbursement claims.the department responds that is required to comply with the federal medicaid provisions that require a state to be reimbursed from the remaining assets of a decedent special needs trust.the department argues that the assets of a special needs trust may be disregarded for purposes of eligibility only if the state is assured of reimbursement from any remaining assets.
the federal medicaid provisions require qualifying state plans for medical assistance to comply with federal statutes relating to eligibility and reimbursement.those federal medicaid provisions provide that the assets of special needs trusts are to be disregarded in determining an individual eligibility for medicaid benefits.however,such assets may be disregarded only if the state is entitled to be reimbursed for benefits paid,from any assets remaining in the special needs trust upon the death of the beneficiary.these trust provisions are found in subdivision d of title of the united states code section.
subdivision b of title of the united states code section provides in general for reimbursement to a state of medical assistance paid on behalf of an individual.reimbursement from the estate of a deceased individual for such medical assistance payments may not be obtained from an adult disabled child of the decedent.
the department argues that subdivision d of title united states code section governs reimbursement from special needs trust assets.the department argues further that subdivision d includes no express provisions exempting from reimbursement distributions to adult disabled children of a beneficiary.accordingly,the department asserts that the exemption for assets distributed to an adult disabled child in subdivision b is not applicable to special needs trust assets.
this argument is not persuasive.the provisions of subdivision d relate to eligibility for medical assistance.in determining an individual eligibility for state medical assistance,the assets of a special needs trust are to be disregarded if the state is entitled to be reimbursed from the trust.the nature of that right to reimbursement is not set forth in subdivision d.reimbursement provisions are found in subdivision b,which expressly excludes assets distributed to an adult disabled child.these reimbursement provisions are generally applicable to all reimbursement for medical assistance payments.the department has put forth no persuasive argument that reimbursement from special needs trusts should be treated differently than other reimbursements.we conclude such trusts should not be treated differently.thus,qualification of a state plan for medical assistance under the federal medicaid provisions does not requ
