we have for review hayes guardianship of thompson,so d dca,in which the third district court of appeal certified conflict with the fourth district court of appeal decision in bachinger florida,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the certified conflict involves the issue of standing to participate in guardianship proceedings.for the reasons that follow,we hold that a person,including an heir of a ward,has standing to participate in a guardianship proceeding if the applicable provisions of either the florida guardianship law or the florida probate rules entitle the person to notice of the proceeding or authorize the person to file an objection in the proceeding.applying this holding to guardianship proceedings concerning attorney fees under section,florida statutes,we conclude that,in addition to the attorney making the fee request,only the guardian,the ward,and those interested persons who have requested notice under florida probate rule have standing to participate in the proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
this case concerns the guardianship of mae thompson,now deceased.thompson lived with her nephew,william hayes,iii,who,along with thompson sister,vivian hayes,and,william hayes,are the petitioners in this case.in february,the department of children and families dcf filed a petition under the adult protective services act,sections,florida statutes,to have thompson,who was then years of age,removed from her nephew home because of poor living conditions.the circuit court granted the petition and ordered that thompson receive protective services the circuit court also adjudicated thompson incapacitated and appointed a guardian and court monitor 
in a subsequent comprehensive order,the circuit court agreed with dcf initial assessment finding that thompson was a victim of multiple abuses at the hands of her nephew and sister,who had been responsible for assisting thompson with her medical and financial needs.the circuit court also specifically found that the living conditions at the nephew home were deplorable and that thompson was placed at risk of harm and danger by living there.the circuit court determined that thompson had been exploited by her sister,vivian,and nephew billy,that she could be easily influenced,and that she had poor insight and judgment regarding her finances.the court also concluded that vivian was responsible for gross misappropriations from thompson financial account.
the guardianship proceedings involved significant financial issues,including the extent of the petitioners mismanagement of thompson money and whether some of the funds frozen by the circuit court belonged to any of the petitioners individually.there were also several hearings involving the petitioners violation of court orders.
during the guardianship,thompson counsel filed several petitions for attorney fees pursuant to section.the petition for attorney fees at issue in this case was sent to thompson guardian and the monitor.neither the guardian nor the monitor objected to the fee request.however,at the hearing on the petition,counsel for the petitioners objected to the petition for several reasons that an accounting needed to be conducted before further fees could be disbursed that expert testimony on the amount of fees was required and that a portion of the fees claimed was for work for which counsel had already received compensation.in response,thompson attorney asserted that the petitioners lacked standing to challenge the petition.the trial court agreed,but allowed the petitioners to explain their objections as a friend of the court.
after hearing the petitioners objections and finding that thompson was solvent,the circuit court determined that this case involved exceptional circumstances and awarded attorney fees in the amount of for legal services rendered from january,through march.the circuit court determined that the attorney fees were both reasonable and necessary 
the petitioners appealed the circuit court order awarding thompson counsel in attorney fees.the third district affirmed,concluding that petitioners lacked standing to challenge the award.the third district cited its decision in mcginnis kanevsky,so d dca,and certified conflict with the fourth district decision in bachinger.the third district did not decide whether the fee award was proper.
chapter,florida statutes,the florida guardianship law,governs guardianship proceedings in this state.section,which concerns guardian and attorney fees and expenses,states that a guardian,or an attorney who has rendered services to the ward or to the guardian on the ward behalf,is entitled to a reasonable fee for services rendered and reimbursement for costs incurred on behalf of the ward.stat.the statute further provides that a petition for fees or expenses may not be approved without prior notice to the guardian and to the ward,unless the ward is a minor or is totally incapacitated.stat.
the issue in this case requires us to determine whether standing to participate in guardianship proceedings under this statute is limited to the guardian and the their counsel in attorney fees whether it also extends to other parties.we first review case law addressing standing in the context of different types of guardianship proceedings.we then set out the analysis that courts should undertake in making a determination on standing and explain why the summary approach adopted by the third district in mcginnis is incomplete.
case law addressing standing in guardianship proceedings 
in mcginnis,the issue was whether relatives of a deceased ward had standing as heirs of the ward estate to challenge awards of guardian fees that had previously been approved by the court under section on the ground that the fees were excessive.see so d at.the third district held that guardianship fees,properly authorized by the probate court,may not be set aside after the ward death merely because his heirs consider that the awards were too high.id.
mcginnis construed a version of section that provided 
a guardian of the person or of the property shall receive a reasonable fee for his services to be fixed by the court after such notice as the court shall require.
id.at quoting.stat.based on this language,the third district explained why the heirs of the ward estate were not entitled to notice 
the lack of any requirement for further notice reflects the idea that,in the case of a guardianship,the ward and his estate are the only interested parties.insofar as these interests may be contrary to those of the guardian seeking fees,they are represented and safeguarded by the probate court itself.
id.the third district noted that even under the new and far broader guardianship law enacted in,heirs of a ward estate are not within the class of persons cognizably interested in the guardianship estate because the statute provides notice to only the ward,guardian,and attorney.id.
the third district also rejected the argument that the heirs were entitled to revisit the issue of guardianship fees under section,florida statutes,which provided for objections to attorney fees and guardianship expenses sought in annual and final returns unless previously allowed.mcginnis,so d at.the court reached the same conclusion about florida rule of probate and guardianship procedure a,id.at,which provided for objections to annual financial returns by a person interested as creditor,or otherwise.id.at quoting rule a because the heirs of the ward estate were not entitled to notice under section and were not authorized to file objections under section or rule a,the third district ruled in mcginnis that the heirs lacked standing to challenge the previously awarded guardian fees.so d at.
finally,the third district observed that in guardianship proceedings,the court is concerned only with the welfare of the ward himself in the administration of what are,after all,only his funds.id.at.heirs of a ward estate are only contingent or potential beneficiaries who can not complain that any expenditures on behalf of the ward have diminished what they may eventually receive and thus are not interested parties in the administration of the guardianship.id.the third district expressed concern that allowing heirs standing to challenge an award of guardian fees was akin to allowing heirs or devisees standing to challenge the supposedly excessive spending habits of a competent person during his lifetime or to seek a pre or determination of the appropriate expenditures of the assets from the guardianship,which is not the law.id.at.
bachinger,the conflict case,also involved whether heirs of a deceased ward had standing to participate in a guardianship proceeding.however,unlike the proceedings in mcginnis and hayes,which involved guardian and attorney fees,respectively,bachinger involved a proceeding on a petition for final discharge.see bachinger,so d at.the third district in hayes did not acknowledge that bachinger involved a different proceeding when it certified conflict,but this distinction is significant.
when a guardian petitions for final discharge,the guardian must file a final report with the court,and the court shall approve the report 
i f no objections are filed and if it appears that the guardian has made full and complete distribution to the person entitled and has otherwise faithfully discharged his or her duties.if objections are filed,the court shall conduct a hearing in the same manner as provided for a hearing on objections to annual guardianship reports.
stat.in determining whether the heirs had standing to object to the petition for final discharge,the fourth district looked to florida probate rule a,which provides that the ward,or any other interested person,may file an objection to any part of a guardianship report within the time provided by law.see bachinger,so d at.
relying on the language of rule a,which allows an interested person to file an objection to any part of a guardianship report,the fourth district determined that the heirs had standing to object to the petition for final discharge because they alleged that,in addition to being heirs,they were relatives and were taking care of the decedent before she was declared incompetent.bachinger,so d at.the fourth district stated that i f they do not have a sufficient interest to question how the ward funds were spent,there is probably no one who does.id.the fourth district considered the concerns expressed by the third district in mcginnis about allowing heirs to object to funds being spent on the ward,but was not persuaded that it follows that they should have no standing.id.at.the fourth district explained that it is not sufficient to rely on the court and the guardian to scrutinize expenditures made on behalf of the ward because,due to the ex parte nature of these types of proceedings,it is highly unrealistic to assume that they would involve any high level of scrutiny.id.quoting judge sharp observation in sun bank trust jones,so d,dca,the fourth district added that c ourts must scrupulously oversee the handling of the affairs of incompetent persons under their jurisdiction and err on the side of rather than indifference.bachinger,so d at.
in jones,on which the fourth district relied,the fifth district also considered both the applicable statutory law and the guardianship rules in deciding whether personal representatives of a deceased ward estate had standing to object to a petition for final discharge and a petition for guardian and attorney fees.in that case,the guardian and the guardian attorney sought fees for services performed on the ward behalf that included substantial sums related to a home plan.jones,so d at.the ward,in her capacity as personal representative of the ward estate,objected to the fees and asserted that they should not be awarded for services rendered in carrying out the home plan because the home plan was neither feasible nor in the best interest of the ward.see id.sun bank,which was the personal representative under a superseding will also objected to the fees and maintained that the home plan was excessive and unauthorized,created a conflict of interest between the guardian and the ward,and was not in the ward best interest.see id.at.the trial court refused to consider the merits of these objections,citing mcginnis as authority.see id.
on appeal,the fifth district reversed and ruled that review of the personal representatives objections to the home plan should not have been foreclosed and that sun bank was a proper party to raise these objections.see id.at.the fifth district observed that notice was not provided to the personal representatives as required by the applicable statute and rule of procedure.see id.specifically,the fifth district cited section,which requires that notice of a petition to perform any act that constitutes a conflict of interest between the guardian and the ward be given to the ward,next of kin,if any,and to those interested persons who have filed requests for notices as provided in the florida probate rules.see jones,so d at.the court also cited florida probate rule b,which requires that notice of a petition to perform an act requiring court approval be provided to the ward,next of kin,and those persons who have filed requests for notices.see jones,so d at 
because these notice requirements had not been followed and because the trial court had conducted most of the proceedings ex parte,the fifth district concluded that a full hearing on the objections should be held.see so d at.the fifth district distinguished mcginnis because the thrust of the objections in jones is not excessiveness of the fees sought but a direct conflict of interest between guardian and ward.id.the court concluded that c learly,only a person other than the guardian can protect the ward interests in such a case.id.
ii.determining standing in guardianship proceedings 
standing is a legal concept that requires a litigant to demonstrate that he or she reasonably expects to be affected by the outcome of the proceedings,either directly or indirectly.see generally brown firestone,so d,t his court has long been committed to the rule that a party does not possess standing to sue unless he or she can demonstrate a direct and articulable stake in the outcome of a controversy.weiss johansen,so d,dca standing depends on whether a party has a sufficient stake in a justiciable controversy,with a legally cognizable interest which would be affected by the outcome of the litigation.thus,standing to bring or participate in a particular legal proceeding often depends on the nature of the interest asserted.
in guardianship proceedings,the overwhelming public policy is the protection of the ward.see.stat.declaring that the purpose of the florida guardianship law is to promote the public welfare by establishing a system that permits incapacitated persons to participate as fully as possible in all decisions affecting them that assists such persons in meeting the essential requirements for their physical health and safety,in protecting their rights,in managing their financial resources,and in developing or regaining their abilities to the maximum extent possible and that accomplishes these objectives through providing,in each case,the form of assistance that least interferes with the legal capacity of a person to act in her or his own behalf.thus,unlike most other types of litigation,guardianship proceedings are not adversarial and are governed by a comprehensive statutory code and set of procedural rules dictating who should receive notice of a particular proceeding.
in deciding who has standing to participate in a guardianship proceeding,the third,fourth,and fifth districts all focused on whether the person asserting standing is entitled to notice of the proceeding or is expressly authorized to file an objection in the proceeding.significantly,each of these courts reviewed both the statutory law and the florida probate rules.these courts also evaluated the nature of the interest of the person asserting standing.
we agree that when deciding whether a person has standing to participate in a specific guardianship proceeding,the court should begin by considering both the provisions of the florida guardianship law and any pertinent florida guardianship rules the guardianship statutes and rules complement one another.the gua
