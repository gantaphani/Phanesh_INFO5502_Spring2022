under california constitution,article xiii b,section,subdivision a,whenever the state mandates a new program or higher level of service upon a local government,the state is required to provide a subvention of funds to reimburse the local government for the costs of the mandated program or increased service.in this case,we are concerned with a mandated program for which the state is several hundred million dollars in arrears in its payments to local governments.in november,the voters approved proposition,which added to section of article xiii b a provision requiring that the state begin reimbursing local governments for the amounts due.cal,art.xiii b,subdivision b.under that provision,in each year,for each unreimbursed mandate,the legislature is required to either appropriate,in the annual budget act,the full amount due that year toward repaying the local governments for the unreimbursed mandate or suspend the operation of the mandate.cal,art.xiii b,subd.b.in the instant case,we are concerned with a mandate for which the legislature appropriated the required amount in the budget bill,and the governor exercised his power of veto to eliminate the appropriation cal,art.iv,subd.e.
in this original proceeding,we are asked to determine if the governor had the power to veto the appropriation of reimbursement funding for the mandate,or if,to the contrary,the discretion to make an appropriation of mandate reimbursement funding is exclusively vested in the legislature.we conclude that the governor was constitutionally permitted to exercise his veto in this manner.we therefore will deny the petition to declare the governor veto void.
factual and procedural background 
the factual background leading to the instant proceeding is undisputed.a brief overview of the law governing mandate reimbursement and the history of the particular mandate at issue will help to place the instant dispute in proper context.
mandate reimbursement 
article xiii a was added to the california constitution by proposition in.it limited state and local governments ability to increase taxes.the following year,the electorate approved proposition,which added to the constitution article xiii b,a complementary limit on the rate of growth of government spending.included among its provisions was section,which provided for reimbursement to local governments for the costs of complying with certain requirements mandated by the state.county of los angeles commission on state mandates th.the purpose of this section is to preclude the state from shifting financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions to local agencies,which are ill equipped to assume increased financial responsibilities because of the taxing and spending limitations that articles xiii a and xiii b impose.citations.citation.county of san diego state of california th.
following the adoption of article xiii b,the legislature enacted a comprehensive statutory and administrative scheme for enforcing it see,et of particular relevance to the instant dispute is government code section,which provides that if the legislature identifies a particular mandate in the budget act as one for which reimbursement is not provided for that fiscal year,the local agencies are not required to comply with the mandate during that year.
for a number of years,the legislature chose not to fund certain mandates,but did not identify the mandates in the budget act as those for which no reimbursement would be provided.instead,the legislature funded the mandates in the token amount of.this had the effect of not automatically suspending the operation of the mandates,but leaving them virtually unfunded local agencies advanced considerable funds complying with drastically underfunded mandates,with the expectation of ultimately obtaining reimbursement from the state.
this state of events led to proposition,which was approved by the voters in november.proposition,which was placed on the ballot by the legislature,with the support of local governments added,among other things,section,subdivision b to article xiii b.that subdivision provides that,for every fiscal year,for a mandate for which the costs of a local government claimant have been determined in a preceding fiscal year to be payable by the state pursuant to law,the legislature shall either appropriate,in the annual budget act,the full payable amount that has not been previously paid,or suspend the operation of the mandate for the fiscal year for which the annual budget act is applicable in a manner prescribed by law.cal,art.xiii b,subd.b.the full arrearage may be paid over a term of years.cal,art.xiii b,subd.b.by statute,that period has been established to be years.thus,with respect to a reimbursable mandate,for each fiscal year,the legislature is required to choose to either fully fund the annual payment toward the arrearage or suspend the operation of the mandate.
special education related services 
we are here concerned with a reimbursable mandate relating to special education.the federal individuals with disabilities education act idea et has the purpose of ensuring that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs d a.related services include social work services,counseling services,rehabilitation counseling,and medical services as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.under the idea,the federal government provides financial to states which submit plans that provide assurances that certain conditions will be met.a.among those conditions are that a free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities.a a.a state educational agency must be responsible for meeting the idea requirements.a a.however,the state may assign responsibility for the provision of related services to other agencies.a.
in california,the state and local education were initially responsible for providing not only special education,but all related services,to students with disabilities this was changed with the enactment of chapter of the government code,entitled interagency responsibilities for providing services to children with disabilities,et under this statute,local education agencies remained responsible only for education services.related mental health services were to be provided by the state department of mental health or community mental health agencies.we refer to these related mental health services as chapter services.
as local mental health agencies had not previously been required to provide chapter services to special education students,local mental health agencies argued that these requirements constituted a reimbursable state mandate.in a series of three successive opinions,the commission on state mandates concluded that these requirements constituted a reimbursable state mandate,and discussed,in detail,exactly which expenses were reimbursable.thus,there is no dispute in this case that the chapter services obligations at issue do,in fact,impose a reimbursable state mandate on local mental health agencies.we refer to this as the chapter mandate.
the state budget act 
in making budget decisions,the state could decide to fully fund its repayment obligation under the chapter mandate,or decide not to do so.the state could also choose a middle course of funding the reimbursement for a limited time while simultaneously enacting legislation conveying responsibility for chapter services back to the local education agencies the decision among these options is a policy decision left to the legislature and governor the wisdom of the course pursued by those branches of government is not a matter for judicial review.we note,however,that as early as the the proposition arrearage payment requirements first went into governor proposed returning responsibility for chapter services back to local education agencies.legis.analyst,to joint legis.budget,the budget perspectives and issues.

aftermath of the governor veto 
local mental health agencies immediately began giving local education agencies notice that they would no longer provide chapter services,although many of them indicated that they would continue to provide the services if the local education agencies paid for them.on october,the director of the special education division of the california department of education informed local educational agencies that they were ultimately responsible to provide chapter services.
two lawsuits followed.on october,a federal class action was brought by students who relied on chapter services,against the governor,the department of education,the department of mental health,and several local education and mental health agencies.schwarzenegger no.the complaint in this action alleged that chapter services were being disrupted,in possible violation of the idea and other federal statutes.on november,numerous counties brought a declaratory relief action in sacramento superior court,seeking an order relieving county mental health agencies from complying with the chapter mandate.county of sacramento state of california super.sacramento county.both of these actions are now pending.
california received million in federal idea funds.on october,the department of education indicated that it would distribute these funds to county mental health agencies in order to pay for continued provision of chapter services.this provided a solution only the funds were expected to be fully expended by,
the instant action 
the instant original proceeding in mandate was brought by california school boards association and its education legal alliance,los angeles unified school district,and manhattan beach unified school district the respondents are the governor,the state of california,the superintendent of public instruction,the secretary of the health and human services agency,the director of the california department of mental health,and the controller the petitioners in this case assert that,if the governor veto of reimbursement funding for the chapter mandate is upheld and the mandate is suspended,the local education agencies will be required to provide chapter services which they are,and lack funding,to provide.the superintendent of public instruction supports petitioners the controller has taken no position.references to respondents refer to the remaining respondents,who oppose the petition.because of the importance and urgency of the issues presented,we have exercised our original jurisdiction and issued an order to show cause 
issues presented 
the issue presented in this proceeding is whether the governor possessed the constitutional authority to exercise his veto to delete the mandate reimbursement appropriation for the chapter mandate.petitioners advance three arguments as to why the governor was prohibited from exercising his veto in this manner the governor may only reduce a particular appropriation,not a provision directing how an appropriation is to be spent,and the chapter mandate reimbursement was not an individual appropriation,but simply a directive as to how the controller was to spend the mandate reimbursement appropriation article xiii b,section,subdivision b provides that,for each mandate,the legislature shall either appropriate the amount payable or suspend the mandate once the legislature has made the appropriation decision,it can not be vetoed by the governor by exercise of the veto and the decision to eliminate the amount of an appropriation can not be separated from the decision to suspend the operation of the mandate,and the latter is a matter of substantive policy left solely to the legislature.
as we now explain,we reject each argument and conclude that the governor veto was properly exercised,and had the legal effect of suspending operation of the mandate.
discussion 
the governor general power to veto appropriations 
when the governor exercises the power of veto,he is acting in a legislative capacity.harbor deukmejian cal d.as such,he may only act as permitted by the constitution.ibid.this legislative act,however,is a necessary part of our system of separation of powers.l egislative power is circumscribed by the requirement that legislative acts be bicamerally enacted and presented to the head of the executive branch for approval or veto.carmel valley fire protection dist.state of california cal th.
california constitution,article iv,section,subdivision b provides that the legislature may make no law except by statute and may enact no statute except by bill.article iv,section,subdivision a provides,each bill passed by the legislature shall be presented to the governor.it becomes a statute if it is signed by the governor.the governor may veto it by returning it with any objections to the house of origin,which shall enter the objections in the journal and proceed to reconsider it.if each house then passes the bill by rollcall vote entered in the journal,two thirds of the membership concurring,it becomes a statute.subdivision e of that section provides,the governor may reduce or eliminate one or more items of appropriation while approving other portions of a bill.the governor shall append to the bill a statement of the items reduced or eliminated with the reasons for the action.the governor shall transmit to the house originating the bill a copy of the statement and reasons.items reduced or eliminated shall be separately reconsidered and may be passed over the governor veto in the same manner as bills.thus,it can not be disputed that the governor possesses the constitutional authority to reduce or eliminate an item of appropriation in the budget bill passed by the legislature.
the chapter appropriation was an appropriation against which the veto could be exercised 
if a general appropriation specifically includes smaller appropriations,the governor may veto one or more of the smaller appropriations.reardon riley cal d.in such a situation,the governor may,but is not required to,reduce the larger appropriation in an equivalent amount.id.at pomeroy riley cal d.
the rule is different when there is a appropriation which is intended for multiple purposes,but does not specifically allocate amounts to each of those purposes.in that situation,the governor may reduce the appropriation.harbor deukmejian,supra,cal d at.however,the governor may not attribute the amount of the reduction to a specific purpose,and thereby transform his reduction of the into a veto of the use of the remaining appropriation for the disfavored purpose.see ibid.reduction of appropriation permitted veto of portion of subsequent substantive bill containing subject of appropriation prohibited.reduction of appropriation permitted attempt to eliminate one specific subject of appropriation via veto message prohibited.
in this case,petitioners argue that the budget bill passed by the legislature did not include a specific appropriation which would be subject to a veto for the reimbursement payments due with respect to the chapter mandate.instead,the budget bill included only a general appropriation of for reimbursement payments for different mandates,of which the chapter mandate was one thus,they argue that while the governor may have possessed authority to reduce or eliminate the appropriation,he did not have the authority to strike one specific purpose the chapter mandate reimbursement from the list of general purposes for which the total amount was appropriated.in this regard,they note that the budget act provided,whenever herein an appropriation is made in accordance with a schedule set forth after the appropriation,the expenditures from that item for each category,program,or project included in the schedule shall be limited to the amount specified for that category,program,or project,except as otherwise provided in this act.each schedule is a restriction or limitation upon the expenditure of the respective appropriation made by this act,does not itself appropriate any moneys,and is not itself an item of appropriation.stats,ch,emphasis added.
we reject the argument.california constitution,article xiii b,section,subdivision b provides that for a mandate the legislature shall either appropriate,in the annual budget act,the full payable amount that has not been previously paid,or suspend the operation of the mandate.emphasis added.in other words,in order to perform its constitutional duty with respect to the chapter mandate and each other mandate,the legislature was required to make an appropriation of the full required amount or suspend the operation of the mandate.it is clear that the legislature intended to follow the former course.it is also undisputed that is the full amount which had to be appropriated with respect to this mandate,and is the amount which the legislature intended to be allocated to it.that the legislature did not use the language of a specific appropriation of with respect to this mandate does not render the legislature act any less of an appropriation.indeed,if it did not constitute an appropriation,the legislature would have failed in its duty under article xiii b,section,subdivision b.
in arguing that the governor right to veto an appropriation is limited in this context by article xiii b,section,subdivision b,petitioners raise a parade of horribles,suggesting that if the governor can reduce the appropriation,the governor has a power which the legislature is,to choose an option other than fully funding the payment due on the mandate or suspending its operation.even worse,they suggest that,since the law forbids the governor from assigning a specific purpose to part of a appropriation and vetoing that purpose,if the governor was permitted to reduce the overall mandate reimbursement appropriation,the result would simply be that all of the mandates to which it applied would be,in contrast to the specific command of article xiii b,section,subdivision b.
far from proving petitioners point,however,these arguments instead demonstrate why,despite the language used by the legislature in the budget bill,it made a appropriation for reimbursement payments with respect to the chapter mandate.the legislature could not simply make a appropriation of or any other amount for mandate reimbursement and leave it to the controller to determine which mandates were to be reimbursed,and in what amounts.the legislature was constitutionally required to make a choice,with respect to each mandate,between an appropriation of the full reimbursement payment due or nothing at all.it did so,choosing to make the appropriation.the legislature can not shield an appropriation from the governor veto simply by not using the language of an appropriation in the budget bill.john well child family center schwarzenegger,supra,cal th at.this is particularly true when,as here,the constitution requires that the legislature choose between a full appropriation of a specific amount,or nothing at all.as the legislature chose to fully appropriate the specific amount of reimbursement for the chapter mandate,an appropriation was made.the appropriation was therefore subject to the governor veto unless the governor was otherwise prohibited from exercising his veto in this context.we now turn to that issue.
article xiii b,section,does not give the legislature exclusive jurisdiction over the decision to appropriate reimbursement funds for a mandate 
petitioners main argument against the governor exercise of the veto power is that article xiii b,section,subdivision b,as added by proposition,vests sole discretion in determining whether to fund a mandate reimbursement in the legislature.the key language is as follows for a mandate for which the costs of a local government claimant have been determined in a preceding fiscal year to be payable by the state pursuant to law,the legislature shall either appropriate,in the annual budget act,the full payable amount that has not been previously paid,or suspend the operation of the mandate for the fiscal year for which the annual budget act is applicable in a manner prescribed by law.cal,art.xiii b,subd.b,emphasis added.petitioners argue that the plain language of the provision means that the legislature alone has discretion to either make the necessary appropriation or suspend the mandate.had the voters sought to permit the governor to exercise his veto,they argue,the language would have instead read,the state shall either appropriate emphasis added.
we are,therefore,called upon to determine whether the use of the words the legislature in proposition was intended to mean the legislature acting alone,or whether it was intended to refer to the legislature enacting statutes subject to the governor veto,as generally provided in the constitution.whenever construing a constitutional provision enacted by initiative,the intent of the voters is the paramount consideration.citation.to determine that intent,we look first to the provision language,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.if the language is clear and its meaning in relation to the problem at hand is manifest,ordinarily there is no need to search further for the provision proper interpretation.citation.davis city of berkeley cal d.if the language is ambiguous,however,we turn to extrinsic evidence,such as ballot arguments.california school boards association state of california th.
here,the language is reasonably susceptible of both meanings.while the use of the term the legislature could mean the legislature acting exclusively,it could also mean the legislature acting as otherwise permitted by the constitution.indeed,petitioners interpretation of article xiii b,section,subdivision b would put it in direct conflict with the governor veto power of article iv,section,subdivision e.the law shuns repeal by implication thus,we are bound to harmonize constitutional provisions that are claimed to stand in conflict.kennedy wholesale,state board of equalization cal d.as such,the interpretation of the legislature which encompasses,rather than forbids,the governor veto power is necessarily a reasonable one,and the use of the legislature in article xiii b,section,subdivision b is therefore ambiguous thus,we turn to extrinsic evidence.
we have taken judicial notice of both the ballot pamphlet regarding proposition,and excerpts from the legislative history of the bill which placed it on the ballot.neither one,at any point,suggests that,under the proposed constitutional amendment,the legislature decision to appropriate reimbursement funding for a mandate would be exempt from the governor power of vet
