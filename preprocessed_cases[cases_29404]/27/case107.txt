facts and procedure 
the fenimores filed their complaint in november.after the hospital filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint,the fenimores filed a first amended complaint fac in lieu of opposition.
facts alleged in the fac 
because this appeal arises from an order sustaining a demurrer,we summarize and accept as true the factual allegations of the fac.mack soung th.the fenimores fac alleged as follows with respect to elder abuse.george was over the age of at all relevant times.welf,elder means any person residing in this state,years of age or older.around march,george suffered an onset of dementia and alzheimer disease.he began wondering away from home,was confused,and experienced an increased number of falls.his family admitted him to a local hospital on a hold and then transferred him to the defendant hospital to protect him from falls and wandering 
the hospital admitted him on march.it was advised that george suffered from dementia,alzheimer disease,coronary artery disease,congestive heart failure,hypertension,hyperlipidemia,diabetes,gout,a history of pancreatitis,a history of a cholecystectomy,and a history of wandering that led to numerous falls.the hospital knew he had just been transferred from another facility on a hold and was an extreme fall risk.it further knew george required special care and assistance,including hour supervision,assistance with ambulation and transferring,the provision of safety devices to prevent accidents,interventions to prevent further falls,and assistance with other activities of daily living.
just minutes after entering the hospital,george was left unattended and fell.in an attempt to conceal his fall,the hospital did not immediately inform george family,his legal representative,or his primary care physician of the fall.hospital staff also failed to adequately assess george after the fall and noted only that he had superficial abrasions.
george family arrived at the hospital later the same day.the hospital told them of the fall then but provided conflicting accounts of how it occurred.a nurse and occupational therapist told the family that george fell while trying to follow the nurse into the hall,landed on his knee,and was sore but okay.four hours after the fall,doctors at the hospital recorded that george suffered a mechanical fall just after reaching the unit,while nursing staff was changing his adult diaper.the hospital engaged in this fraudulent cover up of his fall because the federal government has determined a fall is a type of adverse event or never event that does not occur except in the absence of proper care by a hospital medicare does not pay for hospital stays in which adverse events occur.
for the next four days after his fall,george received no medical attention or further assessment.the day after the fall,one nurse noted in his record that he denied any pain however,the same day,another nursing note indicated that he received acetaminophen for leg pain.three days after the fall,an occupational therapist noted george was guarding his leg and wincing when bending forward and lifting the knee.she recommended imaging of his hip.he was not walking at that time.the hospital did not inform his family,primary care physician,or personal representative of this change in his condition or his need for evaluation.on april,four days after the fall,the hospital transferred him out for totally unrelated reasons acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.on april,results revealed that george had a left hip fracture.he had hip surgery that day and transferred to rehabilitation afterward.unfortunately,he never recovered from this surgery and passed away from his injuries on july.
the hospital failed to assess george fall risk and implement an adequate plan of care for him,complete with interventions or other measures to prevent him from falling.interventions it could have implemented included lap buddies a device to prevent one from falling out of a wheelchair or hip guards.
the hospital also violated several sections of the california code of regulations applicable to acute psychiatric hospitals.by way of example,these regulations required it to properly train its staff,have a written patient care plan,and have a sufficient number of staff on hand for the safety of patients these regulatory violations caused injury to george.the hospital acted with reckless disregard for the health and safety of george and other residents.
the hospital had a pattern and practice of understaffing and undertraining its staff to cut costs,which foreseeably resulted in the abuse and neglect of its residents,including george.it consciously chose not to increase staff numbers or increase training.the hospital knew that insufficient staff in number and competency would lead to it not meeting patients needs,and injuries to patients would be not only likely but inevitable.had there been sufficient staff at the hospital,george would have received proper supervision and assistance and would not have suffered his injuries.
the fac sought general and special damages,and as to the elder abuse cause of action specifically,punitive damages and attorney fees and costs.
trial court ruling sustaining demurrer in part 
the hospital filed a demurrer to the first cause of action for elder abuse,third cause of action for negligent hiring and supervision,and fourth cause of action for wrongful death.it also filed a motion to strike portions of the fac.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling the day before the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike.the tentative sustained the demurrer in part.specifically,it sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to elder abuse and negligent hiring and supervision.the tentative overruled the demurrer as to the wrongful death cause of action.regarding elder abuse,the tentative held t he allegations do not qualify as the reckless withholding or denial of care necessary for decedent basic needs,citing worsham hospital th,worsham.
the tentative granted the motion to strike,at least in part.it said nothing about the portions of the elder abuse cause of action the hospital sought to strike,likely because the court viewed the issues as moot,having sustained the demurrer to the entire cause of action.the tentative stated the motion to strike is granted.the references to neglect in the wrongful death claim are improper and irrelevant.general damages are not recoverable.punitive damages are not recoverable from a public entity.see government code section.
on the day of the hearing,the fenimores counsel filed a declaration regarding a proposed second amended complaint sac and also lodged the proposed sac.counsel declaration stated that,after receiving the tentative,he drafted an sac designed to address the shortcomings the court had identified in its tentative.the sac alleged a list of fall prevention interventions that the hospital wrongfully withheld from george.for instance,the sac alleged the hospital could have kept fluids within his reach,implemented a toileting program,or used bed and chair alarms to alert staff of his attempts to stand.the sac also added allegations that george had suffered a preventable and severe unstageable sacral pressure ulcer as a result of the hospital wrongfully withholding care to prevent the formation and worsening of pressure sores or ulcers.it further alleged the hospital concealed the pressure ulcer from george family and physician.
the court entered a final ruling identical in substance to its tentative order,except that it noted it was not considering the sac.the fenimores voluntarily dismissed their remaining causes of action for negligence and wrongful death.the court entered judgment in favor of the hospital,and the fenimores filed a timely notice of appeal.

discussion 
under the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act the elder abuse act or the act et,abuse of an elder or dependent adult may take several forms,including neglect and t he deprivation by a care custodian of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering,subd.a.as pertinent here,neglect means t he negligent failure of any person having the care or custody of an elder or a dependent adult to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a like position would exercise,subd.a.neglect includes,but is not limited to,the f ailure to provide medical care for physical and mental health needs and the f ailure to protect from health and safety hazards,subd.b,see,subds.a,e.
the elder abuse act provides for heightened remedies to afford extra protection to the vulnerable population of infirm elders and dependent adults.conservatorship of kayle th.specifically,when the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice in the commission of neglect,the plaintiff may recover attorney fees and costs.welf,subd.a delaney baker cal th,delaney.additionally,on the same proof,plaintiffs bringing a survival action may recover damages for the decedent predeath pain and suffering,although such damages may not exceed.welf,subd.b code civ,subd.b.the legislature intended these heightened remedies to enable interested persons to engage attorneys to take up the cause of abused elderly persons and dependent adults.welf,subd.j.

here,the fac alleged the hospital committed neglect by allowing george to fall minutes after entering the facility,failing to treat george fractured hip for four days,and violating certain state regulations for acute psychiatric hospitals.
if the fenimores alleged only these first two things,we might agree that the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer.according to the fac,george fell within minutes of entering the hospital,either because he was trying to follow a nurse into the hall,or when staff was changing his adult diaper.alone,the fact that staff allowed him to fall suggests perhaps incompetence or unskillfulness.recklessness,by contrast,lies in a conscious choice of a course of action.delaney,supra,cal th at.the same can be said for the allegations relating to the treatment of his hip.it is not as though the hospital did nothing at all,even according to the fac.the nurses inquired about his pain,they gave him acetaminophen for it,and the occupational therapist noted his need for an.the did not take place for several days.but there are no factual allegations showing this delay in diagnosis and proper treatment was more than mere incompetence or unskillfulness,negligence.
the allegations that the hospital regulatory violations constituted elder abuse add more to the story,however.among other regulations,the fac alleged the hospital violated california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision c,requiring a sufficient number of appropriate personnel to be provided for the safety of the patients in an acute psychiatric hospital.the fenimores opening brief also points to another staffing regulation,section,subdivision c,which mandates s ufficient registered nursing personnel to provide direct nursing care based on patient need.
the regulations applicable to acute psychiatric hospitals define those facilities duties of care owed to their residents and therefore define duties of care applicable to elder abuse of those residents.norman life care centers of america,th,norman.thus,proof that a facility violated a regulation may constitute t he negligent failure of any person having the care or custody of an elder to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a like position would exercise.id.at,quoting,subd.a see norman,supra,at.in norman and conservatorship of gregory th gregory,regulations applicable to skilled nursing facilities provided the duty of care by which the jury could judge neglect.norman,supra,at a violation by lifecare of those regulations in caring for an elder constitutes elder abuse neglect under the act gregory,supra,at.in gregory in particular,the court rejected the defendants challenge to a jury instruction based on staffing and other regulations,which the defendants alleged were too vague to provide meaningful guidance to the jury.the court held the jury could ascertain the regulations meaning because the jury heard testimony describing how nursing homes construed and applied the standards regarding sufficient staff.gregory,at.like in norman and gregory,a violation of staffing regulations here may provide a basis for finding neglect.such a violation might constitute a negligent failure to exercise the care that a similarly situated reasonable person would exercise,or it might constitute a failure to protect from health and safety hazards george known fall risk.the former is the definition of neglect under the act,and the latter is just one nonexclusive example of neglect under the act,subds.a,b.
of course,the fenimores still had to allege facts showing the hospital acted recklessly,oppressively,fraudulently,or maliciously in the commission of neglect.the fac supplied allegations that may show recklessness.it alleged the hospital had a pattern and knowing practice of improperly understaffing to cut costs,and had the hospital been staffed sufficiently,george would have been properly supervised and would not have suffered injury.on a demurrer,we must accept the allegations as true and express no opinion on whether the fenimores can ultimately prove these allegations.we must assume the fenimores can prov
