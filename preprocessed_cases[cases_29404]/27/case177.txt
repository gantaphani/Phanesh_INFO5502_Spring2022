the relevant facts are not in dispute.beverly and julius tutinas were married for more than years.they resided together in moline in a home to which they held joint title.the couple also held joint title to an automobile.they had no children.
in,julius declining health required that he be cared for in a nursing home.on july of that year,the department of public aid approved julius for medical assistance pursuant to title xix of the social security act,commonly known as the medicaid act et.
julius began receiving medicaid payments in august of.those payments continued until he died in at the age of.the payments totaled.
no probate estate was created for julius following his death.because julius and his wife,beverly,held the marital home and their automobile in joint title,full ownership of the home and car passed to beverly when julius died.beverly lived on for several more years,eventually passing away in may of.unlike julius,beverly neither applied for nor received medicaid payments.
beverly left a will when she died naming her sisters,shirley nelson and betty hines,as coexecutors.beverly will was admitted to probate by the circuit court of rock island county on may,and letters of office were issued to betty hines as independent executor see ilcs west.

the department petitioned for leave to appeal.that petition was allowed,and the matter is now before us for a decision on the merits.as indicated at the outset of this opinion,the sole question before us is whether the department claim against beverly estate was permissible under the medicaid act and the state statutes and regulations implemented pursuant to that act.this issue presents a question of law,which we review de novo.bowman american river transportation.
in undertaking our review,we begin with a brief discussion of the purposes and operation of the medicaid act.the act,which originated in the,created a cooperative program under which the federal government reimburses state governments for a portion of the costs of providing medical assistance to low income groups.gillmore illinois department of human services.states are not required to participate in the medicaid program.once they elect to do so,however,they must design their own plans and set reasonable standards for eligibility and assistance.see a.such plans and standards must comport with the medicaid act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the united states department of health and human services.see cohen quern,smith miller,cir.
the act provides that participating states must designate an agency to administer their medicaid plans.see a a.the agency designated by illinois to administer its medicaid plan is the department of public aid.see ilcs west american society of consultant pharmacists garner,d.
under the act,two types of low income groups are eligible for medical assistance the categorically needy and the medically needy.categorically needy persons are those who are automatically eligible to receive cash grants under one of the general welfare aid to families with dependent children program afdc et or the supplemental security income for the aged,blind,or disabled program ssi et.see ilcs west et.the medically needy are persons who are ineligible to receive cash grants under afdc or ssi because their resources exceed the eligibility threshold for those programs,but who still lack the ability to pay for medical assistance.see ilcs west et.people who fall into the second category are called mang medical grant recipients.see.a march.gillmore illinois department of human services,at.julius was a mang recipient.
to qualify for medicaid as a mang recipient,a person must have low income and low assets,and the person must spend down any resources over the statutory and regulatory limits.see.d amended at.reg,eff.may.spend down requirements pose an obvious hardship to the spouses of medical assistance recipients,who face the prospect of being left with virtually nothing to live on once the couple income and resources are reduced to the level necessary to qualify for medicaid.to ameliorate that hardship,congress enacted the medicare catastrophic coverage act of mcca,which includes provisions to protect,financially,the spouse who was not receiving medical assistance.these provisions,commonly called the spousal impoverishment provisions,allow the spouse to retain a certain level of resources and income and protect those amounts from use as payment for an institutionalized spouse nursing home care.see cleary waldman,cir.
the medicaid act affords an additional element of financial protection to the families of medicaid recipients by limiting the circumstances in which a state may seek reimbursement for the payments it made on the recipient behalf.the act,as amended by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra,a,expressly provides that n o adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the state plan may be made,except in three specified circumstances.b.only one of those exceptions is relevant here.it is set forth in subsection b of the statute,which provides 
in the case of an individual who was years of age or older when the individual received such medical assistance,the state shall seek adjustment or recovery from the individual estate.b b.
the statute further provides that any adjustment or recovery under the foregoing paragraph may only be made after the death of the medicaid recipient surviving spouse,if h
