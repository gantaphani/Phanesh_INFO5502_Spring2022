congress passed the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,to promote the employment of older persons and prohibit arbitrary discrimination by employers based on age.see b.congress crafted a detailed administrative scheme with complex enforcement mechanisms to accomplish these goals.when a district court dismissed linda ahlmeyer adea claim because it was barred by the eleventh amendment,ahlmeyer moved to amend her complaint so she could vindicate the same alleged discrimination based on her.the district court denied ahlmeyer motion as futile and,pursuant to the parties stipulated dismissal of ahlmeyer remaining claims,entered an order dismissing the claims with prejudice.because we hold the adea is the exclusive enforcement mechanism for claims of age discrimination in employment,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on october,ahlmeyer filed a complaint in district court against the nevada system of higher education nshe and her former supervisor mike reed.the complaint alleged that ahlmeyer,who was over forty years old,was not allowed to take classes during work hours and was denied requests for an assistant,unlike her younger coworker.ahlmeyer also contended she was written up and given substandard evaluations based on actions for which younger employees were not reprimanded.the complaint contained three claims,only one of which is at issue in this appeal the nshe violated the adea.
the nshe and reed moved for partial summary judgment on ahlmeyer adea claim,on the basis that the claim was barred by the eleventh amendment to the federal constitution in response,ahlmeyer moved to amend her complaint and replace the adea claim with a claim against reed personally,based on claimed age discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause.under kimel florida board of regents,d,the district court concluded ahlmeyer adea claim against the nshe was barred by the eleventh amendment.therefore,the district court granted the nshe and reed motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed ahlmeyer adea claim.the district court also denied ahlmeyer motion to amend her complaint,holding the adea creates an exclusive remedy for age discrimination by employers no claim for relief for age discrimination exists under.on march,the parties stipulated to dismissal of the remaining claims,and the district court entered an order dismissing the claims with prejudice.
ahlmeyer appealed the district court denial of her motion to amend.she contends the adea does not preclude her claim against reed individually.
ii.jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,the nshe and reed contend this court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case,because ahlmeyer did not appeal from a final decision of the district court as required by.this claim is without merit.it can not be disputed that the district court march,order dismissing all remaining claims in the action constituted a final decision of the district court.the nshe and reed contend this court lacks jurisdiction,however,because ahlmeyer notice of appeal did not expressly reference the march,order.
a notice of appeal generally must specify the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.nonetheless,this court repeatedly has held a mistake in designating the judgment appealed from should not bar appeal as long as the intent to appeal a specific judgment can be fairly inferred and the appellee is not prejudiced by the mistake.lynn sheet metal workers int l ass n,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in determining whether intent and prejudice are present,we apply a test first,whether the affected party had notice of the issue on appeal and,second,whether the affected party had an opportunity to fully brief the issue.id.
ahlmeyer notice of appeal meets both of these requirements.first,the notice of appeal stated precisely the issue presented to this court whether the district court erred in denying ahlmeyer motion to amend her complaint.second,the nshe and reed had the opportunity fully to brief the issue on appeal and did so.therefore,this court has jurisdiction to hear ahlmeyer claim.
iii.motion to amend 
standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion.johnson buckley,cir.although five factors generally are considered when assessing the propriety of a motion to amend futility of amendment alone can justify the denial of a motion.id.a district court exercise of discretion based on an erroneous interpretation of the law constitutes an abuse of discretion.in re arden,cir.
preclusion standard for claims 
ahlmeyer attempted to assert her age discrimination claim against reed as an action under to vindicate her constitutional right to equal protection.her claim can proceed only if the adea is not the exclusive remedy for claims of age discrimination in employment.
title provides,in relevant part,that e very person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage of any state subjects any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured.section claims are not available,however,where congress has evinced an intent to preclude such claims through other legislation.middlesex county sewerage auth.sea clammers ass sea clammers,d.this congressional intent can be inferred when congress has passed a sufficiently comprehensive legislative scheme to address violations of a given right.id.when the remedial devices provided in a particular act are sufficiently comprehensive,they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under.
every circuit to consider the issue views the adea as the exclusive remedy for claims of age discrimination in employment.
while this court has not ruled whether the adea is the exclusive remedy for age discrimination in employment claims,every other circuit to consider the question has so held.the leading case to hold the adea precludes actions in the area of age discrimination in employment is zombro baltimore city police department,cir.we find the reasoning of zombro particularly persuasive.
in zombro,a police officer asserted a claim contending the baltimore city police department department discriminated against him on the basis of age when the department transferred him to a job of lesser status.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the department.id.
on appeal,the fourth circuit analyzed the adea complex enforcement scheme and observed,if a violation of substantive rights under the adea could be asserted by way of a action,the aggrieved party could avoid the specific provisions of the adea id.at.moreover,the assertion that constitutional rights have somehow been infringed does not ipso facto defeat the coverage,application and exclusivity of a comprehensive statutory scheme enacted by congress to redress the alleged violation of rights.id.at.the fourth circuit found the adea remedies sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude actions in the area of age discrimination in employment.see id.at.finally,the court examined the text and history of the adea and found it implausible that congress would have intended to preserve the private cause of action under for age discrimination when that cause of action would severely undermine,if not debilitate,the enforcement mechanism created by congress under the adea.id.at.the court concluded the adea forecloses claims and affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment.id.at.
the fifth and tenth circuits have reached similar conclusions.see migneault peck,cir,abrogated on other grounds by kimel.bd.of regents,d,reaffirmed by migneault peck,cir lafleur.dep t of health,cir.
no circuit to consider the issue of whether the adea precludes claims has reached the opposite conclusion and allowed a claim based on the same conduct to go forward.see mummelthie city of mason city,iowa,cir per curiam unpublished table decision affirming on other grounds the district court decision,which held inter alia that the adea is not the exclusive remedy for age discriminatio
