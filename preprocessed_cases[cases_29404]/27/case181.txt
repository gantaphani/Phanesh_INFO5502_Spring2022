admissions 
defendant contends that the trial court erred by allowing evidence on matters that had been admitted.defendant made numerous admissions in responsive pleadings,answers to requests to admit,and responses to motion for a summary judgment.defendant contends that these responses constituted judicial admissions and made any discussion of the care rendered to elizabeth rath irrelevant and prejudicial.
a judicial admission is a deliberate,clear,unequivocal statement of a party,about a concrete fact,within the party peculiar knowledge.wausau insurance all chicagoland moving storage,d.judicial admissions are binding upon the party making them and may not be controverted.wausau insurance,d at,at.judicial admissions are not evidence at all but rather have the effect of withdrawing a fact from contention.pryor american central transport,d,quoting graham,evidence text,rules,illustrations and problems,at.the purpose of the rule is to remove the temptation to commit perjury.in re estate of rennick.
a trial court may exclude evidence on an issue which has been judicially admitted because the evidence is no longer relevant to the issues remaining in the case the evidence may be superfluous and confusing and the other party may not necessarily be entitled to the additional dramatic force of the evidence.davis international harvester,d,citing wigmore,evidence,at chadbourn ed.the rule,however,is not absolute.a trial court is afforded discretion in evidentiary rulings,and its decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.stallings black decker,d.as stated in wigmore treatise 
nevertheless,a colorless admission by the opponent may sometimes have the effect of depriving the party of the legitimate moral force of his evidence furthermore,a judicial admission may be cleverly made with grudging limitations or evasions or insinuations especially in criminal cases,so as to be technically but not practically a waiver of proof.hence,there should be no absolute rule on the subject and the trial court discretion should determine whether a particular admission is so plenary as to render the first party evidence wholly needless under the circumstances.emphasis in original.wigmore,evidence,at chadbourn ed.
a categorical description of the admissions as judicial does not resolve the issue at hand.despite the admission of negligent conduct,a discussion of the care rendered to elizabeth rath was still necessary to determine the merits of plaintiff claim.in other words,the admissions were limited in scope.
an initial question arises concerning the time frame for the conduct admitted by defendant.plaintiff alleged defendant was negligent throughout elizabeth rath stay.in its answer to the amended complaint,defendant admitted that it carelessly and negligently failed to monitor for skin care,dehydration,and nutrition,but it limited its admission to the conduct in the approximate last week of elizabeth rath residence.this limitation was an apparent part of defendant presentation to the jury.at the trial,defendant argued that it had been negligent,but only during the last week of elizabeth rath stay.
in light of the time limitation,the contested testimony was still relevant.plaintiff did not limit his claim of negligence to the last week of elizabeth rath residence,but rather he presented evidence on the treatment rendered to elizabeth rath throughout the duration of her stay.for example,diel,a treating physician,testified that elizabeth rath must have lacked proper hydration and nutrition for some time to reach her debilitated condition.defendant assertion that any negligent conduct occurred only during the last week of her residency is the type of grudging limitation that prevents an admission from being a practical waiver of proof.see wigmore,evidence,at chadbourn ed.plaintiff was entitled to present evidence regarding treatment throughout elizabeth rath stay,considering defendant limited admissions of negligence to a limited period of time.
even if defendant had admitted negligent conduct for the entirety of elizabeth rath stay,evidence of the care given to her would still be relevant.a description of the course of care was necessary for an understanding of plaintiff claim.on appeal,defendant asserts that the testimony was merely cumulative,and possibly inflammatory,because liability was admitted.this position raises an interesting question how could a jury assess damages without discussing the care rendered a patient when a part of the alleged pain and suffering occurred during the ongoing treatment itself we need not add
