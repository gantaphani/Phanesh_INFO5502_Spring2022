defendant lois lynne lintz appeals from a judgment of financial elder abuse,undue influence,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion of separate property,and constructive trust.defendant challenges only the remedial aspect of the judgment.she argues that the probate court erred by voiding her deceased husband testamentary trusts and trust amendments executed after may without proof of undue influence in connection with the execution of those documents.she argues further that the probate court invalidation of the trust documents unconstitutionally interferes with her marital relationship.
although the probate court applied the incorrect standard for legal capacity and failed to apply a presumption of undue influence to the interspousal transactions at issue here,we will affirm the judgment because it is amply supported by the evidence,especially in light of the higher burdens incorrectly placed on plaintiffs below,and we find no error in the remedy.
factual and procedural background 
defendant was the third wife of decedent robert lintz.the couple married in,divorced approximately six months later,and remarried in february.their second marriage ended when decedent died in october at age.defendant has two children from a previous marriage.decedent had three children from two previous marriages,and two grandchildren.when decedent remarried defendant in,he was a retired real estate developer worth millions of dollars.decedent had a complicated estate plan,with holdings in both northern and southern california.decedent northern california estate plan was contained in the robert lintz trust the trust and a series of amendments to the trust,prepared over the years by decedent estate lawyers.the ninth amendment to the trust,in effect when decedent and defendant remarried,provided for decedent children,grandchildren,and former upon decedent death.
in may decedent executed a tenth amendment to the trust.the tenth amendment provided defendant with fifty percent of decedent assets upon his death,with the remaining fifty percent to be distributed among decedent children and grandchildren.between may and decedent executed several additional trust amendments,increasingly providing defendant with more of decedent assets upon his death and disinheriting his two eldest children.ultimately,in june defendant and decedent,as joint settlors and trustees,executed the lintz family revocable trust.the trust,prepared by defendant attorney at defendant direction,purportedly designated all of decedent property as community property,gave defendant an exclusive life interest in decedent estate,and gave defendant the right to disinherit decedent youngest child and leave any unspent residue to defendant two children.
upon decedent death,decedent older children,plaintiffs susan lintz and james lintz,as decedent successors in interest,filed a second amended complaint against defendant alleging several causes of action including fiduciary abuse of an elder,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,constructive trust,and undue influence following a day bench trial,the probate court issued a page statement of decision finding defendant liable for financial elder abuse under welfare and institutions code section,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion of separate property funds,and finding defendant in constructive trust of decedent converted funds and trust property.the court ruled that decedent had testamentary capacity to execute the trust instruments,but it found defendant liable for undue influence in the procurement of decedent estate plans.
among several remedies,the probate court voided all trusts and trust amendments following the tenth amendment to the trust,invalidated real property deeds,and took steps to implement the terms of the tenth amendment.the court concluded that much of defendant spending during her marriage to decedent constituted acts of financial abuse and conversion,and awarded plaintiffs attorney fees and costs for proving financial elder abuse under welfare and institutions code section.
ii.discussion 
legal capacity standard 
probate code sections to set forth a mental capacity standard related to certain legal acts and decisions.section establishes a rebuttable presumption that all persons have the capacity to make decisions and to be responsible for their acts or decisions,recognizing that persons with mental or physical disorders may still be capable of contracting,conveying,marrying,making medical decisions,executing wills or trusts,and performing other actions,subds.a,b.section,subdivision a provides that a person lacks capacity when there is a deficit in at least one identified mental function and a correlation exists between the deficit or deficits and the decision or acts in question.section provides except where otherwise provided by law,including,but not limited to,the statutory and decisional law of testamentary capacity,a person lacks the capacity to make a decision unless the person has the ability to communicate the decision,and to understand and appreciate,to the extent relevant a the rights,duties,and responsibilities created by,or affected by the decision b the probable consequences for the decisionmaker and,where appropriate,the persons affected by the decision and c the significant risks,benefits,and reasonable alternatives involved in the decision,subds.a c.
in contrast,probate code section,the standard applied by the probate court,contemplates a significantly lower mental capacity standard for the making of a will,requiring only that the person understand the nature of the testamentary act,the nature of the property at issue,and his or her relationship to those affected by the will,including parents,spouse,and descendents.
in anderson hunt th,anderson the court addressed the measure by which a court should evaluate a decedent capacity to make an transfer by trust.anderson ruled that probate code section applied to the mental competency to make a will,not to a testamentary transfer in general.it thus rejected the notion that the decedent competency was determined under probate code section.the court explained that probate code sections through do not impose a single standard of contractual capacity.because each section provides that capacity be evaluated in light of the complexity of the decision or act in question capacity to execute a trust must be evaluated by a person ability to appreciate the consequences of the particular act he or she wishes to take.anderson,supra,at.indeed,m ore complicated decisions and transactions thus would appear to require greater mental function less complicated decisions and transactions would appear to require less mental function.ibid.
anderson further concluded that,when a trust amendment closely resembles a will or codicil in its content and complexity,a court should look to probate code section to determine whether,under probate code section,subdivision b,a person lacks the mental function to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions with regard to the type of act or decision in question.anderson,supra,th at.w hile section is not directly applicable to determine competency to make or amend a trust,it is made applicable through section to trusts or trust amendments that are analogous to wills or codicils.ibid.because the trust amendments in anderson merely reallocated the percentage of the trust estate among beneficiaries,the court considered them indistinguishable from a will or codicil and concluded that the decedent capacity should have been evaluated under the lower capacity standard of probate code section.anderson,supra,at.
adopting the reasoning of anderson,we conclude that the probate court erred by applying the probate code section testamentary capacity standard to the trusts and trust amendments at issue in this case instead of the contractual standard in probate code sections through.the trust instruments here were unquestionably more complex than a will or codicil.they addressed community property concerns,provided for income distribution during the life of the surviving spouse,and provided for the creation of multiple trusts,one contemplating estate tax consequences,up
