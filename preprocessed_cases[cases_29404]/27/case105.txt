in this appeal we consider whether two plaintiffs,frederick mahan fred and his wife martha mahan martha have stated a viable claim under the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act the elder abuse act or the act against charles chan chan,the charles chan insurance agency,the chan agency,omar kaddoura kaddoura,cung thai thai,and the american brokerage network abn collectively the respondents,all of whom provided life insurance advisory services to them.
the facts,as alleged,begin in the when,long before any of the respondents were involved,the mahans purchased two life insurance policies,naming their children as beneficiaries.together,these two policies provided death benefits of approximately,at an annual premium cost of.as part of the mahans estate plan,the policies were held by a revocable living trust the children trust or the trust,of which their daughter,maureen grainger,was trustee.the mahans made enough money available to the trust,in advance,so that it would be,with no need for additional cash infusions from them for ongoing premium costs.
more than two decades later,in,when the events triggering this action began,fred,then at the end of his career as a lawyer,was suffering from confusion and cognitive decline martha,who had turned overall control of the couple affairs over to fred under a power of attorney,was in an even more precarious state of health,having been diagnosed in with alzheimer disease.seizing on this situation,the respondents allegedly carried out an elaborate scheme that involved arranging the surrender of one of the life insurance policies and the replacement of the other with a policy providing more limited coverage,at massively increased cost.the premiums for the new coverage,spread over the term it was to be in force,amounted to some,forcing the mahans to feed cash into the trust to sustain it and,in effect,consuming most of their intended gift in transaction costs,including in commissions to the respondents.
the mahans and maureen acting for the trust sued.separate demurrers to the first amended complaint fac were filed by chan,the chan agency and kaddoura collectively the chan defendants and by thai and abn the thai defendants.the focal point of both demurrers was the mahans first cause of action,pleaded under the elder abuse act.the thrust of the respondents attack was that the children trust owns and has always owned the life insurance policies at issue here,and that all of the commissions paid to the respondents were paid by or on behalf of the trust.whatever money the mahans paid into the trust to sustain it,the respondents argued,was paid voluntarily for the benefit of their children,after the alleged scheme was over.according to the respondents,the only proper plaintiff is the children trust,which does not have an elder abuse act claim because it is not years old.
embracing this line of argument,the trial court sustained both demurrers,ruling that the mahans had not alleged any depriv ation of property owned by them within the meaning of section.the court also sustained the demurrers as to the mahans remaining causes of action,the second for negligence,third for breach of fiduciary duty,fourth for fraud and fifth for violation of business and professions code section,applying in substance the same reasoning the fac failed to allege that the mahans rather than the children trust,suffered harm.since neither of the demurrers attacked the trust right to pursue the second,third,fourth and fifth causes of action,the court ruling left those claims intact,with the trust remaining as the sole plaintiff in the action.the court invited the mahans to amend to allege harm to themselves directly,but they elected to stand on the allegations of the fac,as originally stated.judgment was then entered dismissing the mahans claims with prejudice,and this appeal followed.
we now reverse and remand.
background 
we review a trial court ruling on demurrer de novo california apartment city of fremont th,giving the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and viewing its parts in context.citations.we deem to be true all material facts properly pled.citation.we must also accept as true those facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.balikov southern cal.gas th,see tameny atlantic richfield cal d.the primary issue here is whether the mahans have stated legally cognizable harm to themselves.accepting the allegations in the fac to be true,as we must at this stage whether those allegations can be proved is another matter we conclude that they have done so.
the fac,to be sure,is not particularly.it begins with some pages of dense background narrative,set forth in numbered paragraphs,bereft of subheadings or clear organizing principles.these undifferentiated background allegations are then incorporated,wholesale,into each cause of action.because of the fac meandering style,the trial court observed it is difficult to discern the materiality of its many allegations,and as a result,if the mahans chose to amend,the court ordered them to file something more focused and concise.we sympathize with that reaction,having waded through the document ourselves,but in the end we believe the mahans core allegations are set forth in reasonably coherent fashion beyond the capsule summary provided above,we set forth the relevant highlights,as follows.
background the children trust 
in the the mahans paid an estate planning attorney to create an estate plan in which the children trust was a critical component.the trust was created to hold the insurance policies in the approximate amount of million for the children future benefit,until after both of the mahans had passed away.in implementing their estate plan,the mahans made the children trust sustainable,they made enough cash available within the trust to pay the annual premiums for many years to come.this gave the mahans peace of mind knowing that there would be million for their children upon their passing.for tax reasons,all assets held by the trust had to be,and are,indisputably owned by maureen as the trustee and a beneficiary of the trust 
b.the alleged scheme 
the parties first meetings 
sometime in january or february,the chan defendants assisted fred in finding casualty and earthquake insurance for the mahans home,and in doing so succeeded in winning fred trust and confidence by convincing him of their insurance expertise and that they had the mahans best interests at heart.after finishing this project,the chan defendants,with the assistance of the thai defendants,turned their focus to the mahans existing life insurance policies,offering to review and,if appropriate,fine tune the life insurance component of the mahans estate plan.early in their dealings with fred,the respondents discovered the mahans respective cognitive issues and proceeded to exploit the situation and betray their trust,driven by an avaricious pursuit of a life insurance commission.
the respondents also learned that the children trust held two joint life policies which the mahans had purchased many years earlier and which had accumulated substantial cash value.one policy,from reassure america the reassure america policy,providing death benefits of,had a planned annual premium of the other was from sun life of canada the sun life policy,providing a death benefit of,with an annual planned premium of.maureen,a beneficiary of both policies,owned the reassure america policy the trust owned the sun life policy.the linchpin of the respondents scheme was the false representation to fred that he could use the cash value in the existing policies to get substantial additional coverage while keeping the annual premium costs at.
once the respondents convinced fred of their ability to obtain more coverage without any increase in premium cost,they embarked on a course of conduct in which they manipulated the trust by dealing almost exclusively with fred,cutting maureen out of the loop,and relying on their ability to get maureen to sign off on transactional steps presented to her as having her father approval.the respondents knew of maureen reliance upon her father guidance and exploited that trust and deference.they went out of their way to accelerate and pressure maureen actions and limit her access to information,often providing her with only signature pages or blank forms to sign,and always having fred mahan sign first in order to signal his approval and recommendation.
the first wave of life insurance applications 
in march,the respondents prepar ed and submit ted applications for life insurance on both mahans to both life insurance company of the southwest and lincoln benefit life insurance company.both applications were either presented in a way which deprived the mahans of a meaningful opportunity to review them,or simply given to the mahans to sign before they were filled out.had fred been given a chance to review the southwest and lincoln benefit applications before they were submitted,he would have discovered that,instead of leveraging the cash value in the reassure america policy and the sun life policy,as chan and kaddoura and represented,defendants were actually planning on replacing both policies.
in this first wave of applications,the respondents went to great lengths to conceal the ownership of the life insurance they were seeking,which allowed them to obscure the fact they were planning a replacement of coverage,not simply the purchase of additional coverage.in five applications submitted in may and july,the respondents concealed either one existing policy or the other,listing the mahans,not maureen,as the owners.all of the applications the respondents submitted between march and may were eventually denied,with each of the insurers citing martha cognitive disorder and abnormal lab results for fred as the reason for the denial.
in june,having failed in their first series of attempts to arrange replacement coverage for both existing policies,the respondents took a different tack.by that point,it was clear to them that martha was uninsurable due to her alzheimer disease diagnosis,so they decided to apply for a new policy insuring only fred.this change in course would later turn out to have significant consequences.among other things,it created the prospect of a sharp escalation in cost,for in seeking coverage the the premiums on a policy insuring only fred mahan would be higher than the premiums on a policy insuring both of the mahans.it also fundamentally undermined any pretense that additional insurance could be obtained without additional premium cost.the respondents pressed ahead anyway.motivated by their own and determined to earn a commission,the respondents proceeded to prepare and submit more life insurance applications.
the purchase of the transamerica policy 
because obtaining term insurance of any kind,given fred age then was going to be enormously expensive,the respondents developed a strategy to leave the sun life policy in place,while arranging to have the trust borrow against its cash surrender value.by raising cash through a loan against the sun life policy,the trust could then pay the high initial payment that would be required to place the insurance.for a purchase of term life insurance structured in this way,the respondents submitted two applications in july,one to transamerica,and one to american general.at that point,they still had not yet discussed anything about what they were doing with maureen.and as they had done with the prior,unsuccessful applications,the respondents had fred sign blank or incomplete applications before respondents themselves completed and submitted them.
when defendants steered the mahans and the trust into funding the initial premium on the transamerica policy by borrowing against the sun life policy,they failed to disclose the fact that there would be an additional cost for the loan because an annual payment of the loan interest would have to be made or that unpaid interest would be deducted from the cash value and reduce the death benefit.a loan against the sun life policy would be a loan because it would reduce the net cash surrender value to under within a year.defendants had the sun life policy statement of value and knew,but did not disclose,that borrowing funds from that policy without additional funding would jeopardize the policy by putting it in danger of lapsing.
in seeking to place this new coverage,the respondents gamesmanship concerning policy ownership continued.the notice regarding replacement accompanying the transamerica application stated that fred was the contract owner for the sun life policy when,in fact,the respondents knew the policy was owned by the children trust.on both the transamerica application and on the american general application,the respondents pretend ed to replace the sun life policy when in fact they were going to replace the reassure america policy and borrow against the sun life policy.there was also no indication in either application that martha was one of the insureds.had the respondents identified martha as an insured or listed reassure america as the policy being replaced,they would have jeopardized their scheme by triggering a deeper inquiry by the insurance companies into what was going on.
the transamerica application,which is attached as an exhibit to the fac,was given to fred in blank,with an x encircled next to several places on it where he was expected to sign.only after fred mahan signed those forms did defendants complete and submit them to transamerica.among the documents submitted with the transamerica application were forms entitled absolute assignment to effect internal revenue code section exchange and rollover,and a notice regarding replacement replacing your life insurance or annuity.these forms were left blank.in submitting the application,the respondents,as life insurance experts,knew that replacing the sun life policy or the reassure america policy with the transamerica policy did not qualify as an irs section exchange,thereby exposing the cash surrender value of the reassure america p olicy to income taxes.notwithstanding their knowledge that they were purporting to surrender a policy for a policy,defendants prepared,presented and had fred mahan sign a transamerica illustration which still assumed a legally impossible e xchange.
ultimately,the transamerica application was successful,resulting in the issuance of a new term life policy the transamerica policy in september covering fred,providing death benefits of for an initial payment of and an annual premium thereafter of,terminating on fred birthday.when the transamerica policy issued,so focused were the respondents on making sure that they were paid the commission they were due that they failed to deliver the policy as issued and neglected to pass along crucial pricing information from transamerica.in issuing the coverage,it turned out,transamerica indicated that,to defray the high initial payment which respondents had already arranged to fund by the surrender of the reassure america policy fred had the option of paying a lower upfront premium and paying a higher interest rate.the availability of this option showed it was unnecessary to surrender the reassure america policy,but neither fred nor maureen was advised of it.
summing up the workings of this alleged scheme up to its culmination upon issuance of the transamerica policy,the fac alleges that the defendants completed the sale of the transamerica p olicy through a parade of wrongful acts,errors and omissions,includ ing,forging signatures,failing to provide the mahans and the trust complete copies of the documents they had signed,concealing or otherwise negligently failing to disclose the true economics of the transamerica transaction,concealing or otherwise negligently failing to disclose the tax consequences of surrendering the reassure america policy,concealing or otherwise negligently failing to disclose material facts about the loan being taken against the sun life policy,and concealing or otherwise negligently failing to disclose the fact that they were extinguishing insurance coverage on martha mahan and at a time of her life when she had become uninsurable.
the consequences to the mahans and to the children trust 
the respondents scheme had a series of negative financial consequences,impacting the trust as well as the mahans.first,the trust was drained of cash because the annual insurance premium owed by the children trust increased by more than,and over the life of the transamerica policy left the trust obligated to pay over million in additional premiums,the trust owed the respondents over in commissions,and the trust paid transamerica for the initial payment.second,one of the primary tax advantages of using joint life insurance as the form of asset conveyed through the trust to the children was destroyed.because the reassure america policy was not surrendered through a e xchange and could not be,because it went from a to a policy,there would be taxes owed on the funds maureen grainger received upon surrender.defendants knew about those tax consequences but did not explain them to maureen or the mahans.
third,to keep the trust afloat,the mahans were forced to sell assets so they could put significantly more of their personal money into the children trust in order to pay insurance premiums and interest to prevent the sun life and transamerica insurance policies from lapsing,and now they must continue paying money into the trust to sustain it.fourth,the reassure america policy was extinguished by its surrender,the accumulated cash value of the sun life policy was wiped out by its encumbrance with debt,and the whole life,joint survivorship coverage formerly provided by both the reassure america policy and the sun life policy,together,was replaced with far less valuable and more limited term life insurance on fred life alone.after fred mahan turns,the transamerica p olicy will terminate and all premiums paid,including the initial payment of,will be forfeited.in contrast,for the coverage which they gave up,the mahans paid an annual premium of only for the reassure america policy,a policy that would not terminate as long as the premiums were kept current.
it also turned out that fred mahan never understood in that he would be forced to deposit into the children trust over in premiums for the transamerica p olicy,a policy that would terminate when fred turned.when maureen and fred questioned chan about the actual premium costs of the transamerica p olicy,in december of,chan initial response was that fred could just borrow against his real estate to pay the premiums when fred objected to borrowing against his and martha real estate,chan response was to propose a reduction in the transamerica p olicy coverage.to fred and to maureen,this exchange with chan brought into sharp focus the adverse financial consequences of what had occurred,so they sued.
respondents demurrers and the trial court ruling 
the trial court sustained an initial round of demurrers to the original complaint,granting leave to amend.following that order,the mahans filed the fac,alleging that all of the respondents,either directly or by assisting the principals,committed financial abuse against elders,the mahans,in violation of the elder abuse act all of the respondents were negligent the chan defendants breached one or more fiduciary duties,in violation of,at least,insurance code sections and the chan defendants committed fraud and all of the respondents engaged in unlawful,unfair,and deceptive business practices under business and professions code section et.
the chan defendants demurrer challenged all five of the mahans causes of action,while the thai defendants demurrer challenged only the first,second and fifth causes of action the only claims on which they were named as defendants.the grounds for the demurrers,neither of which attacked the trust ability to pursue relief on the second through fifth causes of action,substantially overlapped.each focused in fashion on the mahans elder abuse act claim.the mahans basic argument in support of that claim was that the respondents alleged scheme deprived them of property rights under section by,in essence,forc ing them to conduct a donative transfer to the children trust.based on the mahans concession that neither of them legally owned the transamerica life insurance policy,because neither legally owned the children trust the trust was indisputably owned by maureen,the respondents argued that fred mahan may have been acting as maureen adviser and agent and the rest of it,but he was the one who lost anything.he was a conduit.
the trial court agreed,ruling that the mahans elder abuse act claim fails to state a cause of action.code civ,subd.e.t he allegation that defendants predatory scheme forced the plaintiffs to put money into the children trust fails to allege elder financial abuse,the court explained,because the transfer of funds by the mahans to the trust for their children benefit was a voluntary act that occurred after defendants alleged fraudulent scheme.the mahans property money went not to the defendants,the alleged abusers,but to the trust for the benefit of the children.such allegations do not suffice to show that defendants took,appropriated,secreted,obtained or retained or assisted in taking the mahans money by way of a donative transfer,as plaintiffs assert.
on the same reasoning,the court sustained the respondents demurrers as to the mahans claims for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and violation of section,adopting the respondents argument that those causes of action fail because plaintiffs have not alleged financial loss or harm.the court did,however,once again grant the mahans leave to amend,noting there were some allegations in the fac that appeared to allege in the alternative that fred was the true owner of the transamerica policy,and that,if the mahans could allege truthfully that fred was the actual policy obligor,however,they may be able to allege that they suffered financial harm as a result of defendants scheme.
ultimately,as masters of their own complaint,the mahans declined to abandon their primary theory which accepted that the children trust is the owner of all of the life insurance policies at the center of respondents scheme in favor of an alternate theory that would have committed them to prove that fred was the real owner of the transamerica policy,an approach to pleading their claims which in many respects would have been inconsistent with the documentary evidence attached to the fac.they chose instead to stand on the fac,as pleaded.the court then entered judgment dismissing all causes of action as to them,with prejudice,while leaving intact the second through fifth causes of action to the extent the trust may wish to assert them.a final,appealable judgment having been entered as between the mahans and the respondents see nguyen calhoun th,this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
a.the elder abuse act cause of action 
in construing the elder abuse act,we begin with its words.winn pioneer medical group,cal th,winn.we are guided by the ordinary meaning of those words,their relationship to the text of related provisions,terms used elsewhere in the statute,and the overarching structure of the statutory scheme.citations.when the language of a statutory provision remains opaque after we consider its text,the statute structure,and related statutory provisions,we may take account of extrinsic sources such as legislative history to assist us in discerning the legislature purpose.id.at.
statutory text 
financial abuse claims are authorized in the elder abuse act by section,which works with a set of defined terms in sections and.as provided in section,subdivision a,f inancial abuse of an elder occurs when a person or entity does any of the following takes,secretes,appropriates,obtains,or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud,or both.assists in taking,secreting,appropriating,obtaining,or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud,or both.takes,secretes,appropriates,obtains,or retains,or assists in taking,secreting,appropriating,obtaining,or retaining,real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue influence,as defined in section.
section,subdivision c defines the phrase t akes,secretes,appropriates,obtains,or retains as occurring when an elder or dependent adult is deprived of any property right,including by means of an agreement,donative transfer,or testamentary bequest,regardless of whether the property is held directly or by a representative of an elder or dependent adult.section,subdivisions a,b and c,together,define the requisite level of culpability broadly.the defendant will be liable for depriv ation,subd.c of an elder property that is taken for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud,subd.a,or that is committed by undue influence,subd.a.
the terms wrongful use and undue influence are specifically defined as well.a person or entity shall be deemed to have taken,secreted,appropriated,obtained,or retained property for a wrongful use if,among other things,the person or entity knew or should have known that this conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder or dependent adult,subd.b.undue influence means excessive persuasion that causes another person to act or refrain from acting by overcoming that person free will and results in inequity.the test for undue influence is governed by a series of listed factors,including the vulnerability of the victim,subd.a,the influencer apparent authority,subd.a,the actions or tactics used by the influencer,subd.a,and the equity of the result,subd.a.
no one disputes that the mahans were elders when the acts alleged in the fac took place,or that the alleged chicanery of the respondents,either directly or in assisting one another,potentially exposes them to liability under the statute if the mahans have adequately alleged a deprivat ion of the property of an elder for a wrongful use or by undue influence.placing great emphasis of the words the property of an elder,the respondents contend the mahans were not deprived of any such property,and,even assuming there was a depriv ation of something,the trust owned whatever was allegedly taken here.thus,it is claimed,the respondents committed no statutory violation because they did not take the property of an elder to get the commission they allegedly were paid.
although we are skeptical of such a stingy reading of the statutory text,the position the respondents take does have some surface appeal.there is no dispute that,long before respondents came on the scene,the mahans arranged to place ownership of the life insurance policies at issue in either maureen or the children trust,apparently for tax purposes that they ceded all control of the trust and its assets to maureen as the trustee and that,as trustee,maureen was obligated to pay whatever premiums were owing on the life insurance policies.since respondents position that the elder abuse act does not apply on these facts rests on a reasonably plausible reading of the statutory text,we pause briefly to review the genesis of sections,and,so that we may consider these provisions within the overall structure of the act and take legislative history and purpose into account in applying them.
statutory history and purpose 
the legislature recognizes that elders are a class of persons who are particularly vulnerable to abuse and that this state has a responsibility to protect them,subd.a see bookout nielsen th.enacted in with that broad purpose in mind,the elder abuse act now protects elders by providing heightened remedies that encourage private enforcement of laws against abuse and neglect.winn,supra,cal th at intrieri superior court th.to this end,civil actions may be brought under the act for physical abuse,neglect,or financial abuse.
when the elder abuse act was enacted,its primary focus was on data collection and encouraging the reporting of claims as a way of facilitating criminal enforcement.ara living,superior court th.in,the focus shifted to private,civil enforcement of laws against elder abuse and neglect.delaney baker cal th,see.a key objective of the amendments was to remedy the fact that few civil cases were being brought in connection with elder abuse due to problems of proof,court delays,and the lack of incentives to prosecute these suits,subd.h see cal.elder law litigation an advocate guide ed.may.
the template for private enforcement in cases involving physical abuse or neglect was set by the addition of section to the act in section has been amended several times since then,but the core of it remains the same today.it sets forth a scheme of heightened remedies punitive damages,subd.c,attorney fees and costs,subd.a,and exemption from certain limitations on recoverable damages in survivorship actions,subd.b designed to provide incentives for interested persons to engage attorneys to take up the cause of abused elderly persons,subd.j.these remedies are available only where the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice in the commission of this abuse.
financial abuse began to garner concentrated legislative attention in the late.from the,fiduciary abuse had been among the types of elder abuse covered by the act but beginning in the legislature took a series of steps to strengthen the remedies available for financial injury inflicted on elders by those who misuse positions of trust and confidence the first step the legislature took,in,was to substitute the phrase financial abuse for the narrower phrase fiduciary abuse throughout the act then,in,it created a new class of claims for financial abuse,enacting a private enforcement provision section tailored to these claims in particular.section sets forth a scheme of heightened remedies closely paralleling those available under section,but with some key differences,principally that attorney fee and cost awards are available for financial abuse claims proved by the preponderance of the evidence,while clear and convincing evidence remains the standard applicable to fee and cost recovery for claims of physical abuse or neglect.
in,the legislature,acting on reports that the intent to encourage private claims by providing for enhanced remedies has largely been unrealized,made available the remedy of prejudgment attachment as a way to facilitate quick recovery of losses in financial abuse cases.stats,ch.in the legislature acted again,broadening the defined term financial abuse and making procedural changes designed to facilitate the bringing of financial abuse claims.in an extensive set of amendments,the legislature,among other things,redefined what it means to take property for a wrongful use,replacing the prior requirement that bad faith be shown with a standard based on the whether the defendant knew or should have known of likely harm to the elder,subd.b redefined the phrase takes,secretes,appropriates,obtains,or retains so that any depriv ation of property was subject to liability,including by means of agreement,donative transfer,or testamentary bequest,and regardless of whether the property is held directly by the elder or on his behalf by a,subd.c and created a new basis for liability,adding depriv ation of property by undue influence,subd.a as a ground for suit separate from depriv ation for wrongful use or with intent to defraud,subd.b 
application of the act 
with this quick sketch of the statutory history in mind,we turn to a specific application of the elder abuse act on the record here.most of the questions raised by this appeal are easily answered by resort to the statutory text,either plainly applied,or when read in light of statutory context and history.but to the extent there is room for reasonable debate,we resolve those questions in favor of the mahans.see california of health facilities department of health services cal th,a remedial statute is to be liberally construed on behalf of the class of persons it is designed to protect.as further explained below,we view respondents narrow construction of the elder abuse act as incompatible not only with its overall remedial purpose,but also with the breadth of the financial abuse provisions of the act as those provisions have evolved by amendment in recent years.
depriv ation 
since the respondents are alleged to have arranged for a restructuring of insurance policies the mahans do not own,at an increased premium cost the mahans are not obligated to pay,the threshold question presented here is whether the fac adequately alleges that the respondents took anything from the mahans in a manner that is cognizable under the elder abuse act.we think it does.
the text of section is broad.it speaks not only of taking real or personal property,but also secreting,appropriating,obtaining,or retaining such property,subd.a accord,subd.a,and then,to capture the sense of all of these terms,goes on to use the more expansive term deprive,subd.c a person or entity takes,secretes,appropriates,obtains,or retains real or personal property when an elder or dependent adult is deprived of any property right.some of the terms used in section are narrower than others to secret,for example,suggests hiding or concealment,and to retain or to obtain suggests affirmatively acquiring possession of something.but we have no trouble concluding that the broadest of these terms the word deprive in its ordinary meaning covers what the mahans have alleged.see,subd.c oxford english dict.online deprivation means t he action of depriving or fact of being deprived the taking away of anything enjoyed dispossession,loss at as of june.the trial court determination to the contrary relies heavily on the fact that the mahans gifted or intend to gift whatever money or assets they transferred or will transfer to the trust,but in our view this makes no difference.the act,as amended in,expressly contemplates that liability may flow from transfers made by agreement,donative transfer,or testamentary bequest,subd.c.
property of an elder 
perhaps the most challenging aspect of this appeal,and the focus of most of the respondents attention,is the further question whether any losses claimed by the mahans may be considered the property of an elder the respondents insist that the fac alleges,at most,a depriv ation of property belonging to the trust,not to the mahans.naturally,the mahans disagree,claiming they were deprived of their right s in three pieces of property damage to their estate plan,loss of the money they felt compelled to transfer to the children trust to pay for the transamerica term coverage,and loss of the money they felt compelled to transfer to the children trust to pay the respondents commissions.we agree with the mahans.
first,we consider the mahans theory that their estate plan was damaged.respondents argue that an estate plan can not be a property right,and strictly speaking,they are correct,but what they overlook is that the estate plan alleged here was simply the vehicle by which the mahans sought to convey assets by gift to their children.those assets took the form of joint survivorship life insurance policies.as alleged in the fac,the two chosen policies had unique characteristics and value,in that they accumulated cash surrender value over time and were permanent until the last of the mahans passed away,they were whole life policies on two lives and did not expire on a date certain,as term insurance does,and in combination,they were dramatically cheaper than the restructured coverage put in place by the respondents.by alleging that the respondents steered the mahans into transactions that,in effect,destroyed the value they intended to convey to their children when they chose these two joint survivorship life insurance policies as their preferred form of gift asset,we think the fac alleges a legally cognizable depriv ation of a property right under the language of section,subdivision c,as amended in.we agree with the mahans,therefore,that b ecause defendants misconduct made the donation or voluntary transfer of the mahans chosen gift assets in their estate plan much more expensive and of lesser value,their right to dispose of their property has been damaged.see bounds superior court th,where defendants manipulated plaintiff suffering from alzheimer disease into signing escrow instructions that impeded sale or encumbrance of real estate owned by plaintiff trust,the adverse financial impact of the escrow instructions was sufficient to allege a depriv ation of a property right by means of agreement within the meaning of section,subd.c,because the restrictions on alienability deprived her and the trust of one of the incidents of property ownership.
the value embodied in the reassure america policy and the sun life policy was intrinsically personal to each of the mahans.subdivision a of section of the insurance code provides,in relevant part,that e very person has an insurable interest in the life and health of a h imself.see also ins.code,subd.b an individual has an unlimited insurable interest in his or her own life and may lawfully take out a policy of insurance on his or her own life.we believe a statutory insurable interest is properly considered a property right within the meaning of section granted,in,the mahans eligibility for life insurance as new applicants was subject to many variables for which the respondents can not be held responsible,but that looks at insurability from the wrong point in time.because the mahans enjoyed whole life coverage as of the inception of the two joint survivorship policies at issue here see ins.code,an interest in the life or health of a person insured must exist when the insurance takes effect,they would never have had to qualify as insurable again absent respondents machinations.this is not a case in which the respondents arranged to swap one term policy for another,less valuable one.they are alleged,instead,to have stripped the mahans of the ability to deliver one of the key features that anyone seeks in whole life coverage a lifelong right to death benefits payable to the beneficiary,so long as premiums are paid.due to the ticking of the actuarial clock and their declining health,these elders can never again qualify for life insurance of the same value they secured in the.once they suffered a depriv ation,the value of that asset can not be restored any more than the clock can be turned back.
second,we examine the alleged depriv ation of the mahans property right s in funds paid for the transamerica term coverage.we split this question into two parts,looking first at the initial payment to transamerica,and then looking at the money paid or to be paid for annual premiums.because the initial payment was made from funds generated directly from the reassure america and sun life policies see ante,fn,we view this money as part of the value of that whole life coverage respondents are alleged to have obstructed its transferability to the mahans children.as for premiums paid or payable on the transamerica policy over and above the annual premium cost of the two joint survivorship policies they intended to pass to their children,the mahans have had to reach into their pockets and sell assets to provide more cash to the children trust than they ever planned to do.by alleging that the mahans were forced to transfer more of their own money into the children trust than they anticipated and sell some of their personal assets to do so which the respondents well knew would happen we are satisfied the fac has sufficiently alleged respondents deprived the mahans of their property right s,subd.c in that money.stating things in blunt terms,the fac alleges that,by manipulation and use of the children trust as an instrument,the respondents managed to separate the mahans from their money.that,in our view,constitutes a depriv ation of property.
third,we consider whether,when respondents were paid their commissions,they deprived the mahans of the property of an elder.courts have found in a number of settings that commissions paid by a third party to a defendant arising from an abusive transaction are sufficient to constitute elder abuse.see,wood jamison th,a finder fee paid from the lender sufficient zimmer nawabi cal.d,zimmer commission paid by mortgage broker sufficient negrete allianz life ins.of am.cal.d,negrete commissions from churning insurance policies sufficient.here,whether the commission money flowed directly into the respondents pockets,it seems to us,makes no difference.the mahans have alleged that the respondents scheme depleted all of the cash in the trust and that,as a result,all commission payments by the trust are fairly traceable to them.
at bottom,the respondents insistence that any compensation for their services came from the trust,and that the mahans never paid a dime themselves,strikes us as an argument going to the scope of the relief available,not to the question of whether a claim for relief has been stated in the first instance.certainly,the adverse financial consequences flowing from the respondents actions can not be awarded twice in damages,both to the trust and to the mahans,but any damages apportionment issues must be dealt with as a matter of proof,not as a matter of pleading.on this record,we can not say what specific items of damages may be awardable to the mahans,as distinguished from the trust.all we can say definitively is that it can be fairly inferred from the allegations of the fac that the mahans suffered at least some damages unique to themselves and the respondents are entitled to object to any effort at double recovery.
wrongful use 
we look next to whether the fac adequately alleges that any property of the mahans was taken for a wrongful use under subdivisions a and a of section.to show a likelihood that the alleged scheme here would be harmful to them and thus raise a presumption of wrongful use within the meaning of these subdivisions,the mahans do not have to allege they might suffer physical harm or mental suffering from it see bonfigli strachan th,negrete,supra,d at,although the fac does allege emotional distress to fred.in addition,given their prior dealings with fred,the respondents knew enough about how the mahans estate was structured to understand the critical role joint survivor coverage played in their plans.the respondents also knew early in that each of the mahans was suffering from mental incapacity,yet chose to deal almost exclusively with them instead of maureen.the respondents further knew that maureen,who lived in oregon,would follow her father advice in connection with trust business.
when the respondents alleged scheme began,the mahans had two existing whole life policies that provided satisfactory coverage,yet by using a position of trust and confidence the respondents maneuvered them into an arrangement in which they effectively replaced the existing coverage surrendering one policy,borrowing against the other and wiping out its accumulated cash surrender value and arranged instead to have fred buy a new,policy with significantly higher premiums.to make matters worse,it turned out that,when all was said and done,based on a pricing option transamerica offered,it was unnecessary to surrender the reassure america policy,yet the respondents were so focused on getting their commission that they never bothered to mention the availability of this option to fred or maureen,having already rushed the surrender into effect.
there is enough here to say the respondents knew or should have known of the likely harm their scheme would have on the mahans.chan alleged statement to fred and maureen that the mahans could just borrow against their real estate suggests an awareness fred would need to call upon other assets to bear the dramatically increased cost burden the respondents knew was coming.that alone is enough to justify an inference of the requisite knowledge.the mahans also argue,and we agree,that another way to describe what the respondents allegedly did if true is churning,a term often used in the context as excessive trading done primarily to benefit the broker by generating commissions in excess of those justified.see hobbs bateman eichler,hill richards,d.this case is similar to one from a federal district court see zimmer,supra,d at,where the court held the insurance agents liable for financial elder abuse for what essentially amounted to a churning.just as in zimmer,accepting the allegations of the fac as true,the respondents wrongfully obtained tens of thousands of dollars in commissions as a result of their false statements about the terms of the mahans refinance,which the respondents knew were less favorable to the mahans than their previous insurance policies.id.at.
undue influence 
the last question we address in applying the elder abuse act is whether the fac sufficiently alleges depriv ation committed by undue influence,subd.a,which is an alternative to depriv ation by wrongful use or intent to defraud,subd.a,under the revised liability scheme created by amendment in.we think the fac sufficiently alleges the mahans felt need to pay more into the trust to keep it afloat was brought about by undue influence as now defined in section.the respondents are alleged to have taken advantage of two aged individuals,both in a state of cognitive decline,subd.a and,by use of their professed expertise as insurance professionals,subd.a,carried out an elaborate plan of replacing insurance on the victims lives by actions or tactics that included haste or secrecy,subd.a c,ultimately visiting serious inequity on them,which included adverse economic consequences,divergence from their prior intent,and commissions paid that are out of proportion to the value of the services rendered to them,subd.a.thus,the plain terms of section,subdivision a,fit what is alleged here quite well.the respondents are free to argue in their defense that,factually,and as a matter of causation,the mahans actions in paying more money into the trust were volitional and somehow independent of their alleged bad acts,but for now the fac sets forth plenty to permit a finding to the contrary.
b.other causes of action 
finally,we address the trial court dismissal of the mahans four remaining causes of action negligence,breach of fiduciary duty under ins.code,et fraud,and unlawful business practices under bus.code,based on its conclusion that the respondents had not deprived the mahans of a property interest,and thus the respondents had not injured the mahans.for the reasons explained above in concluding the fac adequately alleges depriv ation of the property of an elder for purposes of the elder abuse act,we conclude the court erroneously sustained the respondents demurrers as to these other causes of action.the analysis of injury is,in substance,the same.
the chan defendants contend the mahans forfeited these four claims for lack of analysis and authority in their opening brief on appeal.we disagree.the trial court was clear in stating it denied all of the mahans five causes of action because they had not alleged financial loss or harm.it is true that the mahans focused their appellate briefs on the alleged harm they suffered in the context of financial abuse under the elder abuse act.the trial court saw this line of argument as presenting a question common to all five causes of action,and so do we.we see no reason the depriv ation of property for wrongful use we have found sufficient for purposes of the elder abuse act may not also serve as sufficient injury to support the second through fifth causes of action 
iii.disposition 
we reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.the mahans shall recover their costs on appeal.
