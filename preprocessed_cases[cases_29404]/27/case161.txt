factual and procedural background 
from november to january,decedent,a woman and an elder was a resident at trinity.decedent suffered from severe pain of her left leg and was identified as a candidate for developing pressure ulcers.despite a physician order to administer celebrex,a drug known by trinity to be effective in relieving decedent pain,decedent rarely received the drug.neither did trinity implement the necessary protocol to prevent decedent from developing pressure ulcers.trinity also failed to notify decedent physician that she complained of pain.consequently,decedent condition deteriorated with the development of severely painful pressure ulcers in both heels and a black blister on her left heel.
in january,in a worsened condition,decedent was transferred to pomona valley hospital medical center.she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis of the left heel and infections in the wounds of both heels.in the next month,decedent underwent debridement of her wounds and amputation of her gangrened left leg below the knee.decedent also required intravenous antibiotics,extensive skilled nursing and rehabilitation.
upon discharge from the hospital,from march to december,decedent was a resident at country villa.while there,the pressure ulcer on her right heel worsened,because country villa failed to provide adequate pressure relief.she also suffered a painful fall when country villa staff dropped her.country villa additionally failed to provide for decedent personal hygiene,leaving her in filthy and unsanitary conditions.decedent further developed aspirational pneumonia as a result of country villa failure to provide her with the proper diet of puree food,monitor her food intake,and assist with her eating.on december,decedent died from respiratory failure,aspirational pneumonia,bulbar dysfunction and parkinsonism.
real parties sued trinity and country villa for willful misconduct,negligence,violation of residents rights,fraudulent concealment,elder abuse,unfair business practices,and wrongful death.the original complaint prayer for relief did not identify the causes of action for which real parties sought punitive damages,but sought them as to those causes of action not covered by section.without distinguishing between trinity and country villa,the alleged custodial care deficiencies by both defendants included the failure to assist decedent with hygiene,the failure to provide decedent with food,adequate hydration and pressure relief so as to prevent formation and worsening of pressure sores,and the failure to protect decedent from health and safety hazards.
trinity and country villa moved to strike the punitive damages claim for real parties failure to comply with section a.relying on community care rehabilitation center superior court th,d community care,disapproved in part in covenant care,supra,cal th at,fn,d,defendants argued that elder abuse claims are not exempt from the procedural requirements of section a.
real parties opposed both motions to strike,asserting their claims were of improper custodial care and as such were not subject to section a.on october,the trial court,in spite of essentially identical allegations as to each of the parties,granted trinity motion and denied country villa motion in its minute order 
in sum,i find that the holdings in community care governs sic and that ccp applies where a plaintiff claims are based in any substantial part on a breach of professional duty.as to defendant country villa claremont,the complaint is not based to any substantial degree on professional malpractice therefore,ccp does not apply and it s motion to strike is denied.as to defendant trinity oakland,a substantial part of the claims against them are based on the exercise of professional judgment therefore ccp applies and the motion to strike the punitive damages claim is granted 
in the second amended complaint,real parties prayed for punitive and exemplary damages against all defendants except trinity.
country villa seeks an alternative writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying petitioner motion to strike the punitive damages claim.in its moving papers,country villa cited community care as its primary authority in asserting the applicability of section a to elder abuse cases.real parties return and opposition argued that community care addressed issues only related to professional and not custodial services,and section a was,therefore,not applicable to country villa.
after the supreme court issued its decision in covenant care,supra,cal th,d,country villa supplemental brief acknowledged its holding relieves real parties from complying with section a on their statutory cause of action for elder abuse,but continued to assert that compliance with section is required as to common law causes of action such as fraud and willful misconduct.real parties supplemental brief asserted that covenant care is plainly dispositive of the issues raised in this petition and the trial court ruling is correct.
