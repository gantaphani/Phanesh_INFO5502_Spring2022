tepper first amended complaint 
on september,tepper filed a first amended complaint substantially repeating the allegations of elder financial abuse.as to standing tepper added,plaintiff brings this action in the name of eileen,the real party in interest,who is incapable of bringing the action herself.eileen has no awareness of her finances or how her continued trust in defendants is harming her financial security.defendants are eileen other three children and they are or have been trustees of various trusts established by eileen and her late husband while eileen is nominally a of her revocable living trust,it is clear she has entirely delegated control of her finances to the defendants.this action became necessary after the defendants failed to respond to requests for an accounting and information about expenditures from eileen trusts after eileen professional advisers became concerned that she would shortly run out of money.a formal conservatorship action is not required to act on behalf of eileen because it would unnecessarily involve her in proceedings primarily concerned with her capacity rather than the actions being taken by her fiduciaries and would create additional expense for her.a conservatorship would focus the legal action as an attack on eileen capacity,rather than an attempt to protect her from her who are endangering her financial security.
tepper further alleged eileen lack of understanding of her situation was supported by numerous statements eileen had made during her deposition including she does not sign her own checks,does not have a budget and does not know specifically how her money is being spent she relied on her lawyer to produce documents at her deposition she could not independently describe the extent of gifts being made from her assets by her three and she was under the mistaken impression that tepper was suing her.tepper attached transcripts from eileen deposition as exhibits to support these allegations.this time,in her prayer for relief tepper sought compensatory and punitive damages payable to eileen wilkins or her designated trust,as well as tepper reasonable attorney fees.
on february,martha,individually and as,demurred to the amended complaint asserting,primarily,tepper lack of standing to pursue the elder financial abuse action on eileen behalf.eileen,geoffrey and derek joined in martha demurrer.
on november,the court sustained without leave to amend the wilkinses demurrer to tepper complaint,ruling tepper did not allege facts showing she has standing to assert the financial elder abuse claim on behalf of eileen wilkins.after this court advised her counsel that an order sustaining a demurrer was not an appealable order,tepper obtained an order dismissing her complaint with prejudice and judgment was entered for the defendants on february.
