this case requires us to resolve an issue involving the notification provision of the veterans claims assistance act of,pub,a,stat.vcaa,codified at a.based on various communications between the department of veterans affairs va and the,the board of veterans appeals held that the va had satisfied its obligations under the notification provision.the court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court affirmed the board decision,but it did so based on a communication other than the ones the board relied on.mayfield nicholson.we hold that it was improper for the veterans court to affirm the board based on the court analysis of a communication not relied on by the board.we therefore reverse the court order and remand for further proceedings.
estey mayfield,a veteran who served in the army during the second world war,was awarded service connection and a percent disability rating in for a injury and varicosities of both legs.he died in of congestive heart failure due to coronary artery disease.following mayfield death,his widow lizzie mayfield filed a claim for dependency and indemnity compensation dic.in order for her to be eligible for dic benefits,mayfield death had to be the result of a disability.see a.mayfield alleged that the required causation was established because mayfield veins were in such poor condition that he was unable to undergo a bypass operation to treat his coronary artery disease.
a va regional office denied mayfield dic claim on the ground that the evidence failed to establish any causal relationship between mayfield military service and his death.mayfield filed a notice of disagreement with the regional office decision,and in june the regional office issued a statement of the case soc in which the regional office noted that n o medical evidence has been presented which provides a link between the veteran varicose vein condition and his death.mayfield then filed an appeal with the board.
in december,the board remanded mayfield claim to the regional office for readjudication in light of the recently enacted vcaa.the board held that a remand was necessary for the va to comply with the notice and requirements of the new law.in particular,the board directed the regional office to ensure that the new notification requirements and development procedures contained in sections and of the act to be codified as amended at,and are fully complied with and satisfied.after doing so,the board directed,the regional office should readjudicate the issue on appeal,and if the benefit sought on appeal remains denied,mayfield and her representative should be provided with a supplemental statement of the case.
on remand,the regional office sent mayfield a letter dated december,in which it asked that she identify all va and health care providers who have treated the veteran subsequent to service,and particularly any medical treatment rendered to the veteran during the period immediately preceding his death.in response,she submitted forms authorizing mayfield physicians to release his medical records and requesting that the physicians submit any medical evidence relating to his heart condition and his varicose veins,and in particular any and all medical evidence which would help establish that he could not undergo treatment for his heart condition because of the severe varicosities of the lower extremities.
on march,the regional office sent mayfield a letter that presumably was intended to serve as the notice required by the vcaa.the letter informed her of the va duty to explain what information or evidence the va needed to grant the benefit she wanted and its duty to assist her in obtaining that information or evidence.the letter then set forth the three requirements that must be satisfied to establish entitlement to death benefits the cause of death an injury,disease or event in service and a relationship between the cause of death and injury,disease,or event in service.the letter further explained what had been done to assist her with her claim and what information or evidence the va still needed from mayfield.
mayfield responded that she would like a medical opinion on the likelihood that her husband condition of varicose veins may have contributed to the cause of his death.after the va obtained mayfield medical records from several sources,a va physician concluded that it was likely that mayfield death was related to his longstanding smoking and hypertension and that it was not likely that his varicose veins had any effect on the cause of death.in january,the regional office advised mayfield that it was continuing to deny her request for benefits,and it issued a supplemental statement of the case explaining the reasons for its decision denying service connection for the cause of mayfield death.
the case was then returned to the board,which sustained the regional office decision denying service connection for the cause of death.with respect to the duty to notify and assist imposed by the vcaa,the board found that the va had satisfied those duties in mayfield case.in discussing that issue,the board made no reference to the march,letter to mayfield,but instead concluded that the duty of notification was satisfied by the combined contents of three documents that had been sent to mayfield the december rating decision that explained the reasons for the denial of mayfield claim,the june statement of the case,and the january supplemental statement of the case,which provided mayfield with what the board characterized as the applicable law and regulations pertaining to service connection for the cause of the veteran death.
mayfield then appealed to the veterans court.in a order issued in march,the court vacated the board decision and remanded the matter for readjudication.the court noted that although the board stated that mayfield and her representative had been advised of the information and evidence necessary to substantiate her claim,there was no evidence in the record that the va had complied with the regulation implementing the vcaa notification requirement,and in particular the requirement that the va request that the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant possession that pertains to the claim,id.b.because the claimant has not had the opportunity to benefit from and react to the notice that the secretary was and is obligated to provide,the court ruled that any conclusion by this court that the appellant is not prejudiced would be pure speculation.accordingly,having taken due account of the rule of prejudicial error b,the court remanded the matter for further proceedings.
the va moved for reconsideration or panel review of the order.the va first argued that the court had overlooked the portion of the march letter to mayfield that advised her that she should submit any additional evidence that supports your claim for service connection for the cause of your husband death,and specified the kinds of evidence that she should submit.that language,the va argued,was sufficient to fulfill the requirement that the va request that the claimant provide any evidence in her possession that pertains to the claim.second,the va argued that the court had failed to take account of the harmless error rule,because it had not required mayfield to show that if the va had provided the requisite notice,the outcome below would have been different.
the veterans court denied the motion for reconsideration of the order,but it granted the motion for a panel decision.the panel then issued a lengthy opinion that withdrew the order and affirmed the decision of the board.the court noted that the board had not relied on the march,letter as the basis for its conclusion that the va had satisfied its obligations under the vcaa.nonetheless,the court looked to that letter and concluded that the va had fulfilled its obligations under the statutory notice requirement in a and had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the regulatory notice requirement in b.the court also concluded that mayfield had failed to make a plausible showing that any error by the board was prejudicial,and that she had therefore failed to demonstrate that the board erred in finding that the va fulfilled its statutory obligations in her case.mayfield then appealed to this court.
mayfield first argues that the language of requires the va to provide a claimant with a single notice containing all the information referred to in the statute.she contends that there is no authority in the statute permitting the board of veterans affairs or the veterans court to combine,cobble together,or aggregate various va notices issued over a period of years to support a conclusion that the va provided the claimant with adequate vcaa notice.for that reason,she contends that it was legal error for the board to look to the information provided in three separate december regional office decision,the june statement of the case,and the january supplemental statement of the the basis for finding that the va had satisfied the notification duty imposed by section a.
we agree with mayfield that it was improper for the board to conclude that the va notification duty was satisfied by the notice of decision and the two statements of the case that it sent to her between and.section a,as amended by the vcaa,provides as follows 
upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application,the secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant representative,if any,of any information,and any medical or lay evidence,not previously provided to the secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.as part of that notice,the secretary shall indicate which portion of that information and evidence,if any,is to be provided by the claimant and which portion,if any,the secretary,in accordance with section of this title and any other applicable provisions of law,will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.
a.subsection b of section provides that information or evidence to be provided by the claimant must be received by the secretary within one year from the date of such notice.id.b the va has promulgated a regulation that effectuates the notification duty of section.it largely parallels the provisions of section a,but adds that va will also request that the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant possession that pertains to the claim.b 
the purpose of the statute and the corresponding regulation is to require that the va provide affirmative notification to the claimant prior to the initial decision in the case as to the evidence that is needed and who shall be responsible for providing it.see paralyzed veterans of am.sec y of veterans affairs,fed.reg.that duty of affirmative notification is not satisfied by various communications from which a claimant might have been able to infer what evidence the va found lacking in the claimant presentation.the text of section b,which refers to the period from the date of such notice,confirms that congress envisioned a deliberate act of notification directed to meeting the requirements of section,not an assemblage of bits of information drawn from multiple communications issued for unrelated purposes.
documents such as the notice of decision,the statement of the case,and the supplemental statement of the case that were sent to mayfield were required by and to advise the claimant of the decision rendered on the claim and to facilitate review of that decision.the va obligation to provide those communications to the claimant long predated the vcaa.unlike sections and,the version of section requires the vcaa notification to be issued prior to the initial decision on the claim,not afterwards.moreover,the vcaa notification is required to have different contents from the notices,and it is designed for different ensure that the claimant case is presented to the initial decisionmaker with whatever support is available,and to ensure that the claimant understands what evidence will be obtained by the va and what evidence must be provided by the claimant.the notice of decision and the two statements of the case did not contain any of the information expressly required by the vcaa notification provision,nor did they provide that information to mayfield prior to the va decision on her claim.
this is not to say that vcaa notification must always be contained in a single communication from the.the statute and regulation are silent regarding the format to be used for the required notification.what the statute and regulation require is that the claimant be given the required information prior to the va decision on the claim and in a form that enables the claimant to understand the process,the information that is needed,and who will be responsible for obtaining that information.
to be sure,the fact that the vcaa was enacted after the regional office initial decision in this case made strict compliance with the timing aspect of the amended version of section impossible.the timing problem,however,was cured by the board remand following the enactment of the vcaa for a new vcaa notification followed by readjudication of mayfield claim.in light of that remedial measure,the va could have substantially complied with the vcaa by issuing a fully compliant section notification before readjudicating mayfield claim.
in its decision,following the remand and the readjudication by the regional office,the board found that the va had satisfied the notification requirements of the vcaa.yet it based that finding not on a predecisional vcaa notification,but on the three communications with notice of decision and the and statements of the case.those notices did not advise mayfield of the information needed to substantiate her claim,nor did they indicate what information the va would provide and what information she would be responsible for obtaining.indeed,one of the three communications,the supplemental statement of the case,even postdated the va readjudication decision in january and therefore was not a predecisional communication even with respect to the readjudication decision.
significantly,the veterans court did not rely on the notice of decision and the two subsequent statements of the case to hold that the notification requirement of section was satisfied.instead,the court looked to the march,letter to mayfield as the basis for its decision that the notification requirement had been satisfied.the court acknowledged that the board decision on the notification issue was not based on the march,letter.in fact,the court pointedly stated that the board had inexplicably made no reference to that letter.
the problem with the court decision is that it violates the longstanding principle of administrative law that a court reviewing an agency decision generally may not sustain the agency ruling on a ground different from that invoked by the agency.see sec.exch.comm chenery.the grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based.sec.exch.comm chenery.a reviewing court,in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make,must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.if those grounds are inadequate or improper,the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.bivings dep t of,a court can not affirm the agency on a theory that,although supported by the record,was not the basis for the agency ruling.by sustaining the board determination that the notification requirement had been satisfied,but basing its ruling on an entirely different ground,the court violated those principles.the board decision was based on an incorrect understanding of the law,specifically that the vcaa statute and regulation permitted compliance through a combination of unrelated pre and communications,and the result under the correct understanding of the law is not a foreordained conclusion.as such,the veterans court should have remanded the case to the board.
citing fleshman west,the government first argues that this case does not present a chenery problem because there was no dispute as to many of the relevant facts in this case.it emphasizes that mayfield does not dispute the contents of the march,letter or the fact that she received it.the governme
