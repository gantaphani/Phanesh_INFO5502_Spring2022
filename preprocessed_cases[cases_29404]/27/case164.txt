discussion 
elder abuse enhancement 
appellants were charged with murder.as to that charge,it was alleged within the meaning of section,subdivision b a,that the victim was elderly and appellants caused his death.adams was convicted of second degree murder and peterson was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.the section,subdivision b a,allegation was found true as to both appellants.adams was sentenced to an indeterminate term of years to life plus years for the section,subdivision b a,enhancement.peterson was sentenced to the midterm of three years on the involuntary manslaughter conviction plus five years for the enhancement.
appellants argued the evidence was insufficient to support a true finding on the enhancement.we asked the parties to brief the more fundamental question of whether a section,subdivision b a,enhancement is applicable to a charge of murder or manslaughter or is applicable only to the crime of elder abuse as defined in section,subdivision b.we conclude the enhancement is applicable only to the latter offense
