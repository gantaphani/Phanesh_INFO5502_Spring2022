background 
in september hartley filed a complaint for damages against monex deposit company and numerous associated companies and individuals collectively,monex the complaint alleges ruth is an elderly widow.her husband,millard hartley millard,who died in,had handled all their finances.millard had opened an account with monex,a precious metals dealer.after millard death,hartley invested with monex,signing standard form contracts titled atlas account agreements hereafter account agreements,which included a purchase and sale agreement purchase agreement and loan,security and storage agreement loan agreement,both of which contained an arbitration clause.hartley lost more than by following the advice of a monex account executive to purchase silver on margin.the agent concealed the risks of investing in volatile precious metals on margin.
the complaint includes claims for breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,fraud,elder abuse and other statutory violations,and for injunctive relief under the consumers legal remedies act,et.the complaint also seeks declaratory relief as to whether certain disclaimers in the account agreements,and the arbitration clauses of the agreements,are unconscionable and unenforceable.
monex petitioned to compel arbitration.hartley opposed,arguing monex had the greater bargaining power,the arbitration clause is a contract of adhesion,and it is oppressive.a week after hartley signed an account agreement that did not contain an arbitration clause,monex required her to sign a new account agreement,which added an arbitration clause,on the guise the original agreement was outdated.the contracts looked virtually alike,and the arbitration clause in the new agreement was in fine print type.hartley complained that arbitration before judicial arbitration and mediation services jams would be prohibitively costly to her given the hourly rates charged by retired judges.further,she argued the arbitration clause unfairly provides that a party requesting a panel pay the entire cost of the panel,whereas the parties split the cost of a single arbitrator allows an appeal only when one arbitrator is used prohibits punitive damages,damages for statutory violations and award of attorney fees and prohibits class actions and joinder or consolidation,and waives any customer reliance on federal or state judicial opinions denying enforcement of arbitration under such circumstances.
the court granted monex petition to compel.the court determined the arbitration clause requires the arbitrator,rather than the court,to determine the issue of arbitrability.the court cited the united states supreme court opinion in rent a center,west,jackson.rent a center.
discussion 
ilegal principles 
a threshold dispute as to whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable is ordinarily for the court decision rather than the arbitrator.in discovery bank superior court cal th,disapproved on another point in at t mobility llc concepcion,our high court explained t he question whether grounds exist for the revocation of the arbitration agreement code civ,based on grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract,is for the courts to decide,not an arbitrator.citation.this includes the determination of whether arbitration agreements or portions thereof are deemed to be unconscionable or contrary to public policy.
in federal cases,the united states supreme court has held that although the issue of arbitrability is usually for judicial determination,under contract principles the parties may reserve the issue for the arbitrator exclusive determination,but only by clear and unmistakable evidence.at t technologies,communication workers of america,at t howsam dean witter reynolds,howsam first options of chicago,kaplan,first options rent a center,supra.
here,the trial court relied on rent a center,a case under the federal arbitration act faa,in which the court designated the clear and unmistakable test as a heightened standard.rent a center,supra.at,fn.in rent a center,the parties contract delegated to the arbitrator exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the enforceability of this agreement including,but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable.id.at.the parties there agreed this provision met the heightened standard.id.at,fn.the court explained the clear and unmistakable requirement pertains to the parties manifestation of intent as to who will decide the gateway issue of arbitrability,not the agreement validity.i t is an interpretative rule,based on an assumption about the parties expectations.in circumstance s where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter,citation,we assume that is what they agreed to.thus,u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator,citing at t,supra,at.
several california courts have followed this line of supreme court opinions.in rodriquez american technologies,th,the court explained although the scope of an arbitration clause is generally a question for judicial determination,the parties may,by clear and unmistakable evidence,elect to have the arbitrator,rather than the court,decide which grievances are arbitrable.italics added,citing at t,supra.in greenspan ladt,llc th,the court similarly held the contracting parties may reserve to the arbitrator the exclusive authority to determine gateway issues of arbitrability,such as unconscionability,but only if there is clear and unmistakable evidence of such an agreement.the court cautioned that a contract silence or ambiguity about the arbitrator power in this regard can not satisfy the clear and unmistakable evidence standard.id.at,citing first options,supra,at see also,dream theater,dream theater th,dream theater murphy check n go of california,th,murphy bruni didion th.
in first options,the court acknowledged that the issue of who may determine gateway issues to arbitration is rather arcane.a party often might not focus upon that question or upon the significance of having arbitrators decide the scope of their own powers.citations.and,given the principle that a party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration,one can understand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity on the who should decide arbitrability point as giving the arbitrators that power,for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge,not an aribtrator,would decide.first options,supra,at.
in parada superior court th,parada,
an action by investors against monex for fraud and other counts,the parties differed as to whether under california law,contracting parties can agree to have the arbitrator decide unconscionability.relying on discovery bank superior court,supra,cal th at page,the petitioners argued unconscionability must always be decided by the court,notwithstanding the parties agreement otherwise.if the party resisting arbitration is claiming the arbitration clause is unconscionable,a court must decide this claim.parada,supra,at.
the parada court acknowledged that other california courts have held the contracting parties can deviate from the general rule that the court decides gateway issues of arbitrability.parada,supra,th at,citing murphy,supra,th at bruni didion,supra,th at.the parada court declined to weigh in on the issue,because it could decide the appeal on another ground even if california law permits parties to contract away their right to have the court decide the issue of arbitrability,the contract at issue did not clearly and unmistakably reserve the issue to the arbitrator.parada,at,citing howsam,supra,at first options,supra,at.the court noted to permit the arbitrator to decide the issue of arbitrability,even if the contract so provides,raises issues we need not reach in this case.one such issue that particularly concerns us is whether having the arbitrator decide the issue of arbitrability presents the arbitrator with a conflict of interest.parada,at.
hartley urges us to hold the rent a center line of federal cases is inapplicable under state law.our high court has not yet determined whether state law allows parties to delegate gateway issues such as unconscionability to the arbitrator.sonic calabasas a,moreno cal th,fn.as in parada,supra,th,we are not required to reach the issue because we agree that even if state and federal law agree on the point,the court order here is erroneous because the account agreements do not clearly and unmistakably show they agreed to give the arbitrator the exclusive power to decide the gateway issue of arbitrability.rather,the contract language conflicts on the issue of who is to decide arbitrability and creates ambiguity.
paragraph a of the purchase agreement provides arbitration of claims.the parties agree that any and all disputes,claims or controversies arising out of or relating to any transaction between them or to the breach,termination,enforcement,interpretation or validity of this agreement,including the determination of the scope and applicability of this agreement to arbitrate,shall be subject to the terms of the faa and shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before jams,or its successor,in orange county,california,in accordance with the laws of the state of california for agreements made in and to be performed in california.italics added.
paragraph d of the purchase agreement provides that arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of jams comprehensive arbitration rules and procedures in effect at the time of filing the demand for arbitration.the paragraph advises the customer that he or she can obtain a copy of jams rules on its internet web site.
rule c of jams rules stated at the relevant time jurisdictional and arbitrability disputes,including disputes over the formation,existence,validity,interpretation or scope of the agreement under which arbitration is sought,shall be submitted to and ruled on by the arbitrator.the arbitrator has the authority to determine jurisdiction and arbitrability issues as a preliminary matter.ordinarily,the parties agreement to arbitrate in accordance with such a rule is clear and unmistakable evidence of the intent that the arbitrator will decide whether a c ontested c laim is arbitrable.dream theater,supra,th at.
paragraph h of the purchase agreement,however,provides no waiver of any right to provisional or injunctive relief.nothing contained in this agreement shall in any way deprive a party of its right to obtain provisional,injunctive,or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction,pending dispute resolution and arbitration.for purposes of any proceeding for provisional,injunctive or other equitable relief,the parties consent to the jurisdiction of,and venue in,the courts of the state of california and the united states district court,located in orange county,california.italics added.paragraph of the parties loan agreement contains the same provision.
a claim that a contract is unenforceable on the ground of unconscionability is an equitable matter.that equity does not enforce unconscionable bargains is too well established to require elaborate citation.walnut producers of california diamond foods,th,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.under both federal and california law,arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the voiding of any contract.citation.unconscionability is a recognized contract defense which can defeat an arbitration agreement.arguelles romero superior court th,italics added.
further,paragraph of the purchase agreement provides 
severability.in the event that any provision of this agreement shall be determined by a trier of fact of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction,the remainder of this agreement shall remain binding italics added.
in parada,the court held that read together,an arbitration provision and a severability provision in monex account agreements that were similar to the ones quoted above,created an ambiguity as to who may determine unconscionability,and the ambiguity foreclosed monex argument that the issue was for the arbitrator determination.parada,supra,th at.as to the severability clause,the court explained,use of the term trier of fact of competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration panel or panel of three e arbitrators suggests the trial court also may find a provision,including the arbitration provision,unenforceable.id.at.
here,likewise,the account agreements do not meet the heightened standard that must be satisfied to vary from the general rule that the court decides the gateway issue of arbitrability.the severability clause here uses the term trier of fact of competent jurisdiction,rather than the term arbitrator,indicating the court has authority to decide whether an arbitration provision is unenforceable.as in parada,although one provision of the arbitration agreement stated that issues of enforceability or voidability were to be decided by the arbitrator,another provision indicated that the court might find a provision unenforceable.parada,supra,th at,citing baker osbourne development th.further,one paragraph of the arbitration clause here authorizes the court to decide all equitable issues,notwithstanding another paragraph that authorizes the arbitrator to decide all disputes.when an agreement is ambiguous,the court and not the arbitrator should decide arbitrability so as not to force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably thought a judge,not an arbitrator,would decide.dream theater,supra,th at,citing first options,supra,at.we construe ambiguities against monex as the drafting party.hunt superior court th.
we conclude hartley is entitled to a judicial declaration of whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable,as requested in the complaint twentieth count we also conclude that should the court find in favor of monex on the issue of arbitrability,hartley is entitled to a judicial declaration of whether certain contract disclaimers in the account agreements are unconscionable or in violation of public policy,as requested in the complaint nineteenth count,and to a court decision on the complaint eleventh count for injunctive relief under the consumers legal remedies act,et.declaratory relief and injunctive relief are equitable remedies in re claudia th,harvard westlake school th,reserved to the court under paragraph h of the purchase agreement and paragraph of the loan agreement.
monex submits that hartley forfeited the issue of contract ambiguity by failing to raise it at the trial court.monex asserts it was prejudiced because it lacked the opportunity to present parol evidence of the parties intent to explain ambiguities in the account agreements.we are unpersuaded.
generally,in a motion to compel,the petitioner bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the evidence,and a party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,engalla.when,however,as here,the assertion by the claimant is that the parties excluded from court determination not merely the decision of the merits of the grievance but also the question of its arbitrability,vesting power to make both decisions in the arbitrator,the claimant must bear the burden of a clear demonstration of that purpose.united steelworkers of america warrior gulf navigaton,fn.warrior gulf,italics added gilbert street developers,llc la quinta homes,llc th,fn.gilbert street general motors pamela equities cir,gonski second judicial dist.court of state ex
