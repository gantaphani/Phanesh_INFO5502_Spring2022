respondents beverly wellner and janis clark the wife and daughter,respectively,of joe wellner and olive clark each held a power of attorney affording her broad authority to manage her family member affairs.when joe and olive moved into a nursing home operated by petitioner kindred nursing centers,beverly and janis used their powers of attorney to complete all necessary paperwork.as part of that process,each signed an arbitration agreement on her relative behalf providing that any claims arising from the relative stay at the facility would be resolved through binding arbitration.after joe and olive died,their estates represented by beverly and janis filed suits alleging that kindred substandard care had caused their deaths.kindred moved to dismiss the cases,arguing that the arbitration agreements prohibited bringing the disputes to court.the trial court denied kindred motions,and the kentucky court of appeals agreed that the suits could go forward.
the kentucky supreme court consolidated the cases and affirmed.the court initially found that the language of the wellner power of attorney did not permit beverly to enter into an arbitration agreement on joe behalf,but that the clark document gave janis the capacity to do so on behalf of olive.nonetheless,the court held,both arbitration agreements were invalid because neither power of attorney specifically entitled the representative to enter into an arbitration agreement.because the kentucky constitution declares the rights of access to the courts and trial by jury to be sacred and inviolate,the court determined,an agent could deprive her principal of such rights only if expressly provided in the power of attorney.
held the kentucky supreme court rule violates the federal arbitration act by singling out arbitration agreements for disfavored treatment.
a the faa,which makes arbitration agreements valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,establishes an principle a court may invalidate an arbitration agreement based on generally applicable contract defenses,but not on legal rules that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue,mobility llc concepcion.the act thus preempts any state rule that discriminates on its face against arbitration or that covertly accomplishes the same objective by disfavoring contracts that have the defining features of arbitration agreements.

c because the kentucky supreme court invalidated the arbitration agreement based exclusively on the rule,the court must now enforce that agreement.but because it is unclear whether the court interpretation of the wellner document was wholly independent of its rule,the court should determine on remand whether it adheres,in the absence of the rule,to its prior reading of that power of attorney.
