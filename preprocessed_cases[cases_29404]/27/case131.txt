this is a negligence action against a nurse and,vicariously,the hospital that employed the nurse.plaintiff carl massey was a postoperative patient who sustained injury after falling from a walker.the nurse had placed plaintiff on the walker and then left him unattended.
we conclude that the question of the nurse alleged negligence for the fall poses a question of common knowledge,and therefore does not require expert opinion testimony.consequently,we shall reverse that part of the trial court judgment that concluded otherwise and that dismissed the negligence action after plaintiff made his opening statement.we shall affirm that part of the judgment that denied plaintiff attempt to amend his complaint to add causes of action for battery,fraud and elder abuse.
factual and procedural background 
besides concluding that the issue of the nurse alleged negligence regarding plaintiff fall required expert opinion testimony,the trial court found plaintiff expert unqualified on this issue.with plaintiff lacking the required expert,defendants ken,a registered nurse,and his employer,mercy medical center redding hereafter or nurse and mercy,respectively moved successfully for nonsuit after plaintiff opening statement,and the case was dismissed 
plaintiff opening statement specified the following evidence,which we must fully credit because we are reviewing a successful defense motion for nonsuit that precluded plaintiff from presenting his case to the jury for decision.carson facilities development cal d,carson.we will cover the highlights of this evidence now,and detail it when we discuss the negligence cause of action in part of the discussion below 
plaintiff,who was then years of age,underwent bifemoral bypass surgery on march,to improve circulation in his legs.this procedure involved making incisions in plaintiff abdomen and groin.
after plaintiff surgery,nurses caring for him including defendant noted that he was a substantial fall risk and placed him on a fall prevention protocol that included a walker and assistance.
on the evening of march,plaintiff used his call light to summon a nurse to help him go to the bathroom.nurse arrived,set plaintiff on the walker,and then told plaintiff he had to go do something and would be right back.when right back became minutes,plaintiff lost patience and tried to move on his own with the walker.he fell and suffered a compression fracture to his back.
based on this evidence,plaintiff sued and employer,mercy,for ordinary negligence.subsequently,plaintiff moved to amend his complaint to allege medical negligence based on this same evidence and to allege battery,fraud,and elder abuse based on injecting plaintiff,about four hours after plaintiff was found to have fallen,with morphine sulfate without a valid prescription and without informed consent.
the trial court allowed the medical negligence cause of action to replace the action for ordinary negligence,but denied the addition of the battery,fraud and elder abuse counts.see flowers torrance memorial hospital medical center cal th,d,flowers substantively,ordinary and professional negligence comprise just one form of action.it was this medical negligence cause of action on which plaintiff gave his opening statement and on which the trial court granted the defense motion for nonsuit.
discussion 
the issues 
on appeal,plaintiff raises three issues.he contends the trial court erroneously required expert opinion testimony to establish negligence concerning his fall found his expert unqualified on this issue and denied his motion to amend his complaint to allege causes of action for battery,fraud,and elder abuse.we agree with plaintiff regarding his first contention,rendering his second contention moot expert opinion testimony is not required to establish negligence for plaintiff fall.as for plaintiff third contention,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion.
i and ii.the issue of expert testimony involving plaintiff fall and the disqualification of plaintiff expert 
generally,negligence is the failure to exercise the care a reasonable person would exercise under the circumstances.delaney baker cal th,d,delaney.medical negligence is one type of negligence,to which general negligence principles apply.flowers,supra,cal th at,d.
accordingly,a nurse is negligent if he or she fails to meet the standard of is,fails to use the level of skill,knowledge,and care that a reasonably careful nurse would use in similar circumstances.alef alta bates hospital th,d alef caci.
the standard of care against which the acts of a medical practitioner including a nurse are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of experts it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be proved by their testimony,unless the conduct required by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of laymen.alef,supra,th at,d.in other words,expert opinion testimony is required to prove that a defendant nurse did not meet the standard of care and therefore was negligent,except in cases where the negligence is obvious to laymen.kelley trunk th,d.
we think the alleged negligence concerning plaintiff fall is within the common knowledge of laymen,and therefore expert opinion testimony is not required to determine the culpability of nurse.
as shown by the evidence set forth in plaintiff opening statement,at the time of his fall,plaintiff was a man who,just a few days before,had undergone a surgery to improve the femoral artery circulation in his legs.this surgery involved cutting open plaintiff abdomen and making tunnels in his groin and then threading tubes from his aorta through the tunnels to his leg arteries.
nurses caring for plaintiff following the surgery including defendant noted plaintiff scored on the morse fall scale this scale is a standardized fall assessment that is scored from zero to based on common sense criteria any score over is deemed a fall risk plaintiff was placed on a fall prevention protocol his bed rails were placed up he was to use a walker and assistance to ambulate the walker was apparently placed across the room and to be obtained by a nurse and his gait was weak.along similar lines,plaintiff physical therapist noted that plaintiff needed to be assisted in walking,and that on the day before plaintiff fell march,he had walked about feet with assistance or supervision with his walker.
on the night of his fall,plaintiff used his call light around to summon a nurse to help him go to the bathroom.nurse responded.obtained the walker from the corner of the room,lowered plaintiff bed railings,assisted plaintiff out of bed,and set plaintiff upon the walker.then told plaintiff that he had to go do something and would be right back.plaintiff stood for about minutes while waiting on the walker.losing patience,plaintiff tried to move on his own.he attempted a step forward,lost his balance,and fell backwards against the wall and floor of his room,hitting his back,head and behind as he crumpled onto the floor.apparently,he was not discovered for nearly two hours.he suffered a compression fracture to his back at.
we think the alleged negligence standard of care and breach involving nurse conduct as to plaintiff fall is within the sphere of common knowledge and obvious to laymen insufficiently attending to a patient who needed assistance to walk short distances with a walker.
the fall in the present case falls squarely on the legal turf of stevenson alta bates,d,stevenson,because the mishaps in the two cases are quite similar.in stevenson,the court held that the common knowledge exception applied to a negligence action against a nurse and the nurse hospital employer.id.at.the patient in stevenson,after partially recovering from a paralyzing stroke to her left side,was being assisted in walking by a nurse on each side of her and by a cane she held in her right hand.the patient fell when the nurse released the patient arm to prepare the chair for the patient to sit in.ibid.the patient recuperative status at the time of her fall was that she could stand and walk short distances with the assistance of one person and her cane.ibid.on these facts
