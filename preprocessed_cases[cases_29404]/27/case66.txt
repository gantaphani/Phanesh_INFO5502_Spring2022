under the older workers benefit protection act owbpa,employees may not waive rights or claims arising under the age discrimination in employment act adea unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary.f.to qualify as knowing and voluntary,a waiver included in an agreement between an employer and its employees must,among other things,be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average employee eligible to participate in the agreement.id.f a.this appeal presents the question whether a waiver form used by international business machines ibm in connection with a severance benefit package meets that standard.we hold that it does not and was therefore not knowing and voluntary.id.f.
in january,ibm began a reduction in its workforce.as part of its workforce reduction plan,ibm offered each employee selected for termination severance pay and certain benefits in exchange for signing a document entitled microelectronics resource action mera general release and covenant not to sue mera agreement along with the mera agreement,ibm issued each selected employee a lengthy document entitled microelectronics division resource action employee information package information package,which details the job titles,ages,and numbers of those employees selected and those not selected for termination from various ibm divisions.
appellants the employees are former ibm employees,each of whom signed the mera agreement,or a similar agreement,receiving in return severance pay and benefits.based on the data contained in the information package,these employees filed charges of age discrimination with various state authorities and with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc dismissed all charges,issuing each employee a notice of right to sue along with a letter stating that the language of the mera agreement satisfies the owbpa minimum requirements for knowing and voluntary waiver of adea rights and claims and is enforceable,thus depriving the employees of their right to pursue their age discrimination claims.the employees then filed this putative collective action in federal court alleging that the mera agreement violates the waiver requirements of the owbpa and that ibm layoff program constitutes age discrimination in violation of the adea the employees owbpa cause of action challenged the mera agreement use of both a release covering adea claims and a covenant not to sue excepting them,the pairing of which allegedly caused confusion over whether adea claims were excepted from the release.
ibm filed a counterclaim seeking relief for the plaintiffs employees breach of the agreements and,predicated thereon,a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
the district court entered an order granting ibm motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.the parties then stipulated to entry of judgment holding the employees jointly and severally liable on ibm counterclaim and awarding ibm.
in dismissing the employees claims,the district court determined that the mera agreement was written in a manner calculated to be understood by an average individual selected by ibm for employment termination,and was knowing and voluntary under the owbpa.in so holding,the district court cited to thomforde international business machines,d thomforde i,a single plaintiff action against ibm,in which the minnesota district court found on summary judgment that an ibm contract,the server group resource action sgra general release and covenant not to sue sgra agreement for present purposes,identical to the mera the owbpa requirement that waiver of any adea right or claim be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average individual.see id.at.the employees here now appeal the dismissal of their case.
after this appeal was fully briefed but before oral argument,the eighth circuit reversed the minnesota district court grant of summary judgment in favor of ibm,holding that the sgra agreement is not written in a manner calculated to be understood by the intended participants as required by the owbpa.thomforde int l bus.machs,cir thomforde ii the employees maintain that under the doctrine of offensive nonmutual issue preclusion,the eighth circuit ruling is preclusive of an independent determination by this court of the waiver issue and alternatively,that the mera agreement does not satisfy the owbpa manner calculated requirement.

added as a collection of discrete amendments to the age discrimination in employment act adea in,the older workers benefit protection act owbpa.codified at,imposes,in relevant part,mandatory requirements for waivers of adea rights and claims,see f,to ensure that older workers are not coerced or manipulated into waiving their rights to seek legal relief under the adea,see,at,as reprinted in,see also oubre entergy operations,d the owbpa is designed to protect the rights and benefits of older workers.the owbpa implements congress policy via a strict,unqualified statutory stricture on waivers.under the owbpa,a n employee may not waive an adea claim unless the employer complies with the statute.oubre,at.to this end,t he owbpa sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of adea waivers,separate and apart from contract law and creates a series of for knowing and voluntary waivers.id.
section f,part of the owbpa,sets forth specific requirements for a knowing and voluntary waiver of primary importance here is the requirement that a waiver be part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be understood by the individual,or by the average individual eligible to participate in a workforce reduction plan.f a also relevant to this case is the requirement that the selected employee or employees be advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement.id.f e.when a dispute arises over whether the requirements of f are met,the party asserting the validity of the waiver bears the burden of proof.id.f.
to satisfy the manner calculated requirement,w aiver agreements must be drafted in plain language geared to the level of understanding of the individual party to the agreement or individuals eligible to participate in a group termination plan.b.employers are thus instructed to take into account such factors as the level of comprehension and education of typical participants.id.these considerations usually will require the limitation or elimination of technical jargon and of long,complex sentences.id 
as developed in greater detail below,the employees dispute,as they did before the district court,whether the mera agreement satisfies the manner calculated requirement of f a.
in thomforde ii,the eighth circuit considered the precise question we are asked to determine here,holding that the release of claims signed by thomforde as part of ibm involuntary termination program did not satisfy the statutory waiver requirements of the owbpa,f.at.in addition to parsing the language of the sgra agreement,the court noted in its recitation of facts that 
prior to signing the agreement,thomforde asked his supervisor,andrew schram,if the exception for adea claims contained in the covenant not to sue meant that he could sue ibm if the case was limited to claims under the adea.schram told thomforde that he would contact ibm legal department.
schram later sent thomforde an stating regarding your question on the general release and covenant not to sue,the wording is as intended by ibm.the site attorney was not comfortable providing an interpretation for you and suggested you consult with your own attorney.after meeting with his attorney to review the agreement,thomforde concluded that he could sign the agreement and still pursue his claims of age discrimination as long as they were limited to adea claims.
id.at citation omitted.the thomforde ii panel concluded that g iven the lack of clarity in the agreement,and ibm declination to tell thomforde what it meant by the language,we hold that the agreement is not written in a manner calculated to be understood by the intended participants as required by the owbpa.id.at emphasis added.
seeking to capitalize on thomforde ii,the employees argue for the application of offensive nonmutual issue preclusion which prevents a defendant from relitigating the issues which a defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff.parklane hosiery shore,d see state of idaho potato comm g t terminal packaging,cir noting that offensive,as opposed to defensive,nonmutual issue preclusion involves a plaintiff seek ing to prevent a defendant from relitigating an issue that the defendant previously litigated unsuccessfully against a different party.in parklane hosiery,the supreme court sanctioned the use of offensive nonmutual issue preclusion and granted to trial courts broad discretion to determine when it should be applied.at.
we have since specified that the application of offensive nonmutual issue preclusion is appropriate only if there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the identical issue in the prior action,see fund for animals,lujan,cir resolution trust keating,cir appling state farm mut.auto.ins,cir the issue was actually litigated in the prior action,see appling,at the issue was decided in a final judgment,see resolution trust,at and the party against whom issue preclusion is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior action,see id.see also reyn pasta bella,llc visa usa,cir setting out standard robi five platters,cir same restatement second of judgments cmt.j same.
the supreme court grant of broad discretion to trial courts provides those courts the authority to take potential shortcomings or indices of unfairness into account when considering whether to apply offensive nonmutual issue preclusion,even where the standard prerequisites are met.see parklane hosiery,at.appling,at.the potential shortcomings or indices of unfairness identified by the court include whether the plaintiff had the incentive to adopt a wait and see attitude in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff would result in a favorable judgment which might then be used against the losing defendant the defendant had the incentive to defend the first suit with full vigor,especially when future suits are not foreseeable one or more judgments entered before the one invoked as preclusive are inconsistent with the latter or each other,suggesting that reliance on a single adverse judgment would be unfair and,the defendant might be afforded procedural opportunities in the later action that were unavailable in the first and that could readily cause a different result.parklane hosiery,at.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure hereinafter fed.prac.proc.discussing limitations on nonmutual issue preclusion.it is against this backdrop of concerns that we consider the employees assertion that thomforde ii controls our decision in this appeal.
ibm takes the position that thomforde ii should not have preclusive effect because the decision in thomforde ii is not final there were prior inconsistent judgments there is a salient difference between the thomforde action,a single plaintiff action,and the case before us,a putative collective action and the issue addressed in thomforde ii is not identical to the one raised in this appeal.
we do not adopt ibm first three contentions.first,contrary to ibm assertion that the district court in thomforde may still consider whether,based on the actual evidence and not just the plaintiff allegations,the w aiver is valid under the owbpa,the eighth circuit opinion leaves no room for such reconsideration by the district court.see thomforde ii,at stating that the release of claims signed by thomforde as part of ibm involuntary program did not satisfy the statutory waiver requirements of the owbpa.the eighth circuit decision on the waiver question is thus sufficiently final even though there are to be further proceedings on remand on the merits of the adea action.see luben,united states,cir to be final for issue preclusion purposes,a decision need not possess finality in the sense of.instead,the proper query here is whether the court decision on the issue as to which preclusion is sought is final.it is.see lummus commonwealth oil refining,cir friendly,explaining that f inality in the context of issue preclusion may mean little more than that the litigation of a particular issue has reached such a stage that a court sees no really good reason for permitting it to be litigated again see also fed.prac.proc.i ssue preclusion has been applied to matters resolved by preliminary rulings or to determinations of liability that have not yet been completed by an award of damages or other relief.the most prominent of those decisions have involved issues that were resolved by appeal prior to final judgment in the first action.emphasis added.
second,the two judgments that ibm offers up as prior inconsistent judgments thomforde i in favor of ibm and the district court ruling in this action in favor of ibm are not pertinent judgments for the purposes of an issue preclusion determination.thomforde ii reversed thomforde i,definitively rejecting its application of a legal rule to the evidence.restatement second of judgments cmt.f noting the prior inconsistent judgment rule applies where the outcomes of the judgments may have been based on equally reasonable resolutions of doubt as to the probative strength of the evidence or the appropriate application of a legal rule to the evidence emphasis added.thomforde i is not a judgment on which a party to the present action may rely,and is not,therefore,inconsistent with thomforde ii for the purposes of our issue preclusion determination.
we also do not consider the district court decision in this case,which we are here reviewing,to be a prior judgment inconsistent with thomforde ii.intermediate determinations that are part of ongoing litigation do not trigger the prior inconsistent judgment fairness concerns identified by the supreme court in parklane hosiery.see at.there,the supreme court relied on professor currie example in which a railroad collision injures passengers all of whom bring separate actions against the railroad.after the railroad wins the first suits,a plaintiff wins in suit,and currie argument that offensive use of collateral estoppel should not be applied in such a circumstance so as to allow plaintiffs through automatically to recover.id.at.as this example demonstrates,allowing plaintiffs to favorable prior decisions to preclude issues in an ongoing or subsequent litigation raises serious fairness concerns.by contrast,thomforde ii is the only prior judgment that is final on the waiver matter at issue here because appellants have challenged the district court decision in this case.
finally,we acknowledge that there may be merit to ibm contention that,based on the different stakes and tactical considerations at play in a action as compared to a putative collective or class action,a defendant should not be precluded from relitigating an issue in a later collective or class action if it did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in an earlier action.the lone case cited by ibm,schwab philip morris usa,no.cv jbw,wl,however,does not support its per se position that a final determination of an issue in a action can not preclude relitigation of that issue in a collective or class action.in schwab,class action plaintiffs sought to preclude philip morris,the defendant,from relitigating the issue of whether it had conspired with other tobacco companies to defraud the public.wl,at.the decision in schwab primarily turned on the fact that the prior case was based on distinct substantive legal consumer fraud law rather than a on the fact that the prior case was brought by a single plaintiff.see id.at.we further note that here the two litigations were occurring nearly simultaneously,so invocation of issue preclusion in this case was foreseeable and ibm had every incentive to litigate thomforde fully and vigorously.see parklane hosiery,at.
in the end,we do not need to decide whether the nature of thomforde is alone sufficient to preclude nonmutual issue preclusion.a comparison of these actions convinces us that,while the question is close,the issue decided in thomforde is not identical to that raised here.thomforde ii,therefore,can not preclude us from reaching the merits of this appeal.
several factors bear on the question of whether the issue decided in thomforde ii is sufficiently similar to the one raised here,including whether there is a substantial overlap between the evidence or argument advanced in both proceedings,whether new evidence or argument involve s the application of the same rule of law as applied in the earlier decided action,and the degree to which the claims advanced in both actions are closely related.resolution trust,at.
ibm maintains that thomforde ii should not have preclusive effect here because the eighth circuit holding in that case rested on two bases the lack of clarity in the agreement and ibm declination to tell thomforde what it meant by the language.see thomforde ii,at.the second consideration is particular to the individual plaintiff in thomforde and absent here.
it is far from clear exactly what significance the thomforde ii panel gave to ibm refusal to clarify the sgra agreement.the bulk of the opinion is devoted to explaining why the language of the agreement lacks clarity.id.at.the significance of ibm refusal to explain the terms of the agreement to thomforde is not analyzed.nevertheless,the eighth circuit did point to that refusal in its final summary of the grounds for its decision.that being so,we can not conclude that this distinct set of facts,applicable to the individual plaintiff in thomforde but not to the named plaintiffs or the putative class in this case,had no role in the eighth circuit ultimate conclusion that the waiver was invalid.
we note that thomforde ii stated,in no uncertain terms,that clarification outside the scope of the sgra agreement would not satisfy the strict requirements of the owbpa.see at.it is,therefore,rather unlikely that ibm declination to clarify the agreement played a material role in eighth circuit determination.with no way to verify this hunch,however,we decline to so assume.
because the eighth circuit reasoning did not end with analysis of the language of the sgra agreement,but instead,expressly took into account facts specific to the individual plaintiff in that case,we conclude that the issues are not sufficiently identical between that case and this one for offensive nonmutual issue preclusion to apply.we therefore turn to the merits of this appeal.
at the outset of the mera agreement,the employee is advised to consult an attorney prior to signing.the mera agreement goes on to provide,in relevant part 
if you feel that you are being coerced to sign this general release and covenant not to sue hereinafter release,or that your signing would for any reason not be voluntary you are encouraged to discuss this with your manager,the mera project office or human resources before signing this release.
in exchange for the sums and benefits received pursuant to the terms of the microelectronics resource action mera,employee name,hereinafter you agrees to release and hereby does release ibm from all claims,demands,actions or liabilities you may have against ibm of whatever kind including,but not limited to,those that are related to your employment with ibm,the termination of that employment,or other severance payments or your eligibility for participation in the retirement bridge leave of absence,or claims for attorneys fees.
you also agree that this release covers,but is not limited to,claims arising from the adea,as amended,and any other federal,state or local law dealing with discrimination in employment,including,but not limited to,discrimination based on sex,sexual orientation,race,national origin,religion,disability,veteran status or age this release covers both claims that you know about and those that you may not know about which have accrued by the time you execute this release.
you agree that you will never institute a claim of any kind against ibm including,but not limited to,claims related to your employment with ibm or the termination of that employment or other severance payments or your eligibility for participation in the retirement bridge leave of absence.if you violate this covenant not to sue by suing ibm,you agree that you will pay all costs and expenses of defending against the suit incurred by ibm,including reasonable attorneys fees,and all further costs and fees,including attorneys fees,incurred in connection with collection.this covenant not to sue does not apply to actions based solely under the adea,as amended.that means that if you were to sue ibm only under the adea,as amended,you would not be liable under the terms of this release for their attorneys fees and other costs and expenses of defending against the suit.this release does not preclude filing a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission.
you hereby acknowledge that you understand and agree to this general release and covenant not to sue.
end note of the agreement explains that t he adea prohibits employment discrimination based on age and is enforced by the eeoc.
in arguing that the mera agreement is unclear and confusing,the employees maintain that the last sentence of the covenant not to sue when read in conjunction with end note conveys the impression that,notwithstanding the waiver,ibm employees could still obtain individual relief for their adea claims filed with the eeoc.section of the code of federal regulations provides that a waiver agreement must not have the effect of misleading,misinforming,or failing to inform participants and affected individuals.b.the employees argue that given the last sentence of the covenant not to sue,it was incumbent upon ibm to provide sufficient information so as not to mislead them about their ability to obtain relief by filing claims with the eeoc,the availability of such relief being,apparently,an open legal question.see generally eeoc waffle house,d 
the language that the employees challenge,however,does not exaggerate or misrepresent the availability of relief via the eeoc.it merely notes that such relief is unaffected by the mera agreement.that representation is accurate.see f no waiver agreement may affect the eeoc rights and responsibilities to enforce this chapter.no waiver may be used to justify interfering with the protected right of an employee to file a charge or participate in an investigation or proceeding conducted by the eeoc.see also,at,as reprinted in,the legislation provides that a waiver may not interfere with the eeoc rights and responsibilities to enforce the adea,nor may such a waiver be used to interfere with the employee protected right to file a charge or to participate in an eeoc investigation or proceeding.we conclude that the last sentence of the covenant not to sue does not render the mera agreement invalid.
the employees core complaint is that the mera agreement misleads participating employees to believe that,above and beyond their unaffected right to file an adea claim with the eeoc,they retain the right to pursue independently an adea claim in court.they contend that the phrasing of the release and covenant not to sue engenders confusion over whether adea claims are in fact covered by the release or are excepted from it.we agree,and hold that the mera agreement does not satisfy the manner calculated requirement of the owbpa.the employees waiver of adea claims,along with the accompanying covenant not to sue,was therefore not knowing or voluntary,and both are unenforceable.
the mera agreement contains,on the one hand,a release of all claims,including claims arising from the adea and,on the other hand,a covenant not to sue which includes an agree ment to never institute a claim of any kind against ibm related to employment with ibm.it also provides,however,that t his covenant not to sue does not apply to actions based solely under the adea.emphases added.considering this very same language,the eighth circuit observed 
o ne plausible reading of the document reveals that the employee releases ibm from all adea claims and agrees not to institute a claim of any kind against ibm,except the employee may bring an action based solely under the adea.without a clear understanding of the legal differences between a release and a covenant not to sue,these provisions would seem to be contradictory how can an employee bring a suit solely under the adea if the employee has waived all claims under the adea 
thomforde ii,at.
we agree.the existence of a technical distinction between legal terms does nothing to demonstrate that the average employee confronted with the mera agreement would grasp the import of the distinction in a meaningful way.see id.at despite their distinct purposes,the differences between a release and a covenant not to sue are fairly amorphous and may not be readily apparent to the lay reader.see also watts bellsouth,cir observing,in erisa context,that what may seem obvious to attorneys and judges familiar with the law may not to the average plan participant.instead,to a lay,as we discuss below,to many lawyers as provisions seem first to release all adea claims an employee might have,and then to preserve a right to sue under the adea,implying retention,not release,of adea claims.
ibm protests that it can not fairly be faulted for including in the agreement a covenant not to sue that is permissible under the law and necessary for ibm to obtain an affirmative remedy,the collection of fees and costs in the event of a suit based on a waived claim.according to ibm,the release and the covenant not to sue serve distinct legal purposes.so they can,but,as a practical matter,the two purposes often merge.
black law dictionary defines covenant not to sue as a covenant in which a party having a right of action agrees not to assert that right in litigation,black law dictionary abridged ed emphasis added,and a release as the act of giving up a right or claim to the person against whom it could have been enforced,id.at see also id.at defining waiver as t he voluntary relinquishment or abandonment of a legal right.this distinction is reflected in case law.see medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular,cir a release is a provision that intends a present abandonment of a known right or claim.by contrast,a covenant not to sue also applies to future claims and constitutes an agreement to exercise forbearance from asserting any claim which either exists or which may accrue quotation marks omitted pacific states lumber bargar,cir releases of,and covenants not to sue,a wrongdoer have from early times been considered distinct.a covenant not to sue one of several joint obligers or joint tortfeasors did not at common law operate to discharge others from liability,since it was said not to have the effect,technically,of extinguishing any part of the cause of action.quotation marks omitted see also colton,misc d,canvassing the generally abstrusely worded distinction between releases and covenants not to sue.
the technical distinction between these terms is sometimes more apparent than real.as the court in colton observed 
p erhaps the most important difference between a covenant not to sue and a release the effectiveness of the agreement as a bar to subsequent action by a breaching promisor has long been recognized as being invariably a distinction without a difference.since equity would not permit specific performance of a covenant not to sue,an action would lie for its breach.the measure of the aggrieved promisee damages,however,would except for attorneys fees,be equal to his original liability on the underlying claim.thus,in order to prevent a circuity of actions,where a covenant not to sue was given in perpetuity and did not involve joint torfeasors,it would be deemed to operate as a release,a complete and permanent bar to the underlying action.
at emphasis added citation omitted.
further,the distinction between releases and covenants not to sue becomes particularly murky when both are included in a single document.as the eeoc recognized 
although adea covenants not to sue absent damages operate as the functional equivalent of waivers,they carry a higher risk of violating the owbpa by virtue of their wording.an employee could read covenant not to sue or promise not to sue as giving up not only the right to challenge a past employment consequence as an adea violation,but also the right to challenge in court the knowing and voluntary nature of his or her waiver agreement.the chance of misunderstanding is heightened if the covenant not to sue is added to an agreement that already includes an adea waiver clause.the covenant in such a case would have no legal effect separate from the waiver clause.nonetheless,its language would appear to bar an individual access to court.
waivers of rights and claims tender back of consideration,emphases added to be codified at pt.
given this substantive overlap between releases and covenants not to sue,that fact that the mera agreement covenant not to sue contains an exception for adea claims necessarily creates potential confusion,as it appears to lift any barrier from proceeding to court with an adea claim.the confusion ensues,in part,from including in a single document two concepts that,technically speaking,can not coexist.under the classic definitions contained in black law dictionary and in the case law quoted above,a covenant not to sue is pertinent only if the underlying right is not extinguished,while a release extinguishes any underlying right.where both nonetheless appear in the same document,the covenant not to sue largely swallows the the negation of the covenant not to sue can therefore be read as negating the release as well.
ibm stresses that without the covenant not to sue it would have been deprived of the full benefit of its bargain with those employees who signed on to the mera agreement,because without the covenant,although ibm could raise the release as an affirmative defense and obtain a dismissal of the suit,it still would be out its costs and attorneys fees.ibm also maintains that the covenant not to sue was drafted to comply with the eeoc regulation that provides n o adea waiver agreement,covenant not to sue,or other equivalent arrangement may impose any penalty,or any other limitation adversely affecting any individual right to challenge the agreement including provisions allowing employers to recover attorneys fees damages because of the filing of an adea suit.b.
it very well may have been ibm intention to draft an agreement that would preserve the right of an employee to challenge without penalty his waiver of adea claims as not knowing or voluntary.see thomforde ii,at observing that t he intended effect of the agreement was to release the employee substantive claims under the adea,while preserving the employee right to challenge the validity of the release through a lawsuit,as provided by the regulations citing b.if that was ibm intention,it would have been quite easy to have accomplished this purpose directly.the mera agreement,by contrast,uses a term unfamiliar to lay people,covenant not to sue,and does not explain how the release and the covenant not to sue dovetail,either in general or as they relate to the adea claims.see id.noting that the agreement does not explain how the provisions relate to each other or the limited nature o
