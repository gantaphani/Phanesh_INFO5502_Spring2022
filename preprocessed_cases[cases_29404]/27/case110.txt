unnecessary hardship is a term of art generally used in the context of evaluating a zoning variance.for example,under the los angeles municipal code,no variance may be granted unless the strict application of the provisions of the zoning ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purposes and intent of the zoning regulations.west chandler boulevard neighborhood city of los angeles th,fn.although the test includes both practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships,the focus should be on unnecessary hardships and not practical difficulties,which is a lesser standard.stolman city of los angeles th,zakessian city of sausalito d.
just as with variances,los angeles municipal code section,which governs the permitting process for eldercare facilities,provides that approval of the eldercare facility is warranted only if the zoning administrator finds that the strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulations.e.
in this case,the zoning administrator for the city of los angeles city approved a permit for an eldercare facility that exceeded the building square footage and number of guest rooms allowed under zoning regulations.nearby residents challenged the facility arguing that the zoning administrator failed to make all of the necessary findings,including a finding of unnecessary hardship.the trial court found no substantial evidence supported the finding of unnecessary hardship.
after review,we agree with the trial court that the zoning administrator determination that the strict application of the land use regulations to the proposed eldercare facility would result in unnecessary hardship was not supported by substantial evidence.although the developer argued the unnecessary hardship was based on its purported lost economy of scale,no evidence supported that claim.the record contained no evidence that following the zoning regulations and building a less dense facility would cause either financial hardship or unnecessary hardship.we therefore affirm the trial court judgment requiring the city to rescind its approval of the proposed eldercare facility.
facts and procedure 
prior to the enactment of section,developers seeking to build an eldercare facility were required to obtain several zoning permits variances for each proposed development the los angeles city planning department in a report recommended the city adopt the ordinance eventually codified in section,explaining the growing number of senior citizens in southern california is more active than previous generations and they are demanding a wide variety of housing types and services.those who need special living environments and services find that there is an inadequate supply of these housing types in the state.although,the development community is meeting these demands by providing different types of housing,government can assist by assuring the efficient delivery of these developments and a streamlining of their applications.this proposed ordinance would enable the city of los angeles to expedite the review process for these eldercare facilities.the city attorney reviewing the draft ordinance described it as follows this draft ordinance would amend the los angeles municipal code to add definitions for new and previously undefined uses,provide development standards for alzheimer dementia care housing,assisted living care housing,senior independent housing and skilled nursing care housing,create a single approval process for these uses and facilitate the processing of applications of eldercare facilities.
in,the los angeles city council city council passed ordinance section.as stated in the ordinance,section purpose is to provide development standards for alzheimer dementia care housing,assisted living care housing,senior independent housing and skilled nursing care housing,create a single process for approvals and facilitate the processing of application of eldercare facilities.these facilities provide much needed services and housing for the growing senior population of the city of los angeles.a.
pursuant to section e,to approve an eldercare facility,the zoning administrator is required to make several findings.as previously noted,the zoning administrator shall not grant the approval unless he or she finds that the strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulations.the zoning administrator also is required to find compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood,an absence of adverse impacts on street access in the surrounding neighborhood,a scale compatible with the surrounding neighborhood,as well as compatibility between the project and the general plan.e.finally,the zoning administrator is required to find that the project shall provide services to the elderly such as housing,medical services,social services,or long term care to meet citywide demand.e.
the parties and proposed project 
the owners of the property,john and thomas simmers and the developer community multihousing,sought a permit under section to build an eldercare facility at north fallbrook avenue in woodland hills.they are collectively referred to as appellants.
with limited exceptions,owners of neighboring single family residences strongly opposed the development of the eldercare facility in their neighborhood.their neighborhood association walnut acres neighborhood association and some individual residents mohammad tat,jack pomakian,dawn stead,and donna schuele challenged the development.they are collectively referred to as respondents.
the site of the proposed facility is a one and a half acre lot zoned ra and designated for only very low residential uses.the front of the proposed building is located on fallbrook,which is classified as a major highway,and in some areas has commercial uses.the commercial uses are not immediately adjacent to the proposed facility,which instead is surrounded by single family homes.variances previously had been granted to construct a private school on the site,but the school failed to comply with the conditions of its variance approval.
the proposed eldercare facility would house persons years old or older.the proposed project exceeded the maximum allowable density and floor area of the residential zone.zoning regulations would limit a structure to square feet,and the proposed facility would contain square feet,including over square feet devoted to common areas.the proposed facility would have guest rooms and guest beds,with percent of the beds allocated to persons with alzheimer or dementia.application of the zoning regulations would have limited the site to guest rooms.the height of the project was consistent with that allowed in the ra zone.
the developer submitted a proposal to the city in connection with its requested permit.the proposal explained s tatistics reported in the city housing element show that while approximately nine percent of the city population is currently aged years and older,the age distribution is expected to shift,and almost triple by in the greater los angeles area.an article on aging statistics was included in the record before the zoning administrator.it provides that people over are expected to grow to percent of the population by,doubling from.the projection for california was even higher at percent of the population.the united states census bureau projected rapid growth nationwide of persons over,projecting that by one in five residents would be age or older.
according to the developer proposal,limiting the project to the zoning requirements at the proposed site poses a significant practical difficulty and an unnecessary hardship in that with this restriction would limit development of the project site to a maximum of approximately total square feet of residential floor area this development limitation represents a vast and inappropriate underutilization of the project site,which is inconsistent with the basic purposes and intent of the lamc los angeles municipal code and would not allow the highest and best use of the project site,given the clear existing and projected future market demand for eldercare housing.it would also be at cross purposes to the proposed eldercare facility objective,which is to provide eldercare housing in sufficient quantity so as to contribute meaningfully to the current and projected future demand for such housing consistent with the city regional housing needs assessment and in a manner that is compatible with and enhances the character of the established surrounding residential neighborhood.limiting the project size would present a practical difficulty to the developer who would lose the economy of scale required for the economic operation of an eldercare facility if the developer is not allowed to develop the guest rooms as proposed.
as we shall now describe,the proposed eldercare facility was reviewed multiple times with different results.
zoning administrator decision 
in connection with the proposed eldercare facility,city staff drafted a report,which described the property,the project,and the surrounding areas.the report did not consider whether limiting the facility to rooms would pose an unnecessary hardship.the report contained no information regarding economy of scale in the construction or running of the project.
on may,the zoning administrator approved the project.he concluded that the strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulations.boldface omitted.the zoning administrator explained according to the applicant,the strict application of the far floor area ratio limitation of the ra zone in this case would limit the proposed eldercare facility to only square feet and would reduce the building envelope to a level where only a maximum of guest rooms would be feasible on the site because of the need to accommodate the required common areas needed to support the residents.the strict application of the zoning regulations to the proposed elder care facility would limit the site ability to provide needed amenities and support services to the detriment of the project occupant or would limit the site to only guest rooms,which would result in significant underutilization of the site and would not permit the operator to achieve the economy of scale required to provide the level of support services and amenities required for the eldercare facility unique population.denial of the request would therefore preclude the provision of much needed housing for the elderly population.
the zoning administrator also found as follows the project will provide services to the elderly such as housing,medical services,social services,or long term care to meet the citywide demand.boldface omitted.the opinion explained that the facility will have guest rooms with beds.the facility model is to provide care in a setting and to provide a wide range of supportive services tailored to the individual needs of each resident.a percent average occupancy rate in assisted living facilities was the norm in the industry.although local residents argued that there were high vacancy rates in nearby facilities they provided no data to support their claims.
the zoning administrator further found that residential care facilities were becoming more popular.a forbes magazine article indicated that eldercare facilities range from small homes with four to beds to large institutions with over beds.the zoning administrator relied in part on data from the developer,explaining the applicant noted that the proportion of the population over the age of is expected to double in the next years generating a strong need and demand for eldercare facilities.again,data was not submitted to substantiate this assertion.however,the shift in population as baby boomers age is well known.census data is not available for the city.nationwide data show that the elderly population will almost double between and.the city housing element cites approximately percent of the city population is currently aged years and older.of all households citywide are headed by elderly persons 
appeal to the south valley area planning commi s sion 
appellants appealed the zoning administrator approval to the south valley area planning commission.a public hearing was held june.dan chandler,one of the developers,testified that the area adjacent to the housing project had a tremendous shortage of senior housing.the developer representative stated that forcing the project to comply with zoned density requirements would reduce the project by more than percent.there no evidence that the citywide demand for these services has been satisfied in the six years since the ordinance was adopted 
the hearing officer for the zoning administrator testified as follows and yes,we granted relief from the zoning regulations to allow a square foot facility when the maximum floor area is square feet.we were allowed to do that under the eldercare provisions in order to facilitate these types of facilities,as long as we make the finding of practical difficultly,which i did get too much into that finding,but again,it just a matter of logic and practicality that you really ca,if you were to limit the site to square feet,you would end up with a maximum of guest rooms.and with the level of support services that this type of facility needs,it really would be feasible.
property owners near the proposed facility argued that the zoning administrator merely echoed statements made by the developer,which according to them were not supported by any evidence.they claimed there was no evidence of a demand either in the area adjacent to the eldercare facility or citywide for the eldercare services proposed by the project.the national association of real estate investment trust,a national trade association,has indicated that there may be overbuilding in the eldercare industry appellants stated that there were facilities within a radius of proposed facility and that those facilities had vacancies.
the south valley planning commission concluded that the facility was not appropriate for the neighborhood.one commissioner described it as a lovely facility but inappropriate for the chosen location.another was concerned about the windows in the eldercare facility overlooking the adjoining single family residences.the facility was described as too massive and too dense for a single family neighborhood.one commissioner would have affirmed the zoning administrator decision,only adding mature landscaping.overall,four commissioners voted to grant the appeal and one to deny it.
planning and land use management committee 
the city council asserted jurisdiction and voted to send the proposal for the eldercare facility to the city planning and land use management committee.
on august,the planning and land use management committee recommended that the city council adopt the findings of the zoning administrator.the city council voted consistently with the committee,thereby overruling the decision of the south valley planning commission.
superior court 
respondents petitioned for a writ of mandate in the superior court.appellants and the city opposed the petition.the city is not a party on appeal.
in a lengthy order,the superior court concluded the majority of findings by the zoning administrator were supported by substantial evidence.because those findings are not challenged on appeal,we have not described them in detail.with respect to the findings challenged on appeal,the superior court found no substantial evidence supporting unnecessary hardship or citywide demand for senior housing.
first,the trial court found that the zoning administrator finding that the strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purposes and intent of the zoning regulation was not supported by substantial evidence.citing stolman city of los angeles,supra,th at page,the c
