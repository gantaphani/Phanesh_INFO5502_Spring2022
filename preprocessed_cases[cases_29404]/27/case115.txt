introduction 
the objectors,jay rose and fred maidenberg,appeal from two may probate court orders.the objectors appeal from an order appointing,terry shaylin,dolores diehl,and maria gracita dacosta iyer.they were appointed to act as executors of the estate of the decedent,sonia,also known as sonya,sobol.in addition,the objectors appeal from an order denying rose competing petition with prejudice.rose competing petition sought to have him named as executor.the probate court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend because the objectors lacked standing.the objectors argue the probate court has inherent and statutory authority to give them standing pursuant to probate code section.the objectors contend they have standing to challenge the codicil,which replaced rose as executor,with the the codicil was procured by shaylin through elder abuse of sobol and sobol was an elderly and enfeebled woman who lacked testamentary capacity when the codicil was executed.we conclude the objectors lack standing to contest the codicil.we affirm the order denying rose competing petition in which he sought to be named as executor.thus,we affirm the orders under review.
