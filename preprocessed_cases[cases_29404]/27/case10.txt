this appeal presents two issues.first,when reviewing the administrator denial of benefits under an disability plan,to which version of the summary plan description should the district court refer when determining the applicable standard of review the version in effect at the time the claim is denied or the one in effect when the beneficiary became disabled second,did the district court err by granting summary judgment to cigna on the issue of the correct calculation of the gibbs disability benefits we hold that where an erisa plan beneficiary benefits have vested,the summary plan description in effect at the time the benefits vest governs for purposes of determining the standard of review.we further hold that the district court erred in disregarding cigna admission that gibbs was not a cfa associate under the plan and that there were material issues of fact concerning whether he received a salary in.we,therefore,vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
