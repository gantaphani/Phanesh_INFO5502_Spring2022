introduction 
this original proceeding arises from the elder abuse action filed by petitioners fioravante and peter intrieri,the husband and son of amalia intrieri,after intrieri died following her admission to the alzheimer unit of a nursing home owned and operated by guardian postacute services,in their petition for writ of mandate,petitioners challenge the trial court order granting guardian motion for summary adjudication of the causes of action for elder abuse,negligent infliction of emotional distress,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,unfair business practices,and false advertising.we granted writ review only as to the causes of action for elder abuse,negligent misrepresentation,and fraud.because we agree with petitioners that triable questions of fact exist,we will issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent court to vacate its summary adjudication order as to these three causes of action.
factual and procedural background 
i.the fourth amended complaint 
petitioners allege in their fourth amended complaint that guardian caused intrieri death as the result of events that occurred while she was a patient at guardian nursing home in san jose.another patient,janet lawry,is also named as a defendant according to petitioners,intrieri,age,was injured during an unprovoked altercation with lawry after lawry,who was not an alzheimer patient,entered the alzheimer unit where intrieri resided.
petitioners allege that lawry gained access to the alzheimer unit through secured doors and became engaged in a loud,prolonged disturbance with alzheimer patients.although at least two guardian nurses were present,no guardian personnel intervened.intrieri came out of her room when she realized a disturbance was occurring.at that point,lawry shouted at intrieri to get back in your room,or words to that effect.lawry then shoved intrieri backwards,causing her to fall and break her hip.
guardian allegedly delayed appropriate treatment due to its failure to immediately diagnose intrieri hip fracture.according to petitioners,after intrieri fall guardian staff put her back in bed and did not perform a complete medical assessment until the next morning.eventually,intrieri underwent hip surgery and subsequent amputations of an infected foot and leg.she also developed severe pressure sores during her admission to guardian nursing home,and family members observed unexplained bruises on her face and body.intieri died two months after the fall.
based on these allegations,the complaint states causes of action.our writ review focuses upon the causes of action for willful abuse,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.the first cause of action is captioned as willful misconduct and alleges that guardian violated welfare and institutions code section by neglecting intieri.the alleged neglect includes failing to provide appropriate supervision of patients and allowing them to enter the alzheimer unit and interact with vulnerable alzheimer patients failing to provide proper and necessary nursing care and services to maintain intieri well being failing to initially assess and treat her fractured hip failing to prevent and properly treat intieri pressure sores and the development of repeated and unexplained bruising on her face and body.further,petitioners allege that guardian neglect was intentional and in reckless disregard for the probability that severe injury would result from their failure to carefully adhere to their duties.in their prayer,petitioners request attorney fees and compensatory damages pursuant to the enhanced remedies of section,subdivisions a and b.
in the seventh cause of action for fraud,petitioners allege that guardian admissions director intentionally made false representations to petitioner peter intieri to induce him to place his mother in guardian facility.specifically,the admissions director told him a.that the alzheimer ward of the facility was a secure facility for the residents,which would include intieri b.that the door to the facility had a pad access on both sides,also for the security of the residents,which would include intieri c.that a code would have to be entered into the pad access in order to enter and exit the alzheimer ward d.that only persons authorized by guardian would be provided with the pad access code.peter intrieri asserts that he would not have placed intrieri in guardian nursing home but for his reliance upon these misrepresentations concerning safety and security,which he believed to be true.the eighth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is based upon the same factual allegations as the cause of action for fraud,and further alleges that guardian had no reasonable grounds for believing the representations to be true.
ii.guardian motion for summary adjudication 
guardian moved for summary adjudication of each cause of action except the second cause of action for negligence.as to the first cause of action for willful misconduct,guardian argued that this cause of action lacked merit as a matter of law,for several reasons.first,it was undisputed that the two nurses who were present at the time of the altercation between lawry and intrieri responded as quickly as possible.second,petitioners had no evidence to show that those two nurses had actual or constructive notice that lawry was violent or that she had committed previous physical assaults on other patients.third,there was no evidence to show that guardian intentionally or recklessly neglected intrieri medical needs or caused her bruising,and guardian medical experts stated in their declarations that guardian met the standard of care with respect to intrieri.
regarding the seventh and eighth causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,guardian contended that the claims had no merit as a matter of law because guardian owed no duty to petitioner peter intieri since he was not a guardian patient.alternatively,while guardian admitted that its admissions officer had made the statements about the safety and security of the alzheimer unit alleged in the complaint,guardian maintained that these statements were not actionable because they were not false or fraudulent.
instead,guardian argued,its admissions officer had truthfully represented the alzheimer unit as secure,because it was undisputed that guardian security system allowed unfettered access to the alzheimer unity by authorized persons,who,according to guardian,included staff,patients,and family members.at the same time,the security system prevented alzheimer patients from leaving the unit without supervision because an alarm would sound unless a code,which was posted above the keypad,was entered into the keypad code system for the alzheimer unit door.therefore,guardian argued,the evidence showed that it was undisputed that the alzheimer unit was a secure environment that did not violate the right of unit residents to be free of physical restraints,such as locked doors.
iii.petitioners opposition to the motion for summary adjudication 
petitioners opposed guardian motion for summary adjudication on the ground that petitioners evidence demonstrated that a triable question of fact existed as to each cause of action.as to the cause of action for willful misconduct,petitioners stated that the cause of action had been mislabeled.petitioners meant to assert an elder abuse cause of action seeking the enhanced remedies available under the elder abuse act,section,which required only a showing that guardian had physically abused or neglected intrieri while she was in guardian care and that guardian had acted recklessly in doing so.
in support of the elder abuse cause of action,petitioners submitted the declarations of their medical experts,roberta block,and kathryn locatell,both specialists in nursing home care.the medical expert opinions were based in part on lawry medical records,which revealed that two weeks before her altercation with intrieri,lawry had been observed by guardian staff to be confused and hostile,and had been heard to shout,i want to go home.i will kill someone to get home.locatell stated in her declaration that these medical records also showed that guardian knew prior to lawry assault on intrieri that lawry had become unstable and that she was not an appropriate resident for the facility because of her level of functioning and wandering behavior.additionally,locatell opined that when lawry entered the alzheimer unit and displayed signs of agitated behavior that posed a risk of harm to the alzheimer patients,guardian staff should have immediately removed her from the unit and prevented the altercation that resulted in intrieri hip fracture.locatell further concluded that guardian acted with conscious disregard that intrieri would sustain further injury when guardian failed to provide care planning,skin care reporting and proper treatment of her skin ulcers.
similarly,block stated in her declaration that lawry medical records revealed that lawry had been upset,depressed,confused,disoriented and hostile in the weeks leading up to the altercation with intrieri,and therefore it was below the nursing standard of care to allow lawry to enter the alzheimer unit because there was a high probability that lawry would cause injury to the unit residents.further,block stated that the medical records pertaining to the altercation showed that the nurses on duty actually heard lawry screaming at the residents of the alzheimer unit,yet they failed to respond immediately and remained seated at the nurses station until intrieri fell.block also criticized guardian nursing care,opining that guardian failure to properly treat intrieri skin ulcers fell far below the nursing standard of care and was done with a conscious disregard of the high probability that her condition would worsen.on that basis of these expert declarations,petitioners argued that they had sufficient evidence to show that guardian had committed elder abuse within the meaning of section.
with respect to the seventh and eighth causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,petitioners asserted,first,that guardian statements to peter intrieri were actionable although he was not a patient at guardian nursing home.petitioners pointed out that the existence of a duty is not an element of a cause of action for fraud.nor was patient status required for the negligent misrepresentation cause of action,because guardian made the statements directly to peter intrieri as part of a business transaction,to induce him,as intrieri caregiver,to place intrieri in a guardian facility.
second,petitioners argued that guardian had failed to establish that the statements made by guardian admissions director to peter intrieri regarding the safety and security of the alzheimer unit were true as a matter of law.peter intieri testified in his deposition that he was told that only authorized persons would be able to enter the alzheimer unit,that patients were not supposed to enter the unit,and that the guardian facility would be very good for his mother.to the contrary,petitioners asserted,the evidence showed that no authorization was required,because the keypad code for access to the alzheimer unit was displayed above the keypad system for the unit door,and that the care his mother received fell below the standard of care.further,petitioners argued that the admissions director knew or should have known that her statements were false because the evidence showed that the nursing care was substandard guardian staff were aware that lawry,a patient with reported instances of hostility,was allowed unlimited access to the alzheimer unit and that anyone who could read the keypad code could enter the alzheimer unit.
iv.the trial court order 
the trial court granted in part and denied in part guardian motion for summary adjudication.the court granted summary adjudication of the causes of action for willful abuse,negligent infliction of emotional distress,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,unfair business practices,and false advertising.regarding the willful misconduct cause of action,the trial court determined that the evidence was insufficient to create a triable question of fact,because there was no evidence establishing that the staff at guardian intentionally acted with a positive,active disregard for decedent physical condition or safety,or with an absolute knowledge that substantial serious injury would probably result from any errors or omission in attending to her care or treatment.the court finds that,at best,that evidence suggests that defendant care of decedent may have fallen below the standard of care however,that is insufficient to constitute willful misconduct.
as to petitioners statement that the first cause of action was actually a cause of action for elder abuse mislabeled willful misconduct,the trial court also determined that the evidence was insufficient to create a triable question of fact.t he court finds that the evidence,at best,indicates that guardian may have been negligent in failing to protect decedent from being pushed by patient janet lawry,failing to promptly obtain proper treatment for decedent resulting fractured hip,in failing to properly care for decedent subsequent pressure sores.however,the court finds that the evidence is insufficient to establish that defendant acted with a deliberate disregard of a high probability that decedent would be injured by lawry or that the course of treatment for decedent pressure sores would not be successful.the court specifically finds that evidence is insufficient to support a claim under the elder abuse act because there is no evidence showing either that lawry attacked or threatened anyone prior to incident involving decedent or that guardian intentionally ignored decedent pressure sores or intentionally withheld treatment.in short,the court finds that the evidence is insufficient to establish that defendant acted with recklessness,oppression,fraud or malice in providing care and treatment to decedent.therefore,petitioners have failed to show a triable issue of fact as to their elder abuse claim.
as to the causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,the trial court again determined that the evidence was insufficient to create a triable question of fact.the trial court reasoned,undisputed evidence establishes that the alzheimer unit was secure where alarmed from the inside and where only authorized persons,including patients,were permitted to enter.therefore,the admission director statements did not constitute untrue statements of material fact and can not constitute actionable misrepresentations.furthermore,the court finds that the admission director additional alleged misrepresentations to peter intieri that guardian would be very good for his parents constitutes a statement of opinion of prediction of future events.the trial court also determined that there was no evidence to show that the admissions director knew or should have known that the alleged statements were false at the time she made them.
