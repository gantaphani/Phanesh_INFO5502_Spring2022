discussion 
i.the medicare advantage program 
appellant primary claim against respondent,both here and in the trial court,is that the contractual structure through which respondent arranges to provide medical services gives the medical care providers an undue financial incentive to deny medically reasonable services.we will begin with a brief description of the insurance program pursuant to which respondent enters into contracts with medical providers.
medicare advantage ma previously known as medicare choice is a federal program designed to permit persons eligible for medicare to enroll in private insurance plans,including health maintenance organizations hmo.the medicare program pays all or most of the premium for that insurance in lieu of paying medicare benefits directly to service providers.see cal.elder law resources,benefits,and planning introduction to medicare,see also medicare advantage program,et all citations to federal regulations are to the,edition.
respondent provides an ma hmo plan marketed under the name secure horizons.respondent is a health insurance company and does not directly provide medical services.instead,it contracts with local health care providers,who then provide physician,hospital,and other medical services to secure horizons plan members.
as an organization providing an ma plan,respondent,through a process of bidding and negotiation see et,contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to receive a monthly payment from medicare for each person enrolled in respondent ma plan.in return,respondent must arrange to provide a specified range of services for enrollees.see et similarly,as relevant in this case,respondent contracts with a physicians group and two hospitals for provision of direct services to enrollees,again based,primarily,on a negotiated monthly fee for each enrollee regardless of services actually provided in a particular month.this payment mechanism is generally called capitation.see a.
respondent and its participating medical providers are contractually bound to provide adequate access to covered medical services.see,a.service providers are required to provide medically necessary care in a competent manner.see id.at a i.nevertheless,it is obvious that an ma organization or a provider receiving capitation payments would,in any given month,make more money if it reduced costs by providing fewer services than the average anticipated by the parties in arriving at a capitation formula.
apparently medicare is concerned that contractual,ethical,and patient satisfaction considerations may not be sufficient incentives for organizations and providers to render timely,sufficient,quality care.as a result,federal regulations require the following the actual and timely provision of contracted services see a,a,a,noninterference by entities receiving capitated payments in the individual medical decision of the actual service provider see,c,a,extensive quality assurance programs and review see,b,a,and an administrative grievance procedure that allows the patient to challenge a determination that a service is not covered by the plan or is not medically necessary et.cms periodically reviews all contracts and usage data,with a view to ensuring quality and availability of services.see b,d.
ii.the complaint 
appellant sued both respondent and all the various medical service providers who had anything to do with the course of treatment that ended in yarick death.the present appeal involves only the judgment dismissing the action against respondent as far as our record discloses,the action continues against the other defendants.
as to respondent,the fourth amended complaint preliminarily alleges respondent had a duty to arrange its business and financial affairs so that it
