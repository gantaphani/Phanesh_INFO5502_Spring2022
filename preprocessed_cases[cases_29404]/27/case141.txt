this writ proceeding challenges an order of the trial court requiring ombudsman services of northern california osnc,an authorized representative of the office of the state care ombudsman and a to the underlying litigation,to provide the litigants with all of its records relating to a specific care facility over a specified period of time.we conclude the trial court erred in requiring the production of such investigatory records,even with the redaction ordered by the court.we will grant osnc petition for extraordinary relief and issue a writ of mandate requiring the trial court to vacate the portion of its order requiring osnc to provide any records beyond those regarding lavern staples made by staples,his representatives,or family.
background 
ann coleman,as the legal representative of her late father lavern kenneth staples estate plaintiff,sued foothill oaks care center,horizon west,and william nesbitt,iii defendants for elder abuse,wrongful death,unfair business practices,fraudulent business practices,and for fraud.upon stipulation of plaintiff and defendants,a court order was issued requiring osnc to produce any and all records of complaints and actions taken pertaining to foothill oaks care center between may,and january.osnc first received notice of the order when a copy was faxed to it by plaintiff a few days after entry of the order by the trial court.when osnc could not get all parties to the litigation to stipulate to set aside the order,osnc filed a motion in the trial court seeking to set aside the stipulated order based on lack of notice and requesting an affirmative protective order prohibiting the parties from conducting any further discovery of osnc privileged and confidential information.
osnc asserted a protective order was necessary as its records were privileged and confidential under welfare and institutions code sections and,title of united states code section,subdivision a c iii,evidence code section,subdivision b,and the california right to privacy contained in article,section of the california constitution.osnc disputed plaintiff claim that the records should be disclosed based on plaintiff authorization under welfare and institutions code section hereafter section.according to osnc,section only permits limited discovery of the personal information of a living individual patient or resident upon the authorization of that same patient or legal representative.it did not extend to disclosure of any information regarding other people contained in osnc files.osnc also argued there was no compelling necessity that warranted overriding the privilege and confidentiality of its records.
plaintiff alone filed opposition to osnc motion.plaintiff argued california does not recognize an ombudsman privilege,that the privileges contained in the evidence code are exclusive,and that the plain meaning of section provides for disclosure based on her authorization and upon the court order issued on stipulation of all parties to the underlying action.plaintiff argued disclosure was consistent with the federal law cited by osnc.plaintiff contended the right to privacy under the california constitution is conditional and could be sufficiently protected by obliteration of the names of confidential sources.
the trial court granted the motion by osnc to set aside the stipulated order based on due process grounds,but granted only in part osnc motion for a protective order regarding the discovery sought by plaintiff.the trial court ordered osnc to provide all records about the decedent lavern staples made by the decedent or his.the ombudsman shall also provide all records pertaining to foothill oaks care center between may,and january,with the names of all persons involved redacted as well as any other private information that would reveal the identity of the care or family or representatives.the trial court found that redacting such information shall protect the interests in confidentiality.
osnc filed a petition for writ of mandate prohibition with this court seeking a peremptory writ directing the trial court to set aside and vacate the portion of its ruling and order requiring osnc to provide all of its records pertaining to the foothill oaks care center for the specified time period.we issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed all further discovery proceedings involving osnc pending further order of this court.after this matter was fully briefed and oral argument scheduled,we received notice that the underlying litigation had settled.we requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the effect of such settlement.we conclude,due to the conditional nature of the settlement,the case is not moot.moreover,the issues here involve an important matter of continuing public interest that is likely to recur.in such cases,we have discretion to retain jurisdiction and decide the merits.lundquist reusser cal th,fn,d,burch george cal th,fn,d,californians for fair on superior court th,d glenfed development superior court th,fn,d.we now issue the peremptory writ requested.
discussion 
relief is appropriate 
although writ review of discovery rulings is generally disfavored,interlocutory review by writ is the only adequate remedy when,as here,a court compels the disclosure of documents or information that may be subject to a privilege,because once privileged matter has been disclosed there is no way to undo the harm which consists in the very disclosure.citation.union bank of california superior court th,d accord story superior court th,d see kleitman superior court th,d.writ review is particularly appropriate here to protect the confidential records of third persons who are not parties to the underlying litigation below,who have had no notice of the ordered disclosure,and who,as a result,have had no opportunity to object.osnc properly asserted the privacy rights of those third persons affected by the discovery order of the trial court.doe superior court th,d denari superior court d.ceb,cal.civil discovery practice ed.

as we will discuss,we conclude writ relief is appropriate and necessary to correct the trial court abuse of discretion in ordering disclosure of privileged and confidential osnc records beyond osnc records about lavern staples made by staples,his representatives or family.
osnc role as ombudsman 
to place our discussion in context,we begin with a discussion of osnc role as an authorized representative of the office of the state care ombudsman.
the federal older americans act et the federal law provides federal funding for states to carry out vulnerable elder rights protection activities.to receive federal funding for such activities,states must comply with a variety of statutory requirements,including the establishment and operation of an office of the state care ombudsman.a.under the federal law,such state ombudsman may designate a local ombudsman entity to provide services to protect the health,safety,welfare and rights of care residents and to ensure residents have regular and timely access to representatives of the ombudsman program and timely responses to complaints and requests for assistance.a b i ii.the local ombudsman must identify,investigate,and resolve complaints made by or on behalf of residents that relate to action,inaction,or decisions,that may adversely affect the health,safety,welfare,or rights of the residents.a b iii.the duties of the local ombudsman also include representing the interests of residents before government agencies,as well as reviewing and commenting on,if necessary,any laws,regulations,government policies and actions pertaining to the rights and of residents.a b iv v.
california has established a care ombudsman program to comply with the requirements of the federal law.welf,et osnc is a local ombudsman entity authorized by california office of the state care ombudsman.consistent with state law welf,osnc considers its principal role to be the investigation,resolution,and reporting of complaints made by any person alleging abuse,neglect or mistreatment of patients or residents in care facilities.in conducting such investigations,osnc assures all prospective witnesses that the information they provide is confidential and will not be made public or released to the patient,the facility or other witnesses except as ordered by a court.such guarantee of confidentiality is critical to the functioning of the ombudsman as patients,family members,employees of the facility or other third parties may otherwise be hesitant to report alleged abuse or neglect.osnc conducts over investigations annually.according to osnc,almost everything in the records of its investigations is highly personal in nature,including patient diagnoses,prognoses,medications,patient and family social histories,other personal and intimate family details,social security numbers,m edicare numbers,and so on.disclosure of such information would aggravate the widely recognized risks of patient,family,employee and witness exploitation and retaliation.osnc claims the broad discovery authorized by the trial court in this case jeopardizes the continued effectiveness of its investigations and the program.
the records of osnc are statutorily privileged 
evidence code section provides that e xcept as otherwise provided by statute a no person has a privilege to refuse to be a witness.b no person has a privilege to refuse to disclose any matter or to refuse to produce any writing,object,or other thing.c no person has a privilege that another shall not be a witness or shall not disclose any matter or shall not produce any writing,object,or other thing.
in section of the evidence code,the legislature clearly intended to abolish common law privileges and to keep the courts from creating new nonstatutory privileges as a matter of judicial policy.welfare rights organization crisan cal d,see valley bank of nevada superior court cal d.thus,unless a privilege is expressly or impliedly based on statute,its existence may be found only if required by constitutional principles,state or federal.welfare rights organization crisan,supra,at.the source of recognized statutory privileges,however,is not limited to those enumerated in the evidence code,union bank of california superior court,supra,th at,d.
while there is no general ombudsman statutory privilege in california garstang superior court th,d garstang,there is a specific statute providing a privilege for the investigatory records and files of the office of the care ombudsman.
section provides all records and files of the office relating to any complaint or investigation made pursuant to this chapter and the identities of complainants,witnesses,patients,or residents shall remain confidential,unless disclosure is authorized by the patient or resident or his or her conservator of the person or legal representative,required by a court order,or release of the information is to a law enforcement agency,public protective service agency,licensing or certification agency in a manner consistent with federal laws and regulations.
section clearly provides a statutory privilege against disclosure of any complaint made to osnc and all investigatory records and files of osnc.the question in this case becomes the interpretation of the exceptions outlined in the last half of section.
the consent exception in section 
section provides broad confidentiality to osnc investigatory records and files,unless disclosure is authorized by the patient or resident or his or her conservator of the person or legal representative.plaintiff argues disclosure of the records she requested is allowed under the plain meaning of this language because she is the legal representative of her father,who was a of foothill oaks care center

the language of section starts with the premise of confidentiality covering all care ombudsman investigatory records,files and the identities of persons communicating with the ombudsman.this clearly promotes the important purpose of the legislation in providing for the investigation of complaints and reports of possible abuse,neglect and mistreatment of elderly patients and residents by an independent ombudsman.the ombudsman is likely to get the full cooperation of such patients,residents,employees or administrators of the facility,medical personnel,and other third persons only if such people are assured their statements and information will not come back to haunt them.the confidentiality provision in section is consistent with,and apparently enacted to meet,the requirements of the federal law that requires states receiving federal funding to provide that all information,gathered in the course of receiving complaints and reports of elder abuse and in making referrals,remains confidential.a c,d,b d e.
section then allows disclosure if authorized by the patient or resident or his or her conservator of the person or legal representative.this language,however,does not make it clear what exactly is to be disclosed upon the consent being just the identity of the person giving consent,just the statements and personal information of the person giving consent,the complete records and files relating to the person giving consent,or some wider net of identities,records and information,as plaintiff claims.we reject as an unreasonable interpretation of the language plaintiff suggestion that a consent given by a patient,resident,conservator or legal representative authorizes disclosure of a third person identity,statements or information included in the investigatory records of the care ombudsman,as plaintiff sought here any other construction of section would risk making it inconsistent with the related federal statutes on the same subject and undermine the apparent purpose of the ombudsman statute.
the federal law 
specifically,section of the federal law provides a number of eligibility requirements for a state plan to receive federal funding,subd.a.one of these requirements is an assurance that the state will conduct a program of services for receipt of reports of elder abuse and referral of complaints to law enforcement or public protective service agencies if appropriate,subd.a a.section a c requires all information gathered in the course of receiving reports and making referrals shall remain confidential.the statute lists three exceptions i if all parties to such complaint consent in writing to the release of such information ii if the release of such information is to a law enforcement agency,public protective service agency,licensing or certification agency,ombudsman program,or protection or advocacy system or iii upon court order.a c i iii.
similarly,section of the federal law provides a state agency must develop and enhance programs for the prevention of elder abuse,
