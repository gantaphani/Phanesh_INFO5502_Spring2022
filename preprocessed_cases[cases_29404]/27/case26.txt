we now affirm the district court judgment denying haggar amended motion for jmol,awarding palasota back pay and liquidated damages based on the jury verdict,and awarding palasota interest,and costs of court.we reverse and render judgment in favor of haggar,rejecting palasota claims for reinstatement and interim monthly front pay.we vacate and remand for further proceedings with respect to palasota claim for lump sum front pay.
jimmy palasota worked for haggar as a men clothing sales associate for years,until may,when,at the age of,he was terminated.over his years of service,he was referred to as an outstanding employee,and performed his work exceptionally well.in his accounts netted him an annual income of.his territory at that time included a key account with dillard,some trade accounts and eight.penney stores.
during the,as the clothing industry was restructuring,haggar overhauled its company image,in part by replacing older sales associates with younger individuals.haggar also changed its compensation plan in the early,paying associates a guaranteed monthly income based on the prior year sales.in the fall of,however,haggar resumed paying its associates on a straight commission basis without any guarantee.
in,through no fault of palasota,haggar lost its account with dillard department stores,which had generated around of palasota income between and per year.haggar manager over palasota proposed assigning him a new sales territory including additional penney stores in houston,san antonio,and austin,which would have allowed him to maintain his earnings at the same level.in december,however,haggar replaced that manager,and palasota new manager refused to assign the proposed territory to palasota.instead,palasota was relegated to less lucrative accounts in east texas and louisiana.that assignment allowed him to earn no more than per year.
moreover,in february,the new manager informed palasota that he could accept either the less lucrative territory or a severance package.palasota declined the severance package and refused to resign.as a part of the transition to the less profitable territory,haggar provided palasota with a salary bridge,effective from january through april of,that guaranteed him of his salary about.
in march,palasota manager informed him that he would be terminated.on april,haggar notified palasota in writing of his pending termination.the termination notice included the tender of a severance package of months pay and a requirement that he release haggar from liability to him for his adea claims.palasota did not accept the severance package and was officially terminated on may.he promptly stopped working and sent transition letters to his customers informing them that he had left the company.because palasota refused to release haggar from adea liability,haggar suspended his severance pay after three months.
in this second appeal,of course,haggar may not challenge the jury finding that it terminated palasota employment because of his age in violation of the adea.that issue was conclusively resolved against haggar by the previous panel decision in haggar first appeal and is therefore the law of this case.free abbott,cir.in its present appeal,however,haggar can and does challenge issues not reached in the first appeal,the jury finding that haggar acted willfully in its adea violation which formed the basis of the liquidated damages award,the jury calculations of palasota financial loss caused by the violation used as a basis for the back pay award,as well as the district court decision to order haggar to reinstate palasota and pay him both lump sum and monthly front pay.we turn first to haggar challenge to the parts of the district court judgment that denied haggar motion for judgment as a matter of law,and that,instead,sustained palasota jury verdict on financial loss which determines back pay and employer wilfulness which determines whether liquidated damages are awarded.

after reviewing the record,we conclude that the district court correctly analyzed the evidence and applied rule,not simply for the district court stated reasons,but also because of additional evidence in the record from which the jury reasonably could have found that haggar violation was willful and reasonably could have calculated the amount of his resulting financial loss.
in this appeal,haggar arguments with regard to willfulness merely parallel its previous argument on the violation issue,that haggar employment decisions were not discriminatory or intended to cause palasota to suffer economic loss or employment termination and that haggar believed palasota had resigned voluntarily rather than being forced out of the company by haggar employment decisions.it is possible for an employer to violate the adea without doing so willfully,without knowingly or recklessly disregarding whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute.hazen paper biggins,d west nabors drilling usa,cir.here,however,there existed a fully sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury to reasonably find haggar guilty of a willful violation.the previous panel,in reversing the district court judgment as a matter of law in favor of haggar,concluded that the jury reasonably found haggar had violated the adea,based on,inter alia,the following evidence 
between december,and march,haggar terminated sales associates forty years of age or older,including palasota,while hiring new retail marketing associates rmas,only one of whom was over forty years of age.haggar chief financial officer testified that the increase in the number of rmas and the decrease in the number of sales associates were related and offset each other in the company sales budget.
in late,haggar president,frank bracken,stated that he wanted race horses and not plow horses,while telling palasota that he was out of the old school of selling.bracken announced at a sales meeting that there was a significant graying of the sales force.alan burks,a member of management,stated at a sales executive meeting hey,fellows,let face it,we got an ageing,graying sales force out there.sales are bad,and we got to figure out a way to get through it.
palasota produced evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that he was terminated as part of haggar plan to turn sales associate duties over to younger rmas.for example the february,memorandum from tim lyons to haggar executives frank bracken,joe haggar,iii,and alan burks.in that memo,lyons discusses palasota displeasure with the company offer of a standard severance package.lyons then shifts focus,recommending severance packages for fourteen named sales associates,all of whom are specifically identified as over fifty years of age,in order to thin the ranks as part of a transition period.the memo states that,by eliminating employees over fifty years of age,we will have the flexibility to bring on some new players that can help us achieve our growth plans.
the memo,which is undeniably,was composed approximately two months before palasota termination.lyons,vice president of,was empowered to terminate palasota,as well as offer severance packages to other employees.in no uncertain terms,the memo discusses a broad plan to thin the ranks of older sales associates in order to ease the anxiety of this transition period.
haggar contends the memo merely discusses the possibility of providing severance packages to three employees requesting them,including palasota.this ignores the fact that employees over fifty years of age,at least of whom did not request severance packages,were targeted for offers.haggar does not explain why,as part of its plan to reconfigure its sales staff,only older associates were selected,nor why rmas were simultaneously hired to perform sales duties.
within two months after palasota refused to accept the severance package,he was eliminated the stated reason for termination was a reconfiguration of the sales force.between december,and march,haggar terminated twelve sales associates,including palasota percent of the sales associates were males over the age forty,while percent of the rmas were females under forty.haggar chief financial officer testified that increases in the number of rmas and declines in sales associates were designed to offset one another.the former head of haggar penney account testified that there was no difference between the rmas and sales associates,and that the transition was part of a plan to shift sales responsibilities to the younger,predominantly female,rmas.coupled with haggar campaign to present a more youthful image,a reasonable juror could conclude that palasota was terminated because of his age.
t he eeoc determination found reasonable cause,made after a two and year investigation,to believe that palasota and similarly situated sales associates were discharged in violation of the adea.a n eeoc determination prepared by professional investigators on behalf of an impartial agency,is highly probative.plummer western int l hotels,cir citing peters jefferson chem,cir.
palasota i,at some citations and quotation marks omitted.additionally,haggar unsuccessful efforts to have palasota release it from adea claims upon his termination tended to show that haggar had knowingly violated the adea or recklessly disregarded whether its conduct toward palasota was prohibited by the statute.
applying the standards dictated by rule and reeves,it is apparent that haggar is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the willfulness issue.after reviewing all of the evidence in the record,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,refraining from credibility determinations or weighing the evidence,and disregarding all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury was not required to believe,we conclude that there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that haggar knew or at least showed reckless disregard for whether its employment decisions affecting palasota were prohibited by the adea.
back pay encompasses what the plaintiff would have received in compensation but for the employer violation of the adea patterson healthcare,cir citing phelps dodge nlrb.in general,back pay liability in a wrongful termination case commences from the time the discriminatory conduct causes economic and ends upon the date of the judgment in other words,back pay accrues from the date of the commencement of the discriminatory course of conduct causing financial loss until the date damages are settled.
the district court charge to the jury on back pay consisted of a medley of instructions pertaining to the concept of damages as making palasota whole as well as the period during which back pay accrues.thus,the jury was told to assess damages for the income lost by palasota from the date he was terminated,in this case may,until the date of trial but it was also instructed as follows 
y ou must then determine an amount that is fair compensation for the damages sustained by palasota.the purpose of damages is to make a plaintiff is to compensate palasota for any injuries that he has suffered for injuries that palasota proves were proximately caused by haggars sic allegedly wrongful conduct.
the jury was also instructed to answer this interrogatory what amount of financial damages,if any,did palasota sustain as a result of actions taken by haggar on account of his age 
further,the jury was instructed as to the diametrically opposed contentions of the parties.palasota contends that he was terminated based upon his age as part of a plan implemented by haggar to eliminate older males from the sales force and transfer the sales responsibilities to younger females and that such transfer constituted age discrimination.haggar contended,however,according to the court instructions,that palasota was not terminated because of his age,but that he voluntarily left haggar because palasota key account,dillard,was no longer purchasing haggar products.
undisputedly then,palasota was entitled to back pay based on the accrual of his economic damage during the period from his termination to the date of the trial.the parties disagree,however,on whether the jury used a reasonable method to calculate the accruement of damages during that period.haggar contends that the jury unreasonably overcompensated palasota because it used as a baseline for measuring his economic damage his earnings rate in per than his earnings rate at the time of his termination on may,per annum.palasota,on the other hand,argues that the jury was correctly instructed to compensate him for all injuries proximately caused by haggar wrongful conduct in order to make him whole and that requiring haggar to repair him only at the rate of his depressed earnings level,deliberately brought about by haggar as part of its continuing plan to eliminate older males,would not make him whole or fairly compensate him for the damage he sustained.
because the jury was also instructed not to single out one instruction alone as the law,but consider the instructions as a whole,we conclude that it was not impermissible or unreasonable for the jury to take into account all of the economic injury and damage that palasota suffered as a result of haggar continuing scheme and violation in quantifying the amount of financial damages palasota sustain ed as a result of actions taken by haggar on account of his age when a continuing violation has been perpetrated,a defendant employer is not shielded from liability simply because the defendant earlier discriminatory acts occurred outside the limitations period rather,a court may take into account the effects occurring within the accrual period that stemmed from the acts of discrimination occurring earlier.see,rendon,cir messer meno,cir glass chem,cir thompson sawyer,crawford western,cir acha beame,cir verzosa merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir lindemann grossman,supra note,at rossein,supra note,
in this case,the jury reasonably could have found that haggar successfully engaged in a scheme of willful discriminatory acts designed to replace its ageing sales force with a younger,less highly paid one.in respect to palasota,the jury reasonably could have found that the scheme began with haggar refusal to assign him to a lucrative territory in early in order to reduce his earnings rate before terminating him in.from this and the other evidence,the jury legitimately could have determined that but for haggar scheme of willful adea violations,palasota would have attained earnings rate levels of at least per year from early through the dates of the trial and the jury verdict.
in assessing palasota loss,the jury apparently found and accounted for the fact that his earnings rate would have been per annum at his termination but for the impact on palasota of haggar scheme to rejuvenate its sales force in violation of the adea after reviewing the record,we conclude,from the evidence stipulated to by the parties and introduced at trial,that the jury reasonably found the following facts 
haggar conceived of and successfully executed a plan and continuing violation to force palasota and a dozen other sales associates over the age of to resign and to replace them with new salespersons,called retail marketing associates,only one of whom was over years old 
that the sole purpose of the plan and continuing violation was to replace haggar aging sales force,including palasota,with persons that were younger and more youthful in appearance 
that the first discriminatory act in the plan and continuing violation by haggar against palasota and the other ageing sales associates was the company refusal in late to place him in charge of a new territory including major stores in houston,san antonio,and austin as proposed by haggar national sales manager at that time,james thompson and 
that palasota,who was consistently earning approximately per year at that time was the best candidate to assume responsibility of those accounts that it was part of haggar plan and continuing violation to systematically reduce palasota earnings rate before finally terminating him in order to minimize its exposure to liability under adea.
but for haggar discriminatory campaign,palasota would have continued to earn income comparable to his peak earnings of per year that he was achieving in early until the date of the judgment.instead,however,the record shows,the jury reasonably could have found that haggar relegated palasota to the position of tending to a group of less lucrative trade accounts in east texas and louisiana that haggar committed this discriminatory act as part of a continuing plan and violation against palasota for the sole purpose of reducing his annual commissions income,ultimately forcing his resignation,and carrying out its plan to replace its ageing sales force with persons under years old and that on april,haggar plan and continuing violation culminated,insofar as palasota was concerned,with its notifying him that his position was being eliminated as part of a reconfiguration of the sales force.
in sum,it is evident that the jury calculated the back pay to which palasota was entitled by finding from the evidence that palasota earned per annum as a sales associate with haggar up until the beginning of haggar discriminatory acts and continuing violation against him,which were part of a larger plan to reduce his earnings,force his resignation,and rejuvenate its sales force as part of its age discrimination plan and continuing violation,haggar assigned palasota to a much less lucrative sales territory rather than to a more fertile one for which he was the most qualified employee and palasota financial losses caused by haggar continuing adea violations from the date of his termination until the date of the judgment amounted to the total sum of.we can not say that the jury erred or acted unreasonably in this regard.compensating palasota merely at the depressed earnings rate deliberately brought about by haggar as part of its willfully unlawful scheme and continuing violation would unjustly reward haggar by reducing its cost of perpetrating that scheme and it would unfairly penalize palasota.
certain events or circumstances may serve to cut off an employee entitlement to back pay prior to the date of the judgment,such as,for example,the plaintiff employment in a or the plaintiff failure to seek other employment with reasonable care and diligence.see lindemann grossman,supra note,at see also rossein,supra note,although generally the back pay period commences when the discrimination began or occurred and ends the day of the judgment,various factors can affect the determination.citing,inter alia,mills int l of teamsters,cir.moreover,under the adea the plaintiff is required to mitigate damages by using reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain comparable employment following his termination.west nabors drilling usa,cir.we have defined comparable or substantially equivalent employment as that which affords virtually identical promotional opportunities,compensation,job responsibilities,working conditions,and status as the position from which the claimant has been discriminatorily terminated.id.internal quotations omitted quoting sellers delgado,cir title vii case.

in ruling on haggar motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to back pay,the district court stated that the jury did not toll the award of back pay for the length of palasota employment at dickie although it did,however,reduce the backpay award by his earnings over that time.on appeal,haggar argues that the jury was unreasonable in not tolling back pay during palasota job with dickie because it entailed essentially the same functions he had performed for haggar 
haggar relies solely on evidence that palasota earned a year at dickie,and that under his employment contract there he potentially could receive to more in commissions.haggar argues that palasota actual and potential income at dickie matched or exceeded both palasota predicted annual income of at haggar at the time of his termination and his income of.it is not genuinely disputed that the work was similar in kind in both positions,palasota sold menswear to retailers.palasota correctly points out,however,that haggar presented no evidence regarding promotional opportunities,job responsibilities,working conditions,or status,and that haggar simply asserts that no additional evidence was required to show that the two positions were substantially equivalent.
haggar assertion therefore misses the point.we must consider whether there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for that party with respect to that issue.a.here,the jury apparently found that the evidence did not support haggar assertion that the jobs were comparable and therefore refused to toll damages during palasota employment with dickie.we have already determined that the jury reasonably used palasota earnings rate of per annum as a baseline for determining the quantum of his economic damage caused by haggar wilful adea violation.palasota compensation by dickie is plainly not comparable to his earnings rate at haggar unless he actually realized the additional potential for commissions mentioned only as a possibility in his dickie employment contract.the evidence presented by haggar on this and other aspects of palasota employment situation with dickie is not so compelling that we must conclude that the jury unreasonably refused to toll his right to back pay during his dickie employment.further,while the industry and basic nature of the work may have been the same,the jury reasonably could have found that the newly hired palasota would not have received the same status or responsibilities,or that palasota would not have received other benefits that he was accorded by his former employment by haggar.see,boehms crowell,cir holding that a position was not comparable despite identical salary and similar general area of expertise where position was considered inferior to the previous position in status and supervisory and budgetary authority.
we next address haggar appeal from the equitable relief granted palasota by the district court on remand.the adea vests the court with discretion to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.b.we therefore review the award of equitable remedies,such as front pay and reinstatement,for abuse of that discretion.deloach delchamps,cir.
the central purpose of the adea is mak ing the individual victim of discrimination whole.julian city of houston,cir.in structuring its remedies,the court may when justified include judgments compelling employment,reinstatement,or promotion.b.the court must take care,however,that its fashioned remedy only goes so far as to compensate the victim adea remedies are not meant to punish the defendant or award plaintiff a windfall.deloach,at.
in the case before us,the district court ordered both palasota reinstatement to the first available sales associate vacancy in dallas and ordered haggar to provide monthly front pay of until such reinstatement occurred.in addition,the district court ordered haggar to pay a lump sum award of front pay of to cover the months between the date of the verdict january,and the date of its order assigning equitable remedies january,in order to compensate palasota for the delay in rendering judgment on the jury verdict due to his first appeal.haggar argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding reinstatement and accompanying interim front pay and that the district court abused its discretion in awarding a lump sum of front pay we address each argument in turn.
the selection between reinstatement and front pay is discretionary with the trial court so long as the relief granted is consistent with the purposes of the adea.brunnemann,at.nevertheless,reinstatement is by far the preferred remedy in an adea case.hansard,at.as a result,the district court must consider and adequately articulate its reasons for finding reinstatement to be infeasible and for considering an award of front pay instead.julian,at see also walther lone star gas,cir deloach,at.in reviewing a district court decision to award reinstatement,we have considered a number of factors,including whether positions now exist comparable to the plaintiff former position and whether reinstatement would require an employer to displace an existing employee.see ray iuka special mun.separate sch,cir see also cassino reichhold chemicals,cir.we have also considered whether the plaintiff has changed careers and whether animosity exists between the plaintiff and his former employer.see ray,at deloach,at.in the present case,the district court stated only that the parties had demonstrated no great hostility or animosity,without discussing the other feasibility factors that should be considered or giving reasons for ordering both reinstatement and front pay.
our review of the record indicates that there is no sales position comparable to palasota former position at haggar to which he could be reinstated,and that rehiring palasota would require either termination of another employee or a decrease in each current employee sales territory and salary haggar present sales force is composed of associates,who work on commission and are not guaranteed a particular income.further,haggar introduced testimony indicating that palasota former position provided him with a broad range of clients,including individual stores tied to key accounts as well as smaller trade accounts divided up by territories.today,the trade accounts are divided among four sales associates the remaining associates manage the national key accounts.haggar can not provide palasota with a sales base similar to the one he originally managed to do so,the company would have to either eliminate a current employee tied to a key account,eliminate an employee tied to a trade account,or reduce each of the trade account territories by to create a new position thereby reducing compensation for the associates assigned to those territories.in addition,haggar managers testified at trial that the company has not hired any new associates since a round of layoffs in november.they indicated that the company does not plan to hire more and,furthermore,that more reductions are likely in the future.reinstating palasota,therefore,requires ousting reducing the compensation of innocent incumbents.we have held that,except under extraordinary circumstances not present here,innocent incumbents may not be displaced.see gamble birmingham southern,cir see also lander lujan,recognizing the state of fifth circuit law on this point.the fact that haggar lack of openings is not the result of employer recalcitrance,but rather of changes in the market and corporate management structure over the last two decades,reinforces our reluctance to order reinstatement in this case.
further,the record indicates the existence of numerous other factors suggesting that reinstatement is not feasible.first,haggar compensation structure is such that the company can no longer guarantee palasota the salary he earned in.palasota acknowledged in court that he would not be interested in returning to haggar for a yearly income of would be ambivalent about returning even if he earned a year.second,palasota left the clothing industry in to become a realtor by the time of trial he had opened his own brokerage business.finally,the record suggests some lingering animosity between the parties palasota alleges that haggar management attempted to him in the industry haggar alleges that palasota falsified expense reports while employed at haggar,an offense for which other haggar employees have allegedly been terminated.
for these reasons,we reverse the district court award of reinstatement and interim front pay and render judgment for haggar and against palasota on these issues.
haggar next argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding lump sum front pay again,an award of front pay is meant to compensate the plaintiff for wages and benefits he would have received from the defendant employer in the future if not for the discrimination.tyler,cir.unlike back pay,however,which compensates plaintiff for damage suffered between the date of injury and the date of final judgment in his favor,front pay is a prospective remedy that estimates the damage plaintiff will continue to suffer after the date of final judgment as a result of the wrongdoing.we have held that a substantial liquidated damage award may indicate that an additional award of front pay is inappropriate or excessive.walther,at.haggar now relies on walther to argue that palasota recovery of liquidated damages should bar his recovery of the additional lump sum of front pay.
the reasoning behind the principle stated in walther is that receipt of a substantial liquidated damage award further strengthens the court judgment that the plaintiff has already been made whole.hybert hearst,cir quoting rengers wclr radio station,see also walther,at.this court has emphasized that the size of a liquidated damages award is only an indicator of the propriety of front pay,not a bright line rule.shattuck kinetic concepts,cir.furthermore,the line of seventh circuit cases on which we have relied in crafting our rule notes that
