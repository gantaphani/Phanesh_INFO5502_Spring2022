helen odian died in january,leaving her entire estate to appellant catharina vulovic,who had been her paid companion for approximately two years before odian moved into a nursing home.the trial court found that vulovic hereafter sometimes appellant exercised undue influence to make herself the sole beneficiary of odian trusts,wills and annuities,and that odian lacked legal capacity when she executed the trusts and the annuity contracts.the court also found that appellant was a care custodian within the meaning of probate code section,and as such,was disqualified as a beneficiary of odian testamentary instruments.
in the published portion of this opinion,we address appellant contention that she was not a care custodian within the meaning of section.we conclude that the undisputed evidence demonstrates that appellant was a care custodian.because she failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence which arises from that fact,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
helen odian and her older sister,ruth,lived together their entire adult lives.neither married,and neither had children.although the sisters had modest incomes,they invested wisely.with the help of their financial advisor,richard robinson,who advised them from until,they amassed significant wealth.at the time of her death,helen estate was worth approximately million 
in,the sisters executed wills leaving their estates to each other and then to the seven charities which are parties to this action.in,ruth odian died.helen odian continued to rely on richard robinson for financial advice and tax preparation.he had a power of attorney for her bank account and wrote checks for certain items,such as estate tax and income tax payments.robinson and his wife,jessie,also had a social relationship with the odian sisters.after ruth death,their contact with helen increased.ruth had been the dominant sister and had made most of the decisions.after her death,the robinsons felt that they had to take care of helen to some degree and to reassure her that they would assist her if any problems arose.
helen had designated ruth the beneficiary of her ira individual retirement accounts.after ruth death,robinson advised helen to designate another beneficiary in order to avoid taking increased distributions from the ira.helen designated robinson.robinson agreed that she would donate the ira to charity after helen death.
in the spring of,jessie robinson suggested to helen that she get someone to help her.her home was cluttered and needed cleaning.in february,helen had hurt her back,and she had also lost her driver license.a mutual acquaintance told catharina vulovic that helen needed help with household tasks and transportation and encouraged her to contact helen.vulovic called helen and then met with her to discuss arrangements.
helen hired vulovic to do housework and laundry,cook,and drive her to appointments and on shopping trips.helen asked her to work from noon to seven days a week,for an hour.vulovic began working for helen on march.the initial plan was for vulovic to work only for one month.however,toward the end of march,helen asked vulovic to move in with her.jessie robinson liked vulovic and encouraged the arrangement.vulovic agreed to do so and to stay on for an additional four months.her rate of pay remained the same,as did the services she was to provide and the number of hours she was paid to work each day.at the end of the period,helen asked vulovic to stay permanently.after discussing it with her family,vulovic agreed.thereafter,helen paid her a week.
helen was very appreciative of vulovic assistance.she told friends and acquaintances that vulovic did everything for her and she appeared to look to vulovic more or less for help and guidance.she told her friend david gibson that she would not have lived as long if she had not had vulovic assistance and that she wanted to leave her estate to vulovic helen became acquainted with vulovic family and was invited to family gatherings,including the wedding of vulovic son.vulovic celebrated some holidays with helen and david gibson.vulovic children and grandchildren visited helen at home frequently,and helen enjoyed their visits.when helen was hospitalized,vulovic visited her every day.after helen was moved to a residential care facility,vulovic and her family visited her.however,helen never gave vulovic a birthday or christmas gift.
beginning in,vulovic began helping helen pay her bills.at first,vulovic merely wrote the checks at helen direction and helen signed them.eventually,helen gave her a power of attorney and vulovic began writing checks on helen account and signing them.in the middle of,helen accepted as payment in full of two promissory notes from kirk brown.however,helen and ruth had lent brown,and the notes were for each.when richard robinson learned that brown had paid helen for both notes,he reminded her that the loan was for.helen became very upset and said that she would not have accepted the money if she had known that.robinson prevailed upon brown to return the notes,and returned the to him.helen remained upset about the incident for several weeks,and had to be reminded several times that it had been resolved.
both robinsons had noticed that helen memory was failing.richard robinson had noticed that helen could carry on a normal conversation but that within a few minutes,she would not remember what they had talked about.jessie robinson also began to notice that helen was having difficulty expressing herself.if she was asked a yes or no question,she could respond,but if she was asked a more complex question,she had greater difficulty responding.
in the summer of,robinson suggested to helen that she create a living trust to avoid probate of her estate.she agreed,and told him that she wanted the trust proceeds to go to the seven charities that were the beneficiaries of her will.robinson was concerned about helen capacity to make a trust,but he concluded that he could proceed because helen was not changing beneficiaries but merely avoiding probate.late in,helen told him that she wanted to leave her mobile home to vulovic.robinson did not question that,because the mobile home was a small part of helen estate.
robinson arranged to have the trust and will prepared by the attorney who prepared helen earlier will.he made an appointment with helen for march,for her to sign the trust documents and the will and to discuss her taxes.however,on march,robinson received a faxed letter from helen cancelling the appointment and stating that helen intended to write her own will.vulovic wrote the letter and helen signed it.the robinsons subsequent efforts to contact helen failed.she did not respond to any of their letters or return any of their telephone calls.helen directed her mutual fund company to cease sending statements to robinson,as they had for years.
on february,helen executed a will,trust,power of attorney and durable power of attorney and living will using forms.vulovic filled in all of the information and helen signed the documents.the will and trust left helen entire estate to vulovic.the will was witnessed by helen friend david gibson and by her neighbor,carolyn mcmullen.however,when helen took the documents to mail depot plus to be notarized,the witnesses signatures could not be notarized because they were not present.two customers at the store the will and their signatures were notarized.the witnesses and the notary all testified that helen appeared to be in control of the situation and did not appear to be acting under the influence or at the direction of vulovic.
in march,a representative of family first advanced estate planning services family first,called helen home,asking for ruth.vulovic took the call,and made an appointment to have a representative visit helen to discuss estate planning.sean perry,a commissioned salesman with little training in estate planning,visited helen shortly thereafter.helen told him that she did not understand or thought there might be some problem with the will and trust she had executed on february.she told him that she needed help getting money back from kirk brown,even though robinson had resolved that matter months earlier.helen purchased a group legal services plan and submitted an estate planning application to family first,along with the february will and trust,to be reviewed by an attorney.
despite concerns about helen competence,a group legal services attorney prepared a new will and a restated trust for helen.a representative of family first delivered the documents to helen on april.after he reviewed the will with her,helen executed the will.on may,the family first representative visited helen and went over the restated trust,which she then executed,along with documents transferring assets to the trust.
during the april meeting,the family first representative discussed with helen the safety of her mutual fund ira investment in american funds.helen told him she was concerned about the market and potential loss of value of the funds and that she needed additional income.he suggested that she transfer the ira to fixed annuities.helen agreed,and he helped her prepare an application for the annuities.ultimately,helen transferred her american funds mutual fund ira,amounting to nearly million,to two annuities.helen made vulovic the successor beneficiary of the annuities,followed by vulovic three children.
in late april,richard robinson reported his concerns about helen to adult protective services.he spoke to investigator larry smith.smith job was to do initial assessments to determine whether a person has the mental capability to make his or her own decisions.he had done approximately such assessments,approximately half of which resulted in the conclusion that the person did not need further evaluation.
smith visited helen on the morning of may.he spent to minutes with her.he initially was unable to converse with helen.it appeared that she had no difficulty hearing him,but when she tried to respond to his questions,she appeared to be unable to do so.she was able to ask him to sit down and to say ok,i guess when he asked how she was.after a few minutes,vulovic joined them.thereafter,she responded to all of the questions smith directed to helen.she told him,you have to excuse helen.she has a hard time completing sentences and explaining what she wants.smith concluded that a professional evaluation was necessary in order to determine helen mental capacity.he set up an appointment with helen physician for an evaluation.however,helen did not keep the appointment.smith contacted the county public guardian and requested a professional evaluation.
robert sawicky,a psychologist with approximately years of experience in performing forensic evaluations to assess mental capacity,was asked by the office of the riverside county public guardian to conduct a conservatorship evaluation on helen,including issues of undue influence and legal and testamentary capacity.he was qualified to assess dementia.on may,he visited helen in her home.the visit was unannounced.sawicky spent about two and a half hours observing helen,conversing with her and conducting the formal assessment.he observed that she appeared to be very dependent.vulovic was with her the entire time she was getting dressed and groomed,and although he did not directly observe their activities,he had the sense that helen needed assistance with her grooming and hygiene activities.when she came into the kitchen,she said she was hungry.pat puliafico,a public guardian probate investigator who was present,prepared a pop tart and fed it to helen.helen passively accepted being fed,as though it was a commonplace occurrence.
helen was initially uncomfortable and guarded in speaking to sawicky,but after some conversation and explanation as to the purpose of the visit,she warmed up and became comfortable enough for him to conduct the evaluation.he observed that her speech was a bit disjointed,that she was not capable of real discourse.she would sometimes derail herself midsentence,and would sometimes shift gears and make what seems like a bit of a tangential statement in the context of what she was saying.she sometimes appeared to refrain from answering a question if she found it too difficult to answer.she did not give direct responses to sawicky questions about where she grew up,where she went to school and about her family.she later volunteered that she had a sister,ruth,who had died recently.she could not remember,or could not produce,vulovic name until sawicky prompted her.she volunteered the information that she had had a stroke.she did not appear to have any difficulty hearing him.helen was aware of her difficulties in completing sentences and retrieving words and was frustrated by it.however,she could still make herself understood.
helen told sawicky that vulovic does everything for me.she said that vulovic had wanted to take charge of and money management,and that she had let her do so.she said that the robinsons used to be in charge,but that they stopped coming around and did give her any records.when sawicky first mentioned the robinsons,helen spontaneous reaction was to gush,display a spontaneous positive emotional response.she said that robinson had made her a lot of money.however,she said that after vulovic came to her,she came to believe that robinson had overcharged her.
helen was aware that she had a checking account and a savings account,but could not tell sawicky the name of her bank.she did not know the amount of money in either account.she did not know of any other investments or the amount of money involved in any investments.she was unable to perform arithmetic.when asked if she had a will or a trust,she replied that she had a trust.she said that the proceeds of the trust were to go to charity.she said that the trust was made in accordance with my wishes.sawicky was startled to hear her use such a formal phrasing and found it hard to imagine that helen had come up with that statement independently.
sawicky concluded that helen suffered from mild to moderate expressive difficulty in retrieving well as difficulty in organizing information.she also had attention and concentration problems,and both and memory problems.he concluded that she suffered from moderate dementia.he also concluded that she was very dependent and that as a result of that,along with her cognitive impairments,she was vulnerable to undue influence.finally,he concluded that she lacked testamentary and legal capacity and needed a probate conservatorship of her person and of her estate.based on his contact with her in may,he did not believe that she had legal or testamentary capacity when she executed the wills,trusts and annuity contracts.
sawicky acknowledged that helen friends and acquaintances did not believe that she was cognitively impaired,and that people who had witnessed her wills or notarized her signatures had testified that helen did not appear to be impaired.however,he doubted that such people had asked her pointed questions to elicit her level of functioning,and that people would normally be tolerant of deficiencies in word retrieval and other communication difficulties in an woman.he pointed out that helen was capable of casual conversation and had even made a joke,which both he and she found funny,during his conversation with her.thus,her communication abilities might appear normal in casual conversation.
james spar,a geriatric psychiatrist,reviewed helen medical records,sawicky reports and other documents,but did not interview helen.he generally agreed with sawicky conclusions,assuming that his observations were correct.he disagreed that helen was totally dependent,but concluded from all the material that he read that she was moderately dependent.he concluded that helen was extremely vulnerable to undue influence and that her impairment began way before february.he did not disagree with sawicky conclusions that helen lacked testamentary and legal capacity at least as early as february.he disagreed with the testimony of vulovic expert,victoroff,that sawicky methodology in conducting his evaluation of helen was seriously flawed.he concluded that victoroff assumed that helen aphasia was more severe than it actually was.he also concurred that helen ability to appear normal in casual conversations or brief interactions would be expected at her level of cognitive impairment.
on may,helen regular doctor,raja,administered a mental examination,which showed that helen had moderate cognitive impairment.raja was surprised,based on his interactions with helen.cat scans raja had ordered previously showed that helen probably had a stroke in but had not had any additional strokes since then.
the riverside county public guardian was appointed helen conservator in june.in august,helen was hospitalized,and then moved to a residential care facility.she died on january.
vulovic filed a petition to probate helen will dated february,as well as her will,dated april.richard robinson filed a petition to probate helen will and contested the wills and sought to invalidate the trusts and the annuities.the seven charities that were beneficiaries of helen will joined.vulovic and her sons contested the petitions.robinson,the charities and the attorney general answered the contest.
the court found that the february,form will,the february,trust,the april,will,the may,restated trust and the two annuities were invalid as the products of undue influence on helen odian by catharina vulovic that the february,trust,the may,restated trust and the two annuities were invalid because helen odian lacked legal capacity to execute them and that catharina vulovic and her family were disqualified as beneficiaries by operation of probate code section et.the court denied vulovic petition for probate of the wills and granted the petitions to probate the will and to invalidate the trusts and annuities.
vulovic filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
code section,subdivision a bars all donative transfers to appellant and her sonsa.appellant was a care custodian within the meaning of probate code section,subdivision a 
probate code section subdivision a provides that no provision,or provisions,of any instrument shall be valid to make any donative transfer to any of the following a care custodian of a dependent adult who is the transferor,subd.a.section does not apply if t he court determines,upon clear and convincing evidence,but not based solely upon the testimony of any person described in subdivision a of section,that the transfer was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence,subd.d.thus,if appellant was a care custodian,all donative transfers to her were presumptively barred by probate code section,subdivision a.bernard foley cal th,d.transfers to her sons as successor beneficiaries of the annuities would be barred as well.
because our analysis requires us to interpret the meaning of section,we review the matter de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods.cal th,d,appellate courts independently determine the proper interpretation of a statute.
the term care custodian has the meaning as set forth in section of the welfare and institutions code,subd.c.as pertinent to this case,the welfare and institutions code defines care custodian as any person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults.welf,subd.y.
appellant does not dispute that odian was a dependent adult within the meaning of section,subdivision a however,appellant contends that she was not a care custodian as a matter of law for three reasons because she had a personal relationship with odian,because she was not a professional caregiver,and because she did not provide the kind of services which define a care custodian role.
appellant relied primarily on conservatorship of davidson th,d davidson to contend that her personal relationship with odian excluded her from disqualification.in davidson,the court of appeal held that in enacting section,subdivision a hereafter section a,the legislature did not intend to apply the presumption of undue influence to individuals who have assumed the role of care custodian to a dependent adult,if that role evolves naturally out of a personal relationship with the dependent adult which preexisted the role.however,if the personal relationship is entirely incidental,secondary to,and derived from the preexisting professional or occupational connection as caregiver,section a presumptively bars any donative transfer.davidson,supra,th at,d accord,conservatorship of mcdowell th,d.
after the conclusion of briefing but before oral argument in this case,the california supreme court issued its opinion in bernard foley,supra,cal th,d,bernard.in bernard,the court analyzed the purpose underlying section a and concluded that the legislature did not intend to exclude caregivers who had preexisting personal relationships with the decedent from the classes of individuals to whom the presumption of undue influence applies.bernard,at,d.accordingly,it disapproved davidson as well as conservatorship of mcdowell,supra,th,d,and estate of shinkle th,d,to the extent they interpreted section as allowing for a preexisting personal friendship exception.bernard,at,fn,d.we note,however,that even under davidson,the transfers to appellant were presumptively barred because it was undisputed that appellant relationship with odian resulted from her employment by odian,and not the converse.davidson,supra,th at,d.
bernard also addressed appellant contention that section a was intended to apply only to professional caregivers,and concluded that nothing in the statute structure,terms or language authorizes us to impose a professional or occupational limitation on the definition of care custodian as defined in welfare and institutions code section.bernard,supra,cal th at,d.the court further concluded that the legislative history of section buttressed its conclusion.bernard,at,d.thus,the fact that appellant had never previously worked as a caregiver and was arguably not a professional caregiver,even though she was being paid for her services to odian,is immaterial to her claim that she was not a care custodian within the meaning of section a.
finally,we address appellant contention that the services she provided to odian were not of the type which define the function of a care custodian.
as noted above,section a adopts the definition of care custodian found in welfare and institutions code section,subd.c.as pertinent here,subdivision y of welfare and institutions code section defines care custodian as a ny person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults.appellant contends that davidson,supra,th,d holds that services such as cooking,cleaning,shopping and driving do not amount to health or social services of a care custodian.based on that understanding of davidson,she contends that the services she provided do not amount to health or social services within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision y 
leaving aside,for the moment,the fact that the trial court found that appellant provided significantly greater services than cooking,cleaning and shopping,we note that the court in davidson did not actually hold that services such as those are not social services within the meaning of the statute.in davidson,the court found,primarily,that the beneficiary of the estate was not a care custodian because his role as the decedent caregiver arose naturally from his friendship with her and not from his employment as a caregiver.davidson,supra,th at,d,discussed ante.secondarily,the court questioned whether services such as cooking,gardening,running errands,providing transportation,grocery shopping and providing assistance with banking could be equated with social services.it concluded that e ven if the kind of unsophisticated care and attention that the beneficiary provided could be described as constituting health and social services id.at,d,italics added,the beneficiary in that case was nevertheless not a care custodian because the unpaid services he provided allowed the decedent to continue to live independently,in her own home while the beneficiary maintained his own home,and the beneficiary had no professional expertise or occupational experience in providing such services.ibid.for the latter reason alone,the court held,the beneficiary did not qualify as a care custodian under section and welfare and institution
