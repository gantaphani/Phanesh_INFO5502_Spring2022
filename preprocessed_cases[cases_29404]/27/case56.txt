geneva goff appeals from the district court order affirming the commissioner of social security denial of her application for disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits.goff claims she is disabled because two strokes have affected her walking,motor capabilities,and speech.she also claims she suffers from depression.on appeal,goff argues the administrative law judge alj erred by failing to give proper weight to the opinions of goff treating physician and psychiatrist,discounting her subjective complaints of pain,and finding goff could perform the work of a companion or personal assistant.we affirm the decision of the district court.
in october,goff suffered a stroke.following her stroke,she was neurologically normal and her condition was stable.in january,goff sought help for depression.in march,goff suffered a second stroke.during this time,she had been working as a certified nurse assistant cna.she continued work as a cna until january,when she was fired for allegedly slapping a resident.from early through the hearing,goff worked approximately fifteen hours per week as a kitchen aide.goff filed for disability benefits on january,and for supplemental security income on february,alleging she became disabled beginning january.goff claimed she was unable to work because multiple strokes caused slurred speech and balance problems.additionally,she claimed she suffered from depression.
the alj determined goff met the disability insured status requirements of the social security act on january,and continued to meet them through at least december.the alj found goff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since january.the alj further determined goff suffered severe impairments in combination,consisting of degenerative changes in her knees,more severe on the left obesity status post strokes from with dysarthria depression and hearing loss amenable to improvement with a hearing aid.however,the alj found goff impairments did not meet the social security income listings.
while the alj concluded goff was unable to perform past relevant work,the alj found goff still retained the residual functional capacity rfc to perform work which was limited to lifting pounds frequently and pounds occasionally,and standing walking no more than six hours of an day.the alj determined goff should avoid very complex and detailed work,but found she was capable of performing more than merely simple,routine,and repetitive work.in determining goff rfc,the alj found goff was years old,which is defined as a individual she had a high school education and she had acquired work skills which were transferable to the skilled or work functions of other work,including feeding and transporting individuals,record keeping,and assisting with activity of daily living.
further,in determining goff rfc,the alj concluded the hearing testimony regarding the intensity and severity of goff symptoms was not fully credible.at the hearing,goff testified about the severe pain she experienced after working.the alj discounted goff subjective complaints because they were inconsistent with the record as a whole.the alj also found that goff limitations related to her speech and depression were not severe,and her seizures had been controlled with medicine.additionally,the alj found no evidence goff could not afford pain medication.
the alj also discounted certain opinions from two of goff treating sources.in early,both christopher okiishi,goff treating psychiatrist,and matthew prihoda,goff treating physician,submitted rfc assessments,where they backed goff claim of significant limitations.the alj did not request clarification from either doctor.instead,the alj discounted both opinions,citing inconsistencies with other objective medical evidence,goff activity level,and her work history.
accordingly,a vocational expert ve,considering goff age,education,previous work experience,and rfc,determined jobs still existed in significant numbers in the national economy that goff could perform.the ve cited personal attendant and companion as examples of such jobs.as such,the alj determined goff was not under a disability as defined by the social security act.
this court reviews de novo a district court decision upholding the commissioner denial of social security benefits.reed barnhart,cir citation omitted.the court will affirm the alj decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.tellez barnhart,cir citation omitted.substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support the commissioner conclusion.young apfel,cir.evidence that both supports and detracts from the alj decision should be considered,and an administrative decision is not subject to reversal simply because some evidence may support the opposite conclusion.davis apfel,cir.if,after reviewing the record,the court finds it is possible to draw two inconsistent positions from the evidence and one of those positions represents the alj findings,the court must affirm the alj decision.pearsall massanari,cir.
the commissioner regulations governing determinations of disability set forth a sequential evaluation process which the commissioner must use in assessing disability claims.see stormo barnhart,cir citing a f.
during the process,the alj considers whether the claimant is gainfully employed,whether the claimant has a severe impairment,whether the impairment meets the criteria of any social security income listings,whether the impairment prevents the claimant from performing past relevant work,and whether the impairment necessarily prevents the claimant from doing any other work.
eichelberger barnhart,cir citation omitted.if a claimant fails to meet the criteria at any step in the evaluation of disability,the process ends and the claimant is determined to be not disabled.the fourth step in this analysis requires the alj to determine a claimant rfc.id.at.a disability claimant has the burden to establish her rfc.id.at citing masterson barnhart,cir.if the claimant establishes her inability to do past relevant work,then the burden of proof shifts to the commissioner.id.the commissioner must then prove,first that the claimant retains the rfc to do other kinds of work,and,second that other work exists in substantial numbers in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform.id.citing nevland apfel,cir.moreover,t he burden of persuasion to prove disability and to demonstrate rfc remains on the claimant,even when the burden of production shifts to the commissioner at step five.stormo,at.
goff contends the alj,in determining her rfc,erred by not giving proper weight to the opinions of her treating physician and her treating psychiatrist.a treating physician opinion is given controlling weight if it is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence.reed,at quotations and citations omitted.a treating physician opinion do es not automatically control,since the record must be evaluated as a whole.bentley shalala,cir.an alj may discount or even disregard the opinion of a treating physician where other medical assessments are supported by better or more thorough medical evidence,or where a treating physician renders inconsistent opinions that undermine the credibility of such opinions.prosch apfel,cir.
in august,prihoda,goff treating physician,submitted an rfc assessment,where he found,among other things,that goff could only stand or walk for two to three minutes at one time,could seldom reach with her upper extremities,and could handle objects for less than two hours of an work day.the alj,finding the opinion inconsistent with other substantial evidence,discounted it.the alj pointed out goff testified she worked shifts for fifteen to hours a week as a kitchen helper,where she was on her feet for about two hours at a time,stacked dishes,lifted sacks of potatoes,and lifted ice buckets.we find this testimony to be substantial,indeed compelling,evidence inconsistent with prihoda assessment.as such,the alj is not required to give the assessment controlling weight.while the alj also foun
