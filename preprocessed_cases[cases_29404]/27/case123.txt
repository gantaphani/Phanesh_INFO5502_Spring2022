following a bench trial,the trial court convicted christi schoenbachler of grand theft and financial elder abuse,both felonies,and two counts of misdemeanor elder abuse.she claims that there was insufficient evidence for the court to impose the misdemeanor convictions,but that if we disagree then the sentences on those counts must be stayed.as a second alternative,she claims that the trial court erred in convicting her of certain of the crimes as multiple offenses when they constituted but a single offense.
we will order the abstract of judgment modified to stay one sentence,but affirm the judgment as so modified.
procedural background 
the trial court convicted defendant of financial abuse of an elder former,subd.e stats,ch,and grand theft,subd.a,both felonies,and two misdemeanor counts of elder abuse,subd.c.it sentenced her to two years in prison.
defendant and her mother,lisa karen macadams,are the granddaughter and daughter of the victim,elsie brooks,who was in her seventies at the time of the crimes.they drained brooks fortune either without her knowledge or by coercion when she lived with or near them in monterey county from to,eventually reducing her to and,having so reduced her,abandoning her 
brooks had been living independently and in good mental and physical health in san luis obispo county when she moved to monterey county in to live with defendant and macadams.she had managed her own finances in san luis obispo county and had long shared her financial bounty with her family,including defendant,macadams,and a son to whom she lent a loan on which he soon defaulted.
when brooks moved to monterey county,she had considerable cash on hand.she had sold her prior residence,a mobile home,for a profit.she had an annuity worth,and she owned a collection of jewelry and gold coins worth about,according to her estimate at trial.she also had social security income of per month.
brooks gave defendant and macadams authority to draw checks on her bank account with the understanding that they would handle her finances in a responsible and fiduciary manner.she wanted them to handle the finances so that she would not have to deal with them.however,on one occasion she asked to see the bank records and defendant and macadams put her off,telling her not to concern herself about them.
at one point brooks checked herself into a care center called sun bridge for physical therapy.brooks liked to consume alcohol and also hoped that the stay at sun bridge would cure her of the habit.she was there for about two months.at the same time,defendant and macadams,with brooks knowledge,vacated the residence they had shared with brooks.when brooks emerged,she discovered that defendant and macadams had sold some to of her jewelry and her furniture acts that she had not authorized.
when brooks left sun bridge,defendant and macadams declined to have brooks live with them,asserting that they could not accommodate her.they moved her to a facility called tender loving care,a facility that was,filthy,and the abode of other residents who suffered from alzheimer disease and would scream throughout the night.
defendant told brooks that the only way for her to leave the tender loving care facility was for her to authorize the liquidation of her annuity.in desperation,brooks agreed to the plan.the annuity was redeemed for.brooks expected that the money would be used solely to fund her living expenses,but defendant and macadams also used it for their own purposes,including payment of rent and business expenses,without brooks authorization.
part of the annuity money was used,however,to rent a condominium for brooks and another individual in pacific grove,with a arrangement.later,the other tenant moved out and defendant and macadams moved in,sharing the condominium with brooks.
eventually brooks confronted defendant with an ultimatum that she would give her family members no more money.defendant and macadams replied that in that case within three days brooks would be returned to sun bridge which had been renamed the monterey care center,confined in a hospital,or taken away by the police.brooks went back to the monterey care center.
on this point,brooks testified as follows on direct examination 
defendant had plans to go to harvard and move back east,and everybody moving right along,and and it just did sit well with me,because of what i just went through for the last year and some,and i said,no,no more money.
q.you said that to defendant 
i said that to defendant,yes.
okay.and so what happened when you told her she was going to get this money 
well,i was told three days,i either was going to be taken away by the police,or i could go to the peninsula hospital,again,and go into monterey care center,which was formerly sun bridge.
q.so they gave you three days to get out 
pack up what i could and get out.
and so what did you do 
i did want to go to the police,and i did want to be standing in the street,so i went to the hospital.
and when you went to the,to the hospital to check in,what were you able to bring with you 
just my suitcase,with a few clothes and my toothbrush,if you will,and that it.
some months later,monterey care center staff called brooks to the facility front door,informing her that some members of the family were throwing containers and different things.brooks saw defendant,macadams,and another relative throw boxes of clothing and other items,including her jewelry box,from a van.the lock on the jewelry box was broken and the box was empty.when brooks gestured to macadams to come over and talk with her,macadams waved,got into the van,and departed with defendant.brooks did not see either of her two descendants again until the time of trial.
brooks remaining property consisted of the material defendant and the others had discarded onto the sidewalk three containers of belongings,two boxes of clothing,and the rifled jewelry box.one of the unwanted containers contained family albums,and macadams little baby pictures,which i have,and bronze shoes.brooks stood on the sidewalk and soon began to cry.
thereafter brooks returned to san luis obispo county,where she resumed living independently and once again managed her own finances.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence of the elder abuse misdemeanors 
defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to convict her on the two misdemeanor elder abuse counts.
this claim relates to the tender loving care and the monterey care center residential facilities at which brooks resided while under the influence of defendant and macadams.the record shows that the dates on which defendant committed elder abuse under subdivision c of section ranged from approximately march to may of,when brooks was at tender loving care,and july of to march of,when she was at the monterey care center.
regarding tender loving care,brooks testified as follows 
q.did you ever ask them to get you out 
oh,yes,all the time.
okay.what did you say to macadams 
well,i want to get out of this place.it just a nightmare,and they did have a place for me to go.
and what did macadams say when you asked to get out 
nothing much,just that they struggling and trying to keep the business together,and there just was a place for me to go.
regarding brooks second relevant period of institutional care,at the monterey care center,she and the prosecutor had this exchange 
h ow long were you in the monterey care center 
eight months.
q.during that eight months,did macadams ever come visit you 
q.did defendant ever come visit you 
q.did they ever write you letters 
q.did they ever call 
send a birthday card 
do you know how the monterey care center was being paid for 
i believe medicare and my s ocial s ecurity.
brooks also testified about defendant and her entourage discarding of her possessions on the sidewalk outside the monterey care center 
outside,they have a white fence around the the gate,and it a low fence as you come into the care center,and that where the social worker summoned me to come and see what was going on,which i did.
and when you got outside,you said you saw macadams and jan schoenbachler and defendant 
q.did they come over and talk to you 
do you know if they saw you 
i was standing in the front and they could miss me,as they were jumping into the van,after they threw the stuff at the front door,and macadams was the last one to enter the vehicle,and i asked her to come and talk to me,and i motioned,w ould you come and talk to me,and she waved back,later,and jumped in the van,and i never saw any of them again.
the prosecutor how far away from you was the van 
like between you and i sic,the distance.
okay.and did they make eye contact with you,did they look at you 
oh,macadams saw me,definitely.defendant had a way to look away,she jumped in the vehicle,and jan schoenbachler jumped in the other side,and macadams was the last to get into the van.
the monterey care center social services director,brenda lee lopez stood alongside brooks at the scene of the dumping of brooks few remaining belongings onto the sidewalk 
w hat was brooks doing when this was going on 
a.she tried to talk to her daughter macadams,and they totally blew us off.
and how did she react when they did that 
a.when i got her back in there,she was crying.
and what was she upset about 
because she wanted to talk to her daughter.
during closing argument,the prosecutor argued as follows count is the mental suffering for brooks stay at tlc.she testified as to the conditions of the place,her isolation,her abandonment,her duress to sign over the annuity.she testified as to the mental suffering she endured while she stayed in tlc,and the d efendants clearly ignored her pleas and begs to be removed from the facility.even after she signed over,they left her there another two months.
count is the mental suffering,the monterey care center abandonment.she was left in a facility she did not need to be in not one visit or call the entire time,from july of to march of.both d efendants were still in the community,did not make one visit or call,did not return calls,left her with one suitcase.when they did show up,they would not talk to her.they ignored her,left her crying on the sidewalk,with her few boxes of all she had left in the world.
earlier,in answering an objection by defense counsel during brooks testimony,the prosecutor had made a similar point your honor,one of the charges is the misdemeanor elder abuse,causing pain and suffering on an elder.in this case,the victim was left at tlc,a facility that she did not need to be in,but was left there by both her daughter and her granddaughter,who refused to get her out of that facility.and i also setting the stage for the embezzlement of the annuity,in that the victim was desperate to get out of this facility,and that was the only reason she agreed to cash out said annuity was to get out of this facility.
as for the two felony counts,the prosecutor explained,count,section e,felony financial abuse of an elder is the embezzlement,so count is as to the annuity,and count,grand theft,is as to the jewelry.
under the federal constitution due process clause,there is sufficient evidence to support defendant convictions if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.this test does not require a court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.citation.instead,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.t he court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence that is,evidence which is reasonable,credible,and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people johnson cal d.the court does not,however,limit its review to the evidence favorable to the respondent o ur task is twofold.first,we must resolve the issue in the light of the whole record,the entire picture of the defendant put before the jury and may not limit our appraisal to isolated bits of evidence selected by the respondent.second,we must judge whether the evidence of each of the essential elements is substantial it is not enough for the respondent simply to point to some evidence supporting the finding,for not every surface conflict of evidence remains substantial in the light of other facts.id.at.
at the relevant times,two versions of subdivision c of section were in effect.they differ little.beginning in,the statute provided in pertinent part any person who knows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder or dependent adult and who,under circumstances or conditions other than those likely to produce great bodily harm or death,willfully causes or permits any elder or dependent adult to suffer,or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering,or having the care or custody of any elder or dependent adult,willfully causes or permits the person or health of the elder or dependent adult to be injured or willfully causes or permits the elder or dependent adult to be placed in a situation in which his or her person or health may be endangered,is guilty of a misdemeanor.the italicized language reflects the change that became effective on january.stats,ch.the change does not affect the strength of defendant claim 
in,when defendant committed financial elder abuse,subdivision e of section provided any caretaker of an elder or a dependent adult who violates any provision of law proscribing theft or embezzlement,with respect to the property of that elder or dependent adult,is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year,or in the state prison for two,three,or four years when the money,labor,or real or personal property taken is of a value exceeding four hundred dollars,and by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars,by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year,or by both that fine and imprisonment,when the money,labor,or real or personal property taken is of a value not exceeding four hundred dollars.stats,ch.
defendant argues that the evidence and prosecutor closing argument establish her nonfeasance and may also establish a third party malfeasance,but neither can supply a basis for criminal liability.as she interprets the proceedings,the prosecution showed that brooks complaints about living at tender loving care and the monterey care center were that the management at tender loving care was atrocious and that defendant was inattentive to brooks while brooks was at the monterey care center.at oral argument,counsel for defendant emphasized this point.counsel also argued that the coercion regarding the annuity while brooks was at tender loving care was the basis for the resulting felony elder financial abuse conviction under former subdivision e of section and was an embezzlement but not an instance of mental cruelty.
as noted,brooks testimony about tender loving care was that it was uninhabitable,but she did not testify that defendant or macadams acted affirmatively to make it uninhabitable.part of her testimony pointed instead to defendant and macadams indifference to her stay there.
given this partial description of the evidence,defendant point is that our supreme court has construed a roughly parallel statute to require a prior duty of care,some sort of special relationship that creates a legal duty before an individual can be punished for neglecting to aid an elderly adult,as opposed to acting to place the adult in danger or discomfort.
in people heitzman cal th,d,heitzman,the court examined former subdivision a of section stats,ch,which may be loosely described as the version of the misdemeanor statute under which the trial court here convicted defendant.
heitzman,supra,cal th,d,restated the rule that nonfeasance generally does not give rise to criminal liability.w hen an individual criminal liability is based on the failure to act,it is well established that he or she must first be under an existing legal duty to take positive action.id.at,d.the legal consequence of t he of one who has no legal duty to act is nothing.id.at,d.this rule applies to adult children and their parents.prefatorily,there is no common law obligation on adult children to protect and care for their aging parents.id.at,d,fn.omitted.with regard to any further requirements of statutory law,in order for criminal liability to arise for permitting an elder to suffer unjustifiable pain or suffering,a defendant must stand in a special relationship to the individual inflicting the abuse on the elder such that the defendant is under an existing duty to supervise and control that individual conduct.ibid.a fortiori,under heitzman an adult child can also be liable if the child was the caretaker in other words,heitzman applies to a person with actual custody and control over the dependent or with the legal duty to control the person with custody or control quigley first church of christ,scientist th,d lead opn.of bedsworth,a defendant can not be guilty of elder abuse based on a failure to prevent abuse,unless the defendant had either care and custody of the victim or a duty to control the conduct of the perpetrator.people culuko th,d.
in heitzman,supra,cal th,d,the defendant was a daughter who,when visiting her father,would witness his deteriorating condition amid noisome squalor but failed to help him.her nonfeasance did not make her criminally liable.id.at,d.as stated,heitzman considered a statutory provision that roughly parallels the misdemeanor elder abuse provision at issue here.defendant argues that she is in essentially the same factual position regarding the conditions at tender loving care as a moral matter she might have done better to take action to improve brooks situation,but,not having a duty of care toward brooks,her failure to act does not lead to criminal liability.
this case,however,differs from heitzman,supra,cal th,d.unlike the defendant in heitzman,defendant did not simply observe someone else abuse of an elder and take no action.she injected herself into brooks miserable living conditions and exploited the situation.she leveraged brooks unhappiness by telling her that the price brooks must pay for escaping from tender loving care was the liquidation of her annuity,and by that point brooks had reason to know that defendant would take full advantage of the funds that became available.brooks annuity was,inescapably,a source of solace to her she was not a woman of vast financial resources and forcing her to relinquish it on pain of continued suffering at tender loving care was an affirmative act to cause despair and benefit from its fruits.defendant is correct that her action constituted an embezzlement,but is incorrect that it was only an embezzlement.former subdivision e of section stats,ch,could,obviously,be violated without the intention to inflict any kind of distress to achieve the goal of theft.in people catley th,d,for example,the perpetrator took advantage of the victim cognitive deficits to defraud him surreptitiously,without employing cruelties.id.at,d.defendant committed embezzlement,but also acted to willfully cause or permit any elder or dependent adult to suffer,or inflict thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering,subd.c.the latter constituted misdemeanor elder abuse.
if nonfeasance were all there was to the episode,heitzman might compel reversal of one of the counts.we recognize that the prosecution arguments and statements focused on nonfeasance,defendant failure to act to extract brooks from tender loving care.however,the trial court statement at the time it found defendant guilty was nebulous about the bases for the convictions it handed down,neither affirming nor rejecting the prosecution nonfeasance theory.the court stated that there no doubt in the court mind that these d efendants are guilty of what they accused of.they used this lady money,without her consent,or if she gave consent,it was,in many cases,manipulated,such as the situation with the annuity.and they both participated.they both took her money,without authorization,used it,without her authorization,and whatever they did with it,they had no right to do it.so the court finds each of them guilty as to each count.
in such circumstances,in which the court made no statement that it was relying on an erroneous theory and did not display that it misunderstood the law,we assume that the court applied applicable law to the evidence and did not rely on a flawed argument.people raley cal th,d,also weighed a claim resting in part on the prosecution statement to the jury of its theory of the case.raley stated that the prosecution argument was beside the point.id.at,d.a trier of fact,whether judge or jury,is not bound to accept the prosecutor argument see also people howard cal th,d,likewise stating that the jury was not bound in any event to accept the prosecutor argument.rather,the trier of fact is bound to consider the evidence and the law the question is whether any rational trier of fact,having heard the evidence and been properly instructed in the law,could find defendant guilty,regardless of what the prosecution argues.a rational trier of fact could find defendant guilty of both elder abuse offenses in light of the state of the law and the evidence presented.
in sum,the evidence most favorable to the prosecution showed that in the two episodes that led to the charges in counts and,defendant willfully cause d or permit ted any elder or dependent adult to suffer,or inflict ed thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering,subd.c.the evidence was substantial,reasonable,credible,and of solid value,and hence sufficient people johnson,supra,cal d at,for purposes of this inquiry.we reject defendant claim.
ii.staying sentence on the elder abuse misdemeanors 
defendant claims that the trial court should have stayed her misdemeanor elder abuse sentences under section to the extent that they are based on the embezzlement of the annuity cash out and the theft of the jewelry.
section,subdivision a,provides in pertinent part an act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment,but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.
the test for determining whether section prohibits multiple punishment has long been established whether a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section depends on the intent and objective of the actor.if all of the offenses were incident to one objective,the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one.people britt cal th,d.
whether section applies in a given case is a question of fact for the trial court,which is vested with broad latitude in making its determination.citations.its findings will not be reversed on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to support them.citations.we review the trial court determination in the light most favorable to the respondent and presume the existence of every fact the trial court could reasonably deduce from the evidence.citation.people jones th,d.
despite the deference described in people jones,supra,th,d,defendant is correct that she had only one criminal intent and objective when visiting brooks at tender loving care she wanted to gain control of brooks annuity.where a trial court erroneously fails to stay terms subject to section,the appellate court must stay sentence on the lesser offenses while permitting execution of the greater offense consistent with the intent of the sentencing court.people pena th,d.therefore,punishment must be stayed on the misdemeanor elder abuse conviction resting on brooks stay at tender loving care.we will order the abstract of judgment modified accordingly 
the foregoing is not true of the other misdemeanor elder abuse conviction,however.to repeat,we must presume the existence of every fact the trial court could reasonably deduce from the evidence.people jones,supra,th at,d.the trial court could reasonably deduce from the evidence that defendant had two in
