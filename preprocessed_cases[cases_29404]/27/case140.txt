introduction 
after an evidentiary hearing,the trial court issued a protective order under the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act welf,et elder abuse act,prohibiting diana gdowski from contacting,striking,or otherwise abusing her father,michael gdowski,and requiring her to stay away from his residence 
diana argues the trial court erred by issuing the protective order because no evidence was presented that diana posed an immediate threat of future abuse against michael.we hold a protective order under the elder abuse act may be issued on the basis of evidence of past abuse,without any particularized showing that the wrongful acts will be continued or repeated.
diana also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the protective order.the court stated that its decision was tipp ed by diana counsel aggressive and confrontational of michael,which the court assumed was consistent with diana desires.counsel tone of voice or style of examination is not evidence,and can not be the basis for the issuance of a protective order under the elder abuse act.we conclude the trial court erred in issuing the order,and therefore reverse.

b.the hearing 
an evidentiary hearing was conducted on july.michael and diana testified.michael admitted he had filed a petition to be appointed conservator for frances.he was seeking a protective order against diana because of t hreat of bodily harm,and threats of kidnapping.and stabilizes sic the family.michael testified diana had struck his back with her fists in february or march.michael said this was the first time diana had hit him,and it occurred spontaneously and not in response to an argument.michael and diana were always having disagreements,during which diana would get excited and scream at him michael claimed his hearing problems were the result of diana screaming right up close to my ear.michael also testified diana created confusion and disrupted the order of the household.a caregiver provided care for frances.michael testified two caregivers had quit,although no testimony was offered for the reasons they left.michael felt diana posed a threat to the health and safety of himself,frances,and other members of his family.
on,michael admitted he reported the february or march incident of physical abuse only after he had filed a petition in the probate court to be appointed frances conservator.michael also testified on that,although he had only identified one incident of physical abuse on direct examination,there were actually multiple incidents michael did not provide any testimony as to the nature or timing of those other incidents.
diana testified she had never struck michael,and they had never had heated arguments.diana claimed she and her father agreed about everything other than his investments and the care to be provided for frances.diana had concerns about frances welfare,objected to michael conservatorship petition,and filed her own petition asking that a professional conservator be appointed.before the temporary restraining order was issued,diana had almost daily contact with frances,and made her dinner every night.diana denied ever threatening michael or suggesting to anyone she would harm him.diana testified that when she expressed her belief that the money michael was investing should be used to provide care for frances,michael replied,he did have a wife any more,and frances was not worth spending any money on.diana believed michael investments were very risky because too much of his and frances portfolio was tied up in oil,gas,and gold,and because he traded on margin.diana testified frances former caregiver quit because caring for frances was too physically demanding,and the caregiver was not happy about the situation there.diana claimed that michael hearing loss was due to his age,diet,and circulatory problems,not to her yelling at him.
c.the trial court ruling 
after the parties completed their testimony,the trial court made the following ruling 
the court what i have here,is simply a rather close call.it one person word against the other.the court has observed carefully the demeanor of this process.frankly,the court is affected by the manner in which michael was examined,and that diana allowed that to happen.
counsel for diana,i assume that your rather aggressive and confrontational of michael was consistent with your client desire to treat her father in such a fashion.
diana counsel that is an unfair characterization.
the court i speaking,counsel.i the one that sat and watched you beat up on this fellow.and speak to him in such a way.
there is a problem here.it an elderly man that is having difficulty.his wife is disabled,and in need of a conservatorship.he has concern about her.he has come to this court to ask for relief.
what he has got in response is an allegation that he is a bad person,and in some fashion that he is out for some evil motive and that he does not have the best interest of his wife.
the examination of him i think was abusive to him.we in a court of families that go through these difficult times.and they need to be treated with respect.
and i compared that to how michael counsel cross examined diana.with respect,without raising his voice,without being confrontational.
this is a family in trouble.it not a war we fighting in this courtroom.this is a family.the court observed that happening and your client did tap you on the shoulder and say to you this is my father you are speaking to.that was the straw that made the difference in tipping the scale as to whether or not michael has been treated in an abusive way.
the elder abuse statute provides that causing emotional distress or mental suffering to an elder person is elder abuse.so it not the same as domestic violence,where you have to hit,where you have to commit something equivalent to a crime in order to have a restraining order issued.
we treat our elderly with respect.we do yell at them,we do treat them rudely,we do tell them i have a right to come in
