proceedings 
central states sued neiman to recover the shortfalls attributable to south coast withdrawal from the pension fund in and.central states theory of recovery derived from the fact that all trades or businesses under neiman control were responsible for the missing funds,and that neiman operated businesses providing management and consulting services in both and.both parties moved for summary judgment before the district court in support of its motion,central states relied exclusively upon documentary evidence,including neiman income tax returns from and,the,nco cash disbursement journal,transcon proxy statement to the sec,and the business expense ledger prepared at neiman direction.in response,both neiman and anisgarten submitted affidavits swearing that neiman did not operate a trade or business in either or.
the district court denied both motions.with respect to central states,the district court held that the tax documents did not unequivocally prove the existence of a trade or business because neiman and anisgarten affidavits attempted to explain the use of schedule c,thus creating a genuine issue of material fact and making summary disposition improper.the district court ruled that central states offered no evidence regarding whether neiman engaged in the activity for income or profit.similarly,the district court held that neiman and anisgarten affidavits were insufficient to prove that neiman had not engaged in a trade or business in or.in the end,neither party had submitted any additional helpful evidence beyond the income tax returns describing the disputed activities.central states,southeast southwest area pension fund neiman,wl slip op.at.march.
