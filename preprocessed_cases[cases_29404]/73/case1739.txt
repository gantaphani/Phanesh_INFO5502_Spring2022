the sole issue presented by this appeal is whether california source income of an s corporation,passed through to a nonresident,is subject to california tax.gene and maureen valentino the valentinos appeal a judgment in favor of the state of california franchise tax board the board entered after the trial court denied the valentinos motion for summary judgment on their complaint for refund of taxes and,on stipulated facts,found in favor of the board.the valentinos contend that the income the board seeks to tax was derived from the ownership of stock,and under revenue and taxation code section,the income must be classified as an intangible which is taxed by the state of residence of the shareholder florida,rather than the state in which the corporation conducts business california.the board contends the legislature intended to tax subchapter s corporations and their shareholders in the same manner as partnerships are taxed and thus it properly demanded payment of taxes from the valentinos on income derived from their ownership of cellular telephone company,cellular stock.as we shall explain,we conclude california source income of an s corporation,passed through to a nonresident shareholder,is subject to california tax.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the valentinos are married and reside in pensacola,florida.they at all relevant times owned stock in cellular,a delaware corporation qualified to do business in california.cellular did business in california and was taxed as an s corporation for federal and california tax purposes.it filed a form,california s corporation franchise or income tax return for income years ending december,december,and december.the income earned by it was derived from california sources for the income years relevant to this matter.cellular paid the california franchise tax of percent on its net income derived from sources within the state for income year ending december.it further paid a california franchise tax of percent on its net income derived from sources within the state for income years ending december,and december,subd.b.
the valentinos filed form,california nonresident or resident income tax return for taxable years and with the board.they filed form for taxable year,but did not report california income or identify any california tax liability.later,they filed amended returns with the board to eliminate all income from cellular and to request a refund of all tax paid for taxable years and.the board issued the refunds as requested and started an audit to determine if the refunds for taxable years and were proper.upon completion of the audit,the board issued notices of proposed assessment for taxable years and,as well as for taxable year.the valentinos protested the proposed assessments,which were later affirmed by the board.notices of action affirming the assessments were issued on march.they paid the tax and interest amounts for tax years,and as referenced in the notices of action on may.later,they were billed and they paid additional interest due for the three tax years in the amount of.the total amounts of payments they made to the board were for for for and the additional payment for all three years of.
on june,the valentinos filed a claim for refund with the board.because it failed to mail notice of action on the claim for refund within six months after the claims were filed,the valentinos considered them disallowed and proceeded to file this action for refund of taxes on december.the board then refunded again the money to the valentinos,while also sending a notice denying the refund to them.the board later demanded the valentinos return the money,claiming the refund was erroneous and that it intended to deny their claim for refund.the valentinos complied.
on may,the valentinos motion for summary judgment was denied and the telephonic ruling of the court was affirmed.a week later,a trial on stipulated facts was held and the court took the matter under submission.on june,the court entered judgment in favor of the board,reasoning 
the valentinos cite to revenue and taxation code section and christman ftb,d,and in appeal of ronnie and patricia childs,august,for the proposition that california follows the doctrine of mobilia sequuntur personam movables follow the law of the person as to intangible property such as stocks.plaintiffs therefore argue that nonresidents of the state are not required to pay a tax on income derived from stock of a foreign s corporation doing business in california unless the intangible property itself,the stock,acquires a business situs in california.
s corporations,however,are treated more like partnerships pass through taxation by california law than like ordinary corporations.in addition,plaintiffs cited sources precede the passage of law recognizing s corporations in california.indeed,when the legislature enacted revenue and taxation code section,it allowed nonresident shareholders deriving income from an s corporation doing business in california to file a composite nonresident return to report their pro rata share of income from california sources.the legislature also enacted section b,requiring nonresident shareholders of s corporations that do business in california to file a consent to be subject to the jurisdiction of the state of california to enable the state to tax the nonresident shareholders pro rata share of income attributable to california sources.therefore,it appears that with regard to s corporations,the legislature intended to look directly at the source of the income not the situs of the stock to determine whether the non residents shareholders pro rata share of the income is taxable by california.
the court notes that revenue and taxation code section conforms to internal revenue code section b,which also states that the character of the shareholders pro rata share of s corporation income is determined as if the income were realized directly from the source from which realized by the corporation.any other interpretation renders the phrase realized directly from the source from which realized by the corporation meaningless.therefore,california law provides that the source of the income,not just the income itself,derived by the shareholders from s corporations is passed through to the shareholders themselves.the source of the income is not the stock.it is the location of the income producing activity creating the income.the mobilia doctrine has nothing to do with the new s corporation regulations.lastly,this ruling is entirely consistent with the tax treatment afforded subchapter s corporations by other states,which have adopted internal revenue code section b,to nonresident shareholders of s corporations doing business in those states.
the valentinos timely appealed.
historical of s corporations under federal and california tax law 
under federal income tax law,there are two distinct types of corporations,c and s corporations so named because of their governing subchapters under chapter,subtitle a of the internal revenue code.the former constitutes a separate entity which pays corporate income taxes based upon its net income,subd.a.the latter,however,generally does not pay taxes as an entity.rather,the s corporation files only an informational return reporting for the taxable year its gross income or loss and deductions,its shareholders,and the shareholders pro rata shares of each item.a.the items are then passed through on a pro rata basis to the shareholders,who report them on their personal income tax returns.citations.the s corporation is,in effect,a hybrid combining traits of both corporations and partnerships.citation.heller franchise tax bd.th,d,quoting beard united states cir.
california did not distinguish between c corporations and s corporations for state tax purposes before,instead treating all corporations as c corporations.plant eager,cal.tax analysis cch.however,commencing that year,california changed its tax law so that subchapter s of chapter of subtitle a of the internal revenue code,relating to the tax treatment of s corporations and their shareholders,shall apply,except as otherwise provided,subd.a see california taxes ed.one notable difference between federal and california law regarding the treatment of s corporations is that under the former,with certain exceptions not relevant here,s corporations do not pay federal income tax a,while under california law a state tax is imposed upon the net income of the reporting s corporation,subds.a,b.heller franchise tax,supra,th at,d.from the perspective of the shareholder,c corporations are taxed upon their income as separate entities,and their distributions of earnings and profits to their shareholders are generally taxable to the shareholders as dividends.in contrast,s corporation shareholders are taxed on their pro rata share of the corporation income,regardless of whether it makes any distributions.ibid.
at the same time california adopted federal s corporation rules,it enacted statutes governing the assessment and collection of tax from nonresident shareholders.section,subdivision b requires every nonresident shareholder of an electing s corporation to consent to the jurisdiction of california to tax his or her share of s corporation income from california sources.see california taxes,supra.former section,subdivision b required an s corporation to pay estimated tax on california source income of its nonresident shareholders.to simplify the filing of nonresident income tax returns,section permitted nonresident shareholders of an s corporation doing business in california or deriving income from california sources to file a single composite nonresident return reporting their share of s corporation income derived from california sources 
california source income of an s corporation,passed through to a nonresident,is subject to california tax 
california imposes a tax on the entire taxable income of every nonresident to the extent it is derived from sources in this state,subd.b.as summarized above,california has essentially adopted federal tax law regarding the treatment of subchapter s corporations,subd.a.thus,following federal tax law,the character of a shareholder pro rata share of s corporation income is determined as if the income were realized directly from the source from which realized by the corporation.b.this principle is known as the conduit rule and was intended by congress to be the same as the partnership rule.sess,reprinted in,eustice kuntz,federal income taxation of s corporations ed,rul,christian grant,subchapter s taxation ed.as in the case of nonresident partners,nonresident s corporation shareholders may be taxed by a state only to the extent the income claimed to be subject to tax is fairly attributable to activities of the s corporation in the taxing state.willson windfeld,tax management multistate tax taxation of entities general principles,bna.
under section the gross income of nonresident taxpayers thus includes only the gross income from sources within this state.where a nonresident business,trade or profession is conducted wholly within california,the entire gross income must be reported,tit.it is undisputed that cellular income was derived from business conducted within california.because the conduit principle cited above characterizes the valentinos pro rata share of cellular income as if the income were realized directly from the source from which realized by the corporation,the valentinos are treated as though they conducted business wholly within california in their individual capacities.christian grant,subchapter s taxation,supra,see cal.tax rptr.cch,guidebook to california taxes cch.this attribution of business activity parallels the treatment of nonresident aliens as being engaged in a trade or business within the united states where the partnership of which such individual is a member is so engaged.see also rul.thus,an s corporation shareholder income is characterized by reference to the activity and,once characterized,the items are then sourced according to the particular sourcing rule applicable to each type of income.consequently,the valentinos were required to report their share of cellular income as gross income from sources within california.
relying on section and the doctrine of mobilia sequuntur personam movables follow the law of the person,the valentinos assert that because their income is from cellular stock the source of the income is determined by looking to their residence.they note there is no authority for limiting the scope of section to essentially c corporation stock.granted,section and the mobilia doctrine provide that income of nonresidents from intangibles,such as stock,does not generally have a source in california.however,internal revenue code section b characterizes s corporation income as to the shareholder by reference to its character as to the corporation,not as income from stock.in other words,a shareholder of a c corporation is taxed on income received from the corporation,while a shareholder of an s corporation is taxed on income received by the corporation as if he or she received it.as such,a shareholder pro rata share of corporate income is not income from stock in the same sense as dividends and gain from the sale of stock.indeed,it can not be characterized as income from stock unless the corporate income itself is derived from stock.rather,such income is corporate income derived directly from corporate activities and passed through and taxed at the shareholder level as if the shareholder earned the income in his or her individual capacity.christian grant,subchapter s taxation,supra,see cal.tax rptr.cch.here,the attribution of cellular income to the valentinos was determined by their percentage of ownership of the outstanding shares,income that was derived from the tangible sources from which the corporation received it and not from the intangible shares themselves.consequently,section never applies to a shareholder share of s corporation income unless the corporate income itself is derived from intangibles.see,tit,subd.c.
the valentinos reliance on miller mccolgan cal d,and christman franchise tax board d,for the propositions that the source of the income to the shareholder is the corporate stock and that the source of the income from the stock is the state where the owner resides under the mobilia doctrine unless it acquires a business situs elsewhere,is misplaced.these cases are distinguishable in that both involved the source of dividends received,not a pro rata share of s corporation income,and taxable years before california adopted s corporation rules.granted,the christman corporation was an s corporation for georgia income tax purposes however,it was a c corporation for california purposes.within this earlier context,the miller court aptly pointed out 
i t appears that there is in the beginning an income to the corporation,and that part of such income in turn is passed on to the shareholder in the form of dividends.as such it represents in law an income to the shareholder quite distinct from the income to the corporation.therefore,in the absence of an express statutory mandate to the contrary,it logically follows that the source of the income to the shareholder is the corporate stock.miller mccolgan,supra,cal d at,italics added.
the valentinos assert the board interpretation of internal revenue code section b is erroneous,as the provision only deals with the character of an item of income and does not address the source or location of the income passing through to the shareholder.they assert this makes perfect sense in the context of the federal taxation scheme,because the source or location of income is not an issue when considering federal taxes.that is,the source of income for a resident shareholder of a recognized s corporation will always be the united states.however,the board counters,asserting that sourcing shareholder income by reference to activity constitutes the logical result of applying the cited characterization rule and california code of regulations,title,section.the board contends it would be absurd to characterize the income by reference to the underlying corporate activities and then source it by reference to another characterization,income from intangibles stock.
