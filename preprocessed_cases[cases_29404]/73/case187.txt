decedent,margot stewart,gave a share of a building to her son brandon stewart brandon.upon margot stewart death,the internal revenue service sought to include this gift in margot stewart estate under a,reasoning that margot stewart had retained for her life the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from the property.the tax court,memo,cch,agreed.estate of margot stewart the estate appeals that decision,arguing that decedent did not retain a lifetime interest in the share and that there was no implied agreement that decedent would retain enjoyment of the share.the commissioner contends that the tax court decision was correct.we do not disturb the tax court finding that an implied agreement existed,but we hold that the tax court clearly erred in finding that the terms of the implied agreement provided that decedent would retain enjoyment of the entire share,and that the entire property should remain in the estate.we therefore vacate the judgment below and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i.the two properties 
since,decedent margot stewart and her adult son brandon stewart,as joint tenants with rights of survivorship,a house in east hampton,new york the east hampton property.each summer,decedent and brandon rented out the east hampton property,splitting the rental income evenly.as a matter of expediency and convenience,decedent and brandon would not both sign the lease nor would they ask the summer tenant to send two different rent checks,one to decedent and one to brandon.rather,in different years,either decedent or brandon would sign the lease to rent out the property,and the tenant would write a single check either to decedent or to brandon.whoever received the rent checks that year would then,every few months,write a check to the other for that person share.decedent and brandon also split evenly the expenses of maintaining the east hampton property.the result was that every summer each of decedent and brandon received half of the east hampton property net income.
at all times relevant to this appeal,decedent and brandon lived on the first two floors of a brownstone in manhattan the manhattan property,which decedent had bought in.on october,decedent leased the upper three floors to an unrelated commercial tenant,financial solutions,financial solutions.the rent was per month,and the term ran through july.
ii.the gift 
on october,decedent and brandon met with attorney frederick walker,an estate planning specialist,for the purpose of reviewing the financial solutions lease.according to walker testimony,decedent asked him what to do about the appreciation in the value of the manhattan property,and walker suggested that decedent make a gift of part of the manhattan property to brandon.decedent then said that she wanted to give brandon half of the manhattan property along with half of the rent.this account is corroborated by walker contemporaneous diary,which says that decedent wanted to give son of building and rent.walker,decedent,and brandon met again the next day so that decedent and brandon could pick up the lease and further discuss the gift possibility with walker.
decedent was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in december,and she began chemotherapy treatments in january.on may,decedent and brandon signed a deed that transferred a interest in the manhattan property to brandon the deed provided that decedent and brandon would be tenants in common.
iii.after the gift 
after the gift was completed,decedent and brandon continued to live together in the lower two floors of the manhattan property.financial solutions continued to rent the upper three floors,but its rent payments were erratic,untimely,and sometimes partial in addition,according to brandon testimony which is corroborated by financial documentation,the manhattan property underwent thousands of dollars worth of repairs.as a result,the manhattan property expenses were significantly higher than usual,at the same time that the income produced by the property became unreliable.
against this backdrop,the financial relationship between decedent and brandon underwent several significant changes during the period after the gift and before decedent death while decedent continued to receive the manhattan property rent payments from financial solutions,brandon received the rent payments from the tenant in the east hampton property.in contrast to their previous practice,brandon never wrote a check to decedent for her share of the east hampton rent.decedent,who had previously paid for all manhattan property expenses,now paid for most of them,with brandon paying a small but not insignificant fraction.the tax court found that decedent paid manhattan property expenses of,while brandon paid manhattan expenses of.the record supports these findings every one of these payments is accounted for in brandon and decedent bank statements,and the numbers add up.
iv.decedent death and tax consequences 
margot stewart died on november.following her death,the estate filed with the irs a form,united states estate and transfer tax return,which reported the contents of margot estate as including of the east hampton but only a interest in the manhattan property.on december,the irs issued a notice of deficiency stating,inter alia,that margot had retained possession or enjoyment of the transferred interest and that therefore,under,the entire manhattan property was part of her estate for federal tax purposes.
the estate filed a timely petition in the tax court challenging the irs determination of deficiency.the tax court held a trial in june.at trial,the estate argued that,contrary to the irs contention,decedent had not retained the enjoyment or income of the entire manhattan property but rather,as a owner,had forgone much of the net income from the top three floors by using a setoff to pay brandon,and had shared the value of the bottom two by living with brandon.according to the estate,instead of splitting up the rental income and expenses each month in proportion to their interests in the two process which would have required decedent and brandon to write separate checks for every expense and receive separate checks from both and brandon were keeping track of each person net income from both properties and intended to reconcile any differences at the end of the year.
the tax court issued a memorandum opinion denying the petition.memo,cch,tax.memo lexis.the court found that decedent continued to receive the monthly rent payments from financial solutions,and enjoy the economic benefits of the manhattan property.id.at.the court described decedent retention of the property income stream after the property was transferred as very clear evidence that the decedent did indeed retain possession or enjoyment.id.because there was no written agreement between decedent and brandon stating that they would reconcile the income and expenses of the two properties and because the tax court did not credit brandon testimony that there was an oral agreement,the court found that no such agreement existed.id.at.rather,the tax court concluded that brandon and decedent had an implied agreement that decedent would retain the economic benefits of the manhattan property and that decedent certainly met the terms of that agreement.id.for those reasons the tax court held that the full value of the manhattan property was includible in the estate under.the estate timely appealed to this court.
discussion 
legal framework 
the internal revenue code imposes a federal tax on the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the united states.a.a taxable estate is defined as the value of the gross estate,less applicable deductions,id,where the value of the gross estate includes the value of all property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death,id.some taxpayers use various planning techniques designed to take property out of the gross estate or decrease its value.the irs has several statutory tools to use in fighting these techniques.one of these u.a is at issue here.
under internal revenue code,the value of the gross estate includes the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer under which he has retained for his life the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property.a,a.the purpose of is to prevent individuals from using a gift transfer of property with reservation of a life any similar order to avoid having to pay the estate tax.see comm r estate of church.absent,a decedent could transfer to her heir the remainder in a property while retaining a life estate,and the economic result would be substantially identical to what would have occurred if the decedent had left the property to the heir in her will under an irrevocable contract so to do.by including such property in the gross estate,closes what would otherwise at one time enormous loophole in the estate tax id.
retention of a formal life estate in a property is just one method a taxpayer might use to try to avoid paying the estate tax while achieving,in substance,the same economic result as would occur if she retained the property for life and only disposed of it by will.another method is to make an agreement even an implied or unenforceable agreement between a decedent and an inter vivos transferee that the decedent will continue to enjoy the benefits of the property for her life.not surprisingly,the courts and the irs have ruled that if there is such an agreement,then the decedent is understood to have retained the possession or enjoyment of that property and the property must be included in the gross estate.see c estate of maxwell comm r,cir.
in the case before us,the tax court found as a fact that when decedent gave a share of the manhattan property to brandon,she did so with an implied agreement that she would retain the economic benefits of the whole townhouse.if,as the tax court held,decedent retained the possession or enjoyment of the share of the property that she had given to brandon,it followed under a that the share was part of the estate.
b.the planning technique in this case 
today,unlike when was enacted,see supra note,the estate tax and the gift tax are on a unified rate schedule and,presumably,decedent owed a gift tax as of the time she transferred the interest in the manhattan property.see noting that the estate filed a gift tax return for this transfer.why,then,does it matter whether the estate pays estate tax or gift tax on the transferred interest part of the answer is that the commissioner wants to tax the appreciation of brandon share of the manhattan property during the roughly period from the date of the transfer to the date of decedent death.but the appreciation of the entire manhattan property during that period was stipulated to be,and the tax applicable to brandon share of that appreciation,though not trivial,would probably not be an unduly large amount of money 
estate planners have,however,found a highly effective way to lower both estate and gift taxes when passing real estate to the next generation.dividing the real estate into separate interests usually lowers the property fair market value and thereby also the taxes due on it see david westfall et,estate planning law taxation.the fair market value of separate interests is typically discounted by about for lack of control and marketability.id.in the instant case,however,the parties stipulated to a much higher discount of if the property had in fact been divided.that discount is responsible for the lion share of the money at stake in this case.it is for this reason that the commissioner wants us to hold that the entirety of brandon interest is part of decedent gross estate.the estate would then be taxed as though decedent,instead of giving brandon of the manhattan property on may,had owned the whole property until her death on november.and there then would be no discount for lack of control and marketability.
ii.continued possession or enjoyment 
the tax court concluded that decedent retained the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property.a,a.the general characterization of a transaction for tax purposes is a question of law subject to de novo review.frank lyon united states.we must therefore determine what it means,in the context before us,to retain the possession or enjoyment of,or the right to the income from,the property.
as an initial matter,we note that two aspects of this statute,as applied to this case,are beyond reasonable dispute.first,decedent did not retain the right to income from the property.retaining the right to income is not the same as retaining the income.as the supreme court has explained in interpreting a,t he term right,certainly when used in a tax statute,must be given its normal and customary meaning.it connotes an ascertainable and legally enforceable power united states byrum.it is undisputed that decedent did not have a legally enforceable power to receive the income from the interest in the manhattan property that she had legally transferred to brandon.therefore,if decedent retained anything described in a,it was the actual possession or enjoyment of brandon interest,and not any right to income from it.second,the property in a here refers to the transferred interest in the manhattan property,not to the entire manhattan property.the tax court has previously recognized that a decedent formal and substantial retention of a majority interest in real property does not necessarily require a finding that the decedent retained possession of a transferred minority interest,see,estate of wineman comm r,memo,cch,tax.memo lexis,at,and we agree.therefore,our inquiry is limited to whether decedent retained the possession or enjoyment of the transferred interest in the manhattan property.
in applying the possession or enjoyment language of we look to substance,not to form.estate of church,at quoting helvering hallock.it is well settled that the terms enjoy and enjoyment,as used in various estate tax statutes,are not terms of art,but connote substantial present economic benefit rather than technical vesting of title or estates.byrum,at quoting comm r estate of holmes.in the case of real property,the terms possession and enjoyment have been interpreted to mean the lifetime use of the property.estate of maxwell,at quoting byrum,at.while it may sometimes be difficult to determine who is using real property that is wholly inhabited by a decedent family members,it is quite easy to determine who is using real property that is producing income.all we have to do is follow the money.whoever is,in substance,receiving the net income or taking the net loss from the property,is using it during his or her lifetime,and thus possessing and enjoying the property.see estate of mcnichol comm r,cir see also b the use,possession,right to the income,or other enjoyment of the transferred property is considered as having been retained or reserved to the decedent to the extent that the use,possession,right to the income,or other enjoyment is to be applied toward the discharge of a legal obligation of the decedent,or otherwise for his pecuniary benefit.
under the applicable treasury regulations,however,a finding of retained possession or enjoyment is not the end of the matter.the extent of the retained possession or enjoyment must also be determined.
if the decedent retained or reserved an interest or right with respect to all of the property transferred by him,the amount to be included in his gross estate under section is the value of the entire property,less only the value of any outstanding income interest which is not subject to the decedent interest or right and which is actually being enjoyed by another person at the time of the decedent death.if the decedent retained or reserved an interest or right with respect to a part only of the property transferred by him,the amount to be included in his gross estate under section is only a corresponding proportion of the amount described in the preceding sentence.an interest or right is treated as having been retained or reserved if at the time of the transfer there was an understanding,express,or implied,that the interest or right would later be conferred.
c i emphasis added.this position is also the official position of the irs,as well as at least one other circuit court.see rul,w hen a decedent retained an interest in only a part of the transferred property,or,in the alternative,in a corresponding portion of the income produced by the property,the amount includible in the gross estate is that portion of the transferred property that would be necessary to yield the retained income.see also in re estate of uhl,cir.
as discussed earlier,one way a decedent can retain possession or enjoyment of a property is through an implied agreement.under c.c,however,the existence or nonexistence of an implied agreement is not enough to resolve this case.the terms of the agreement also matter.if,for example,the facts were to indicate that,pursuant to an implied agreement,decedent had retained of the substantial present economic benefit of the transferred interest in the manhattan property,then only the corresponding proportion of the value of the entire interest would be included in the estate.
iii.implied agreement 
we now turn to the tax court findings of fact.the tax court found that there was an implied agreement that margot stewart would retain the economic benefits of the entire transferred interest in the manhattan property whether there was such an implied agreement,and what its terms were,are questions of fact that we review for clear error.estate of maxwell,at see also frank lyon,at the general characterization of a transaction for tax purposes is a question of law subject to de novo review.the particular facts from which the characterization is to be made are not so subject.when deciding whether there was an implied agreement,some amount of inference is necessary.in order to make such an inference all facts and circumstances surrounding the transfer and subsequent use of the property must be considered.estate of rapelje comm r,accord estate of abraham comm r,cir see also.t he burden is on the decedent estate to disprove the existence of any adverse implied agreement or understanding and that burden is particularly onerous when intrafamily arrangements are involved.estate of maxwell,at quoting estate of rapelje,at.because the manhattan property was used partly as a residence and partly as an rental property,we shall consider whether the facts and circumstances surrounding either of these uses indicated an implied agreement,and if so,what the terms of that agreement were.
residential use 
the tax court did not rely on decedent continued residence in the manhattan property for its finding that an implied agreement existed.see estate of stewart,tax.memo lexis,at.but the commissioner seems to rely on it in part.we,however,do not believe that the terms of any implied agreement can be read to provide that decedent would retain enjoyment of the residential portion of brandon interest in the manhattan property.
in residential transfer cases,i n determining whether an implied agreement or understanding existed between the parties the courts have found two factors to be particularly significant continued exclusive possession by the donor and the withholding of possession from the donee.estate of spruill comm r,accord guynn united states,cir.the presence of both those factors is so damning that in cases where a decedent transfers a residential property but continues to live in it to the exclusion of the donee,the estate taxpayer has lost in every case of which we are aware because the taxpayer could not meet its burden and,if brandon had not lived in the manhattan property for the entire time between the transfer and decedent death,it would certainly not have been clear error had the tax court found an implied agreement that decedent could have excluded brandon from the manhattan property during her life,and thereby had enjoyed the benefits of the residential part of his interest and of his rights as a residential tenant in common.
in this case,however,neither of the two factors stated in spruill is present.decedent did not have exclusive possession of,nor did she exclude brandon from,brandon interest in the manhattan,for that matter,the entire property.like other courts,we draw a distinction between cases where a decedent retains exclusive possession and withholds possession from the donee on the one hand,and those cases where a residence jointly occupied by the donor and the donee has been held not includable in the donor gross estate,guynn,at,on the other.this case is of the latter sort.and despite the great burden faced by the taxpayer in all these cases,taxpayers have won in every case of which we are aware when those two crucial factors were favorable in these cases a transferor use of the property by occupancy after the transfer is a natural use which does not diminish the transferee enjoyment and possession and which grows out of a congenial and happy family relationship.estate of gutchess comm r.
although of a residential premises by the related donor and donee is highly probative of the absence of an implied agreement and has repeatedly been held to satisfy the taxpayer burden,we need not and do not hold that that fact alone will always carry the burden as a matter of law.in some future case,a finding of an implied agreement between related of residential real property might not be clearly erroneous.but where,as here,the tax court has made no specific findings relating to enjoyment of the residential portion of the property,and the commissioner points to nothing besides the mere between the donor and the donee,a conclusion based on an implied agreement concerning the residential portion can not stand as a result,decedent residential use of part of the manhattan property does not indicate an implied agreement that she would to any extent retain the substantial economic benefits of the residential portion of brandon interest.
commercial use 
it was,however,not clearly erroneous for the tax court to find an implied agreement that decedent would enjoy for her life the substantial economic benefit of some,perhaps the rental portion of the manhattan property.the tax court found that decedent continued to receive the monthly rent payments from financial solutions,and brandon testimony was not credible.estate of stewart,tax.memo lexis,at.those two findings are not clearly erroneous and must be upheld.because the estate has failed to provide a credible explanation as to why the entire rent payments went to decedent,they support the tax court finding of an implied agreement.
apportionment 
for the reasons stated above,it was not clearly erroneous for the tax court to find an implied agreement,but it was clearly erroneous for the tax court to find that the terms of the agreement were such that decedent would enjoy the substantial economic benefit of of brandon interest in the manhattan property.this is so because brandon manifestly enjoyed,and decedent did not,the benefits of the residential portion of the.and,as we discuss below,even as to the commercial portion it seems likely that decedent retained the benefits of less than the total.
the question that remains is,therefore,what part of the interest should be included in the estate.it is for the tax court in the first instance to make the findings necessary to answer that question.because the tax court appears to have treated a as an matter and did not consider whether decedent had retained or reserved an interest or right with respect to a part only of the property transferred,c i,the findings cited by the tax receipt of the rental income and the credibility determination as to brandon not provide a complete picture of the extent to which decedent enjoyed the substantial economic benefit of brandon interest during her life.and,because the tax court did not consider all facts and circumstances surrounding the transfer and subsequent use of the property,estate of rapelje,at,it is appropriate to vacate and remand so that the tax court may do so.
in determining the apportionment of brandon interest,the tax court should use the approach adopted by the irs in rul.in that ruling,a decedent conveyed to his adult children a vacation home,but he retained for his life the right to use it or,in the alternative,keep the rental payments,during the month of january each year.the service explained that the amount includible in the gross estate is that portion of the transferred property that would be necessary to yield the retained income.id.the rental value of the property for january was,which was of the the property produced annually,and the service therefore calculated that of the value of the residence was to be included in the decedent gross estate.id.
the facts are more complicated in the instant case,but the basic principle is the same the portion of the property to be included in the gross estate is the portion that would be necessary to produce the income decedent retained.the tax court must first determine how much of the substantial economic benefit generated by the interest is attributable to the residential portion of the interest and how much is attributable to the commercial portion.such a finding is essential because,at least insofar as gross income is concerned,decedent received of the economic benefit from the commercial portion of the transferred,by receiving the rent payments,while brandon received of the economic benefit from the residential portion of that by inhabiting it.
the tax court should then examine a factual finding that it made,but seemingly failed to take fully into account.between the transfer of the interest and decedent death,decedent paid manhattan property expenses of and brandon paid manhattan property expenses of.estate of stewart,tax.memo lexis,at.this finding is a sword.payment of expenses attributable to a property is one of the indicia of ownership of that property,and decedent paid most but not all of the expenses attributable to brandon interest.as a result,the tax court finding concerning expenses supports its finding that an implied agreement existed and hence the inclusion of a significant portion of the interest in the estate.but each dollar of manhattan property expenses paid by decedent also decreases the economic benefit she received.for example,if a and b jointly own a rental property that generates per month in rent and per month in expenses,and a and b split the rent evenly but b pays all the expenses,then in substance a is getting the entire economic benefit of the property while b is getting nothing.because enjoyment connote s substantial present economic benefit,byrum,at internal quotation marks omitted,we think who paid what expenses must be taken into account in apportioning the interest between the estate and brandon.in other words,the tax court must determine who received what portion of the net income from the interest,rather than the gross income 
finally,the tax court apparently did not consider the distribution of the income and expenses from the east hampton property at all.while the tax court was clearly under no obligation to credit brandon testimony that he and decedent intended to use the east hampton income to set off the manhattan income and then reconcile their accounts at year end,it may be worth considering on remand where the net income from the east hampton property went.although the commissioner argues that the reference to the property in a does not provide for consideration of the decedent relationship to other property,regardless of its circumstantial association with the property at issue,appellee br.at,we need not go that far.in some cases,consideration of other property may be useful to an accurate determination of who enjoyed the substantial economic benefit of a property.if,for example,brandon and decedent had formally split the rental income and costs of the manhattan property but brandon had allowed decedent to take a portion of what should have been brandon net income from the east hampton property,and that amount equaled the income brandon was entitled to from his share of the manhattan property,then consideration of the east hampton property would be necessary to prevent an abusive transaction that would otherwise evade.at the other extreme,if brandon and decedent had jointly owned hundreds of other properties and there was no particular reason to think that the distribution of income from those properties was in any way related to the substantial economic benefit of the disputed property,then it would be incorrect to consider such other properties.we leave it to the tax court to determine,on remand,where this case falls along that spectrum and whether the distribution of net income from the east hampton property is among the facts and circumstances surrounding the transfer and subsequent use of the property,all of which must be considered,estate of rapelje,at 
iv.conclusion 
because the tax court finding that the terms of the implied agreement between decedent and brandon provided that decedent would enjoy of the substantial economic benefit of brandon undivided interest in the manhattan property was clearly erroneous,we vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings.decedent retained or reserved an interest with respect to a part only of,c i,brandon stake in the manhattan property,which is what she transferred.on remand,the tax court should make the factual determinations necessary to determine the amount of the net income from brandon interest enjoyed by decedent.then the tax court can calculate the corresponding proportion of the value of the entire property,and include it in the decedent gross estate under.see c i.
we therefore vacate the judgment below and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the majority concedes that the tax court properly concluded in this case that an implied agreement existed between the decedent,margot stewart,and her adult son,brandon,that despite the transfer of a share in her manhattan brownstone to brandon during her lifetime,margot stewart would retain possession or enjoyment of at least some portion of this,so that its value should be included in her gross estate.it would have been difficult for the majority to have done otherwise.the burden rested with margot stewart estate to disprove the existence of such an agreement,and yet the undisputed facts tended,instead,to show it.thus,after the transfer of the share,margot stewart continued to live in the first two floors of the property with her son brandon,just as she had before.despite the transfer,she alone continued to receive the rental income paid by the tenants who leased the upper three floors for per month.and notwithstanding that brandon stewart formally owned of the brownstone,it was margot stewart who continued to pay essentially all the expenses associated with the manhattan in the period before her death,as compared to the nominal amount of contributed by brandon.
to be sure,brandon stewart offered testimony that,if credited,would have vitiated the tendency of these undisputed facts to show that margot stewart retained possession and enjoyment of the property during her lifetime.he swore that he and his mother had an oral agreement by which the income and expenses from the manhattan property were to be reconciled with the income and expenses associated with an east hampton property they jointly owned.if credited,this testimony would have established that brandon stewart was to receive the rental income associated with his share and was to pay of the brownstone expenses.brandon stewart accountant,however,could not recall being informed of such an arrangement.the tax court concluded that brandon stewart testimony,simply put,was not credible.the majority takes no issue with this conclusion.
in fact,the majority takes no issue with any of this.it nevertheless vacates the decision of the tax court including the full value of the manhattan townhouse in the gross value of margot stewart estate on the theory that even though an implied agreement existed,the tax court clearly erred in concluding that its terms were such that margot stewart retained possession or enjoyment of the entire interest she had formally,not only the income stream from the rent that was paid,but also the substantial economic benefits of residence.the majority does how the tax court clearly erred as a factual matter in concluding that margot stewart retained all these benefits,given that her relationship to the property changed in not one significant respect from the period preceding transfer to the period after.instead,the majority,misreading a body of case law that primarily involves transfers of of a family member interest in a property to another family member,concludes that is evidence that the transferor can no longer enjoy the substantial economic benefits of residence to the extent of the transferred interest.indeed,the majority finds such dispositive even here,where the transfer concerned only a fraction of the transferor interest,created a tenancy in common that guaranteed the transferor continued access to the entirety of her property,and involved a transferor and transferee who the majority agrees were found correctly by a court of law to have reached an agreement undercutting the economic substance of the very transfer under consideration.
this turns the of section on its head.it also opens up a loophole that will vitiate to a considerable degree the efficacy of this section,in conjunction with the uniform rate schedule now applicable to estate and gift taxes,in ensuring that the estate and gift taxes are equitably imposed on all those subject to them.i respectfully dissent.
section provides,in relevant part,as follows 
the value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth,under which he has retained for his life 
the possession or enjoyment of the property 
a.as the foregoing makes clear,the focus of section is upon whether a by express or implied substance has retained the possession or enjoyment of property following a transfer.see comm r estate of church,noting,in interpreting the predecessor statute to section,that we look to substance,not to form in determining the effect of a transaction quoting helvering hallock,estate of thompson comm r,cir applying same principle to transactions under section glaser united states,cir same.as the majority notes,the purpose of this section is to ensure that taxpayers can not avoid the estate tax via inter vivos transfers of property that are essentially testamentary,with the transferor retaining enjoyment of the property for her lifetime.see estate of thompson,at section addresses the concern that inter vivos transfers often function as will substitutes citing united states estate of grace.an implied agreement that a decedent will continue in her possession or enjoyment of property after a transfer is properly inferred from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transfer and the property subsequent use,estate of rapelje comm r,accord estate of abraham comm r,cir,and need not be legally enforceable,estate of maxwell comm r,cir citing estate of rapelje,at.moreover,at least where the surrounding circumstances suggest the existence of an implied agreement that would trigger section,the burden falls to the estate to disprove the existence of any adverse implied agreement or understanding,estate of maxwell,at,a burden that this court has described as particularly onerous in the context of intrafamily transfers,id.at quoting rapelje,at.
as the foregoing suggests,and as the majority acknowledges,the tax court conclusions in this case regarding the implied agreement between margot and brandon stewart are factual determinations reviewable only for clear error.see id.at.a factual determination is clearly erroneous only if although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.mobil shipping transp.wonsild liquid carriers,cir quoting anderson bessemer city.t he fact that there may have been evidence to support an inference contrary to that drawn by the trial court is insufficient to demonstrate clear error,ceraso motiva,llc,cir,as is a conclusion by the reviewing court that it would have reached a different determination had it been considering the evidence as a trier of fact,mobil shipping,at.
in finding clear error in the tax court determination that margot stewart retained full possession or enjoyment of the residence she shared with brandon as tenant in common,the majority errs in at least two respects.first,the majority misreads the very cases on which its argument principally depends.the majority relies heavily upon cases in which a transferor has conveyed of his or her interest in a property to another family member,most typically a spouse,but then has continued to reside at the property with the transferee until the transferor death.in such circumstances,i agree that courts have often reasoned that the decedent use of the property by occupancy after the transfer is a natural use which grows out of a congenial and happy family relationship,estate of gutchess comm r,and have concluded as a result that the transferor continued residence is not itself alone sufficient evidence from which to infer an agreement that the transferor would retain possession or enjoyment,as contemplated by section,see,union planters bank united states,cir finding no basis to impose the tax upon the estate of a husband who has vested the fee simple title to the family residence in his wife,merely because he continues to live in the house until his death emphasis added estate of roemer,cch,citing cases,and observing that the courts have uniformly rejected the advocation of section applicability based on the mere fact that the donor continued to live in a residence which he had conveyed emphasis added.
but whereas courts considering such intrafamily transfers have relied on the compatibility between and the existence of a bona fide transfer to conclude that a transferor continued residence at a property is insufficient evidence,by itself,to confirm the existence of an implied agreement favoring the transferor,see also boris bittker lawrence lokken,federal taxation of income,estates and gifts,the majority,conversely,treats as sufficient evidence to prove the absence of an implied agreement,at least with respect to the residential portion of the property at issue,see draft,observing that in cases where the transferor neither exclusively possessed a property nor excluded the transferee,taxpayers have won in every case,and concluding,on the basis of nothing else,that brandon manifestly enjoyed,and decedent did not,the benefits of the residential portion of the.draft indicating that brandon received of the economic benefit from the residential portion of his interest by inhabiting it.this logic not only departs from that of prior cases,but ignores that the tax court here was required to consider all facts and circumstances surrounding the transfer and subsequent use of the property in determining the existence or absence of an implied agreement.estate of rapelje,at.
next,the majority focuses not on what margot stewart retained after the transfer of the share in her townhouse,but rather on what brandon stewart supposedly received.this contravenes the plain language of section,which directs that the value of a gross estate shall include the value of all property of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer under which he has retained for his life the possession or enjoyment of the property in other words,under section we look to whether the facts and circumstances surrounding a transfer evince an agreement that the transferor lifetime possession or enjoyment of the affected property will not be diminished,and if they do,we include the value of the transferred interest in the gross estate.this reading of the statute is confirmed by reference to the statute original target,the creation by the decedent of a life estate with a remainder given to relatives.in such circumstances,the statute includes the full value of the property in the decedent gross estate because his lifetime enjoyment of the property is because,after the transfer,he somehow enjoys the remainder interest given to his relatives.the tax court interpretation of section in cases involving partial transfers of real the distinction under discussion is most consistent with this understanding of the statute.see estate of wineman comm r,cch estate of powell comm r,cch.
the distinction just highlighted is significant,because neither the formal interest that brandon stewart received as a tenant in common nor his purported substantial enjoyment of that interest can,as the majority would have it,be dispositive as to margot stewart possession or enjoyment of the residential portion of the manhattan property.as a tenant in common,margot stewart retained the right,even after the transfer,to possess and enjoy the whole of the manhattan townhouse,subject only to brandon stewart right to do the same.see,jemzura jemzura,it was thus wholly possible for her to retain substantially the same possession or enjoyment of the property that she had as the sole owner.this is not to say that a tenancy in common ought to be viewed,by itself,as sufficient evidence of an implied agreement or of the terms of such an agreement.a tenancy in common generally,and specifically,might be inconsistent with the transferor full possession or enjoyment of the property,whether because the tenancy interferes with the transferor subsequent desire to sell the property,because the transferee can himself file an action for partition,or simply because the desires for the use of an asset like a home are incompatible.see generally estate of powell,cch at.but neither can the mere fact of a tenancy in common with be,as the majority would seem to have it,dispositive to a conclusion that a transferor did not continue to possess or enjoy the entirety of a property.
estate of wineman,one of the relatively few cases in which courts have considered the estate tax consequences of a fractional real estate transfer resulting in a tenancy in common,supports this conclusion.see cch at.the court in that case found that no implied agreement existed between the decedent and her children regarding her transfer of a interest in the family homestead,and thus that the was not properly included in her gross estate,even though the decedent had continued to live with her children at the homestead after transfer.id.at.the court,however,emphatically did not rely on the mere fact of a tenancy in common,coupled with among family members,to determine that the children fractional share was not properly included in the decedent gross estate.it instead looked at all facts and circumstances surrounding the transfer and subsequent use of the property,id.at,as longstanding precedent requires.see,estate of abraham,at.
the facts of the case showed that the decedent use of the large parcel at contained,inter alia,two residences,two large barns,a small barn,a granary,a farm shop,cattle scales,corrals,two garages,and an limited to her own home,the garden,and the small orchard next to her home.estate of wineman,cch at.even so,the court noted that the fact that decedent personally used less than all of the property after the transfer does not demonstrate that she did not possess and enjoy the entire property.id.nor,even,was the fact that someone other than decedent paid the taxes on the property sufficient on its own to demonstrate the absence of an implied agreement.id.rather,it was only after these and other surrounding circumstances were considered together that the court was willing to conclude that the estate had carried its burden of proving the absence of an implied agreement.notably,the court relied heavily on the credible testimony of one of the transferees that there was no understanding between the decedent and her children.id.
in the present case,there is nothing in the record to indicate that margot stewart use of the manhattan residence after the transfer was limited in the fashion of the decedent in estate of wineman,or that brandon presence in any way interfered with margot possession or enjoyment of the property.in fact,the estate concedes that margot and brandon stewart amicably shared the residential property after the transfer,just as they had when margot stewart was sole owner.see petitioner br.at indicating that after the transfer,brandon and margot lived together amicably as tenants in common,sharing the residential portion of the building.given margot stewart receipt of of rent paid on the property,see estate of hendry comm r,noting that the actual retention of income or revenue from the property by the decedent constitutes very clear evidence of the existence of an implied agreement.accord estate of mcnichol comm r,cir,the estate here needed to point to some facts or circumstances to carry its particularly onerous burden of showing the absence of an implied agreement with respect to margot stewart possession or enjoyment of the whole.see estate of maxwell,at.but the estate made no showing whatsoever that margot stewart use of the residential portion of the townhouse changed appreciably between the many years when brandon lived with margot as her houseguest and the final months of her life,when brandon possessed a formal interest in the property.
moreover,the tax court made other findings of fact that strongly supported its conclusion that margot stewart retained possession or enjoyment of the property following her formal transfer of an interest to brandon.as already mentioned,margot stewart received of the income from the rental portion of the manhattan property,the significance of which the majority attempts to minimize by dividing the property into its rental and residential components,and suggesting that the tax court erred by not making separate findings adequate to support a conclusion that the extent of the implied agreement covered the residence.but as the majority acknowledges,determining the scope of an implied agreement is far from an exact science,and the tax court here was permitted to draw some inferences in determining the agreement parameters.draft the majority does not indicate why the tax court could not have drawn a strong inference about how margot and brandon stewart viewed their relationship to the residential portion of the manhattan property from the way they acted with respect to the property rental income,which belied the estate contention that a bona fide tenancy in common had been created.see estate of thompson,at an implied agreement may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding both the transfer and subsequent use of the property.
in fact,the significance of the majority to be found in prior case the tax court was required to make separate findings regarding the commercial and residential portions of the manhattan property can not be overstated.by subdividing the property in this way,the majority first renders margot stewart receipt of the rental any other evidence regarding the property commercial to the determination whether she retained possession or enjoyment of the residential portion.the majority in effect shifts the burden of proving the existence of an implied agreement as to the residential portion to the commissioner by depriving him of the natural inferences that flow from all the facts and circumstances surrounding this single transaction which the majority admits included an implied agreement favoring margot stewart.the majority next makes it near impossible for the commissioner to meet his new burden with the astounding claim,relying on cases saying merely that a transferor continued residence at a property after transfer is not alone sufficient to infer an implied agreement,that such residence is highly probative of the absence of an implied agreement draft.this analysis makes it hard to conceive of a situation in which the tax court might properly find that despite the formal transfer of a fractional interest in property to a cohabitating child,the parent reserved for himself its possession and enjoyment so that the estate should not be permitted to avoid the payment of estate tax on the property value as a whole.
properly considering all the facts and circumstances,and placing the burden where it belongs,it is abundantly clear that the tax court did not err here in holding against the estate.brandon stewart efforts to satisfy the estate burden of disproving the significance of the rental trial testimony in which he explained that he had received none of the manhattan rent because he and margot stewart had agreed to offset the costs and revenues of the manhattan property against those associated with their east hampton for lack of credibility.see amalfitano rosenberg,cir in reviewing findings for clear error,we are not allowed to either the trial court credibility assessments or its choice between permissible competing inferences.the tax court adverse credibility finding,moreover,was supported by the inconsistency between brandon testimony and that of his accountant,who indicated that he could not recall brandon ever having told him of the offset plan.see krieger gold bond,cir w hen a trial judge finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses,each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence,that finding,if not internally inconsistent,can virtually never be clear error.quoting anderson,at.
even if additional factual findings were required to support the tax court conclusions with respect to the residential portion of the i tax court made such findings.as the tax court noted,after margot transfer of a undivided interest to brandon,she continued to pay the bulk of the expenses relating to the manhattan property,contributing in while brandon paid only.estate of stewart,cch.the majority indicates,on the one hand,that brandon payment of this sum without reimbursement was a significant change in his and margot stewart relationship to the property draft,implying that it supports the conclusion that brandon relationship to the property was that of.at the same time,the majority suggests that margot payment of more than her share of the property expenses decreased her net possession or enjoyment of the property,draft.but surely,brandon payment of far less than his share of expenses as tenant in bit over of the total expenses,when he was the owner of the the tax court conclusion that the transfer was not one of substance,in that margot continued to fulfill the bulk of the responsibilities of ownership,notwithstanding brandon formal interest case law does not support the assertion that a tax court is precluded from finding that the transferor retained possession or enjoyment of the entirety of a property when the transferee made only token gestures showing that the transfer had substance,and where only minor changes occurred in the transferor possession or enjoyment.see estate of thompson,at upholding inclusion of interest in gross estate where the practical effect of changes imposed by the transfer during decedent life was minimal estate of grace,at finding property held in trust includable in gross estate under when a reciprocal trust arrangement leaves the settlors in approximately the same economic position as they would have been in had they created trusts naming themselves as life beneficiaries estate of wineman,cch at noting that even payment of all property taxes by someone other than transferor is insufficient to show absence of an implied agreement giving transferor possession or enjoyment of the whole.viewed in its entirety,the history of margot and brandon stewart relationship to the manhattan property,and especially the lack of significant,objective changes in that relationship,strongly supports the tax court conclusion that brandon stewart remained,in essence,margot stewart houseguest.a fortiori,the record does not support a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed by the tax court in this case.mobil shipping,at.
the majority purports to stop short of holding that,as a matter of law,by the transferor and transferee will always preclude a finding of an implied agreement in favor of the transferor.but given the facts present in this case,it is hard to imagine any of an admission at trial by the would be sufficient to demonstrate the existence of an implied agreement regarding a residence.the transferor retention of all rent from the commercial portion of the very same property is deemed irrelevant as a matter of law to the conclusions a tax court may draw regarding the property residential portion,notwithstanding the court obligation to consider all circumstances surrounding the property in assessing the parties intentions.and a transferee minimal participation in the obligations of a tenancy in common is held,strangely and again as a matter of law,both to aid in establishing the existence of an adverse agreement and to undercut the economic value for estate tax purposes of that which was retained.if the majority opinion imposes any burden of proof on the estate,much less the onerous one that precedent requires,i can not see it.cohabitating family members are all but invited to engage in sham transactions that have no impact upon the transferor possession and enjoyment of a property,and whose only purpose is tax avoidance.it is not the job of this court,of course,to close loopholes that congress has left in the tax code.here,however,the majority inexplicably reopens a loophole that the legislature has,in unmistakable terms,long since commanded shut.
evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine tenancy in common certainly could weigh against the conclusion that the transferor and transferee had an implied agreement that the transferor would continue to possess or enjoy the whole of a property.but since in this case there is not only an absence of such evidence,but the record actually shows that the parties to the transfer did not behave as though a tenancy in common had been created and the transferor relationship to the property did not,in substance,change,i can not see how it was clear error for the tax court to find that the estate failed to carry its burden to disprove the existence of an implied agreement favoring the transferor with regard to both the commercial and residential aspects of this manhattan townhouse.the majority reasoning,by focusing solely on brandon stewart residence at the townhouse as a tenant in common as dispositive,not only departs from prior case law and contravenes the text of section,but also thoroughly undermines the statute,inviting inequitable disparities among those subject to the estate and gift taxes due to easy dodges by future tax avoiders.
