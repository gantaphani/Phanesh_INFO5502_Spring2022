at the may hearing judge bleil also orally ordered that long be detained pending further court proceedings finding that you are a risk of nonappearance and without any information concerning you due to your lack of cooperation with the probation officer and that you a danger to others.
finally,judge bleil,at the may hearing,orally directed long be transported to the lubbock division of the northern district of texas.long was transferred to lubbock,and on may,assistant federal public defender entered her written appearance in the lubbock division in this case as representing long.
long next appearance was on june,before magistrate judge koenig in the lubbock division.again,long purported to fire his public defender attorney.in response,judge koenig set a faretta hearing for august,to determine whether long knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.at the august hearing,long refused to cooperate with judge koenig.for example,long refused to answer any questions and requested a side bar conference with the judge.when the judge told long that he needed to state his issues on the record,or talk to a pretrial services officer to determine whether he could be released on bond or his own recognizance or could retain counsel or could proceed pro se,long refused and requested to postpone the hearing.the judge postponed the faretta hearing for two days.at the august hearing,long again refused to cooperate.judge koenig once more postponed the hearing to september.again,long refused to cooperate.at the september hearing judge koenig had the bill of information read to long,and ordered that a not guilty plea be entered for him.
judge koenig referred long to district judge cummings for the faretta hearing.at a pretrial hearing on october,before trial commenced later that day,long appeared with assistant federal public defendant,who informed the court that she had requested the pretrial hearing because long had said he fired our office and essentially said that he wished to represent himself and that she believed that accordingly he should be advised of faretta warnings by this court.thereafter,at the request of long,attorney moved for a continuance of the trial which judge cummings denied.judge cummings accordingly then asked the defendant whether he wished to represent himself.long responded,no,sir.long was thereafter tried and convicted on october.at sentencing on december,long attorney informed the court that long wished to fire her.long attempted to speak up,but the district judge told him to wait his turn.when the judge allowed long to speak,long stated only,for the record,your honor,your offer of contract is accepted for value and returned with consideration for discharge,settlement,and closure.judge cummings sentenced long to months in prison consecutive sentences of twelve months on each of counts,and and one month on count and concurrent one year terms of supervised release on each count.no fine was imposed restitution to the united states of was ordered.
a defendant has a right to represent himself at trial.faretta.at.an impermissible denial of can not be harmless.united states cano,cir.the defendant must knowingly and intelligently forego his right to counsel,and must clearly and unequivocally request to proceed pro se.id.if the right to counsel is to be waived,the trial court must conduct a faretta hearing,cautioning the defendant about the dangers of and establishing,on the record,that the defendant makes a knowing and voluntary choice.id.nevertheless,the defendant may waive his right to through subsequent conduct indicating an abandonment of the request.id.there is no constitutional right to hybrid representations whereby the defendant and his attorney act as.id.
long did not clearly and unequivocally request to proceed pro se 
united states cano gives an example of a clear and unequivocal waiver of the right to counsel.in cano,the defendant asked the court to dismiss his counsel and allow him to represent himself,stating that he wanted to invoke his constitutional right to as to the matters before the court.id.the court found that request to clearly and unequivocally assert the right to.id.like cano,long indicated to magistrate judge koenig that he is the attorney in fact when the judge asked him at the june,hearing who he wanted to replace the public defender.at the june hearing,long filed a document purporting to fire the public defender and granting himself the power of attorney.moreover,the magistrate judge understood that long sought to represent himself because she ordered a faretta hearing in response to long statements.compounded on this are long several statements that if any one thought they represented long,they were fired.unlike cano,however,long never clearly or expressly asserted either his right to represent himself or that he wanted to proceed pro se.
many cases suggest that something more than just firing one attorney is required before one clearly and unequivocally requests to proceed pro se,moreno estelle,cir.t he right to counsel is in force until waived,and the right to does not attach until asserted.id.at quoting brown wainwright,cir en banc emphasis in original.moreno found that the defendant did not waive his right to counsel because he told the court he wanted to fire counsel without explicitly informing the court that he wished to proceed pro se.id.at.next,in burton collins,cir,this court found no clear and unequivocal waiver where a defendant informed the judge he wanted to fire his attorney and asked,may i represent myself burton,at.the court inter
