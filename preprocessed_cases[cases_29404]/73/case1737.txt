this case involves the differing tax consequences between a contractor consumption of materials and its sale of fixtures as defined in section of the board of equalization board sales and use tax regulations cal.code,tit,hereafter regulation.richard boyd industries boyd manufactures and installs various kinds of signs on real property.during the audit period in question,boyd purchased all its supplies free of tax for resale and issued valid resale certificates to its suppliers.however,boyd did not report sales tax on the sales of the fixtures that it installed.boyd concedes the deficiency assigned by the auditor on its consumption of materials but disputes the portion of the deficiency assigned to its sales of fixtures.we reject boyd attempt to redefine the term fixtures in regulation to mean personal property that is not permanently attached to real property.
procedural and factual histories 
on march,boyd filed a first amended complaint for refund of sales and use tax and declaratory relief.the complaint also included commercial neon,as a party plaintiff.the gist of the action for refund is that the board misapplied regulation in calculating boyd tax liability,and the declaratory relief action requested a declaration that regulation is void.the board filed a demurrer to the complaint,which was sustained on the ground the claims of the two plaintiffs were improperly joined.the court made an order severing trial for the plaintiffs because the amendment to the complaint did not cure the defect caused by the improper joinder.
during a bench trial the parties entered a joint stipulation of facts for trial,as follows 
plaintiff boyd is a licensed construction contractor holding contractor license in the classification of for the installation of signs on real property as classified by the contractor state licenses board,a division of the state of california department of consumer affairs.
boyd was audited for the period october,through september,and this audit resulted in a tax liability of plus interest of.a notice of determination for this liability was issued on january.
in making its determination of underpaid taxes auditors in the employ of the board selected contracts as representative of all other construction contracts performed by boyd during a three year period under review in the audit procedure.such a practice is described as test and projection.because the contracts are representative,the percentage of error as developed is applied to all similar transactions in the three year period.
boyd filed a petition for redetermination,postmarked march.the filing was not timely under revenue and taxation code.the board applied a finality penalty of.
the audit liability was satisfied in full with boyd payment effective november.
boyd construction activity consists of performing construction contracts for the installation of informational and directional signage.
in the performance of the signage contracts by boyd,some of the signage is prepared in the fabricating facility so as to meet the requirement of the contract plans and specification.the prepared signage is installed.
in this proceeding,the claim for refund is limited to the recover y of sales and u se taxes paid pursuant to the determination as noted above on the measure of which is otherwise described as a sale of fixtures under lump sum contracts not reported.
an appeals conference in this matter was held on november.pursuant to a decision and recommendation issued dated march,by appeals attorney randy ferris,a revision to the audit was made.as a result of that revision the defendant has refunded to plaintiff an amount of sales tax.the amount of tax measure remaining in controversy has been reduced to.
plaintiff in the first cause of action of its complaint is requesting judgment to recover all amounts determined as tax,interest,and penalty in excess of the tax on the material content on installations described as fixtures in the manner calculated by defendant on audit schedule and defendant board notice of partial denial of claim for refund,dated june,which discloses the gross amount of fixture installations of.
the parties agree that all of the tangible personal property on which a tax overpayment is claimed was affixed to real property by plaintiff pursuant to a construction contract for the improvement to real property.
in addition to the stipulated facts,boyd testified at trial that he had been in the contracting business for over years,doing signage since.every construction contract boyd has involves placing signs that are permanently affixed to buildings.boyd owns the signs up until the point he installs them.once installed,boyd receives lien rights,but he does not have the right to remove the signs.the intent of the parties to the construction contracts is that the signs that boyd installs become a part of the real property.
joseph franklin jaggard,testified he had been employed as a tax auditor with the board for approximately six years.he did not perform the audit in question,but reviewed it.upon his review,jaggard found a mistake in the audit because one job involved the federal government as a customer.in that situation boyd is to be considered a consumer,not a retailer,of the signs.the united states is exempt from bearing the burden of state taxes.he testified the intent of the parties is irrelevant for purposes of determining tax liability.jaggard explained that installation labor of a sign is exempt,but the fabrication labor is taxable.therefore,in reviewing the audit,he looked to see whether a sign was fabricated into the site or whether the sign was prefabricated,either at the job site or in the shop,and simply installed or attached at the site,in determining whether a tax was due.if the sign was prefabricated and then installed,it is considered a fixture.if the sign is manufactured into the structure or real property,it is considered a material.jaggard explained that certain signs,such as monument signs,could constitute both materials and fixtures for purposes of tax consequences.the material used to construct the monument would be considered material,while a plate or sign attached to the monument would be considered a fixture.the basis for this determination is the plate or sign is removable without damaging or destroying the monument and because the plate or sign does not lose its identity when it is installed.
evan oliver testified he had been in the construction and contracting business since the early,and had testified as an expert witness in the superior and federal courts.the subject matter of his expert testimony in those courts was not revealed.further,although boyd asserts in his opening brief that oliver is qualified as an expert in the construction field with a substantial experience in the anal ysis of sales and use tax liability of construction contractors,no testimony was elicited regarding oliver expertise in sales and use tax law.oliver was never offered,nor was he expressly accepted by the court,as an expert on any given subject matter.unlike jaggard,who was designated as an expert witness by the board,the record fails to show oliver was designated as an expert witness by boyd.
oliver testified to his opinion on the definitions of several terms contained in regulation,such as the terms fixtures,accessory,and component.a fixture is normally considered in the regulation as stated as an accessory to the structure.oliver testified none of boyd signs were accessory to the structure.they were all incorporated in the structure.and materials are defined as components or construction materials or other personal property that installed by the contractor that becomes part of the realty.and so i have to assume that an accessory is the opposite of a material.he testified boyd signs were all improvements to realty.t hese are all materials because they become components of the realty.a fixture is not an improvement to realty.t here no reason why the signs should not be classified as materials,because they are components of the structure and they are other personal property that installed.except to opine that the term accessory means something that is not a material,oliver gave a conflicting definition for that term.its something that is not attached to the realty.as long as its attached it an accessory,never part of the realty.oliver final attempt at defining fixtures and accessories was as follows 
a.the only example of a fixture as defined in the board regulation would item not attached to the realty.
and why is that 
well,that it says,has to be accessory to the realty.
and what does accessory mean,then 
a.as far as i concerned,accessory is something that not a part of what we looking at,it accessory to the realty.
if it does have the words on the back of has to remain an accessory as long as it affixed or attached.it says installed in the regulation.does say affixed.
if it does have the words on the back of might say that it could become a part of the realty.but the regulation specifically states that the fixture retains its identity as an accessory as long as it in the area.
q.so the word accessory means to you that it is not attached,is that 
not incorporated.
not incorporated.
milam no further questions.
gendron no further questions.
the court very well,the witness is excused.
after posttrial briefing,the court found in favor of the board,and denied boyd the relief requested.
discussion 
due to the parties stipulation to the essential facts,any attack on the court judgment must be deemed to present a question of law upon which we exercise an independent review.in this respect,the issue before the court was whether the board erroneously applied regulation in determining boyd tax liability.the pertinent sections of regulation provide 
a definitions.
materials.materials means and includes construction materials and components,and other tangible personal property incorporated into,attached to,or affixed to,real property by contractors in the performance of a construction contract and which,when combined with other tangible personal property,loses its identity to become an integral and inseparable part of the real property.a list of typical items regarded as materials is set forth in appendix 
fixtures.fixtures means and includes items which are accessory to a building or other structure and do not lose their identity as accessories when installed.a list of typical items regarded as fixtures is set forth in appendix 
appendix b lists signs as typical items regarded as fixtures.
the interpretation of a regulation is a question of law.culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization cal d,culligan accord,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,courts must independently judge the text of a statute,taking account and respecting the agency interpretation of its meaning.there are many rules of construction that provide guidance when the meaning of a regulation is uncertain.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law,for a list of rules.the primary rule,however,is to respect the subject matter expertise of the agency charged with enforcing the regulation and to defer to that agency interpretation unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.pacific legal foundation unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d,lusardi construction california occupational safety health appeals bd.th,d.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
boyd acknowledges that the issues to be considered are limited to the grounds stated in the claim for refund,and any contentions intertwined with the contentions expressly raised in the refund claim.preston state board of equalization cal th,d.in the claim for refund,boyd disputed the board determination that in his construction contracts boyd installed fixtures as defined in regulation.boyd contends that his activity as a construction contractor improving real property limited his liability for a sales tax as stated in regulation which defines materials.we limit our review to this legal issue,upon which the parties appear to agree.as a result,boyd contention that the business and professions code has preempted the field of construction contracts.is not properly before us since it was neither raised in the refund claim nor intertwined with the contention made.
although oliver testimony regarding how the sales and use tax should be applied was confusing and at times contradictory,it is clear his opinions are not supported in the law,and at best simply offer a difference of opinion with respect to the interpretation of regulation language.
real property tax law is not controlling.
in state bd.of equalization d,the court agreed that the property installed by general electric,a steam generator,became an improvement to real property and was taxable to the owner of the real property,pacific.the court nonetheless rejected the argument that general electric was a consumer of the materials that went into the completed generator,and not a retailer of tangible personal property.
however,the argument that,because the generator became taxable as real property in the hands of pacific,the transaction by which title was transferred to pacific by general electric is conclusively determined to be not a sale,is unsound.the generator in place was clearly real property and taxable as such.but we are not interested in the nature of the property in the hands of the buyer,but in its nature in the hands of the electric.the sales tax is imposed on the seller,not upon the buyer.section of the revenue and taxation code defines a sale as any transfer of title in any manner or any means whatsoever.clearly,title passed from general electric to pacific.in general electric hands the title it possessed was title to personal property.general electric never had title as real property.what it had it passed to pacific,and that was title to tangible personal property.that is all that is required by the act.this argument of appellants lacks substance.state bd.of equalization,supra,d at.
in accord with general electric,the court in king state bd.of equalization d.rejected the contention that an interpretation of property tax law could be imported into the scheme of sales tax.id.at.the court explained 
like many tax statutes,the sales tax law employs relatively artificial,relatively,concepts.if it utilizes popular meaning or concepts from other fields of law,it does so only by force of its own objectives and definitions.it does not define real property or improvements to real property,if only because it makes little use of these terms.its definition of tangible personal property deals with tangibility,not with distinctions between personalty and realty.to pursue the of definitions,concepts and distinctions from other areas of they are shaped by purposes and by social and economic factors unrelated to sales to false goals.the coverage of the sales tax law is shaped by its own provisions and definitions and,where these are unclear,by applying its own perceived policies and concepts.citation.the courts have often declared that definitions evolved for property tax purposes have no necessary conformity with definitions for other purposes.citation.king state bd.of equalization,supra,d at,fns.omitted.
to the extent boyd attempts to import real property tax law into the determination of taxes owed on his construction contracts,the case law does not support him.accord united states lines,state bd.of equalization d.while ordinarily personal property affixed to the land of another belongs to the owner of the land and can not be removed,for purposes of sales tax,the sale and installation of personal objects are subject to sales taxes even though affixed to the buyer land.
integration of the signs into the structure is not sufficient.
in a suit for refund of taxes,the taxpayer bears the burden of proof,state bd.of equalization d,disapproved on other grounds in culligan,supra,cal d at,fn.if there appears to be some reasonable basis for the board classification a court will not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative body,supra,at.
