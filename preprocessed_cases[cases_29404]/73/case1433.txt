computervision corporation computervision appeals the decision of the united states court of federal claims which held that computervision is not entitled to a refund of deficiency interest assessed and paid with respect to its tax year.the court granted the united states motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute of limitations barred an interest suspension claim because the plaintiff failed to file a claim with the internal revenue service irs until more than years after the expiration of the two year limitation period of a.the court also held that an interest netting claim failed to state a claim because the requirements of d were not met under our decision in federal national mortgage ass united states.we affirm.
background 
the facts of this case are not in dispute.on september,computervision,a manufacturer of manufacturing products,overpaid its tax liability shown on its return by,and elected to apply this overpayment to its tax year on september,computervision overpaid the amount of taxes shown on the return by,and again elected to apply this overpayment to the following year,the tax year.finally,on july,computervision filed a return for the tax year showing an overpayment of,and requested a refund of the entire amount.the irs paid the refund,without interest,on august.
following an audit,the irs issued an examination report on january,in which it asserted that the taxpayer return had understated its tax liability and proposed a deficiency of for the tax year.a portion of this deficiency resulted from the irs determination that a subsidiary of computervision,computervision international,cvi,did not qualify as a domestic international sales corporation,or disc,during the tax year.see a another portion of the deficiency concerned what we refer to as issues.
on april,computervision submitted a protest regarding the irs position with respect to the tax year to the boston appeals office of the irs,disputing among other issues the determination that cvi was not a disc.the issues in the examination report were resolved by an agreement that the tax liability relating to the issues was the irs proposed a total tax deficiency of.of that amount,was attributable to the disc issue,and to issues.
a net operating loss carryback eliminated all of the proposed deficiency except for a deficiency of attributable to investment tax credit recapture.however,the carryback did not eliminate computervision liability for interest which had accrued on the deficiency.on june,the irs assessed computervision deficiency interest totaling,plus tax in the amount of.after corrections,the interest assessment was revised to.importantly for purposes of this appeal,the interest assessment included interest in the amount of attributable to the disc qualification issue,and interest in the amount of attributable to the resolved issues.the irs computed the deficiency interest based on the entire deficiency amount,from the due date of the return to the due date of the return when the nol carryback offset the deficiency.computervision paid the tax deficiency on march.computervision eventually also paid the deficiency interest claimed by the irs,with the final payment of occurring on april.
the statute bars suit for recovery of the deficiency interest unless a claim for refund has been duly filed with the irs a.a claim is timely filed if filed within years from the time the return was filed or years from the time the tax was paid,whichever expires the later a.within two years of the final payment,on august,computervision filed a refund claim with the irs the original refund claim,in which it claimed that portion of the interest relating to the disc disqualification issue for the tax year.the refund claim specifically requested,the amount of interest assessed by the irs on the disc tax liability.the refund claim also included a boilerplate provision stating that 
computervision claims as a basis for the refund of the interest paid with respect to its taxable year such other grounds as are shown to be appropriate by the tax returns,books and records and the examination report and related protest of computervision and cvi for their respective tax years ended december,and january.
section allows the taxpayer to commence suit six months after filing a refund claim if the irs fails to disallow the claim during that time.a.by april,the irs had not acted on the matter,so computervision filed a complaint in the court of federal claims.the complaint alleged that computervision is aggrieved by the defendant failure to refund the interest attributable to the purported disqualification of cvi as a disc.
meanwhile,on november,computervision filed a petition in the united states tax court disputing deficiencies that were assessed for two different tax years,and on the theory that the irs had improperly denied disc treatment for those years.proceedings in the court of federal claims relating to the tax year interest assessment were stayed pending the resolution of the disc issue by the tax court,apparently on the theory that the disc determination for the and tax years would also resolve the issue for the tax year.on march,the tax court ruled in computervision favor on the disc issue,holding that cvi qualified as a disc.computervision int l comm r,cch.the tax court decision on the disc issue became final on may,
following the resolution of the disc issue by the tax court,the court of federal claims lifted its stay with respect to the tax year proceedings on june.computervision and the department of justice doj engaged in settlement negotiations relating to the disc issue.on july,congress enacted a new provision of,requiring interest netting,that is,requiring the irs to apply a zero net interest rate to overlapping periods of mutual indebtedness between a taxpayer and the irs.fed.nat.mortgage united states,describing d.in may,letters to both doj and the irs,computervision claimed the right to a refund of interest based on the theory of interest netting under d.computervision did not in these letters assert a claim for interest suspension.the irs replied on august,treating the claim as including an interest suspension claim for.specifically,the irs august letter stated revenue ruling sequa interest suspension is applied regarding the credit elect from the tax year to.no claim is necessary.at.the doj sent a letter on october,stating that the doj was not in agreement with the irs computations suggesting that an additional refund or overpayment can be allowed in the instant and above that negotiated on the basis of the issues in upon revenue ruling absent the filing of a timely claim for refund raising the issue.at emphasis in original.in a march,letter,the doj reiterated its position and stated that we do not believe that a timely claim for refund has been filed on the interest suspension issue.at.computervision filed a formal amendment with the irs on april,in which it claimed interest under the interest suspension theory.
on july,computervision filed an amended complaint in the court of federal claims,claiming in deficiency interest relating to issues on theories of interest suspension and interest netting.
the government contended that the interest suspension claim was barred by the statute of limitations.unlike the disc interest claim,which involved a challenge to the underlying tax liability,the claim for interest suspension did not involve any challenge to the underlying deficiencies asserted with respect to the issues.rather,the taxpayer contended that,even though the underlying tax liability had been properly determined with respect to issues,interest was not owed.the taxpayer relied on the principle of interest suspension,which derives from a,and was formally set out in revenue ruling,published on october,more than three years earlier.section a requires the payment of interest by the taxpayer with respect to any amount of tax that is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment,and provides that interest on such amount shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.revenue ruling addressed the manner in which interest on a subsequently determined deficiency is computed under a when the taxpayer makes an election to apply an overpayment to the succeeding year estimated taxes.id.
under revenue ruling,interest suspension applies when a a taxpayer elects to credit an overpayment reported on the return for year one here to year two here b a deficiency is subsequently determined for year one and c the credit elect to year two is not needed to satisfy the required payments of estimated tax for year two.rul.under these circumstances,interest is suspended relating to the deficiency for year one.here,in other words,the taxpayer asserted that deficiency interest was not owed for because the tax for that year had been overpaid,and that the transferring that payment to the tax year should be ignored for purposes of computing interest.similarly,taxpayer credit elect from to was not needed to pay its liability,because the taxes had also been overpaid 
as part of the amended complaint,the taxpayer asserted an alternative theory for recovery of the interest based on a theory of interest netting.interest netting is set forth in d,which provides that the irs applies a net interest rate of zero to overlapping underpayments and overpayments of tax.with respect to interest netting there is a different limitations issue described below,but there is no issue as to whether the claim itself was timely filed with the irs because the statute provides for retroactive relief if the statutory conditions are satisfied.see d,c,stat,as amended.the parties agree that interest netting provides identical relief as interest suspension.
on september,the court of federal claims rendered a final decision.computervision united states.by agreement of the parties,the court of federal claims awarded judgment in favor of the taxpayer in the amount of,representing the deficiency interest paid with respect to the disc deficiency id.at.however,the court of federal claims granted the government motion to dismiss the taxpayer claim for a refund of deficiency interest on the deficiencies.it held that the interest suspension claim was barred by the statute of limitations because a claim was not filed with the irs within two years of the date of payment as required by a.id.at.it also held that computervision failed to state a claim for under section d.id.at.section d only applies to overlapping periods when underpayment interest is payable and overpayment interest is allowable.the court held that interest is not allowable on an overpayment credited to a succeeding year estimated tax,nor on an overpayment refunded within days.computervision and overpayments were credited to succeeding years,and its overpayment was refunded within days,so it failed to meet the requirements of section d.see id.at.
the taxpayer timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we first address the statute of limitations issue with respect to computervision interest suspension claim.
statutes of limitations play an important role in tax administration,benefiting both the government and taxpayers.the government authority to assess taxes is limited by,under which taxes must be assessed within three years of the filing of the return.similarly,the taxpayer must file its refund claim with the irs within years from the time the return was filed or years from the time the tax was paid,whichever expires the later a here the taxpayer original claim for refund was filed with the irs within the limitations period because it was filed on august,within two years of the date of the last payment,april.however,that claim did not specifically include the interest suspension claim with respect to the issues.a formal claim with the irs was not filed until april,more than years after the limitations period had expired.nonetheless,the taxpayer claims that for a variety of reasons the claim was timely.
understanding the taxpayer contentions requires a description of the overall regulatory scheme.section a of the internal revenue code bars a taxpayer from filing a suit for refund until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the secretary,according to the provisions of law in that regard,and the regulations of the secretary established in pursuance thereof.a.the secretary by regulation requires that claims for refund set forth in detail each ground upon which a credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the commissioner of the exact basis thereof.b emphasis added.earlier regulations contained similar provisions.see,united states kales.citing article of treasury regulation,promulgated under the revenue act pipe foundry,united states,citing regs.
the requirement for filing a proper refund claim is designed both to prevent surprise and to give adequate notice to the service of the nature of the claim and the specific facts upon which it is predicated,thereby permitting an administrative investigation and determination.alexander proudfoot united states,quoting union pac.united states,cert denied,d.this requirement for claim specificity applies equally to claims for deficiency interest which are separate from claims for the underlying tax liability.john lambert,united states,wl,at.
the supreme court has held that in some circumstances a taxpayer claim is not barred by the statute of limitations even though the taxpayer did not timely file the formal,detailed claim required by the regulations.see,kales,at.united states andrews.united states memphis cotton oil.tucker alexander.unfortunately in implementing the supreme court decisions the language used to describe these exceptions has not always been uniform in courts outside of this circuit.
in this circuit this aggregation of rules has come to be known as the substantial variance doctrine.see lockheed martin united states,see also western of am.united states,union pac,at armstrong rubber united states,wl,at.the doctrine permits consideration of a claim for refund despite failure to timely file detailed formal claims with the irs when a substantial variance from the requirements of the regulation is not involved but this doctrine applies only in four limited situations.each of these has itself come to be identified as a separate doctrine.
first,formal compliance with the statute and regulations is excused when the informal claim doctrine is applicable.under the informal claim doctrine,a timely claim with purely formal defects is permissible if it fairly apprises the irs of the basis for the claim within the limitations period.
the informal claim doctrine is best described in the supreme court decision in kales.there within the limitations period the taxpayer submitted an informal letter claiming a refund of tax.the letter did not comply with the irs regulations because it was not filed on the correct form.the taxpayer later filed an untimely amendment that complied with the regulations.the supreme court held that a timely notice fairly advising the commissioner of the nature of the taxpayer claim will nevertheless be treated as a n effective claim,where formal defects have been remedied by amendment filed after the lapse of the statutory period.id.at.
the informal claim doctrine is well recognized in other circuits we and our predecessor court,the court of claims,have specifically applied the doctrine.see,arch eng,united states,barenfeld united states,stuart united states,am.radiator standard sanitary united states.
in american radiator the court of claims held that i nformal refund claims have long been held valid when they have a written component and adequately apprise the internal revenue service that a refund is sought and for certain years.at citing kales.the court of claims found that the taxpayer filed an informal claim by writing various notations and figures on its timely filed income tax return.see also newton united states,finding informal refund claim based on written protests prior to payment night hawk leasing united states,finding informal refund claim based on objection on the back of a check paying the tax.
in western of north america united states,we recognized that the doctrine applies in circumstances in which the taxpayer action involved a request for information.western,at.the irs mistakenly assessed the taxpayer a ftf penalty.see also western of am.united states.the taxpayer,unaware of what had caused this penalty,repeatedly requested information about the basis for the penalty but did not file a formal claim for a refund.the irs documented this request in writing.at.we held that the substantial variance doctrine did not bar the taxpayer refund claim because,during the limitations period,western had repeated ly request ed information that would have allowed filing of an informed claim,and thereby put the irs on notice of its challenges to the false assessment.id.at.
the informal claim doctrine is of no assistance to the taxpayer here.computervision original complaint was formal,and contained no specific suggestion that interest was in dispute.the complaint simply alleged that computervision is aggrieved by the defendant failure to refund the interest attributable to the purported disqualification of cvi as a disc.there was no further communication from computervision to the irs during the limitations period suggesting that computervision was asserting a claim for interest.as the court of federal claims found,the original claim could not reasonably provide notice to the irs of the interest suspension claims.computervision.at.thus,computervision refund claim was not a valid informal claim.
a second exception exists known as the waiver doctrine.if the taxpayer files a timely formal claim but fails to include the specific claim for relief,the claim may nonetheless be considered timely if the irs considers that specific claim within the limitations period.the irs consideration of the specific claim is held to be a waiver of the requirement of the regulation that the refund claim set forth in detail each ground upon which a credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the commissioner of the exact basis thereof.b.
the supreme court recognized the waiver doctrine in memphis cotton,and angelus milling commissioner.in memphis cotton,the supreme court found a waiver where during investigation of the taxpayer original claim and within the limitations period the commissioner discovered that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund on a specific ground,and notified the taxpayer that a refund would be made.at.after the limitations period expired,the commissioner reversed its position and refused to grant the refund.the taxpayer then filed an amendment asserting its right to a refund.id.at.the court held that the amendment was timely because l ong before the amendment the commissioner had ascertained the facts and had even notified the taxpayer of the justice of its claims and of the ruling of the bureau that adjustments would be made accordingly.id.at.
in angelus milling,the court held that the claim was untimely but stated that a waiver might be found where t he evidence is clear that the commissioner understood the specific claim that was made even though there was a departure from form in its submission,and t he showing is unmistakable that the commissioner has in fact seen fit to dispense with the formal requirements and to examine the merits of the claim.at.see,united states garbutt oil.w hile the commissioner might have enforced the regulation and rejected a claim for failure to comply with it in omitting to state with particularity the grounds on which the claim was based,he was not bound to do so,but might waive the requirement of the regulation and consider a general claim on its merits.
various other courts and authorities have also recognized the waiver doctrine our predecessor court also recognized the doctrine.in consolidated coppermines united states,the court of claims held that a claim could be filed outside the limitations period if it raised a ground that the irs had discovered,within the limitations period,during investigation of the original claim.the court found that the amendment filed outside the limitations period merely made more definite the matters already within the knowledge of the commissioner,which in the course of his investigation he actually did ascertain.at internal quotations and citations omitted see pipe foundry,w here the commissioner determines and applies newly discovered or different grounds in computing the taxpayer liability he is precluded from thereafter denying the refund because the claim was incompatible with his regulations forge ordnance united states,allowing taxpayer to assert a claim in court where the claim for refund was sufficient to cause the commissioner to consider the matters which are the basis of the present suit see also union pac,at recognizing that an item raised in litigation but not specifically adverted to in the original claim might be permitted if it is found that the commissioner considered that unspecified ground in reaching his decision on the items for which a refund was requested.
the central purpose of the waiver doctrine is to prevent irs agents from lulling taxpayers into missing the limitations deadline bcs,at pala,at quoting bcs,at.where the taxpayer learns,within the limitations period,that the irs has addressed the merits of a particular ground,and thus fails to file a timely formal claim raising that ground,the taxpayer claim is not barred.
however,we agree with the court of federal claims that the irs can not waive the requirements of its regulations by conduct outside of the limitations period.see computervision.at.in garbutt oil,the commissioner considered the merits of a claim for a tax refund after the limitations period had expired.at.the argument was that the commissioner had waived the requirements of the regulation.the court held that the claim was not timely,reasoning that no officer of the government has power to waive the statute of limitations id.at.this conclusion follows from the statute itself.even the erroneous allowance of a refund that is barred by the statute of limitations can not prevent the government from recovering that allowance.section allows the government to bring suit to recover an erroneous refund.a b.section provides that a refund is erroneous if it is made after the expiration of the limitations period and no timely claim was filed.a.
our predecessor court has similarly held that a waiver may not occur after the limitations period expires.in sicanoff vegetable oil united states,the court of claims refused to find a waiver where the taxpayer filed timely claim asserting one ground,the limitations period expired,and the commissioner then by mistake considered a different second ground.the taxpayer filed an untimely amendment asserting the second ground.id.at.the court held that the commissioner was not permitted by law to pay such a claim,and his consideration of it could not enlarge his legal authority.id.at.see also melchior united states.
the taxpayer relies on a few excess profits tax cases decided in other jurisdictions for the proposition that the requirements of what is now b may be waived after the statute of limitations has expired.see dale distributing,cir eisenstadt comm r,wl martin weiner comm r,wl many of those cases involved special regulations under the excess profits provisions that imposed unusually detailed claim requirements.see eisenstadt,at dale,at.those decisions are not binding on this court,and are inconsistent with garbutt oil and sicanoff if they are viewed as allowing a waiver after the limitations period.moreover,as other circuits have recognized expanding the scope of the waiver doctrine as the taxpayer urges would appear to be inconsistent with more recent supreme court authority holding that actions of regulatory authorities can not either extend the statute of limitations under section by equitable tolling or create an estoppel against the government.see brockamp,d holding that equitable tolling does not apply to toll section office of pers.mgmt.richmond,d holding that conduct of a government agent could not estop the government from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law.the taxpayer has not called our attention to any or richmond decisions in other jurisdictions that have applied the waiver doctrine to actions by the irs taking place after the running of the limitations period 
here there is no contention that the irs considered the taxpayer claim for interest within the limitations period.rather computervision contends that the irs waived the specificity requirement nine years after the limitations period expired in an august,letter from the irs to computervision that included a set of interest computations applying interest suspension to the interest.the letter also stated that revenue ruling sequa interest suspension is applied regarding the credit elect to.no claim is necessary.at.computervision can not benefit from the waiver doctrine because the irs consideration occurred long after the expiration of the limitations period.
a third exception,which we refer to as the general claim doctrine,exists where the taxpayer has filed a formal general claim within the limitations period and an amendment is filed outside the limitations period that makes the general claim more specific.the supreme court described this exception in united states andrews.
where a claim which the commissioner could have rejected as too general,and as omitting to specify the matters needing investigation,has not misled him but has been the basis of an investigation which disclosed facts necessary to his action in making a refund,an amendment which merely makes more definite the matters already within his knowledge,or which,in the course of his investigation,he would naturally have ascertained,is permissible.
the supreme court thus recognized that an amendment making a general claim more specific may be permissible even when filed outside the limitations period.
the supreme court applied the general claim doctrine in united states factors fin.there the irs performed an audit of the taxpayer,but the audit was incomplete when the statute of limitations expired.in order to preserve any claims resulting from the audit,the taxpayer filed a general claim before the limitations period expired requesting a refund of all the taxes it had paid.the claim did not set forth any specific ground,and explained that its purpose was to permit the commissioner to refund to deponent any excess paid over taxes actually found to be due.id.at.the court held that the taxpayer subsequent amendment was not barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.a general claim for refund,not specifying grounds,is subject to amendment until final rejection irrespective of a limitation running in the interval.id.at.citing memphis cotton oil.similarly,in memphis cotton the court held that an amendment to a general claim,filed outside the limitations period,was timely where the original claim merely stated the amount of the tax paid,the correct tax and the amount of overpayment,but did not specify the facts or reasons justifying a refund.at.
our predecessor court recognized the general claim doctrine in at least one case,cochran united states,where the court permitted an untimely amendment to a general claim that requested refunds relating to losses not claimed.the court held that the amendment perfected and made specific the original general ground.id.at.
however,the general claim doctrine only applies when the original claim is general rather than specific.in united states henry prentiss,the supreme court held that where the original timely claim asserted a specific ground,it could not be amended out of time to claim a new basis for relief unrelated to the original claim.id.at.likewise in andrews the court found that an amendment to a claim raising a specific ground was untimely because t he very specification of the items of complaint would tend to confine the investigation to those items and there is no evidence that the examination was more extended.at.
here computervision original claim was not general but specific.it contained a specific request for interest which claimed the portion of the interest paid that is attributable to the disc disqualification issue.at.
to be sure the original claim included a secondary,general claim.the general claim was a boilerplate provision stating 
computervision claims as a basis for the refund of the interest paid with respect to its taxable year such other grounds as are shown to be appropriate by the tax returns,books and records and the examination report and related protest of computervision and cvi for their respective tax years ended december,and january.
at.in andrews the supreme court rejected the argument that the general claim doctrine was applicable under such circumstances.as here,the taxpayer claim in andrews not only called for redress of a specified grievance but demanded general relief as well.at.the court held that the taxpayer amendment was barred by the statute of limitations,reasoning that t he very specification of the items of complaint would tend to confine the investigation to those items and there is no evidence that the examination was more extended.id.at.thus computervision untimely claim for interest does not meet the requirements of the general claim doctrine 
where the general claim doctrine is inapplicable because the original claim was not general but specific,a related doctrine,the germaneness doctrine,may allow relief.this fourth exception only applies where the taxpayer files a formal claim within the limitations period making a specific claim and after the limitations period but,while the irs still has jurisdiction over the claim,files a formal amendment raising a new legal specifically raised in the original is germane to the original claim,that is,it depends upon facts that the irs examined or should have examined within the statutory period while determining the merits of the original claim.unlike the waiver doctrine,the inquiry here is not whether the particular legal theory for recovery has been considered by the irs during the limitations period but whether the underlying facts supporting that legal theory were discovered or should have been discovered by the irs in considering the original claim during the limitations period.
the supreme court recognized this exception in bemis brothers bag united states.in bemis,the taxpayer filed a timely claim for a refund with the commissioner,arguing that the commissioner should allow a special assessment for determining invested capital for excess profits tax purposes because invested capital could not be calculated with precision.id.at.to support this claim,the taxpayer urged that the precise values of certain items could not be ascertained.the commissioner denied the claim.after the limitations period expired but before the refund suit was filed,the taxpayer filed an amendment specifically urging that the items should be included in invested capital because they could be calculated,and that the tax should be recalculated on that basis.id.at.thus,the taxpayer amendment did not require inquiry into a new set of facts,but simply adapted the form of relief to the facts which would have to be examined during investigation of the original claim.the court held that the claim as amended does not differ in matter of substance from the claim as first presented,because i f the commissioner found that there had been omissions,but that he was able to his own satisfaction to identify and appraise them,he would learn in the process that there had been an undervaluation of invested capital,and that the assessment of the tax was correspondingly erroneous.id.at.
this doctrine also was described in the supreme court decision in andrews.there,in addition to holding that the general claim was inadequate because it was accompanied by a specific claim,the court held the specific claim was inadequate because it was not germane to the later asserted ground.andrews,at.
other circuits have also recognized this exception our predecessor court has also recognized this doctrine.in addressograph,for example,the court of claims held that an amendment filed outside the limitations period was proper and germane because investigation of the merits of the original claim would have necessarily involved a consideration of the facts the amendment depended on.united states.the amendment merely made more definite the matters already within the knowledge o
