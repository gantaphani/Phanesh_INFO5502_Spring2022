this action for refund of property taxes and for declaratory relief was brought by an of an independent electric power plant,plaintiff and appellant elk hills power,llc elk hills,against defendant california state board of equalization the board,and the county of kern the county,where the plant is located,for taxes paid from to.as a state assessee,elk hills sued the defendants under california revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a elk hills major claim of entitlement to refunds relates to the application of section,which provides definitions and guidelines for determining the full cash value or fair market value of assessed property,including,as relevant here,the treatment of intangible rights relating to the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used,and relating to the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes,subd.a.
specifically,in order to construct and operate its independent electric power plant the power plant,elk hills purchased and applied certain emission reduction credits ercs,pursuant to health and safety code section,with the approval of regulatory authorities.such credits are part of a statutory scheme allowing the issuing,applying,deploying,trading,banking,refunding of interchangeable air pollution ercs,among regulatory authorities and power plant operators also known as emissions sources,to enable a plant owner to suitably operate its power plant,in terms of its selection of the available technology and compliance with regulatory limits on pollution.health,for regulations implementing,see,tit,et.
according to health and safety code section,subdivision b,this erc system is not intended to recognize any preexisting right to emit air contaminants,but to provide a mechanism for regulatory districts to recognize the existence of reductions of air contaminants that can be used as offsets,and to provide greater certainty that the offsets shall be available for emitting industries.ibid.once this power plant went into operation,it began to utilize elk hills deployed ercs,and it will continue to do so while it operates at its current level,to continue its compliance with state emissions requirements.pub.resources code,et,the warren alquist state energy resources conservation and development act.
beginning in,when the board assessed elk hills power plant on a unitary basis,it utilized two valuation approaches,a replacement cost approach and an income analysis.itt world communications,city and county of san francisco cal d itt.with respect to each approach,it considered the value added to the power plant by the ercs,in their nature as intangible rights that contributed to the productivity and value of the power plant property,subd.e taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.
on appeal,elk hills contends the trial court misinterpreted section,when granting the board motion for summary judgment and denying the of elk hills.in applying section,the trial court drew certain conclusions from the undisputed facts to determine that when elk hills purchased and applied the ercs for construction and operation of its power plant,the ercs represented intangible rights that relate directly to the power plant real property,and therefore section,subdivision f applied since those ercs are not transferable while the plant is operating in accordance with the way it was built,the ercs were necessary to lawfully operate the power plant in accordance with state emissions requirements,subd.e.using those conclusions,the trial court relied on section,subdivisions e and f,to rule in favor of the board the erc rights apply directly to the power plant real property because they were necessary to construct the power plant thus,the board properly included these rights in its replacement cost approach and was not required to subtract such rights from its income analysis.
on appeal,elk hills points out that this is a matter of first impression with respect to the character of ercs as intangible rights.it renews the arguments made to the trial court,that under the parties stipulated facts and a proper construction of section,when all its subdivisions are read together and harmonized,the board should be found to have illegally imposed extra annual taxes directly upon the valuable intangible erc assets worth around million,or alternatively,failed to deduct their value as required,thereby imposing on elk hills an extra tax burden of around in all,for the subject five years,subd.d.
to support its claims,elk hills relies on basic canons of statutory construction and on the authorities interpreting the character of intangible rights,and argues the ercs were impermissibly separately assessed under the terms of section,subdivision d except as provided in subdivision e,for purposes of determining the full cash value or fair market value of any taxable property,all of the following shall apply the value of intangible assets and rights relating to the going concern value of a business using taxable property shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of the taxable property.if the principle of unit valuation is used to value properties that are operated as a unit and the unit includes intangible assets and rights,then the fair market value of the taxable property contained within the unit shall be determined by removing from the value of the unit the fair market value of the intangible assets and rights contained within the unit italics added.
in response,the board,joined by the county together the board,contends that a proper determination of the statutorily defined character of ercs as intangible rights leads to a conclusion that the governing provision is section,subdivision e an express exception to,subd.d,such that under section,subdivision e,this power plant must be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.ibid.according to the board,these ercs are intangible assets that can not be separately taxed as property,but that may be reflected in the valuation of taxable property,because assessing authorities may take into consideration those earnings derived from the unit that depend upon the possession of intangible rights and privileges that are not themselves regarded as a separate class of taxable property.roehm orange county cal d,roehm.
the board is correct.its unitary taxation determinations properly assessed the power plant as a going concern.itt,supra,cal d,original italics.the board worksheets in the record that contained adjustments for the ercs,as relied on by elk hills,do not demonstrate the board impermissibly assessed and taxed the value of the ercs as a single asset,even though the tax forms filed by elk hills listed a value for the asset.instead,the board legitimately took into account the value added by the ercs,as contributing to the value and earnings of the property as a whole.based on the undisputed facts presented here,we limit our decision to an interpretation of section,subdivision e,and need not reach issues concerning subdivision f of that section.under section,subdivision e,the power plant was correctly assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use,because without the presence of the deployed ercs,the power plant can not operate and function as intended,to make energy and money.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
emission reduction credits assessments complaint 
in the early,elk hills,as the of an independent wholesale electric power company,built the plant in kern county,california in compliance with emission regulations of the san joaquin air pollution control district the district,elk hills purchased about million worth of ercs,and used them to obtain the necessary permits and certifications for the power plant,completed in,to commence operations.beginning in,elk hills filed tax returns that included the board form boe i form i,reporting the cost of the ercs as.
in and continuing into,the board utilized one of the three general methods of valuation for property assessment of the plant.this was the replacement cost approach for analyzing valuation,in light of the cost of replacing the property with a substitute property,less accrued depreciation the replacement cost approach.see watson cogeneration county of los angeles th,watson.
from to,the board continued to use the replacement cost approach in part,as next explained,and it also added an alternative valuation method,an income approach utilizing a capitalized earning ability or cea factor the income approach the board gave this income approach less weight than the replacement cost approach,the income approach represented percent of the analysis in,and percent in.
in reaching its valuation conclusions,the board assessor worksheets listed a adjustment for each year that referred to the ercs as part of the calculation of replacement cost estimates.the parties do not dispute that the adjustment was applied per megawatt to reach the value of the ercs,as part of the board analysis of statewide information from regulatory authorities,to factor in a replacement amount for the ercs.the power plant generates at least megawatts,and the assessor notes also take into account figures on depreciation and remaining economic life,among other relevant considerations 
after amendments,in february,elk hills operative complaint for tax refunds under section,subdivision a,was filed in san diego as the proper venue,due to the location of an office of the attorney general here.elk hills set forth the lien date unitary assessed values for each of the five years assessments that were challenged,ranging from around million through million,and alleged that these were excessive because the board had assessed the intangible ercs in an illegal manner.the board and county answered the complaint and case management proceedings followed.
cross motions for summary judgment 
the parties prepared for summary judgment,arguing questions of law for interpretation of the definitions provided in section and section.in elk hills motion,it argued the ercs qualify as intangible assets that are exempt from taxation,under section and section,subdivision c,providing intangible assets and rights are exempt from taxation and,except as otherwise provided in the following sentence,the value of intangible assets and rights shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of taxable property.taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.italics added.
in support of its motion,elk hills provided an original and supplemental declarations by james asay,its tax manager.also in support,elk hills provided a declaration by its vice president,joseph rowley,who described the process through which elk hills obtained governmental approvals for the plant,by purchasing and deploying the ercs for almost million.the surrendered erc certificates do not have a face value.elk hills did not dispute that it could not operate the plant as designed without applying the ercs,under applicable regulation.
in general,each declaration from elk hills describes the assessment process and the respective understandings of how the ercs were treated as intangible assets,as supported by documents prepared during the process and newly prepared interpretive analyses.the declarations incorporate numerous exhibits,including annual tax forms reporting the cost of acquiring the ercs over million,excerpts from the board manuals and guidelines,and a supporting legal memorandum on behalf of a board member.according to elk hills,in preparing the unitary valuation of the plant,using the two different valuation methods,the board failed to recognize that the value of all relevant governmental permits were already bundled in,and it impermissibly treated the ercs value separately.the refunds sought amounted to somewhere between to.
in the board motion for summary judgment,it sought to defend its assessments as appropriate under well accepted unitary valuation methods and principles.in support of its motion,the board provided original and supplemental declarations by its principal property appraiser donald jackson,who described the valuation methods and considerations his staff used in calculating the unitary value of the plant.they included in the valuation the typical costs associated with possessing many types of permits necessary to the facilities construction and operation,including not only ercs but also building permits and waste discharge permits.other costs were capitalized to such permits,including filing fees,engineering fees,environmental fees,attorney fees,and so forth soft costs.the staff did not expressly consider actual or booked erc costs,as those were reported on elk hills tax forms to be further described in the discussion portion of this opinion.normally,ercs are issued to sources of emissions,and they can be banked to offset an operator future emission overloads,or a power plant operator can sell the ercs to other sources.health,et.
the board provided a declaration from david warner,director of the permit services department for the district,about the necessity for ercs,if a power plant operator can not otherwise comply with emission control regulations.to construct the plant,elk hills supplied the best available control technology bact to reduce emissions,but it nevertheless was also required to purchase ercs at market rates,to allow it to use its technology at megawatt production levels and to offset future emissions.
elk hills was therefore required to surrender or deploy five of the certificates for ercs it had purchased,from other emission sources,to enable its technology to produce power at the permitted levels.these covered excess pollutants such as nitrogen oxides,volatile organic compounds,and sulfur oxides.
judicial notice was sought and granted of legislative history materials for section and section,subdivision c,to support the board position that ercs must be considered in determining the fair market value of power plants,through assuming the presence of the ercs as intangible assets or rights that are necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use,and allowing them to be reflected in the fair market value determination.
an extensive opposition and reply process then took place,in which each party filed supplemental and responsive separate statements,containing more documentation of the plant approval process and the five years of assessments.the county joined in the position taken by the board.
oral argument and rulings 
at the outset,the trial court observed that there appeared to be some remaining factual dispute about how the assessments were actually carried out,whether the ercs were separately assessed,or whether their presence was assumed as part of the replacement value calculation,and later in the income approach.in response,elk hills argued that the site specific adjustments erc displayed on board worksheets showed how separate valuation and separate taxes must have been imposed on the ercs.elk hills also contended that its tax forms,form i,provided evidence that the ercs cost over million,which was value that could be removed,but a portion of that value was apparently impermissibly taxed,when the board worksheets referred to the adjustments for the ercs,of amounts ranging from.
the board position,on the other hand,was that under either valuation method,the ercs were necessary to the beneficial and productive use of the plant,requiring that the unit valuation assumed there was value they contributed or added,such that no separate assessments of the intangibles were made.the ercs amounted to costs necessary for the use of the property that could not be removed from the assessment.the ercs were related to the particular property involved,which the regulatory authorities had evaluated in terms of its weather conditions,inversion layers,and other factors that affected how much pollution could be tolerated there.
at oral argument,the parties did not address section,subdivision f until the latter part of the hearing.ultimately,the trial court ruled there were no triable issues of material fact and summary judgment must be granted for the board,while the by elk hills was denied.the order made the following key findings 
the emission reduction credits ercs purchased and applied by elk for its power plant provide s intangible rights that relate directly to the power plant real property.the closest case is mitsui fudosan county of los angeles d dealing with intangible transferable development rights.
the ercs were purchased and used by elk to build its power plant in compliance with the san joaquin air pollution control district emission requirements.the ercs in question,while purchased and tradable at one point,were purchased and applied to build the power plant.furthermore,such ercs are not transferable while the plant is operating in accordance with the way it was built.the ercs were necessary to lawfully operate the power plant in accordance with state emissions requirements.
the ercs rights apply directly to the power plant real property because they were necessary to construct the power plant thus,they fall within revenue and taxation code section,subdivision f.therefore,the board of equalization properly included these rights in its replacement cost approach and was not required to subtract such rights from its income analysis.declaratory relief was denied.
elk hills brought a motion for new trial,which was denied.mainly,elk hills unmeritoriously argued that when oral argument was held on the merits,the trial court had frankly admitted to having some difficulty in deciding the case,and that factor somehow justified an assumption that there was a doubt or ambiguity in the construction of section and,therefore,the case should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.see california motor transp.state board of equalization cal d,california motor transp.statutes levying taxes will be construed,in doubtful or ambiguous cases,in favor of the taxpayer rather than the government entity.
in response to elk hills new trial arguments,the trial court candidly admitted that it had struggled with the interpretation of section,but even applying the statutory construction rule that was cited california motor,supra,cal d,the court adhered to its original ruling,based upon its understanding of case authority for characterization of intangible assets for taxation purposes,which allowed the ercs value to be included in the unitary valuation.the board motion for summary judgment was granted and judgment was entered in favor of the board and the county.elk hills appeals.
discussion 
after setting forth basic rules of review,we frame the issues presented for interpretation of section,with reference to its subdivisions upon which the parties rely.we then set forth unitary tax principles and the rules regarding the tax treatment of intangible assets.to properly characterize the intangible rights represented by the ercs,we refer to the highlights of the separate statutory schemes that created ercs.we can then determine the appropriate nature of the rights and privileges that ercs represent,for tax purposes.
applicable standards 
we review de novo the trial court decision to grant the board summary judgment on stipulated and undisputed facts.shamsian atlantic richfield th.because the court was presented with purely legal questions,its statement of decision is not binding on us,and we are free to draw our own conclusions of law from the stipulated and undisputed facts.sea world,county of san diego th,independent energy producers,state bd.of equalization,supra,th.
likewise,since the primary issue presented at trial and on appeal,statutory interpretation,is a question of law,we independently review the issue.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,yamaha i.the ultimate interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power conferred upon the courts by the constitution and,in the absence of a constitutional provision,can not be exercised by any other body.id.at,citing bodinson california employment commission cal d.

at this point,we address the initial argument made by elk hills that generally,statutes levying taxes will be construed,in doubtful or ambiguous cases,in favor of the taxpayer rather than the government entity.california motor,supra,cal d.on the other hand,statutes providing an exemption from tax are reasonably,but strictly,construed against the taxpayer.standard oil,supra,d.an exemption will not be inferred from doubtful statutory language,and settled principles of statutory construction require that any doubt be resolved against the right to the exemption citation.ibid.
in fact,elk hills does not claim ambiguity of section per se,instead arguing only its subdivision d may control.the board characterizes that argument as seeking an exemption from taxation of ercs,and also an exemption for any value they might add to taxable property.section is not itself a levying nor an exemption provision,but instead,it appears in property tax law in the chapter for construction and defining terms to be used in that body of law.tax code,div.i,property taxation,general provisions,pt,ch,construction.our purpose is to construe section in its definitional sense,for defining fair market value of,in this case,state assessed property 
we accordingly reject any argument by elk hills that the statements by the trial court in rendering its rulings,that this was a difficult case,somehow mean that the taxpayer must prevail,merely applying the canons of statutory construction.tax litigation is inherently complex,and the trial court was merely making a well justified observation,with which we agree.in any case,it is well accepted that we must review the correctness of the ruling,and not the reasoning of the trial court.board of medical examiners cal d.the proper approach is to construe the statute according to the above rules,without unnecessary preconceptions,and then apply its provisions to the undisputed facts in the record.
interpretation of sections and 
our task is to apply the statutory definitions set forth in sections and in the present context of unitary taxation of the power plant.unit taxation prevents real but intangible value from escaping assessment and taxation by treating public utility property as a whole,undifferentiated into separate assets land,buildings,vehicles,or even separate kinds of assets realty or personalty.itt,supra,cal d.
in defining full cash value or fair market value in section,subdivision a,the legislature refers to the basic qualities of a bona fide sale of property on the open market,where the parties are not under undue pressure to sell,and both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used,and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes,subd.a italics added.obviously,a power plant is subject to numerous such governmental restrictions,both at ground level and in the air,where pollutants are emitted.obtaining permits for operation at certain emission levels is required so that the power plant technology can operate at its optimal level.
according to elk hills,section,subdivision d,must govern its assessment,so that with respect to the replacement cost approach,erc values intangibles can not be included for the plant value.then,with respect to the income indicator approach,erc values would be removed,excluded,or deducted from the plant value.as support in the record,elk hills relies on its form i,estimating the cost of its ercs at over million.it also relies on the board assessor worksheets that show there is a adjustment for ercs,in the replacement cost calculation,for most of the tax years.
before evaluating those claims,we note that it is significant that section,subdivision d,the subdivision elk hills relies upon,begins except as provided in subdivision e,for purposes of determining the full cash value or fair market value of any taxable property,all of the following shall apply.italics added.because section,subdivision d operates only as not otherwise provided in subdivision e,it is important to read all the subdivisions together.
in section,subdivision d,the enumerated criteria are the value of intangible assets and rights relating to the going concern value of a business using taxable property shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of the taxable property.apparently,any real property taxation question may fall within that subsection.however,its subdivision d then specifically refers,as here,to a unitary valuation case if the principle of unit valuation is used to value properties that are operated as a unit and the unit includes intangible assets and rights,then the fair market value of the taxable property contained within the unit shall be determined by removing from the value of the unit the fair market value of the intangible assets and rights contained within the unit.italics added we need not consider its subdivision d,relating to concessions or franchises,which are not involved here.
section,subdivision e,states in full taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.italics added.we think that determining whether this necessary criteria is present,with respect to intangible assets relating to a given taxable property,will be the critical factor for determining whether section,subdivision d or subdivision e will govern the treatment of the intangible assets.
before turning to the meaning of section,subdivision f,as cited by the trial court we first seek to reconcile the interaction of its subdivisions d and e,in the case of a unitary valuation matter,like this one.according to elk hills,section,subdivision d stands alone in a unit valuation case and must require the fair market value of the taxable property contained within the unit to be determined by removing from that value the fair market value of the intangible assets and rights contained within the unit.this would be some level of return upon its reported value of the erc assets,yearly,or a total of about over the five years.
to the contrary,the board argues that in a unitary valuation case,it is not correct to read section,subdivision d without first referring to section,subdivision e,which overrides it as the principal component of the section definitions.section,subdivision e therefore requires that since the power plant can not operate at a beneficial or productive level without its permits,including the ercs,then the plant should be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use,which allows the ercs to be valued within the power plant operating context,even if not separately.italics added see itt,supra,cal d,public utility property is valued as a whole,undifferentiated into separate assets land,buildings,vehicles,or even separate kinds of assets realty or personalty.necessary operating permits are part of the greater whole,even with regard to their value.
likewise,section,subdivision c,contains necessity language very similar to section,subdivision e intangible assets and rights are exempt from taxation and,except as otherwise provided in the following sentence,the value of intangible assets and rights shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of taxable property.taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use,subd.c italics added.
on a preliminary basis,we disagree with elk hills that the initial clause of section,subdivision d may be disregarded i,that referring to,subd.e.nor can the two subdivisions both be implemented here.instead,whether for unitary or other property taxation,section,subdivision e must govern in those cases where it is critical for the assessor to consider how the taxable property is put to beneficial or productive use,and when such beneficial or productive use requires the presence of intangible assets or rights as necessary.in such a case,the appraiser for the assessor may assume their presence in valuing the property.here,this would mean taking into account the value added to the plant by the existence of the applied ercs,when assessing the plant as a going concern,while it is producing power and emitting pollutants as allowed by the ercs.see itt,supra,cal d.
although the trial court expressly relied upon section,subdivision f,we must review the actual decision and not the reasoning of the trial court it might be observed that it is unclear whether the terms of section,subdivision f,specifying real property,may be squarely applicable to unitary valuation,which includes both real and personal property.see itt,supra,cal d.it is a most abstract question if ercs,as intangibles,expressly qualify as attributes of real property,such as zoning or location,or are other attributes that relate directly to the real property involved,since ercs allow some level of pollution to be emitted,but mainly in the airspace above the real property.it is not necessary for us to engage in such an academic exercise and we decline to base our decision upon section,subdivision f.
we now turn to the particular nature of the ercs to test the above hypothesis on the sole applicability of section,subdivision e,under a necessity analysis.how much of a separate,intangible,alienable character is retained by the ercs,when they have been applied to property for which they are necessary for the ongoing highest and best use of the property stated another way,under section,subdivision a,is the value represented by the ercs a component of the unitary value,in light of the enforceable restrictions upon the use of the property as a power plant 
related statutory schemesa.features of unitary taxation of power plant 
california constitution,article xiii,section is the general provision for property taxation of all forms of tangible personal property,and any legal or equitable interest therein not exempt under any other provision of this article it is undisputed that california constitution,article xiii,section governs,authorizing the board to annually assess certain property,including companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity.this property shall be subject to taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as other property.ibid.
the board is charged with the ad valorem unit taxation of public utility property by article xiii,section of the california constitution.gte sprint communications county of alameda th,gte sprint.it is well understood that unit taxation of public utility property is necessary to ascertain and reach with the taxing power the entire real value of such property.itt,supra,cal d.p ublic utility property can not be regarded as merely land,buildings,and other assets.rather,its value depends on the interrelation and operation of the entire utility as a unit.many of the separate assets would be practically valueless without the rest of the system.ibid.
thus,in reading together the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions in itt,the supreme court concluded that unit taxation is properly characterized not as the taxation of real property or personal property or even a combination of both,but rather as the taxation of property as a going concern.first,what the board assesses is the value of the public utility property as a going concern it considers the earnings of the property as a whole,and does not consider,less still assess,the value of any single real or personal asset.second,what the board allocates to the local taxing authority is,again,a share of the value of the public utility property as a going concern itt,supra,cal d,original italics.
to value utility property as a going concern,the board must appraise it at its full value when put to its beneficial and productive use.gte sprint,supra,th,citing itt,supra,cal d at also see the board may use the principle of unit valuation in valuing properties of an assessee that are operated as a unit in a primary function of the assessee.
we are aware that the same going concern language used by the supreme court in itt,supra,cal d,a unitary valuation case,also appears in section,subdivision d,regarding the valuation of a business using taxable property and also using intangible assets but not necessarily in a unitary valuation case.however,the going concern language does not appear in the subdivision relied upon by elk hills,section,subdivision d,which is limited to unitary valuation cases.nor does section,subdivision e mention it.for our purposes,the going concern concept applied to utility operations,as explained by the supreme court,is the most useful.for a particular kind of intangible asset the necessary kind,we believe section,subdivision e should be used for evaluating this operating power plant.
tax treatment of intangible assets 
in carrying out the functions of the power plant,elk hills is subject to numerous form of governmental regulation,including permit requirements of varying types.many governmental permits or licenses are classic examples of intangible assets,some of them necessary to the business and some of them optional or readily transferable.roehm,supra,cal d,stands for the basic proposition that intangible assets that are not specified in the statutory definitions of assets subject to taxation are exempt from property assessment,in particular,liquor licenses.however,the court also made clear that intangible asset values that can not be separately taxed as property may be reflected in the valuation of taxable property.thus,in determining the value of property,assessing authorities may take into consideration earnings derived therefrom,which may depend upon the possession of intangible rights and privileges that are not themselves regarded as a separate class of taxable property.id.at.
in watson,supra,th,the court provides a short course in the lore of intangible assets.under section,subdivision c,the value of intangible assets and rights shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of taxable property.but subdivision c also provides that t axable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.see also,subds.d e.in accordance with this exemption,california decisions have held that assets such as copyrights,liquor licenses,airport car rental concessions,ballpark food concessions,and cable television franchises are intangible rights which can not be directly subjected to property tax assessment.citations.but while intangible property is exempted from direct property taxation,the courts in this state have repeatedly held that the value of such intangible property may be included in the valuation of otherwise taxable tangible property.citations.watson,supra,at.
in gte sprint,supra,th,the court applied established rules that intangible asset values may be treated as enhancing the value of the tangible property,but nevertheless,where it is possible to identify and value certain intangible assets and estimate their separate income expectancies,then the board must exclude their values when assessing the tangible property for taxation.id.at.on that record,the court found certain nontaxable intangible assets were inexplicably deemed by the assessor,without analysis,to be subsumed in the fair market value of the property,such that no effort was made to remove the value of the following nontaxable,intangible assets the sprint trade name customer base assembled workforce favorable broadband leases of transmission capacity from other carriers favorable property leases advertising agency relationships favorable debt financing contracts inventory of advertising materials and the benefit of avoiding significant costs by purchasing a going concern,which sprint identified as goodwill and other intangible assets.id.at.
in gte sprint,supra,th,the court ruled that the assessor had used an erroneously absolutist approach,by failing to make any effort to identify and value any nontaxable item,for purposes of deducting them from the allocated unit value.although the intangible assets were valuable and enhanced the unit value,some of them also had independent value,apart from any possessory interest in the unit.see shubat sutter county assessment appeals bd.th.in shubat,the court reasoned while we agree intangible values may be reflected in the value of a possessory interest,it does not follow such values are subsumed as a matter of law.id.at,cited in gte sprint,supra,th at original italics.
thus,an assessor can not merely pay lip service to the concept of exempting intangible assets from taxation.if there is substantial evidence showing the presence and separate value of such intangible assets,the intangibles must be excluded from assessment.gte sprint,supra,th.an assessor can not merely characterize all intangibles as providing enhancement value of the unit,if the evidence is otherwise.this would thwart meaningful judicial review.id.at.
thus,in gte sprint,the court required reassessment,because the board appraisers are required by law to identify and value intangible assets,if any,and exclude these values from the appraisal of the taxpayer property.the board own appraisers admitted that they did not attempt to identify any intangible assets,but instead ignored the detailed evidence produced by sprint,which identified and separately valued numerous intangible assets.it is this indifference by the board and its appraisers,in the face of opposing,credible testimony from sprint of the existence of separate intangible assets,which we find to be error.gte sprint,supra,th.
it is not enough for the taxpayer to speculate that the board relied on impermissible factors.los angeles smsa.partnership state bd.of equalization th,la smsa.nor may the taxpayer provide only circumstantial evidence to establish that the assessor improperly utilized or included for valuation the intangible assets such as permits and related business enterprise.american sheds.county of los angeles th,american sheds.the taxpayer must produce persuasive evidence of separate treatment of the intangibles,to show abuse of discretion or lack of evidence in support of the assessments.
in american sheds,supra,th,it was held that the assessor could properly determine the value of a landfill property,by taking into consideration its earnings,some of which directly depended upon the possession of intangible rights and privileges that are not themselves regarded as a separate class of taxable property.citation.id.at italics omitted.those intangible rights and privileges were an assortment of governmental permits authorizing the landfill operation,principally the operating permit issued by the county department of health services and waste discharge requirements issued by the regional water quality board.id.at.although certain intangibles associated with the realty,such as zoning,permits,and licenses,are not real property and may not be taxed as such,if those intangibles nevertheless affect the real property value,for example by enabling its profitable use,they may properly contribute to an assessment of fair market value.id.at.an assessor should consider the intangibles insofar as they contributed to the property beneficial use,and in doing so,the assessor may impute an amount of income derivable by reason of the intangible right to do business.id.at,citing county of stanislaus assessment appeals board d,stanislaus.
as a practical matter,the assessment may recognize the impact of the presence of intangible rights upon the beneficial use of the property,with respect to valuing the amount of income it could yield it is only forbidden to subsume in the unit value any separate intangible income,and hence value,that should have been attributed to nontaxable intangibles.american sheds,supra,th.
in mitsui fudosan county of los angeles,supra,d,the question was whether intangible transferable development rights air space should be considered as adding assessable property value to undeveloped land.the court determined that such rights amounted to an interest in real property,giving rise to a taxable event when they were transferred,and to a conclusion that they allowed a higher and better use of the property and should therefore be considered in valuation.
background and context of erc statutory scheme 
considering the above descriptions of the nature of different intangible assets and rights,the characterization of the ercs for unitary tax purposes must take into account the nature and character of ercs,which the trial court correctly observed are intended to provide incentives to power plant operators to improve air quality.most of the california statutes governing air quality are set forth in division of the health and safety code health,et.the statutes coordinate state,regional,and local air pollution control by establishing air basins based on similar meteorological and geographical conditions.citations.they create a state air resources board citations,and regional air pollution control districts combining the smaller districts in each air basin citations air quality districts must develop plans and regulations to achieve and maintain ambient air quality standards.citations.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.real property.
the statutory scheme creating ercs is part of the health and safety code,division,air resources,whose legislative declaration of intent is found in health and safety code section the legislature,therefore,declares that this public interest shall be safeguarded by an intensive,coordinated state,regional,and local effort to protect and enhance the ambient air quality of the state.since air pollution knows no political boundaries,the legislature declares that a regional approach to the problem should be encouraged whenever possible and,to this end,the state is divided into air basins.the state should provide incentives for such regional strategies,respecting,when necessary,existing political boundaries.to carry out this goal,health and safety code section places upon local and regional authorities,including this air pollution control district,the primary responsibility for control of air pollution from all sources other than emissions from motor vehicles,which generally are the responsibility of the state board.thus,the district has the authority exercised here to adopt rules and regulations that,a require the use of best available control technology for new and modified sources,and the use of best available retrofit control technology for existing sources health.
pursuant to health and safety code section,air pollution control districts have the general powers and duties of a corporate and political body,or a public agency.one such duty is to administer erc usage,under health and safety code section,subdivision a,through a system by which all reductions in the emission of air contaminants that are to be used to offset certain future increases in the emission of air contaminants shall be banked prior to use to offset future increases in emissions.the system shall provide that only those reductions in the emission of air contaminants that are not otherwise required by any federal,state,or district law,rule,order,permit,or regulation shall be registered,certified,or otherwise approved by the district air pollution control officer before they may be banked and used to offset future increases in the emission of air contaminants.health.under health and safety code section,subdivision b,this erc system is not intended to recognize any preexisting right to emit air contaminants,but to provide a mechanism for districts to recognize the existence of reductions of air contaminants that can be used as offsets,and to provide greater certainty that the offsets shall be available for emitting industries.for regulations for implementing health,to allow interchangeable air pollution ercs,see of,tit,et.
under health and safety code section,it is clarified that erc certificates evidencing ownership of approved reductions issued by a district shall not constitute instruments,securities,or any other form of property.section,subdivision b provides that money kept on hand for normal use in a business is not subject to property tax.although elk hills claims ercs are tradeable like money or currency,we do not see how these ercs may be so characterized,because of the extremely restricted market in which they may be traded and their highly specialized function.
the use of ercs,as part of the certification process for approval of a power plant site,is provided for in public resources code,division,energy conservation and development,chapter,power facility and site certification,section et.under public resources code sections and,the energy resources conservation and development commission,commonly known as the california energy commission the commission,has the power among others,to certify sites for new power plants as part of its written decision under public resources code section,on power facility and site certification,the commission shall include such items as a specific provisions relating to the manner in which the proposed facility is to be designed,sited,and operated in order to protect environmental quality and assure public health and safety.
as most relevant here,under public resources code section,subdivision d,findings by the commission are required about the conformity of the proposed site and related facilities with certain standards,public safety standards and the applicable air and water quality standards,and with other applicable local,regional,state,and federal standards,ordinances,or laws.ibid.specifically,under public resources code section,subdivision d,the commission may not find that the proposed facility conforms with applicable air quality standards pursuant to paragraph unless the applicable air pollution control district or air quality management district certifies that complete emissions offsets for the proposed facility have been identified and will be obtained by the applicant within the time required by the district rules,and t he commission shall require as a condition of certification that the applicant obtain any required emission offsets within the time required by the applicable district rules prior to the commencement of the operation of the proposed facility.italics added.
in light of the various restrictions imposed on power plants by these related bodies of law,we next apply accepted principles for tax treatment of intangible assets to this record.
application tax treatment of ercs 
the controlling and dispositive portion of the ruling is the ercs were purchased and used by elk to build its power plant in compliance with the district emission requirements.the ercs in question,while purchased and tradable at one point,were purchased and applied to build the power plant.furthermore,such ercs are not transferable while the plant is operating in accordance with the way i
