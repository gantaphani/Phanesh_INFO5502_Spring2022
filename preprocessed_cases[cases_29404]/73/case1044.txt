on its face,this is an appeal by charlotte office boutique,from the tax court determination that its royalty payments to charlotte odell,one of its two shareholders,were actually wages and that appellant was liable for employment taxes on those wages and penalties.this appeal,however,also raises a challenge to the tax court jurisdiction,which was first raised before the tax court by the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner and is asserted by both parties on appeal,with the commissioner taking the laboring oar.
following the trial in the tax court,the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the tax court lacked jurisdiction over three of the four tax years in question.appellant joined in the motion.the tax court,however,denied the motion and rendered judgment in favor of the commissioner on all the issues framed by appellant petition for review.
appellant filed a notice of appeal objecting to both the tax court determination of jurisdiction and its rejection of appellant challenges to the determination of taxes and penalties.in response,the commissioner first asserts that the tax court lacked jurisdiction for three of the four tax years in question,and then contends that to the extent that the tax court retained jurisdiction,it properly determined that appellant owes taxes and penalties.
in affirming the tax court opinions,we first consider the jurisdiction issue asserted by both parties,and determine that the tax court jurisdiction under a was not limited by the commissioner admission that appellant treated odell as an employee in years through.we then address appellant challenges to the tax court determinations of liability,taxes and penalties,and conclude that none are persuasive.
prior to,odell and her did business with various united states post offices,selling items such as calculators,chairs and office supplies.when she divorced in,her gave her the list of their customers.odell explained that certain agencies had buy indian programs and that she is a native american.starting in,odell ran the business as a sole proprietorship.
in january,odell incorporated her business as charlotte office boutique.the stock was owned equally by odell and her second husband,theodore,whom she married in.odell is appellant president,and she and theodore are the only directors.
in connection with the incorporation,the sole proprietorship conveyed to appellant an ownership interest in certain assets,such as bank accounts and inventory,but did not convey the customer list used by the proprietorship.in august,appellant and odell entered into three agreements effective january.the tax court explained the arrangements as follows 
these agreements were an employment agreement,a rental agreement,and a licensing and sale agreement.pursuant to the employment agreement,appellant agreed to pay per month to odell in return for her services,and odell agreed that she would receive no employment compensation from january,through july.pursuant to the rental agreement,appellant agreed to pay to odell per month to rent certain of her property.pursuant to the licensing and sale agreement,appellant agreed to pay to odell a monthly royalty fee of the larger of or percent of the gross receipts for all office supplies sold under the agreement.appellant had resolved on february,to pay odell for a royalty payment equal to percent of gross receipts for the use of her existing government contracts and her experience in obtaining government contracts.appellant also had resolved to pay odell a salary of per month.

appellant business required minimal labor.odell primarily handled the administration,such as dealing with and paying suppliers,processing customer orders and bookkeeping.she estimated that this took her a couple of hours a day.theodore also worked for appellant a couple of hours a day,handling the shipping and the computer work,and helping to facilitate sales.he was not paid by appellant.
in all,appellant reported the following payments to odell 
the commissioner commenced his audit of appellant and the odells tax returns in december,and later expanded the audit to cover through.in january,the commissioner issued a notice of determination concerning worker classification against appellant.the first four sentences of the notice read 
as a result of an employment tax audit,we are sending you this notice of determination concerning worker classification under section.we have determined that the individual s listed or described on the attached schedule are to be legally classified as employees for purposes of federal employment taxes under subtitle c of the internal revenue code and that you are not entitled to relief from this classification pursuant to section of the revenue act of with respect to such individual s.this determination could result in employment taxes being assessed against you.
if you want to contest this determination in court,you may file a petition with the united states tax court for a redetermination of the issues.
the notice alleged that odell was appellant employee for purposes of federal employment taxes,that the royalty payments were actually wages,and that appellant was liable for unreported employment taxes for through,as well as statutory additions to taxes because appellant had not withheld employment taxes on the wages the notice also alleged that appellant had other workers.
appellant filed a petition in the tax court for a redetermination of its employment tax liabilities.trial was held in june.following the trial,the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss with regard to tax years through.the commissioner argued that because appellant paid odell a salary during this period of time,there was no actual controversy as to whether she was an employee,and accordingly,the tax court lacked jurisdiction under a 
the tax court ruled that it had jurisdiction,that the royalty payments were wages,and affirmed the tax assessments and the additions thereto.charlotte office boutique,at.the tax court subsequently issued an opinion holding that it had jurisdiction to redetermine additions to taxes attributable to nonpayment of employment taxes.charlotte office boutique,comm r,cch.
we first consider the commissioner assertion that the tax court lacked jurisdiction for three of the four tax years involved.such a challenge to jurisdiction is reviewed de novo.estate of branson comm r,cir i o publ,comm r,cir.
the commissioner argues that the tax court lost jurisdiction over tax years through when he conceded that appellant did not have any other workers for those years and that appellant had treated odell as an employee in those years.in other words,the commissioner maintains that because he and appellant agreed that odell was an employee for tax years through,there is no controversy between the commissioner and appellant as to odell classification under.the commissioner argues that this lack of controversy as to odell classification for through deprives the tax court of jurisdiction to review his determination of taxes and penalties for those years,even though appellant continues to contest those taxes and penalties.
in evaluating the commissioner position,we turn first to the statute at issue.subsection a of reads 
creation of,in connection with an audit of any person,there is an actual controversy involving a determination by the secretary as part of an examination that 
one or more individuals performing services for such person are employees of such person for purposes of subtitle c,or 
such person is not entitled to the treatment under subsection a of section of the revenue act of with respect to such an individual,
upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,the tax court may determine whether such a determination by the secretary is correct and the proper amount of employment tax under such determination.any such redetermination by the tax court shall have the force and effect of a decision of the tax court and shall be reviewable as such.
section was added to the internal revenue code through the taxpayer relief act of,stat.before its enactment,judicial review of irs assessment of employment taxes or related penalties was available only if a taxpayer paid a divisible part of the assessment,filed a claim for refund,and filed a refund suit in federal district court or the court of federal claims to recover amounts paid.henry randolph consulting comm r,wl.congress determined that it would be advantageous to taxpayers to have the option of going to the tax court to resolve certain disputes regarding employment status,at,cong,at.
the commissioner,noting that the tax court is a court of limited jurisdiction,argues that under,the tax court jurisdiction is restricted to situations in which there is an actual controversy as to whether one or more of the taxpayer workers are employees.the commissioner cites the tax court decision in henry randolph as supporting its interpretation of the tax court narrow jurisdiction.at.
although we agree with the commissioner the tax court is a court of limited disagree with his interpretation of the statute.first,it should be noted that the statute was amended in,following the tax court decision in henry randolph.at the time of that decision,a read 
upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,the tax court may determine whether such a determination by the secretary is correct.
at quoting a.the statute now reads,in pertinent part 
upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,the tax court may determine whether such a determination by the secretary is correct and the proper amount of employment tax under such determination.
a emphasis added.the added language indicates that congress did not intend to limit the tax court jurisdiction under to determining only whether an individual was an employee.
second,the commissioner approach is contrary to the prevalent approach to jurisdiction and the few cases in which we have considered the tax court jurisdiction.although we recognize that subject matter jurisdiction can be reviewed at any time during the course of litigation if it becomes apparent that jurisdiction may be lacking,as a general matter a federal court jurisdiction is determined at the time it is invoked.scar comm r,cir.the commissioner,it should be noted,agrees that appellant properly invoked the tax court jurisdiction by filing a timely petition from the notice of determination.
moreover,we noted in scar with regard to a notice of deficiency that no particular form was required and that the commissioner need not explain how the deficiencies were determined.id.the notice must,however,indicate that the commissioner has determined the amount of the deficiency.id.in this case the notice of determination and its attachments provided appellant with the requisite notice of the commissioner classification determination,the amount of taxes due and the penalties imposed see portillo comm r,cir explaining that the adequately linked the deficiency to the taxpayer by considering information directly related to the taxpayer income tax return and investigating whether a deficiency indeed existed.
the commissioner jurisdictional argument is contrary to our statement in scar that a notice need not contain any particular explanation.the commissioner admission that appellant treated odell as an employee in tax years through is not a concession that taxes and penalties are not due.rather,it concerns only one factor in the commissioner decision that additional taxes and penalties were due.it follows that as the notice of determination was not required to contain any particular explanation for the commissioner position,an admission that does not change his position on what taxes and penalties remain due can not deprive the tax court of the jurisdiction it acquired when the appellant filed its petition for review of the notice of determination 
the tax court followed a similar line of reasoning in concluding that it had jurisdiction.it explained 
generally,in the setting of employment taxes,we have jurisdiction under section a to determine whether an individual providing services to a person is that person employee for purposes of subtitle c whether the person,if in fact an employer,is entitled to relief under section of the revenue act of and the correct amounts of employment taxes which relate to the commissioner determination concerning worker classification.see evans publg.commissioner,wl henry randolph consulting commissioner,wl.it is the commissioner determination of worker classification that provides the predicate for our jurisdiction under section a,and the ultimate merits of that determination do not affect our jurisdiction.neely commissioner,wl although respondent now concedes that determination,respondent concession has no bearing upon our jurisdiction.ltv commissioner,wl respondent concession of no deficiency in a year did not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of that year.
our conclusion is further supported by an analogy to the applicable law underlying the issuance of a notice of deficiency.the court may acquire jurisdiction in such a setting only when the commissioner has determined that there is a deficiency.a,a see also richards commissioner,affd.without published opinion cir.it is the determination of a deficiency,rather than the existence of a deficiency,that is dispositive as to our jurisdiction.hannan commissioner,wl.thus,even when a taxpayer has made a showing that casts doubt on the validity of a determination in a notice of deficiency,the notice is generally not rendered void,but remains sufficient to vest the court with jurisdiction.suarez commissioner,wl.
we have previously held that the tax court has jurisdiction to consider its own jurisdiction.billingsley comm r,cir.we conclude that the tax court reasoning in this case is consistent with,and reinforces,our determination that the tax court retained jurisdiction over all four tax years covered by the notice of determination.
in advancing his position,the commissioner does not suggest why his approach furthers the purpose of the congressional intent behind the enactment of provide taxpayers with an alternate be frustrated if the commissioner could unilaterally deprive the tax court of jurisdiction,after having directed the taxpayer to the tax court by issuing a notice of determination.in the absence of compelling authority in support of the commissioner approach,it appears that the intent behind supports the tax court retention of jurisdiction over all four tax years covered by the notice of determination.
the commissioner arguments concerning the tax court jurisdiction offer no compelling authority.the commissioner argues that his interpretation is necessary to protect the from a potential for a statute of limitations whipsaw.however real this dilemma,the commissioner fails to explain why the preferred solution for protecting the commissioner from making one of two erroneous decisions should be a limitation on the tax court jurisdiction.at oral argument,the commissioner counsel suggested that because of the different periods of time for making an assessment and issuing a notice of determination,the time for making an assessment might run while the propriety of a notice of determination is being litigated in the tax court.this may be true,but it does not follow that restricting the tax court jurisdiction would necessarily resolve that dilemma.the proposed limitation on the tax court jurisdiction would provide the commissioner a remedy only if the admission of employee status occurs before the expiration of the time for making an assessment.
one academic commentary describes a similar situation,noting 
the statute of limitations problem arises because of current law on tolling.the irs must mail a statutory notice within the limitations period for assessment of taxes,generally three years.normally,the issuance of a statutory notice tolls the statute of limitations on assessment until the prohibited period ends,plus sixty days however,the tax court determination that the notice was invalid means that the notice was not sufficient to allow an assessment based upon it,or even to toll the statute of limitations.there is some dispute over whether the language of code section means that a tax court petition is sufficient to toll the
