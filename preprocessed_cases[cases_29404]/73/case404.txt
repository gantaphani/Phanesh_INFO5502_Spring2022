at the age of,frank armstrong,gave very substantial gifts of stock to his four children and,primarily through a trust he created,paid millions of dollars in gift taxes on those gifts.armstrong died less than three years later,triggering estate taxes on those gift taxes.in addition,the irs assessed additional gift taxes on the grounds that armstrong undervalued the stock when the original gift taxes were paid.armstrong estate and the trust bring this action seeking a refund of both the original and the additional gift taxes.they maintain that the donee children purported obligation to pay additional gift taxes and potential liability for estate taxes on gift taxes markedly reduced the value of the gifts and thus should reduce the gift taxes attributable to them pursuant to the net gift doctrine.we agree with the district court that,given the speculative and illusory nature of the donees obligation to pay gift and estate taxes,the net gift doctrine does not apply here.accordingly,we affirm.
the parties stipulated to all relevant facts,and so t he material facts in this matter are undisputed.brief of appellants at.
in,frank armstrong,then years old,and his four children agreed that armstrong would carry out his estate plan through inter vivos transfers of his stock in national fruit products,a privately held corporation in which armstrong owned the controlling interest.the children welcomed this approach because of their concern that armstrong might take further actions which would be detrimental to the value of national fruit shares as a family business and to them as heirs of the stock.the events giving rise to this concern included armstrong recent transfer of real estate to two young women with whom armstrong had kept company and his naming of a new executor unfamiliar to the children.
in structuring the gifts of stock,armstrong,the children,and national fruit extensively consulted with counsel and repeatedly negotiated with each other.they obtained an appraisal of the value of armstrong national fruit stock and numerous projections of the tax consequences of various scenarios.on the advice of counsel,armstrong and the children expressly declined to adopt an arrangement requiring the children to pay all gift taxes on the gross gifts they is,a traditional net gift arrangement.the children further declined,also on advice of counsel,to enter into a written agreement to pay the estate taxes on the gift taxes that would be triggered should armstrong die within three years of making the gifts.indeed,throughout these consultations and negotiations,the children made clear that they wanted the transfers structured to reduce their gift and estate tax liabilities and to minimize their own direct cash outlay.armstrong,for his part,would agree to the stock transfers only if,inter alia,he received continuing income comparable to his prior dividend payments and was personally exonerated from the expenses and taxes resulting from the stock transfers.
through the stock transfers,armstrong was completely divested of all his national fruit stock,and control of the corporation was shifted to the children.the stock transfers were carried out over two tax years as follows.in december the transaction,armstrong conveyed shares of his national fruit common stock to each of his four children and shares to each of his eleven grandchildren.in addition,national fruit redeemed all of armstrong preferred stock for approximately in cash,plus a private annuity payable to armstrong.the bulk of the cash from the preferred stock redemption was paid to charitable organizations in donations,although was later used to fund the trust.
in january the transaction,armstrong transferred more than additional shares of his national fruit common stock to each of his children.armstrong also again transferred unredeemed shares to his grandchildren,this time apportioned from the otherwise equal allotments of their respective parents,and transferred approximately shares of his common stock to two trusts,a trust and an employee trust,which are not relevant to the current action.national fruit redeemed armstrong remaining common stock,as represented by a promissory note given to armstrong in the amount of.then,using the from the previous redemption of preferred shares,armstrong created a grantor trust and assigned the promissory note to that trust.under the trust agreement,an irrevocable trust was created naming armstrong as the beneficiary.the trust agreement provides for quarterly income payments to armstrong and that the trustee shall pay the gift and income tax owed by armstrong in connection with the and transactions.
also as part of the and transactions,the children entered into a transferee liability agreement.that agreement provides that the children would pay the additional gift taxes arising by reason of any proposed adjustment to the amount of the and gifts.thus,this agreement appeared to impose on the children the obligation to pay any additional gift taxes in the event the internal revenue service irs subsequently determined that armstrong had undervalued the gifted stock on his tax returns.however,an attorney who advised armstrong and his children regarding the gifts of stock submitted an affidavit on behalf of the estate and the trust in which he stated that the parties agreed that armstrong would use a grantor trust to assure payment of taxes in connection with a proper final determination thereof and the donees would only be secondarily liable for these taxes.this same attorney concluded that t he donor and the donees intended that the arrangement ultimately agreed upon would protect the donees from having to pay taxes.
in his gift tax returns for and,armstrong valued the transferred stock at per share and reported gift tax liability of in and in.the trust and armstrong himself paid all of these taxes the trust paid the lion share,a total of more than million for the two years,while armstrong individually paid just over.the children paid no gift taxes.
on july,less than three years after the and transactions,armstrong died.he had suffered recurring pulmonary problems prior to the and transactions,although the parties stipulated that he did not suffer from any conditions at the time of the stock transfers.
following armstrong death,the irs valued the gifted stock,as of the date of the transfers,at per share.this change in valuation resulted in increased gift tax liability of approximately for and for.the children paid none of the additional gift taxes rather,once again the trust paid all gift taxes,with interest.
in computing the value of armstrong estate,the executor did not include in the estate assets the gift taxes of over million that armstrong and the trust had paid on the stock gifts during the three years prior to his death.the irs determined that the internal revenue code required inclusion of those gift taxes in the estate and assessed an estate tax deficiency of some million.since the stock transfers rendered the estate without assets to pay this deficiency,the irs assessed each donee child with liability for the estate tax deficiency to the extent of the value of the stock transferred to each 
on april,frank armstrong,iii,armstrong eldest son and the ceo of national fruit,on behalf of the estate as its executor and the trust as its trustee,filed claims for refund of all the gift taxes paid in connection with the and transactions.the estate sought a refund of the original gift taxes paid on the stock transferred in the amount of some with respect to the transfers and some with respect to the transfers the trust sought a refund of the additional gift taxes in the amount of some with respect to transfers and some with respect to the transfers.an identical premise drove the refund claims the obligation of armstrong children to pay additional gift taxes and estate taxes as a condition of the gifts had substantially reduced the value of the gifts and,accordingly,the resulting gift taxes.the irs disallowed the claims.
the estate and the trust then filed suit in the district court for refund of all gift taxes.in addition to arguing that the children responsibility for
