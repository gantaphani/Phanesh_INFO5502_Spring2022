randolph george was convicted by a jury on two felony counts of willful filing of false tax returns in violation of,and one misdemeanor count of willful failure to file a tax return in violation of.the district court sentenced george to fifteen months of imprisonment for the false returns,twelve months for failure to file to run concurrently,and one year of supervised release.additionally,the district court ordered george to pay in restitution,a fine,and in special assessments.we affirm.
background 
this case presents two key issues first,are receivership fees paid to a taxpayer taxable in the year received even though they are subject to subsequent court review and possible disgorgement assuming they are,was the law on this point sufficiently clear to allow a criminal prosecution of george for failure to report this income we answer both questions in the affirmative.
during,and,george was affiliated with media venture partnership,which brokered the sale of radio stations and,through its affiliate media venture management,handled receiverships for financially troubled radio stations being sold off to satisfy debts owed to the stations creditors.because corporations can not serve as receivers,george,a taxpayer,was appointed in his individual capacity to serve as the receiver.george receiver fees,which were negotiated with the interested parties and approved by the court at the start of the receivership,were paid on an interim basis during the administration of the receivership,usually monthly.
with respect to the present case,george served as the receiver for five different stations reno broadcasting reno from october of to january of,royal broadcasting royal from may of until,kxgo radio station from march of to december of,diamond broadcasting diamond from may to may of,and jjn broadcasting jjn in.in addition to brokerage commissions and income from other sources,george was paid in receiver fees in,in,and in tax returns for the and income were not filed until.george never filed a return reporting the receivership income from.
nevertheless,when george refinanced the mortgage on his residence in march of,he submitted copies of apparent tax returns for and,listing the receiver fees as personal income for those years.george also submitted a statement of income and expenses for,listing receiver fees as his personal income.these returns turned out to be fraudulent documents fabricated by george for purposes of obtaining the refinancing of his mortgage.
on january,the internal revenue service irs sent george a written inquiry regarding his and returns which had not been filed.george falsely responded that the returns had been filed in december of.george also falsely responded to a subsequent irs inquiry,asserting that the accounting firm of antonini professional corporation was to have completed the returns,but that it went out of business and another firm was working on the returns.george later prepared the and returns himself,filing them on october.neither george returns nor his spouse for and reported the receivership fees received during those years.no return was filed by george or his wife for tax year.finally,the georges joint tax return reported only in receiver fees,in addition to income from other sources.these returns,though filed years after george was paid the receiver fees and approximately one year after the last receivership was approved by the court,failed to report in receiver fees.
when an irs revenue agent initially interviewed george regarding his and returns on july,george did not disclose his employment as a receiver and did not disclose the of receiver fees from nor the of receiver fees from.during a second interview on february,george admitted he earned the receiver fees,but only after he was confronted with the fraudulent tax returns submitted to the lender in in support of his mortgage application.a referral for criminal prosecution soon followed.
ii.analysis 
clarity of the law 
george first argues that,as a matter of law,he lacked wilfulness to commit a crime because the law governing allocation of receiver fees was not clearly established at the time of the offense.the district court determination that the predicate law was clearly established is a question of law which we review de novo.see united states schulman,cir citing united states russell,cir.
the element of wilfulness can not obtain in a criminal tax evasion case unless the law clearly prohibited the conduct alleged in the indictment.schulman,at see also james united states,d vacating taxpayer conviction for failure to report embezzled funds as income because conflicting caselaw rendered the predicate tax statute ambiguous when applied to embezzled funds.without sufficient clarity in the law,taxpayers lack the fair notice demanded by due process so that they may conform their conduct to the law.united states dahlstrom,cir citing united states batchelder,d.however,a lack of prior appellate rulings on the topic does not render the law vague,nor does a lack of previously litigated fact patterns deprive taxpayers of fair notice.see russell,at citing united states ingredient tech,cir stating that it was immaterial that there was no prior litigation directly on point.thus,criminal prosecution is permissible when it is clear beyond any doubt that the conduct is illegal under established principles of tax law russell,at.
the general income allocation rule provides that t he amount of any item of gross income shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer,unless,under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income,such amount is to be properly accounted for as of a different period.a.the applicable regulations further clarify this general rule by identifying the respective duties for and accrual basis taxpayers.under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting,such an amount is includible in gross income when actually or constructively received.a thus,as a taxpayer,george would ordinarily be required to report income in the year it is received 
according to george,the statute and regulations are ambiguous as to when receiver fees should be reported as gross income.george points to caselaw that purports to support his claim that receiver fees paid to a taxpayer are not taxable until the time of final accounting and approval by the supervising court.according to george,the potential for subsequent disgorgement means that receiver fees are not received under a claim of right.see,indianapolis power light,d american valmar int l,cir ahadpour,cch,wl,tax.memo lexis at massey,cir parkford,cir helvering mcglue estate,cir cadwalader,cir.
george reliance on these cases for such a proposition is misplaced.these cases simply suggest that receiver fees paid to taxpayers are income in the year actually paid,and fees paid to accrual basis taxpayers are taxable in the year the applicable state law creates a right to demand the fees.compare cadwalader,at as was the year in which she in fact received the cash commission from the roebling estate,that is the year in which the income was received and the tax upon its receipt due.taxpayer,and massey,at holding attorney receipt of cash payment for part of contingency fee taxable in the year actually received remainder of fee not constructively received or taxable until settlement approved by the court taxpayer,with mcglue estate,at stating that an accrual method taxpayer ordinarily reports executor fees only when entitlement to them attaches under applicable state law,but death of the taxpayer triggers special provision of tax code allocating income as of the date of death despite lack of entitlement under state law,and parkford,at holding an accrual basis taxpayer who was not a receiver need not report commission income for sale of a company which happened to be in receivership until the supervising court approved the sale.
other cases cited by george provide that funds received while still subject to an express obligation to repay are not income.unfortunately,these cases have little to do with the type of income at issue here receiver fees.see,indianapolis power light,at.stating deposits held by utility to secure payment from customers with poor credit was not income because the utility assumed an express obligation either to apply the deposits to customers bills or to refund the balance american valmar,at finding customer deposits held by international broker not income because the broker had an obligation to use the deposits for the customers benefit or to repay them ahadpour,wl,tax.memo lexis at holding earnest money advanced to sellers from escrow under the terms of a contract to sell real property was not income to the sellers in the year received because the contract created an express obligation to repay the funds if the sale did not close.
in contrast,two other cases specifically apply the claim of right doctrine to allocate executors fees in the year they are received.in united states merrill,cir,a husband who was appointed as the executor of his wife estate erroneously paid all of his executor fees out of his wife segregated share of the community funds.we held that the entire of executors fees paid in were taxable to him under the claim of right doctrine despite the fact that was repaid to the estate in a subsequent year due to the error.id.at.merrill therefore unambiguously applied the claim of right doctrine to the receipt of trustee fees even though they were subject to final court approval and were partially repaid.
similarly,the second circuit applied the claim of right doctrine to executors commissions in jacobs hoey,cir.the court held that such commissions were taxable in the year received,not in the year the supervising court conferred final approval.of particular importance to the jacobs court was the fact that the executor negotiated an arrangement with the beneficiaries that allowed advances against his ultimate commission.because the interested parties had agreed in advance,there was no reasonable likelihood that the executor would be called upon to return the sums that had been paid as commissions.id.at.rejecting the taxpayer argument that the advance commissions should be treated as loans because they were subject to subsequent court approval and possible disgorgement,the second circuit held that the commissions were properly allocated to the taxpayer under the claim of right doctrine in the years they were actually paid.id.at.
we conclude that the law clearly required george,a cash basis taxpayer,to report the receiver fees in the years he received them.we find and the applicable provision of free from ambiguities regarding allocation of george income.as stated in the regulation,u nder the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting,such an amount is includible in gross income when actually or constructively received.a.
the fact that george receiver fees were subject to possible disgorgement at the time of a subsequent final accounting does not remove them from the claim of right doctrine.to the contrary,george fees were taxable in the year received even though it may have been claimed that he was not entitled to retain the money,and even though he may have been adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.am.oil consolidated burnet.merrill and jacobs confirm that executor fees and commissions are not exempt from the claim of right doctrine merely because they are subject to final court approval and possible disgorgement likewise,the fact that some fees were actually repaid does not insulate the fees from the claim of right doctrine.see merrill,at see also rasmus,cch,wl,tax.memo lexis at holding funds misappropriated from estate by the administering attorney constituted income to the attorney in the year misappropriated despite subsequent repayment.these same principles apply to receiver fees like george.
short of an express obligation to repay,a contingent obligation to repay a portion of receiver fees actually paid to a taxpayer does not remove these payments from the claim of right doctrine.see merrill,at.this is because a potential or dormant restriction which depends on the future application of rules of law to present facts,is not a restriction on use within the meaning of the claim of right doctrine.healy.indeed,application of the claim of right doctrine does not turn on the relative likelihood of a contingent obligation coming to fruition nor does it depend on the legitimacy of the taxpayer right to retain the funds.see james,at.stating illegally obtained funds are considered income and subject to the claim of right doctrine.instead,the relevant inquiry centers on the taxpayer dominion and control of the funds,see indianapolis power light,at,and the manner in which the taxpayer treats the funds,see alexander shokai,cir.a taxpayer receives a payment under a claim of right when he treats the payment as belonging to him.id.quoting healy,at.
in sum,the district court correctly determined that the claim of right doctrine applied to george receiver fees.the law on this point was sufficiently clear to allow prosecution for failure to report such fees in the years received.
good faith defense 
george next argues that because he held a good faith belief the receiver fees were not taxable until the year in which the final accountings were approved and the receiverships were closed by the supervising courts,the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.when preserved in the district court through a motion for acquittal as it was in this case,we review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.see united states carranza,cir citing united states munoz,cir.in this review,we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in original citing johnson louisiana,d.
willfulness is an element of making and filing a false tax return.see.to establish the requisite level of willfulness,the government must prove that the law imposed a duty on the defendant,that the defendant knew of this duty,and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.cheek united states,d.the government can not carry this burden without negating the defendant claim that he was ignorant of the law,that he misunderstood the law,or that he held a belief his conduct did not violate the law.id.at.good faith reliance on a qualified tax accountant is a defense to willfulness.see united states bishop,cir.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude the government met its burden to prove willfulness,including its burden to negate george good faith defense.the government presented overwhelming evidence at trial which proved that the vast majority of the receiver fees paid to george were never reported on any tax return.the government evidence showed that two of the receiverships reno and diamond were closed in,yet george did not report the receiver fees from these receiverships on his returns.this is fundamentally inconsistent with george good faith defense that he was waiting until the receiverships were closed to report the income.furthermore,the government evidence showed that in,the year the other receiverships closed,george failed to report the vast majority of the other receiver fees paid to him in and.based on this,a rational trier of fact could have concluded that there was no good faith on george part.
additionally,prosecution witness orlando antonini testified his firm was never retained by george to prepare his individual income tax returns.this testimony undermined george claim that he relied on personal advice from antonini in deciding not to report the fees until the receiverships were closed.notably,defense counsel never asked antonini whether he personally advised george to report the receiver fees on his personal returns in the year that the court approved the final accounting of the receivership,as opposed to the year the fees were actually received.george was the sole witness who testified to that effect,and the jury apparently found his testimony to be less than credible.thus,we reject george good faith defense.
