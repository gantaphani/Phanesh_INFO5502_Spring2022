the internal revenue code allows taxpayers to recover costs and attorneys fees if they prevail in either civil or administrative proceedings,so long as the position of the united states was not substantially justified.appellants pacific fisheries and konstantin vladimirovich voloshenko collectively the taxpayers seek attorneys fees associated with pursuing two federal court petitions to quash summonses.the taxpayers and the united states agree that the summonses were not enforceable.they disagree about whether the government should pay the taxpayers legal fees as a consequence.the government issuance of the summonses essentially forced the taxpayers into court,but once there,the government only action during the litigation was to promptly withdraw the summonses.the question is whether the government prelitigation conduct should be factored into a determination of whether its position in the judicial proceeding was substantially justified as defined in the statute.c b i.looking to the language and structure of the statute,we conclude that the litigation fees of these particular taxpayers do not fall within the coverage of the statute governing fees in a court proceeding.see a.
background 
on april,the internal revenue service irs served two administrative summonses on bank of america.the first summons requested information for the years to on an account held by pacific fisheries.the second summons requested the same information for two accounts held by konstantin voloshenko,an employee of pacific fisheries.
both summonses were issued pursuant to a request by the russian government under a tax treaty between the united states and the russian federation.see convention between the united states of america and the russian federation for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital,june,treaty doc,wl,available at.gov.the russian government requested these records as part of its tax investigation of voloshenko.
the irs claims that it attempted to serve summons notices on the taxpayers,but the parties dispute whether either pacific fisheries or voloshenko was properly served.in any event,the taxpayers only received actual notice of the summonses on may,a mere three days before the statutory deadline to file petitions to quash their enforcement.
immediately after discovering that the summonses had been issued,the taxpayers called irs revenue agent douglas sanderson to dispute the enforceability of the summonses on statute of limitations grounds.sanderson replied that he believed the summonses were enforceable.three days later,on may,the taxpayers filed two separate petitions to quash the summonses in the united states district court for the western district of washington.the principal reason they advanced for quashing the summonses was that the time period covered by the summonses was beyond the statute of limitations on any tax liability incurred by the taxpayers.see a providing for a statute of limitations in most civil enforcement cases under the internal revenue code providing for a statute of limitations in most criminal cases under the internal revenue code.
on june,the taxpayers sent a letter to the irs reiterating their position that the summonses were unenforceable.the letter also requested specific documents relating to the underlying investigation.
on june,the irs sent a notice to bank of america,with a copy to taxpayers counsel,that it was withdrawing the summonses.four days later,irs counsel wrote to taxpayers counsel informing him that the summonses had been withdrawn.the irs requested the taxpayers to voluntarily dismiss the petition under federal rule of civil procedure b ecause the controversy at issue in both matters is now moot and the united states has not made an appearance in either matter.
the taxpayers refused to file voluntary dismissals but offered to stipulate to dismissal so long as the irs provided certain information and assurances.the government then moved to dismiss the petitions to quash,arguing that the petitions were moot since the irs had withdrawn the summonses.see spencer kemna,d holding that the jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited to those actions that provide a live case or controversy dame united states,holding that a petition to quash is moot when a summons has been withdrawn.shortly thereafter,pacific fisheries served a set of interrogatories and a request for production of documents on the government.the taxpayers filed a joint response to the motions to dismiss.they did not oppose the motions to dismiss per se rather,they requested dismissal of the petitions subject to certain conditions.specifically,they wanted assurances that the irs would not reissue the summons,requested administrative costs and attorneys fees,and requested that the court order the government to respond to the discovery requests 
in substantially identical orders,the district court granted the government motions to dismiss in both cases,holding that taxpayers petitions to quash became moot when the irs withdrew the summonses.the district court declined to impose conditions on the dismissal or to award attorneys fees.in declining to award attorneys fees,the court held that the taxpayers had not convinced the court that they were prevailing parties for the purposes of the statute,and that the taxpayers had not established that the united states position was not substantially justified.
the taxpayers decry what they view as abusive tactics by the irs and contend that the district court erred in declining to award them attorneys fees under although we are not unsympathetic to the taxpayers claimed plight,we affirm the district court order.

a in any administrative or court proceeding which is brought by or against the united states in connection with the determination,collection,or refund of any tax,interest,or penalty under this title,the prevailing party may be awarded a judgment or a settlement for

ii.the taxpayers substantially prevailed with respect to the most significant issue presented 
as a preliminary matter,we note that the government does not dispute that the taxpayers prevailed with respect to the most significant issue in the proceedings below.the taxpayers filed two petitions to quash irs summonses in district court.although the government motions to dismiss were granted,the taxpayers prevailed on the most significant issue because they received the relief they sought all irs withdrew the summonses.donlon i dev.united states,noting that when the irs withdrew a summons before moving
