plaintiff apple computer,apple,claiming that it overpaid approximately million in property taxes for the through tax years,petitioned for a writ of mandamus against defendants santa clara county assessor lawrence stone assessor and the county assessment appeals board board.the trial court ordered the assessor to complete an audit for those years and the board to set aside its findings and conclusions determining that it had no jurisdiction over apple february applications for a changed assessment.apple appeals the order to complete the audit and the court refusal to order the board to take jurisdiction over the applications and grant apple a hearing.the board and the assessor,the board claiming that the court erred in ordering it to set aside its findings and conclusions and the assessor claiming that the trial court used an erroneous standard of review in ordering him to complete the audit.they claim that previous actions of the board equalized apple taxes for those years and pursuant to revenue and taxation code sections and,subdivision e hereafter e those years may not be revisited.
in each of the tax years,and,apple filed application for reduced assessment for reductions in the assessed valuations of its personal and real property during the annual filing period for challenging the valuations.apple had approximately business locations in santa clara county and filed an application for each.apple tax director terry ryan stated these applications were protective appeals which were necessary to protect the taxpayer right to get a refund in the event of an overpayment.
applications for reduced assessment are filed on a form provided by the board.the form requires certain information and no other.there are two boxes labeled values.in the top box,column requires the applicant to list the tax bill statement of value for each category of property for example,land,real property,business,improvement fixtures,personal property,exemption,total.in column,the applicant must give its opinion of value for the same categories.ryan stated there is no way for the taxpayer to identify in column specific pieces of disputed property or the issues regarding them.
apple column values were half the assessor.ryan explained that because the forms require the taxpayer to state an opinion of value only for the same broad categories as appear on the tax bill,t hat why we take a percentage,percent,because you ca get any more detailed than that.if there is a tax bill value in column,column may not be left blank.the form warns,incomplete applications will not be accepted.
the bottom values box is for county use only.column is for the county to verify the assessment,and column states the value adjusted by board action.
in january,apple,the assessor,and county counsel entered into a stipulation for the,and tax years,setting out a methodology hammered out after an audit and appeals of the to tax years for valuing portions of apple property.in the stipulation,the parties agreed to use the methodology for determining the value of production equipment,purchased computer equipment,and computer equipment manufactured by apple computer,and removed from inventory for their sic own use.the stipulation stated that the amounts entered on the current roll for the parcel s set forth below may be adjusted as indicated on the attachment s.there were three pages reciting the terms of the agreement contained in the stipulation and pages of attachments.the third page of the agreement concluded,a n audit has been completed with respect to the tax year.the assessor reserves the right to verify,and adjust if necessary,the reported costs on apple business property statements,form,for the years and,but would not deviate from the agreed methodology in calculating value.the applicant reserves the right to appeal any escape assessments resulting from such audits.
the parties stated that in valuing the property specified above,they would apply the economic lives,iowa state curves,appropriate bureau of economic analysis bea computer price decline indexes,income decline factors,friedman formula,and weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology as determined by the santa clara county assessment appeals board for these same categories of assets for the four tax years immediately preceding the tax year.the criteria for the,and tax years is as follows two pages of criteria followed.
the attachment following the three pages of agreement contains from and to cash values.the only changed to numbers appear for the category personal property and most are a reduction from the from number.the effect of the attachment was to reduce the assessed value of the stated types of apple personal property in santa clara for the three tax years.
the application for reduced assessment for the next year,was heard by the board on august.the parties contested lifing,trending,and depreciation tables for four categories of property machinery and equipment,office furniture and fixtures,leaseholds,and computers valued from to.the board issued written findings and conclusions in november.the assessments on all contested categories of property were sustained except for a reduction of for computers.
that same month,august,the assessor initiated a property tax audit of apple personal property for the four fiscal years from through as required by section.that section then provided for audits every four years of businesses with a full value of or more.if the assessor findings would alter the previous assessment,section requires the assessor to provide those findings in writing to the taxpayer.the assessor must notify the taxpayer of an overassessment and the fact that a claim for refund may be filed with the county.if an audit discloses property subject to an escape assessment,the rest of the property of the taxpayer may be reviewed and,if not previously equalized,may be equalized 
the auditor requested documents for all four tax years at the start of the audit,but ultimately issued a notice of proposed escape assessment for the tax year only.property that has escaped assessment was,not assessed at all,or was incorrectly valued,misclassified,resulting in an under or.american airlines,county of san mateo cal th,d.when apple told the auditor that if the methodology agreed in the stipulation was applied to,and,those values would change also and apple would be entitled to a refund,the auditor refused to audit the first three years.the auditor,and ultimately,the assessor,notified apple that the and value issues were settled through board approved stipulations.the issues for were presented to the appeals board and their decision has been finalized.therefore,the years,and are closed.
also in august,apple filed a request for a refund of taxes paid in the through tax years with the county board of supervisors.the board of supervisors passed on the refund request to defendant board and defendant board assigned application numbers to it.the clerk of the board then closed the applications as duplicative of prior applications or because they had been settled by an earlier stipulation.
apple filed another set of applications in february.these are the subject of the instant action.when the clerk of the board notified apple that it had also closed the february applications due to prior equalization of the tax years,apple requested a jurisdictional hearing before the board.the board determined it did not have jurisdiction over the applications stating again that it had already equalized apple tax assessment.
on december,apple filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and a complaint for refund of property taxes.the latter was dismissed after a successful demurrer.the petition claimed that the august audit disclosed personal property subject to escape assessment in all four years,that the original assessments had overvalued certain assets for each of the tax years,and that apple had been overassessed taxes for each of the years in issue.the petition claimed that when apple notified the auditor that the property was overassessed,the auditor stopped the audit for those years and finished the audit for only.apple also alleged that the assessor concurrently performed an audit of apple for the orange county assessor under the california counties cooperative audit services exchange.apple had overreported computers for the march,lien date in both santa clara and orange counties.the santa clara county auditor refused to send the orange county assessor any information for the march,lien date.apple,itself,ultimately forwarded that information to the orange county assessor,who enrolled a negative escape assessment and granted apple a refund for the march,lien date,as well as a positive escape assessment for the january,lien date.
apple requested the court to order the board to hold hearings to determine the value of apple property and to equalize and adjust the assessed values for the,and tax years the assessor to issue findings with respect to data that would alter any previously enrolled assessment for the tax years in question and to notify apple with respect to any excess valuation and the right to obtain a refund the county to refund to apple property taxes totaling for the three years,or such amounts as found when the assessments for those years were correctly adjusted and the board to pay apple attorney fees.
in the trial court and in this court,the assessor took the position that i n filing these original applications,apple challenged each and every portion of its assessed value t hese applications challenged the assessed value of all apple fixtures,all apple structures,and all apple personal property original underscoring at every business location where apple had personal property in santa clara county and the valuation of its real property at infinite loop in cupertino.the assessor pointed to apple statement in the applications that it was raising not only the various issues it expressly enumerated in the applications,but was also challenging all other factors and assumptions used in determining the value of the property in question.accordingly,notwithstanding the limitation in the stipulation,the assessor and the board asserted the stipulation covered the value of all of apple property for those tax years.
as for the tax year,defendants asserted that the tax on leasehold improvements,office furniture and equipment,computers,and machines and equipment was equalized after the august,evidentiary hearing.therefore,when apple insisted the auditor should audit each of the four years,the board maintained that it was forbidden by sections and e from granting apple another equalization hearing for those years.
apple position was that only portions of the through assessments were equalized and that the stipulation contemplated that the and tax years would be audited.
the trial court issued a statement of decision finding that the assessor had a statutory,ministerial duty to audit each of the four years in question.the assessor discretion to audit a test year is circumscribed by the requirements of property tax rule the court shorthand for title california code of regulations and a designation which we shall use in the text and that rule does not allow the assessor to forego sic audits for fiscal years which the assessor has unilaterally determined had previously been equalized.to find otherwise would render the language of section nugatory.that statute expressly states that e qualization of property shall not preclude a subsequent audit and shall not preclude the assessor from levying an escape assessment in appropriate instances.revenue taxation code.
the court found that the stipulation did not operate to equalize fiscal years and.the express language of the stipulation indicates that the parties contemplated audits for these two fiscal years,with respondent assessor reserving the right to verify,and adjust if necessary,the reported costs and petitioner apple reserving the right to appeal any escape assessments resulting from such audits.the subject matter of the stipulation was the methodology to be used in calculating the value of specified categories of assets and respondent board approval of the stipulation was an approval of the methodology,not an equalization.
the court found that the august,evidentiary hearing before the board involved contested valuations of machinery and equipment including telecommunication and electronic test equipment,office furniture and equipment,leasehold improvements real and personal and computers accordingly,those are the only categories of property which were equalized by the board as a consequence of its findings and conclusions dated november there could be no equalization of other categories of property which were not at issue in those proceedings.accordingly,the board findings,conclusions and determination dated august are without foundation and must be set aside.
however,the court found apple february applications were premature,as respondent assessor has yet to complete its audit of fiscal years,and.once that audit is complete and the necessary findings and notices are issued by respondent assessor,petitioner apple may file the appropriate applications before the board.
the trial court denied apple request to order the board to take jurisdiction over apple,and applications and ordered the parties to bear their own costs and fees.none of the parties was satisfied by these orders.these appeals ensued.
issues on appeal 
apple contends that the trial court erred in ordering the assessor to issue findings and the notice mandated by law after completing the audit rather than forthwith and in finding apple applications premature and refusing to direct the board to take jurisdiction of apple applications and grant it a hearing.finally,apple contends the statute of limitations for assessments precludes the superior court conclusion that apple applications were premature and that respondent assessor needs to complete the audit.
the board the trial court order setting aside the board findings and conclusions from the jurisdictional hearing on apple february applications,and the assessor appeals the order directing him to complete the audit for through.

completion of the audit 
apple contends that the court erred in ordering the assessor to complete the audit before issuing the statutorily mandated findings and notices.apple claims the assessor already had sufficient information to make the findings and notices without further audit efforts.apple states that it advised the superior court that its holding regarding completion of the apparently was the basis underlying the court finding that apple applications were the applicability of the statute of limitations for escape assessments which had expired for all three years at issue by the time the superior court entered its judgment.apple explains that the assessor would probably have to perform some additional calculations in order to make the determinations required by section.however,it does not entail completion of the audit in the sense of a further review of records,which review otherwise had been concluded by respondent assessor years ago.
where the assessor,in conducting an audit under section and property tax rule,finds a discrepancy or irregularity in the fiscal year first selected for audit,the assessor shall audit the remaining fiscal years for which the statute of limitations has not run unless the documents in the audit report his conclusion both that the discrepancy or irregularity in the fiscal year first selected is peculiar to that fiscal year and that the discrepancy or irregularity did not permit the assessment of an escape under the provisions of sections,or of the revenue and taxation code,tit.
the record supports the trial court finding that the assessor audit narrative did not state that the discrepancy or irregularity did not permit the assessment of an escape under the provisions of section,or of the revenue and taxation code as required by property tax rule a.the conclusion in the audit narrative stated,t he years through were appealed and settled and a note by gh,the chief and the auditor supervisor,which was handwritten on the audit narrative,added,was heard by the appeals board.these comments are not a sufficient substitute for the statement required by the statute.they do not inevitably lead to the conclusion required by property tax rule a that the discrepancy or irregularity did not permit the assessment of an escape under the provisions of sections,or of the revenue and taxation code.consequently,we agree with the trial court that the assessor had a statutory,ministerial duty to audit each of the four years in question and his discretion to audit a test year is circumscribed by the requirements of property tax rule.the assessor may not forego audits for fiscal years which the assessor has unilaterally determined had previously been equalized.
next,the trial court found that the stipulation was an approval of the methodology to be used in calculating the value of specified categories of assets.the court also stated the board approval of the stipulation was an approval of the methodology and not an equalization.the record supports the finding that the stipulation was an approval of methodology but the stipulation was also an equalization of limited types of personal property.
first,the administrative record of the hearing before the board contains only testimony about lifing,depreciation tables and other factors related to determining the cost of specific types of property.the focus is narrow and does not cover all categories of property listed in the tax bill.the parties agreed to apply the economic lives,iowa state curves,appropriate bureau of economic analysis bea computer price decline indexes,income decline factors,friedman formula,and weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology as determined by the santa clara county assessment appeals board for these same categories of assets for the four tax years immediately preceding the tax year.the criteria for the,and tax years is as follows another two pages of criteria follow.
second,the stipulation ends,e ach of the parties waives any right of appeal from any reduction ordered pursuant to this stipulation.this stipulation contains pages.italics added.the pages of from and to cash values following the three pages of the agreement demonstrate there was an equalization of some categories of property.comparing a sampling of the over pages of original applications with the corresponding references in the stipulation establishes that the applications covered the category personal property at many different addresses in santa clara county.while the applications stated that each category of property listed on the tax bill was only worth half of the assessor valuation,the only reduced numbers appear in the attachments to the stipulation for the category personal property.for personal property,in most cases,the to number is a reduction from the from number.in the application forms that we checked,the assessor office generally made no change to the personal property category in the column.county verified assessment.however,the numbers in the to column in the stipulation are different.for example,the application for assessment shows that the total original assessed value was,apple opinion of value was,and the county verified assessment remained at the original.the stipulation,however,shows the value in the to column to be.based on the evidence,and the statement in the stipulation that the amounts entered on the current roll for the parcel s set forth below may be adjusted as indicated on the attachment s italics added,we conclude the reductions set forth in the attachments to the stipulation were an equalization.
the parties do not dispute that that reduction was an equalization the battle is over whether defendants are right that all of apple property,or apple is right that only some of its property,was equalized.
there is no support for defendants position in the record.substantial evidence in the transcript and exhibits submitted at the august hearing supports the finding that categories of personal property and other property not stated to be covered by the stipulation were not equalized.
consequently we reject defendants claim that audits for the through tax years were foreclosed by equalization of all of apple property at every business location in santa clara county.
order to assessor 
next,apple contends that the trial court should have ordered the assessor to make findings based on his previous examination of the books and records for the through tax years.apple asserts that evidence adduced at the trial showed the effect of the issues on the three earlier years and the issues and amounts of the refunds it sought.apple allows that the assessor would probably have to perform some additional calculations in order to accomplish one or more of these three steps,but claims these calculations do not entail completion of the audit in the sense of a further review of the records.
we disagree.although there is evidence in the record that some or perhaps much of the work needed for an audit of the through tax years was completed,the assessor is entitled to determine what is needed for completion of the audit.the trial court properly ordered the assessor to finish the audit and issue findings as required by statute and regulation.
jurisdiction 
apple next contends that the court erred in finding apple applications premature and in not directing the board to take jurisdiction of apple applications and grant it a hearing.apple cites heavenly valley el dorado county bd.of equalization th,d,for the proposition that it was entitled to file applications for the first three tax years in the audit even though the assessor had failed to comply with his statutory duties.according to apple,section e allows a taxpayer to seek administrative review if a section audit discloses property subject to an escape assessment for any year.apple claims the audit had disclosed property subject to escape assessment for the audit year.apple claims that the facts are undisputed that several of the audit adjustments in the tax year would have triggered corresponding escape assessment adjustments in the three earlier tax years.
apple argument is based on the conclusion that the audit disclosed property for the first three tax years subject to an escape assessment.yet apple strenuously urged the point that the audit for those years was never completed.the trial court agreed with this contention.section e allows a taxpayer to seek administrative review based on the audit disclosure.since there were no audit disclosures for the years in question,the court finding that apple applications were premature was supported by the record.
statute of limitations 
finally,apple notes that any escape assessment on personal property generally must be made within four years after july first of the assessment year.section provides that an assessment for property that has escaped taxation or was underassessed shall be made within four years after july of the assessment year in which the property escaped taxation or was underassessed,subd.a.
