this case calls on us to decide if the bankrupt telecommunications company worldcom must pay federal excise taxes on the purchase of a telecommunications service that connected people using modems to the internet.appellant,the internal revenue service irs,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york forrest,which upheld the decision of the bankruptcy court gonzalez,to grant the objection of the reorganized debtors debtors to the irs proof of claim for taxes owed and the debtors refund motion for the taxes worldcom had already paid.
in the late,worldcom purchased a service from local telephone companies called remote access,or cobra,that gave people the ability to use their modems to connect to worldcom network and the internet over their regular telephone line.the tax code adds a three percent excise tax to the purchase of a local telephone service.a local telephone service is any service that provides access to a local telephone system,and the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system.id.a.on appeal,the irs contends that the district and bankruptcy courts erred in concluding that cobra was not taxable as a local telephone service.
for the reasons set forth below,we hold that worldcom purchased a local telephone service when it paid for cobra services,and that worldcom must therefore pay federal communication excise taxes on those transactions.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
the following background is drawn from the bankruptcy court factual findings,adopted by the district court and unchallenged by either party on appeal 
in the late,worldcom,originally a telephone service provider,began building a massive internet network to provide data services.as part of building that network,worldcom purchased a telecommunications service known as remote access,or cobra from local telephone companies.cobra allowed local telephone subscribers to connect to the internet using a modem 
in order to connect to the internet through cobra,a subscriber modem would call the cobra access number over the subscriber normal telephone line the public switched telephone network or pstn line.after dialing the cobra number,the modem signal traveled over the pstn,the same network on which traditional telephone calls travel.the signal then passed through a switch at the local telephone company central office that routed the signal over the telephone company telephone lines,known as primary rate interface or pri lines.the pri lines carried the signal to a network access server,which converted the phone signal to an format using digital signal process dsp cards.the network access server sent this data signal to a router through another pri line contained within the network access server,and the router then transmitted the signal,along with other aggregated data signals,to worldcom network on a data line through the egress of the network access server.the system also worked in reverse and could convert a data signal from the internet to a phone signal that could be carried through the local telephone lines back to the user modem.cobra provided local telephone customers with a connection to the internet 
worldcom plugged the output internet data stream from the local telephone company network access server into its own network,and sold access to the stream to internet service providers isps,like aol,which in turn sold access to the internet to people with modems.the pri lines and all aspects of the network access server up through the egress port where worldcom plugged in its network were considered cobra equipment and were used by the local telephone companies as part of providing cobra service to worldcom.worldcom paid the local telephone companies a monthly fee for access to cobra.
the parties agree that the cobra system was theoretically capable of transmitting an ordinary telephone call.the pri lines that carried a modem signal to the network access server could also carry a regular voice communication signal.instead of connecting to the network access server,those pri lines could have plugged into a pbx,which is a switch that allows for voice communication over pri lines.the pri lines,however,did not include a pbx switch.as purchased by worldcom,cobra was not set up for voice communication.
worldcom also could not reconfigure the pri lines,which,along with the other cobra equipment,were controlled by the local telephone companies.it could access cobra only remotely to disable a modem if it was malfunctioning or make limited software changes.accordingly,within the system provided by the cobra service,once the network access server converted a telephone signal from a modem into packets the data stream,it was no longer possible to transmit a traditional voice communication.a worldcom employee husband could not use cobra to call his wife office and ask her whether she wanted to get lunch 
ii.procedural history 
worldcom filed its chapter bankruptcy petition on july,and the bankruptcy court confirmed the reorganization plan on october.in re worldcom,worldcom i.after the court confirmed the plan,the irs filed a proof of claim requesting that the debtors pay in excise taxes on worldcom purchase of cobra services.worldcom i,at.the debtors objected to the irs claim and additionally moved for a refund of the in excise taxes worldcom had already paid on cobra.
the bankruptcy court gonzalez,held an evidentiary hearing on february.by opinion dated june,the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of the debtors,granting both the refund motion and their objection to the irs proof of claim.worldcom i,at.the irs appealed worldcom i to the district court.on august,the district court jones,concluded that the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that section a required worldcom to have the privilege to both initiate and receive telephonic quality communication.in re worldcom,worldcom ii,civ,wl,at,holding that as long as communication occurred,it was irrelevant which party initiated the call citing usa choice internet,llc united states usa choice ii.accordingly,the district court reversed and remanded to the bankruptcy court for further factual findings on whether cobra was a local telephone service.
on remand,the parties submitted additional proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,and on june,the bankruptcy court again ruled in favor of the debtors.in re worldcom,worldcom ii.the bankruptcy court concluded that the only service worldcom had purchased was the ability to plug into the internet data stream provided by the local telephone companies,the egress from the network access server.because that data stream could not support telephonic quality communication,which,in the bankruptcy court interpretation,meant regular phone calls,and because worldcom could not reconfigure cobra to provide it with telephonic quality communication,the bankruptcy court concluded that worldcom had not purchased a local telephone service as defined by the statute.the court distinguished worldcom purchase of cobra services from other cases finding that similar internet services were taxable.see usa choice ii,at comcation,united states,fed.cl.in those cases,the taxpayer purchased a service that provided it with the raw telephone signals,which the company itself converted to an internet signal.according to the bankruptcy court,because the companies in those cases had access to the telephone lines,they were provided with signals capable of telephonic quality communication.
the irs again appealed to the district court.on december,the district court forrest,affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court.in re worldcom,worldcom iv,civ,wl.the district court emphasized that worldcom itself did not connect users to the internet and characterized cobra as simply an intermediate step in the process.id.at.according to the court,this was another reason to distinguish cobra from the services at issue in comcation and usa choice ii,where the isp plaintiffs connected subscribers to the internet directly.the district court then evaluated whether this intermediate step c ould constitute a stand alone local telephone service for purposes of section a.id.at.after retracing the process of how the cobra service operated in practice,the district court concluded that the nanosecond of time that the modem signal spent traversing the pri lines before being converted into an internet data stream by the network access server was s urely not what congress meant to tax as a local telephone service.id.at.
the district court further concluded that cobra did not provide the ability to communicate with substantially all persons who are part of such asserted telephone system as required by statute.id.at brackets in original.the court determined that cobra was distinct from the local telephone system,and because it wa s a service within the telephone company facility,there was no way for any person to access the telephonic quality communication that the cobra pri lines could theoretically support.id.even though cobra interfaced with the normal local telephone network which the court delineated as a separate service people who used their modems to connect to the internet through cobra could not communicate with the cobra system,nor could worldcom communicate with them.the court entered judgment in favor of the debtors on december.this appeal followed.
discussion 
because neither party disputes the bankruptcy court factual findings or the district court adoption of those findings,we address only the legal conclusions of the district court.our review of those conclusions is de novo.in re cbi holding,cir.federal tax assessments are presumed to be correct and constitute prima facie evidence of liability.see welch helvering,united states mccombs,cir.the taxpayer bears the burden to prove that the assessment was incorrect.mccombs,at.this burden applies within bankruptcy proceedings.raleigh.dep t of revenue.
local telephone service 
federal law imposes a excise tax on amounts paid for three kinds of communications services local telephone service toll telephone service and teletypewriter exchange service.the irs contends that cobra is a local telephone service,which the statute defines as 
the access to a local telephone system,and the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system,and 
any facility or service provided in connection with a service described in paragraph.
whether cobra constitutes a local telephone service is a question of statutory interpretation.in interpreting any statute,we start with its text,auburn hous.auth.martinez,cir,giving the language its ordinary meaning,taniguchi kan pac.saipan.section a sets forth two requirements for a local telephone service,both of which must be satisfied a access to a local telephone system and b the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all of the people who are part of that system.we address each element in turn.
access to a local telephone system 
we begin with the element of access to a local telephone system.although we have not previously addressed the proper interpretation of section a,the federal circuit has confronted its scope.after reviewing ordinary definitions of access,the federal circuit found that general dictionary definitions of access provide little insight into what is covered by the tax.usa choice ii,at.but the court noted it had previously interpreted access in the context of access to a teletypewriter exchange system under section c of the statute,where it held that the technological meaning of the word access in the communications field in general mean s the interface or connection between the central exchange and the customer terminal.id.quoting trans lux united states,fed cir alterations and brackets in trans lux.based on this interpretation of the closely related teletypewriter exchange service definition,the federal circuit concluded that access simply means connectivity.id.
the federal circuit definition of access was adopted by the district court in this case,see worldcom ii,wl,at,and is undisputed by the parties.we agree.access to a local telephone system simply means a service that provides a connection to a local telephone system.
we must still determine,however,what level of connectivity is sufficient to provide access.several of our sister circuits have noted that because section a speaks of access to a local telephone system,congress intended that the service provide a direct connection to a specific local system.see,officemax,united states,cir.we agree that access in the context of the purchase of a local telephone service is limited to direct connectivity to a specific local telephone system.interpreting access to cover indirect connections would mean,for example,that a toll or telephone service,which provides indirect access to every local telephone system,would also be considered a local telephone service.this would collapse the separate definitions of local telephone service and toll telephone service under the statute.see id.noting that contrary interpretation would blur the line between sections a and b accord reese,united states,cir am.bankers ins.grp.united states,cir noting that a contrary interpretation would make the entire united states part of one local telephone system other internal quotation marks omitted am.online,united states,fed.cl.similarly,the usa choice ii court suggested that a service like vonage,whose voice over internet protocol voip technology uses the internet to transmit telephone signals,rather than using the traditional public switched telephone network,does not provide direct access to a local telephone system.usa choice ii,at citing verizon servs.vonage holdings,fed cir.
with this understanding of access in mind,we conclude that cobra provided worldcom with access to a local telephone system.the connection between a user and worldcom through cobra began with a local telephone customer ordinary pstn line.when the subscriber dialed the cobra number,the telephone company routed the signal from the subscriber modem and pstn line to cobra pri lines,which connected to worldcom network through the telephone company network access server.thus,cobra provided direct connectivity to a local telephone system.moreover,the record demonstrates that cobra was a service provided by individual local telephone companies.worldcom contracted separately with each local telephone company,like bellsouth,to gain access to that company local telephone system.cobra did not transform the entire united states into one local telephone system.am.bankers ins,at.the access element is satisfied.
b.the privilege of telephonic quality communication 
with access defined,we turn to the second and more hotly contested element of local telephone service whether cobra provided worldcom with the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting a part of such local telephone system.a.the irs contends that cobra did so by connecting users to worldcom network through modems and telephonic pri lines,just like the similar internet services that were found taxable by the federal circuit in usa choice ii and the court of federal claims in comcation.the debtors respond that,unlike the services at issue in usa choice ii and comcation,worldcom had access only to the internet data stream from the telephone company network access server.without the ability to use or reconfigure cobra to talk to the users on the phone,they argue,cobra did not provide the privilege of telephonic quality communication.
we must therefore define telephonic quality communication.starting with telephonic,dictionaries contemporaneous to the enactment of the last substantive revision to the relevant statutory provision define telephonic as o f,pertaining to,of the nature of,or conveyed by a telephone.the compact edition of the oxford english dictionary accord webster new collegiate dictionary adjective form of telephone,defined as,inter alia,t o send or communicate by telephone see also taniguchi.at interpreting ordinary meaning of statutory term with reference to contemporaneous dictionaries.
next,because section uses the term telephonic quality communication,a emphasis added,we must determine how quality modifies telephonic.like the statute use of the word access,general dictionary definitions of quality shed little light on congress intent.see usa choice ii,at.quality can mean an attribute,property,special feature,or characteristic nature,kind,or character the degree or grade of excellence or a particular class,kind,or grade of anything,as determined by its quality.the compact edition of the oxford english dictionary webster new collegiate dictionary.the meaning of the word depends on context and connotation.
however,a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because the same terminology is used elsewhere in a context that makes its meaning clear.united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest.here,comparing the definition of local telephone service to the related provision of section defining toll telephone service shows that we must give meaning to the word quality independent of telephonic.section b sets forth two alternative definitions of toll telephone service,one that uses the term telephonic quality communication,and another that refers to a service that provides the customer with the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications,unmodified by the word quality.compare b defining toll telephone service as,in relevant part,a telephonic quality communication emphasis added,with id.b alternatively defining toll telephone service as service which entitles the subscriber to the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications emphasis added because congress has distinguished between a service that provides the privilege of telephonic communications and telephonic quality communication,we can not treat telephonic quality as equivalent to telephonic.see duncan walker,we are reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage in any setting.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
if we define quality in the context of telephonic quality communication as meaning an attribute,property,or characteristic,we would make quality redundant with telephonic.saying that a communication that has the property or characteristic of being telephonic is no different from simply calling a communication telephonic.see also the compact edition of the oxford english dictionary defining telephonic in part with of the nature of.on the other hand,applying the alternate dictionary definitions of quality as meaning the degree or grade of excellence or a particular class,kind or grade of anything,as determined by its quality,gives meaning to quality by broadening the scope of telephonic communications to those communications in the same class,kind or grade as a communication by telephone.
we therefore conclude that quality,as used in this statute,refers to the technological capacity of the channel to transmit voice signals,regardless of whether or not the channel is used for voice communication.if the grade of the communication is one that is of the same level as a telephonic communication,then the communication is telephonic quality.in other words,a telephonic quality communication is a communication that is carried over a communication channel that could also carry an ordinary telephone call 
our interpretation not only gives substance to the word quality,but is also supported by another provision of section.the meaning of a particular section in a statute can be understood in context with and by reference to the whole statutory scheme,by appreciating how sections relate to one another.in other words,the preferred meaning of a statutory provision is one that is consonant with the rest of the statute.auburn,f d at citing robinson shell oil.in addition to taxing local and toll telephone services,the tax code also imposes the communications excise tax on teletypewriter exchange service.teletypewriter exchange services now,like cobra,obsolete did not provide voice communication they were an early form of data exchange that connected printers to a network for the purpose of sending messages.see the new encyclopdia britannica ed see also c defining as access from a teletypewriter or other data station.
after defining what a teletypewriter exchange service is,section c notes that t he term teletypewriter exchange service does not include any service which is local telephone service as defined in subsection a.c.by adding this provision to the definition of teletypewriter exchange service,it is clear that congress envisioned the possibility that a teletypewriter service could also qualify as a local telephone service,even absent the provision of any voice communication.otherwise,there would be no need to clarify that a service can not be treated as both a teletypewriter exchange service and local telephone service.to hold that telephonic quality communication means only voice communication would render this provision surplusage.
from this,we conclude that a data communication transmitted by a modem is a telephonic quality communication.in this case,both the government witness and the debtors witness agreed that modems transmit data from a computer over telephone lines using the the same exact frequency range as the human voice,app x accord id.at.the debtors expert also agreed that a modem connection requires a telephonic quality grade telephone line.id.at.indeed,both the district court and bankruptcy court found that the parties agreed that up until the modem signal reached the network access server there existed telephonic quality communication.worldcom iv,wl,at worldcom iii,at.similarly,the federal circuit in usa choice ii noted that a successful connection between one of usa choice server modems and another subscriber modem required telephonic quality.usa choice ii,at.and in comcation,the court of federal claims explained that,once a call was established to comcation network on the pri lines,communication occurred,because information from the subscriber and the internet flowed back and forth over these pri lines.comcation,fed.cl.at rejecting argument that isp did not have privilege to communicate with local telephone customers because isp could not initiate calls.
we recognize,however,that there is one authority that may be contrary to our interpretation.in a revenue ruling from,the irs was asked to evaluate whether a data processing and transmission service that used modems and local telephone lines was taxable,and whether the equipment provided to the business in connection with that service was likewise taxable.see rul.although the irs found that the service could be taxed as a local telephone service under section a,it determined that the modems and computer equipment provided to the business were not taxable as facilities provided in connection with that service under section a.id.the irs concluded that because the type of telephone signal produced by modems is usable only for nonvoice data transmission to other computer station,and because only a relatively few stations in the local telephone system are used in this computer service,a modem is not a facility provided in connection with the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having stations in the local system.id 
it is not clear whether the irs reached this conclusion primarily because the service provided access to only a limited number of stations,or because nonvoice data transmission was not of telephonic quality.in the end,the irs found the service taxable because the business could choose to plug a regular telephone instead of a modem into the port for the service,thereby affording it the privilege of telephonic quality communication,even though it may not be exercised.accord usa choice ii,at.although not altogether certain,the strong implication of the irs reasoning,however,is that communications over telephone wires are not telephonic quality communication.see worldcom iii,at interpreting revenue ruling as equating telephonic quality communication with voice communication emphasis omitted.
we do not think this revenue ruling overcomes the text of the statute.the deference owed to irs revenue rulings is presently an unsettled area of law.see united states cleveland indians baseball,declining to decide whether revenue rulings are entitled to chevron deference.prior to the supreme court opinion in united states mead,we afforded great deference to irs revenue rulings,and explained that they are presumed to have the force of legal precedent unless unreasonable or inconsistent with the provisions of the internal revenue code.weisbart dep t of treasury,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have recognized,however,that this standard was potentially undermined by the supreme court holding in mead that administrative rulings are not entitled to deference unless they carry the force of law.see reimels comm r,cir see also fortis,united states,d.we now hold,consistent with every other circuit to have addressed the issue since mead,that revenue rulings are not entitled to chevron deference.see,kornman,united states,cir aeroquip vickers,comm r,cir omohundro united states,cir del commercial,comm r.
a dministrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.mead,at.but,u nlike treasury regulations,the irs does not invoke its authority to make rules with the force of law when promulgating revenue rulings.kornman,at citing d v d.even though a revenue ruling is the official irs position on application of tax law to specific facts,weisbart,at internal quotation marks omitted,the supreme court has made clear that official agency interpretations lacking the force of law are not entitled to chevron deference.see mead,at holding tariff rulings are not entitled to chevron deference christensen harris,holding agency opinion letters are not entitled to chevron deference.as we previously implied in reimels,weisbart has been abrogated by mead.
although not entitled to chevron deference,particular revenue rulings may be given deference to the extent that they are persuasive in other words,we will afford them skidmore deference.see mead,at citing skidmore swift,accord worldcom i,at rejecting chevron deference and evaluating whether revenue rulings are entitled to deference under skidmore.the weight accorded to an administrative judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.mead,at quoting skidmore,at.as relevant here,we do not defer to revenue ruling under skidmore because we do not find it persuasive.
the irs legal analysis makes no effort to interpret the word quality.nor does it attempt to square telephonic quality communication in the local telephone service definition with either telephonic communications in the toll telephone service definition or the teletypewriter definition exclusivity rule.the ruling contains no analysis of text or legislative history or any other relevant interpretive guidance.fed.mortg.ass united states.similarly,the ruling neither elucidates nor invokes support for its conclusion that modems do not qualify as conveying telephonic quality communication.id.by contrast,other courts that have squarely addressed the issue of whether internet services similar to cobra are taxable have concluded that modems do engage in telephonic quality communication by communicating over telephone lines.see usa choice ii,at,comcation,fed.cl.at.we therefore give revenue ruling no weight,in accord with our sister circuits that have declined to defer to similarly cursory revenue rulings.see fed.mortg.ass n,at comm r,cir 
to be of telephonic quality a communication must use a communication channel over which it is possible to have a conversation with the use of telephones,usa choice ii,at alteration omitted.the local telephone and pri lines used by modems are such a channel.therefore,data communication through a modem over telephone lines is telephonic quality communication.
now that we have defined the privilege of telephonic quality communication,we must decide if cobra provides it.the irs argues that by routing a user modem signal over pri lines that were capable of carrying a phone call,cobra provided worldcom with the privilege of telephonic quality communication.but the debtors claim that because cobra transformed that modem signal into an,quality data stream within the network access server,and because worldcom had access to only the data stream,cobra did not provide the privilege of telephonic quality communication.the debtors contend that all the requirements of section a must extend through the entirety of the connection.it is not sufficient that a portion of the path contains one of these elements.appellee br.emphasis added.
despite the certainty of the debtors assertion,they cite no portion of the statute,nor any relevant case law,that supports such an interpretation.the plain language of section a phrase the privilege of telephonic quality communication does not answer whether the service purchased has to provide the privilege of telephonic quality communication throughout the entirety of the service system,or if it is sufficient if only a portion of the system provides that privilege.we have fallen into a statutory crevice.to fill it,we look beyond the plain text of the statute.in re boodrow,cir t he text is only the starting point,especially when the language is ambiguous.quoting kelly robinson.
but before we do so,we address the government contention that we do not need to look beyond the plain text because cobra is clearly taxable when section a is read in conjunction with another provision of the communications excise tax statute,section a.section a sets out the general rule for calculating the excise tax,which is that i f a bill is rendered the taxpayer for local telephone service or toll telephone service,the amount on which the tax with respect to such services shall be based shall be the sum of all charges for such services included in the bill.a.because the modem connection between the users and the network access server is of telephonic quality and has been previously held to be taxable by usa choice ii and comcation,the irs argues that cobra simply provides the same service plus a network access server,and that the whole charge is therefore taxable.
we disagree for several reasons.first,we think the irs misreads the applicability of usa choice ii and comcation.the irs contends that because those courts found similar services taxable,we can shoehorn cobra into that finding as providing a little more.but this mistakes the holdings of usa choice ii and comcation for agreement with the irs reasoning.those courts did not address the issue of whether the service changes when the customer does not have access to the pri lines.see usa choice ii,at usa choice decision to connect these lines to modems in its network servers rather than to telephones through equipment such as a multiplexor or pbx though perfectly understandable for a commercial isp resulted in limits that did not fundamentally alter the nature of the services that usa choice had the privilege to use.internal quotation marks,citation,and brackets omitted.looking,as we must,at the text,it would be entirely circular to use section a explanation of how to calculate the tax assessed on a local telephone service to define what a local telephone service is.the irs argument works only if we already assume that the section of cobra that uses pri lines is a taxable local telephone service,and therefore fails.
although the plain text of the statute does not answer whether a service must provide telephonic quality communication throughout the entirety of the system in order to be taxable,congress passes legislation with specific purposes in mind.when the ordinary tools of statutory construction permit us to do so,we must attempt to discover those purposes health hosps.perales,cir.keeping in mind that s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor,united sav.ass of,at,we may look at legislative history to determine the intent of congress,auburn,at.
the history of the communications excise tax is long and turbulent.congress first imposed a tax on the purchase of communications services shortly after the spanish american war,twenty years after the invention of the telephone.see officemax,at tracing legislative iterations of the tax.although initially designed as a temporary tax passed to finance the deficit caused by the war,congress repeatedly reenacted and extended the tax,adjusting the scope of its coverage and changing the rates applicable to various services,before making the tax permanent at its current rate of three percent in for all services covered.id.noting that attempt to repeal the tax in was vetoed by president clinton.
the most recent substantive change to the definitions of taxable services occurred in,when congress enacted the excise tax reduction act of,stat.see am.online,fed.cl.at.as is most relevant here,the act enacted the current definitions of local telephone service,toll telephone service,and teletypewriter exchange service.see trans lux,at.the definitions were likely updated and modified in order to reflect and to meet the changing technology and market conditions of the industry,in order to make it clear that it is the service as such which is being taxed and not merely the equipment being supplied.id.quoting,at,at this history suggests that congress intended to tax any communication service as a local telephone service so long as it connected a customer to a local telephone system and allowed that customer to use the telephone lines to communicate with the subscribers to that system,regardless of whether the service also used equipment to accomplish that communication.
although the bankruptcy and district courts acknowledged this congressional purpose,they misapplied it when evaluating the service that cobra provided.by focusing solely on the part of the cobra system that worldcom connected to and had control over the data stream that came out of the egress to the network access server the bankruptcy and district courts did not apprehend the scope of the service the local telephone companies sold to worldcom.the cobra service was not just a data stream,sitting on a shelf to be picked up by any telecom shopper looking for internet access.such a conclusion gives too much emphasis to the equipment used by the local telephone companies the network access server and ignores the system as a whole.
what cobra provided,as made clear by the bankruptcy court factual findings,was a communication pathway between local telephone customers and worldcom network.cobra allowed worldcom to connect modem users to the internet through those users regular telephone lines.and in order to connect them to the internet,the part of that pathway that used modems required telephonic quality communication.
that worldcom connected its equipment to the cobra system only after the local telephone company converted the modem signals to a data stream does not change the fact that the service relied on modem signals being carried over pri lines that afforded telephonic quality communication.without pri lines there would be no cobra service and nothing for worldcom to resell to the isps.as other courts have noted,the statutory definition of local telephone service shows that congress intended to tax those users who rely on the traditional telephone system for whatever reason.see usa choice ii,at noting the tax applies to customers who use their phone lines,regardless of whether to make phone calls or to plug in a fax machine.accordingly,because cobra relied on telephonic quality pri lines to allow worldcom network to communicate with subscribers,cobra provided worldcom with the privilege of telephonic quality communication.
the debtors,relying on the same legislative history from that emphasizes the shift of the focus of the tax to the services rather than the equipment being provided.usa choice ii,at see,at,argue that the pri lines were merely part of the local telephone company cobra equipment and not part of the actual service provided to worldcom.we disagree.first,the bankruptcy court found that one of the cobra system three basic components was routing connections from the telephone company central office switches to the cobra system through ingress primary rate interface pri lines.worldcom i,at.indeed,on remand from the district court,the debtors proposed findings of fact stated that the pri lines were used by the telephone companies as part of their provision of cobra service.app x see also worldcom iii,at referring to pri lines as part of the cobra service.second,the debtors expert witness and employee,john anderson,testified that the pri lines were a component of the cobra service purchased by worldcom.third,worldcom contracts with local telephone companies listed the pri lines as part of the cobra service.
to give a more intuitive example though perhaps dated for some,consider a fax machine.fax machines transmit data signals over ordinary telephone lines.when a person pushes start on a fax machine,the machine scans the piece of paper,converts the image into a signal,and transmits it over a telephone line to the number dialed.the fax machine on the other end of the call receives the signal,converts the signal back into the image originally scanned,and prints a copy.given that we have defined telephonic quality as meaning any communication that relies on a connection,a fax connection is of telephonic quality.but the connection over the telephone lines is not the only thing the fax machine relies on to communicate.to finish the communication,the fax machine converts the signal into a printed image.the piece of paper printed is certainly not of telephonic quality.
accepting the debtors argument that the connection must remain of telephonic quality through the entirety of the connection,a service that connects fax machines over the local telephone system would not be taxable.we would have to conclude that only the part of the fax machine that the customer uses is the service,and that the telephone lines used by the machines are merely equipment.but if that is the case,what,other than an ordinary telephone call,could be taxable as a telephonic quality communication such an interpretation would bring us back to treating telephonic quality communication in sections a and b as equivalent to telephonic communications in subsection b.we do not think that congress intended the taxability of a local telephone service to turn on whether a service that allows a customer to communicate using a telephonic quality connection adds additional services or equipment beyond that connection.
moreover,to hold that cobra did not provide the privilege of telephonic quality communication would create a strange result where telecommunication companies that used their own network access servers to convert a phone signal to a data stream,like usa choice and comcation,would have to pay the tax,but companies that relied on the local telephone company to convert the signals for them,like worldcom,would not.this appears at odds with the statute intent for two reasons.first,whether a service is taxable would hinge on what equipment the local telephone company provided,not the nature of the service.see,at,at.
second,when congress enacted the act it added the private communications service exemption to the tax to avoid such a discrepancy in another context.see d.as the federal circuit explained 
congress enacted the private communication services exemption in order to correct the competitive imbalance that had developed between telephone services and equipment.under the excise tax technical changes act,a subscriber to the telephone company centrex or pbx systems communication systems that allowed both intrapremise and interpremise communication was subjected
