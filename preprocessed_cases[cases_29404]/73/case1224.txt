defendant wesley trent snipes appeals from his criminal convictions,after a jury trial,on three counts of willful failure to file individual federal income tax returns for calendar years,and,in violation of.snipes alleges that the trial court committed reversible error in sentencing,jury instructions,and on issues of venue.after thorough review,we affirm the rulings and judgment of the district court in all respects 
the essential facts adduced at trial and the procedural history are these wesley trent snipes is a movie actor and owner of film production companies,including amen ra films and kymberlyte productions.sometime around the year,snipes became involved in eddie ray kahn organization,american rights litigators arl,that purported to assist customers in resisting the internal revenue service irs.arl employees,including douglas rosile,and arl members sent voluminous letters to the irs,challenging the agency authority to collect taxes.the centerpiece of this resistance was the argument that the domestic earnings of individual americans do not qualify as income under,because the earnings do not come from a listed source.
the arl message appeared to have found a welcome audience in snipes.although snipes earned more than million dollars in gross income from to,he did not file individual federal income tax returns for any of those years.these were not,however,silent years.after meeting with arl,snipes began a long conversation with the irs.he sent treatises describing theories about why the irs was powerless to collect income taxes from him and several altered tax forms demanding money for taxes he had rendered in earlier years.thus,for example,in april,snipes sent an altered form,styled as an amended united states individual income tax return,in which he demanded a refund of over seven million dollars for taxes paid for the calendar year,allegedly paid in error.
snipes correspondence with the irs advanced several arguments justifying his failure to file his personal tax returns,including that he was a alien to the united states,that earned income must come from sources wholly outside the united states,that a taxpayer is defined by law as one who operates a distilled spirit plant,and that the internal revenue code taxing authority is limited to the district of columbia and insular possessions of the united states,exclusive of the states of the union.snipes also claimed that as a fiduciary of god,who is a nontaxpayer,he was a foreign diplomat who was not obliged to pay taxes.when snipes consulted his tax attorneys about his resistance to paying federal income taxes,they advised him that his position was contrary to the law and that he was required to file tax returns.the firm terminated snipes as a client when snipes refused to file his tax returns 
snipes resistance to the irs did not stop at his personal filings.snipes integrated the alr tax teachings into the accounting methodology of his film production companies.after june,his companies stopped deducting payroll and income taxes from employees salary checks.snipes began to proselytize this theory of tax resistance.he invited several employees to an educational seminar at his home.when employee carmen baker attended the seminar and questioned the theory,snipes ordered her to leave his house,later telling her that he was disappointed in her and that if she was not going to play along with the game plan,she should find another job.
the irs launched a criminal investigation of wesley snipes after the agency received the april altered form for the year,demanding refund of over seven million dollars based upon the argument.on october,a grand jury sitting in the united states district court for the middle district of florida returned a superseding indictment,charging snipes and his two,eddie ray kahn and douglas rosile,with various crimes relating to a fraudulent tax scheme.count one charged snipes,kahn,and rosile with conspiracy to defraud the united states by impeding the irs in its collection of income taxes,in violation of.count two charged all three defendants with filing a false claim for a refund of snipes taxes,in violation of and.counts three through eight charged snipes alone with six counts of willfully failing to file his individual federal income tax returns for calendar years through,in violation of.each defendant pled not guilty.snipes surrendered voluntarily and was arraigned on december.
at the time of arraignment,a magistrate judge set a deadline for pretrial motions for january.on january,snipes moved for an extension of time to file motions,due to the complexity of the case and the need to analyze discovery.the magistrate judge granted the extension,resetting the motions deadline to june,and the trial date to october.on june,snipes filed several motions,including a motion to transfer venue to the southern district of new york,under both b and federal rule of criminal procedure b.
the district court denied snipes motion for elective transfer under b as untimely,because it had been filed more than five months past the elective transfer period defined by b.the district court also denied snipes motion to transfer venue under federal rule of criminal procedure b,determining that snipes claim that his wife and children lived in his home in california was insufficient to overcome the hardship a transfer of venue would place on his significantly poorer and on many witnesses.on snipes motion for reconsideration of the venue issue,the court again denied the motion to transfer venue.
in early october,snipes moved for a continuance after he had fired his counsel for claimed incompetence and hired new lawyers.after the district court granted the continuance,snipes new lawyers challenged venue still again,alleging that the government had chosen ocala county,florida,for trial for racially discriminatory reasons.snipes again attempted to make a b statutory transfer election,claiming that the district court could disregard the statutory deadline because the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel constituted good cause.the trial court denied both venue motions.
after the district court refused to conduct a pretrial evidentiary hearing on the issue of venue,snipes lodged a notice of appeal with this court on the orders.we denied this interlocutory appeal,concluding that an order pertaining to venue was effectively reviewable after the entry of judgment.united states snipes,cir.
the case proceeded to a trial in january.at trial,an irs witness testified that although snipes had regularly filed individual federal income tax returns for the years through,he had not filed any returns for calendar years through.
irs special agent cameron lalli testified extensively about the investigation of the alleged tax conspiracy.agent lalli described a telephone conversation with snipes and his lawyer in may,during which agent lalli had informed snipes that snipes was under investigation for tax crimes.when he read snipes his rights,which included the right to remain silent,snipes replied,very interesting.in the course of the investigation,the grand jury served subpoenas on the office staff of amen ra films.former employee carmen baker testified at trial that when she received the grand jury subpoena,snipes ordered her not to respond,not to talk to anybody or to disclose any information on the company.when baker asked snipes why she should not respond,snipes replied,it does matter.i have a confidentiality agreement with your signature on it i f you do contact them,you will have to pay the consequences.according to baker,snipes warning made her feel very upset,uneasy,and scared.
after the government rested its case,snipes moved for a judgment of acquittal on only the false claim charge count two and the charge count three the motion neither mentioned the first count nor the other charges contained in counts four through eight of the superseding indictment.the court denied the motions and the defense rested its case without presenting any evidence.the district court denied again any motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the case.
snipes requested a specific jury instruction on venue for counts three through eight.the district court granted snipes request in full,instructing the jury that the sixth amendment protects a defendant right to a trial in the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.the court instructed the jury that the government must prove district of snipes legal a preponderance of the evidence,and that the jury must acquit snipes if the government had not met its burden.
snipes also sought jury instructions on both general good faith and good faith reliance upon the advice of counsel to supplement the standard willfulness instructions.the district court granted these requests,too,and instructed the jury that g ood faith is a complete defense to the charges in the indictment since good faith on the part of the defendant is inconsistent with intent to defraud or willfulness which is an essential part of the charges.the judge reminded the jury that the government was obliged to prove willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defendant had no burden to prove good faith.the court also gave snipes good faith instruction on intent,telling the jury that one who expresses an honestly held opinion or an honestly formed belief is not chargeable with fraudulent intent,even though the opinion is erroneous or the belief is mistaken.as for good faith reliance upon counsel,the trial court instructed that willfulness could not be found if snipes had consulted in good faith with an attorney and strictly complied with the attorney advice.
snipes also sought an instruction on good faith reliance based upon the fifth amendment,explaining that if he had a good faith belief in his right to assert his fifth amendment privilege not to incriminate himself then he would not be guilty of acting willfully.snipes claimed that he believed he had a fifth amendment privilege not to file his personal income tax returns because special agent lalli advised him of his right to remain silent.the district court declined to give this instruction,observing that there was no evidence that snipes had directly asserted his fifth amendment right as a basis for refusing to file his federal income tax returns.snipes counsel did,however,argue to the jury in closing that snipes reliance on agent lalli advice of rights constituted a good faith basis for his failure to file his individual income tax returns.
on february,the jury convicted kahn and rosile on counts one and two the conspiracy and false claim charges,but acquitted snipes on the same charges.the jury convicted snipes,however,on counts three,four,and five,for the willful failure to file individual federal income tax returns for calendar years,and.the jury acquitted snipes on counts six,seven,and eight,the charges for,and.
the probation office presentence investigation report psi recommended that snipes be assigned a base offense level of under a and.the psi measured snipes intended tax loss at,and assigned a increase under b,determining that snipes had used sophisticated means to hide assets from taxation by using foreign accounts.the psi also recommended a increase pursuant to,because snipes had obstructed justice by directing carmen baker to conceal evidence from a federal grand jury investigation.finally,the psi recommended a guidelines sentence of months imprisonment.snipes objected to the psi sentencing recommendations and challenged the psi reliance on any facts for enhancing his sentence.snipes also objected that the obstruction of justice adjustment was unsupported,because baker testimony was unreliable.
the district court sentenced snipes on april.before the sentence was pronounced,snipes challenged the tax sentencing regime,arguing that the sentencing commission had contravened j by not providing probation for offenses.the district court rejected this claim,observing that,although snipes crimes were not felonies,congress had deemed them to be serious.the court also overruled snipes objection to the enhancement.the court did,however,sustain snipes objection to a enhancement.snipes called several character witnesses who testified on his behalf.the district court calculated the guidelines range,specifically observed that the sentencing guidelines were advisory,and discussed each of the factors enumerated in a.the court sentenced snipes to a total term of months imprisonment,comprised of three terms for the convictions,to be served consecutively,followed by one year of supervised release and a special assessment fee.
snipes timely appealed and the government.
we examine first whether the district court erred by denying snipes june,statutory elective transfer under b as being untimely.snipes claims that when the magistrate judge extended the pretrial motions deadline,the new deadline necessarily extended the period of time in which he was allowed to elect to transfer his trial.this theory rests on the notion that rule c provision that a district court may set deadlines for pretrial motions somehow supersedes b command that an election to be tried in the district in which the defendant resided must be filed within twenty days after arraignment.c snipes also claims that the district court abused its discretion when it denied snipes permission to make a late statutory elective transfer on the basis of his former counsel excusable neglect,under federal rule of criminal procedure b b.
we review a district court denial of a motion on the grounds of untimeliness for abuse of discretion.united states smith,cir.however,we review de novo snipes argument that rule c of the federal rules of criminal procedure supersedes the deadline contained in b.united states jackson,cir per curiam.
the proper venue for the crime of willfully failing to file an individual federal income tax return,in violation of,is either the federal judicial district in which the defendant resided at the time of the offense or the judicial district of the designated service center.united states calhoun,cir title,b provides that a defendant facing a failure to file charge 
may upon motion filed in the district in which the prosecution is begun,elect to be tried in the district in which he was residing at the time the alleged offense was committed provided,that the motion is filed within twenty days after arraignment of the defendant upon indictment or information.
congress placed particular emphasis on the deadline,underlining the limiting word provided in the text of the statute.the deadline was specified i n order to prevent dilatory transfers by defendants,at,reprinted in.
in the first place,c ourts in applying criminal laws generally must follow the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statutory language.united states albertini.section b statutory deadline for an elective transfer is unambiguous and unqualified.see abrams mcgohey,cir per curiam.the supreme court has strictly construed clear statutory deadlines limiting periods for filing motions in criminal cases,holding that there is simply no room in the text of more general criminal rules to supersede congress clear directions in criminal statutes.see carlisle united states.unlike deadlines derived only from court rules,statutory deadlines that achieve a broader goal are more absolute.see john sand gravel united states.the unmistakeable statutory deadline in b can not be waived by a general extension of the motions deadline under rule c.the language employed by congress is fatal to this claim.
we add that w here there is no clear intention otherwise,a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one,regardless of the priority of enactment.morton mancari.plainly,congress showed no intention,clear or otherwise,that rule c would control the tax statute the rule of procedure never even mentions the crime of failure to file a federal income tax return.it merely affords the district court the discretion to set pretrial deadlines.section b,in sharp contrast,is specific to the offense at hand and is a controlling exception to rule c discretion.see conart,hellmuth,obata kassabaum,cir.
indeed,construing rule c to supersede the command of congress embodied in b unambiguous deadline would repeal,by judicial fiat,an unambiguous provision found in a congressional enactment.because the general extension of the motions deadline could not have waived b clear deadline,the district court denial of the late elective transfer motion was not an abuse of discretion.
nor did the district court abuse its discretion by refusing to grant a waiver of the statutory deadline on the theory of excusable neglect under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure because snipes original attorney misunderstood the import of the statutory elective transfer deadline.c ounsel misunderstanding of the law can not constitute excusable neglect.corwin walt disney,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.
finally,it would not have been reasonable anyway to read snipes general request for an extension of time to file motions as a request to suspend the b transfer deadline.snipes putative motion for elective transfer would already have been two weeks late when his attorneys first requested an extension of time to file motions.the deadline for the b election expired on december,snipes motion for extension of time to file pretrial motions was not filed until january.indeed,snipes motion for extension of the pretrial motions deadline did not discuss the b venue election at all.in short,there is no indication that even snipes considered a b transfer election to be governed by the pretrial motions deadline at the time that he moved for the extension.
snipes also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not conducting a pretrial evidentiary,a bench venue.he says that a pretrial evidentiary hearing was essential because,if the choice of venue were improper,a jury sitting in the middle district of florida would be the wrong to decide the question.this claim purportedly has a constitutional dimension snipes submits that by denying a pretrial evidentiary hearing,the district court forced him to choose between presenting the best own this disputed fact and invoking his fifth amendment privilege against.
we review for abuse of discretion the district court denial of a pretrial motion for an evidentiary hearing to challenge venue.united states diaz,cir.however,we review snipes argument that the denial of a pretrial evidentiary hearing violated his fifth amendment rights de novo.united states brown,cir.
it is by now that venue is an essential element of the government proof at trial.q uestions of venue are not to be taken lightly or treated as mere technicalities united states white,cir.the constitution,the sixth amendment,and rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure guarantee defendants the right to be tried in the district in which the crime was committed.united states breitweiser,cir.
as with resolving other important elements contained in a charge,a jury must decide whether the venue was proper.see green united states,cir we hold that the trial court erred in failing to submit the question of venue to the jury.see also united states stickle,cir united states muhammad,cir.in this case,the grand jury returned a facially sufficient indictment,with a clear statement of venue.counts three through eight identified both snipes residence windermere,florida and the location of the crime the middle district of florida.an indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury,like an information drawn by the prosecutor,if valid on its face,is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits.costello united states,footnote omitted.
indeed,it would not have been proper for the district court to find the appropriate venue in a pretrial evidentiary hearing.under.b an indictment may be dismissed where there is an infirmity of law in the prosecution a court may not dismiss an indictment,however,on a determination of facts that should have been developed at trial.united states torkington,cir.to permit preliminary trials on essential facts,would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution,and would result in interminable delay but add nothing to the assurance of a fair trial.costello,at.
snipes argues,nevertheless,that under simmons united states,a pretrial hearing was necessary because a defendant can not be forced to cede his fifth amendment right against in order to enforce his right to testify about venue at trial.in simmons,the supreme court held that a defendant testimony in a fourth amendment pretrial suppression hearing can not be admitted in trial without violating the fifth amendment privilege against it was intolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another.id.at.
however,simmons has never been extended beyond its context.see in re federal grand jury proceedings,cir.only three years after the simmons decision,in mcgautha california,the supreme court itself questioned simmons rationale of the intolerable tension between constitutional rights,explaining that the application of this reasoning was open to question.mcgautha california,vacated in part on other grounds sub nom.crampton ohio.the supreme court observed that in many criminal contexts,such as choosing between forgoing testimony at trial or having one prior criminal acts disclosed,a defendant must make a choice between competing rights.id.at.the supreme court explained that even though a defendant may have a right,even of constitutional dimensions,to follow whichever course he chooses,the constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.the threshold question is whether compelling the election impairs to an appreciable extent any of the policies behind the rights involved.id.at.
snipes sixth amendment rights were not impaired in this case.unlike the fourth amendment right,protected by the exclusionary rule,the sixth amendment right to have venue proven as an element of the offense is safeguarded by integrating it into the trial.snipes had a constitutional right to have venue decided by the jury.it did just that.both parties presented evidence on venue at trial in great detail.moreover,the district court fully instructed the jury that venue is an element of the offense and that snipes must be acquitted if the government failed to establish venue by a preponderance of the evidence.there was no abuse of discretion in refusing to grant a novel pretrial,jury hearing to challenge the claimed venue found in a facially sufficient indictment 
snipes also claims that the district court abused its considerable discretion in declining to give an instruction on snipes purported good faith reliance on his fifth amendment privilege against.at trial,defense counsel argued that after agent lalli had read snipes his rights in may,snipes believed the right to remain silent allowed him to refuse to file his individual federal income tax returns.
a district court has broad discretion in formulating jury instructions.united states mintmire,cir.
in reviewing the denial of a requested jury instruction,we consider whether that instruction was a correct statement of the law was not adequately covered in the instructions given to the jury concerned an issue so substantive that its omission impaired the accused ability to present a defense and dealt with an issue properly before the jury.
united states lyons,cir.the government concedes that snipes proposed jury instruction was substantially correct.nevertheless,snipes assignment of error fails.
it is uncontested that willfulness is an important element of,cheek united states,and that a good faith claim of privilege against,although erroneous,is a defense to the element of willfulness.united states goetz,cir.t he word willfully in these statutes generally connotes a voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.united states bishop.see also united states morris,cir the standard for the statutory willfulness requirement is the voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.quoting cheek,at footnote omitted.
the district court instructions were adequate first because the issue of whether snipes asserted the fifth amendment privilege was not before the jury on the counts for which he was convicted.when special agent lalli read snipes his rights in may,snipes was already legally obligated to have filed his individual federal income tax returns for the calendar years,and.snipes was only convicted of willful failure to file individual federal income tax returns for these three years,contained in counts three,four,and five.the fifth amendment good faith in the subsequent may advice of not have been relevant to any of the charges of conviction.
moreover,the good faith and willfulness instructions that the district court delivered were altogether sufficient to cover the good faith reliance on the fifth amendment argument anyway.the court instructed the jury that good faith is a complete defense to the charges in the indictment.the court reinforced that snipes was under no burden of proving good faith it was the government duty to prove that he acted willfully.further,the court gave the jury snipes proposed language on intent,instructing that one who expresses an honestly held opinion or an honestly formed belief is not chargeable with fraudulent intent,even though the opinion is erroneous or the belief is mistaken.even though the district court did not specifically identify good faith reliance on the fifth amendment in the instruction,the good faith instruction was thorough and substantially covered snipes proposed instruction.contrast morris,at holding that it was error for the district court to refuse to give a general good faith jury instruction at all.
when the instructions omitted are substantially covered by other instructions which were delivered by the district court,there can be no reversible error.united states stone,cir.thus,for example,in united states pomponio,the supreme court affirmed convictions for willfully filing false income tax returns despite the judge refusal to give a good faith instruction the trial judge in the instant case adequately instructed the jury on willfulness.an additional instruction on good faith was unnecessary,per curiam.see also united states jordan,cir the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give the defendant good faith instructions because their concepts were substantially included in the instruction that the criminal act must be done knowingly or willfully.united states johnson,cir no reversible error in a district court refusal to give an instruction on the defendant good faith reliance on his constitutional rights because the jury was instructed both on willfulness and good faith united states mccarty,cir affirming tax conviction where judge gave general good faith and willfulness instructions,but did not instruct on a good faith reliance on constitutional rights.pomponio,jordan,and johnson are controlling here the instructions concerning general good faith,good faith reliance on counsel,and willfulness sufficiently addressed snipes argument that he relied in good faith on the fifth amendment 
finally,the omission of the instruction in no way impaired the accused ability to present a defense.lyons,at.the district court allowed snipes attorneys to thoroughly witnesses on the subject of snipes good faith reliance on the fifth amendment.and defense counsel squarely presented the argument to the jury in closing.contrast goetz,at holding that the court refusal to allow the defendant to present evidence of good faith was error in a prosecution.indeed,the defense was arguably successful the jury acquitted snipes of the willful charges for,and,the years that followed special agent lalli may advice of rights.
as for sentencing errors,snipes first claims that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to.according to snipes,section is invalid because it violates title j prescription that a misdemeanor be treated as a less serious offense creates unwarranted disparity in contravention of b b and is not the product of careful empirical evidence.
we review this legal claim de novo.united states ndiaye,cir.section j provides,t he commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense.j emphasis added.snipes argues that a misdemeanor offense is a less serious offense for which no offender should be awarded jail time.
section the sentencing guideline for willful failure to file returns directs the district court to calculate the offense level for the advisory guideline range with the use of the tax table that measures the tax loss and an assessment of specific offense characteristics.section embodies a change from sentencing practice.although under u nder practice,roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to probation without imprisonment,is intended to reduce disparity in sentencing for tax offenses and to somewhat increase average sentence length.comment.backg.
as for seriousness,snipes argument that conflicts with j misapprehends the structure of the sentencing guidelines.section works in concert with other sections of the guidelines to allow an award of probation to offenders who committed less serious offenses.principally,allows a district court to measure the tax loss and pin the offense level to that loss.the table found in assigns a modest offense level of to tax losses of or less and,not surprisingly,increases the offense level as the tax loss increases.thus,a defendant who caused a tax loss of more than or more would receive an offense level of.if the tax loss were not serious,a first time offender might well be assigned an offense level for which probation would be appropriate.similarly,allows the district court to assess the defendant criminal history less serious criminal histories mitigate reach.
this graduated penalty structure reflects the sentencing commission assessment that a greater tax loss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar characteristics,comment.backg.thus,the commission complied fully with j by ensuring that the tax offense guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment for first time offenders who have committed less serious crimes.j.if the defendant crime were not serious because the tax loss was minor and if his criminal history so warranted,the guidelines would advise a sentence of probation.in contrast,if the tax loss were high and thus more serious and harmful to the treasury,as it was in this case,the guidelines would advise a longer sentence.snipes merely disputes congress and the commission assessment of major tax losses as serious.we are unpersuaded.
snipes challenge to section on disparity grounds is also unsuccessful.snipes claims that b y treating misdemeanors the same as felonies,the tax guidelines violate b b.yet congress was concerned about the disparity of sentences among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct,not between misdemeanants and felons.id.the district court noted that misdemeanants who,like snipes,had willfully failed to file their personal income tax returns had engaged in similar behavior to the felons who had received similar sentences.the guideline does not create disparity of the kind that would violate b b.
finally,snipes claim that is not the product of careful empirical evidence is also incorrect.to begin with,the absence of empirical evidence is not an independent ground that compels the invalidation of a guideline.in kimbrough united states,the supreme court disapproved of the crack cocaine guideline in part because it was not based on empirical evidence,but the court did not invalidate the guideline.id.at.instead,the supreme court held that the lack of empirical evidence was one factor that a district court could consider in exercising its right to depart from the guidelines.id.at.the lack of empirical evidence would not require the wholesale invalidation of sentencing guidelines.
further,although snipes correctly notes that the revised guidelines reflect a change from sentencing procedures,comment.backg,that does not mean that the commission performed no empirical analysis when it increased sentences for tax offenses.according to the sentencing commission,
