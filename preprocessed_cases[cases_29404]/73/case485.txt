raymond beall and hazel beall the bealls appeal the dismissal,for want of subject matter jurisdiction,of their claim for a refund of the interest on income taxes paid to the,the united states.because we conclude,for the reasons set forth below,that the district court did possess jurisdiction to hear the bealls complaint,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand.
background 
on march,the bealls entered into a settlement agreement with the internal revenue service irs to resolve certain tax deficiencies arising from the bealls tax return and subsequent claim for refund following that settlement,the irs assessed additional income taxes,as well as interest on those taxes,against the bealls.after satisfying their outstanding tax liability,the bealls,on december,filed a claim for refund of the tax and interest charged against them.
the irs denied the bealls claim for refund,and on april,the bealls filed a supplemental claim for refund in which they claimed both that the interest on their assessed tax liability should have been netted against other years under d,and that a portion of that interest should have been abated under e.based on those refund claims,the bealls then commenced the present suit in federal district court on march.
the district court granted the government motion to dismiss,concluding,among other things,that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the denial of a request for interest abatement under section e of the internal revenue code the bealls now appeal the dismissal only of that part of their claim for refund based on e.

sovereign immunity 
as a threshold matter,we first address the government position that congress has not waived sovereign immunity so as to permit a plaintiff to sue in federal district court for a refund of unabated interest.see meyer,d sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature therefore,we must first decide whether immunity has been waived.without such a waiver,there can be no jurisdiction over the bealls refund claim in either the district court or in this court.united states mottaz,d when the united states consents to be sued,the terms of its waiver of sovereign immunity define the extent of the court jurisdiction.moore of agric.on behalf of farmers home,cir.
the bealls premised subject matter jurisdiction in the district court upon.section a provides for original jurisdiction in the district courts over claims for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws.we have stated,however,that section,standing alone,is insufficient to waive sovereign immunity.section is a general jurisdiction statute that does not constitute a separate waiver of sovereign immunity.shanbaum united states,cir.
the bealls complaint,however,references,among other provisions,section of the internal revenue code.in language that mirrors section,section provides for a civil action for refund of certain wrongfully collected taxes and although section does not waive sovereign immunity by itself,when coupled with a claim brought under section,section does provide the necessary waiver of immunity.see united states michel.shanbaum,at section operates in conjunction with to provide a waiver of sovereign immunity in tax refund suits when the taxpayer has fully paid the tax and filed an administrative claim for a refund.
the bealls have fully paid the tax and interest at issue,and have filed a claim for a refund with the irs.if their claim for a refund of unabated interest under e,therefore,is cognizable under section,then sovereign immunity presents no bar to the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.
the government claim of immunity thus requires us to address the compass of section with an eye to determining whether it can accommodate the bealls interest abatement claim.according to the government it can not,and a claim for abatement of interest,therefore,can not be brought as a claim for a refund under section.the language of the statute,however,is not susceptible to so limited a construction,and we decline to give it such.
section permits a claim for a refund not only for erroneously or illegally assessed taxes,but also for any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected.whether the bealls abatement claim is cognizable under section,thus requires the resolution of two questions whether the phrase any sum,includes unabated interest charged on income taxes owed and if so,whether the phrase excessive or wrongfully collected includes a sum of interest that the irs has refused to abate in accordance with we answer both questions in the affirmative,and conclude,therefore,that a claim for a refund of unabated interest is cognizable under section and is not barred by sovereign immunity.
the supreme court has long since indicated that the phrase any sum likely encompasses a claim for interest.thus in construing identical language in section,the court noted that any sum,instead of being related to any tax and any penalty,may refer to amounts which are neither taxes nor penalties,and that o ne obvious example of such a sum is interest.see flora united states,d.
a claim for abatement of interest,however,differs from the prototypical claim for refund of taxes and interest under section.the archetypal refund claim is a claim that the taxpayer never owed the underlying tax.see united states williams,d noting that section a displaced the remedy of assumpsit for money had and received,a remedy that afforded relief to taxpayers who had paid money they did not as a result of fraud,duress,or mistake see,your insurance needs agency,united states,cir addressing a refund claim for tax overpayments.a claim for the refund of interest that the taxpayer argues should have been abated,on the other hand,is not a claim to recover money that was paid but never owed,but is a claim that interest,otherwise legitimately assessed,could have been less had the irs not unreasonably delayed in the performance of a ministerial or managerial task.see e.
that a claim for abatement of interest is not identical to an action in assumpsit or a refund claim challenging the validity of the underlying tax,however,does not necessarily establish that an abatement claim can not be prosecuted under section.section is a statutory remedy,and is not confined to the limits of its ancestor.see,flora.at noting that since,an action for refund ceased to be regarded as a action,but rather as a statutory remedy which in its nature was a remedy against the government quoting curtis adm x fiedler,black.it is the language of section that must control,language that in referring broadly to any sum,would by its terms appear to accommodate a claim for the abatement of interest.
finally,we note that our decision in poretto usry,cir,supports the conclusion that section may accommodate a claim for the refund of unabated interest.in poretto,a taxpayer who had been penalized for failing to withhold excise taxes on behalf of his customers,brought an action,citing section,for the abatement of assessed taxes and penalties.id.at.although we affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer action for equitable relief,we noted that the taxpayer appropriate course of action would have been to pay the taxes and penalties,and then to challenge the tax through the normal pay and sue provisions of section.id.at.we read poretto,therefore,as supporting the proposition that a cause of action under section encompasses a claim for abatement of interest under section e.see also magnone united states.indicating that a claim under e could have proceeded as a claim for a refund under section,had the plaintiffs complied with the payment requirements of that section.accordingly,we decline to restrict section as the government suggests,and instead find that the phrase any sum,thus unmoored from its origins,is copious enough to encompass a claim for refund of unabated interest.
having answered the first the phrase any sum includes unabated interest charged on income taxes the affirmative,we now turn to the second,and conclude that the phrase excessive or wrongfully collected includes interest charges that the irs abused its discretion in refusing to abate pursuant to e.
as we did above,in interpreting a statute,we look first to its plain language.see moore cain,cir.excessive is defined as exceeding the usual,proper,or normal.webster third new international dictionary emphasis added.see also oxford english dictionary ed.exceeding what is right,proportionate,or desirable immoderate,inordinate,extravagant.the question thus becomes whether the denial of a request for abatement of interest,where that denial amounts to an abuse of discretion,is either not proper,or results in the collection of a sum of interest that so exceeds the usual or normal as to be considered excessive.
an abuse of discretion necessarily occurs where an act can only be described as clearly improper.see,united states,cir equating an improper decision with an abuse of discretion.thus,where a refusal to abate interest amounts to an abuse of discretion,we may conclude that that refusal is improper,and the improperly unabated interest therefore excessive.in other words,any time that the secretary should commit an abuse of discretion in denying a request for an abatement,the secretary has assessed an improper,and therefore an excessive sum.thus we also answer in the affirmative our second the phrase excessive or wrongfully collected includes a sum of interest that the irs has improperly refused to abate in accordance with.
having determined that the phrase any sum includes a sum of unabated interest,and that the phrase excessive or wrongfully collected includes the denial of a request for abatement where that denial amounts to an abuse of discretion,we conclude that an interest abatement claim is cognizable under section,and that sovereign immunity over such claim is waived by operation of sections and.we therefore join our sister circuits in holding that a taxpayer cause of action,alleging that he paid excessive interest charges because the irs abused its discretion in refusing to abate interest pursuant to e,falls within the district court jurisdiction to decide cases regarding any sum alleged to have been excessive under the laws.selman united states,cir accord argabright united states,cir declining to review an interest abatement claim,but exercising subject matter jurisdiction over that claim horton homes,united states,cir same.
review of section e denials 
that the district court possessed the power to hear the bealls claim,however,merely begins our inquiry it does not establish whether the denial of the bealls request for abatement of interest is subject to judicial review.
under the administrative procedure act apa,final agency decisions are generally susceptible to judicial review.section a of the apa,however,proscribes review in two narrow situations,namely where statutes preclude judicial review or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.based on these limitations,each circuit to address the issue prior to determined that the decision to grant an abatement under section e was not subject to judicial review.see argabright,at selman,at horton homes,at.
proceeding from section of the apa,those circuits concluded that the permissive language of section e,as well as the absence in that section of any substantive standards by which a court might review an agency action,precluded judicial review.see argabright,at citing horton homes and selman.in further support of this position,each circuit also examined the legislative history of section,noting the absence of any substantive standards for review in the legislative history,as well as language in the house and senate reports noting that section e gives the irs the authority to abate interest but does not mandate that it do so.id.at.accordingly,all three ultimately agreed that the language,structure and legislative history of e indicate d that congress meant to commit the abatement of interest to the secretary discretion,and that section a barred judicial review.selman,at 
congress,however,has since amended section.as part of the passage in of the taxpayer bill of rights ii,see pub,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,congress approved a number of amendments to section that are relevant to our analysis of the present case.first,with respect to section e,congress added unreasonable to modify the words error or delay,and added or managerial act,where before only ministerial act had appeared.see id.at a.the current version of section e,therefore,now provides 
e abatement of interest attributable to unreasonable errors and delays by internal revenue service.
in the case of any assessment of interest on 
a any deficiency attributable in whole or in part to any unreasonable error or delay by an officer or employee of the internal revenue service acting in his official capacity in performing a ministerial or managerial act,
the secretary may abate the assessment of all or any part of such interest for any period.e.
second,congress provided for review in the tax court of the secretary decision to deny a request for the abatement of interest.see pub,stat.thus,the current section h provides,in part,that 
the tax court shall have jurisdiction over any action brought by a taxpayer who meets the requirements referred to in section c a ii to determine whether the secretary failure to abate interest under this section was an abuse of discretion,and may order an abatement,if such action is brought within days after the date of the mailing of the secretary final determination not to abate such interest.h.
the statutory landscape in which we address the bealls claim for interest abatement is thus substantially different from the one facing the horton homes,selman,and argabright courts.and though,were we to address today the same issue that faced those courts,we would most likely,and for the same reasons,conclude that judicial review of the secretary decision to deny an abatement request is barred,our decision now must be guided instead by the above amendments we can not merely adopt the reasoning of the horton homes line of cases,but must construe,as a matter of first impression,the effect of the changes to section.
having reviewed those changes,we find that in amending section,congress clearly expressed its intent that the decision to abate interest no longer rest entirely within the secretary discretion.see miller commissioner of internal revenue,cir recognizing that argabright holding that judicial review is not available for irs decisions pursuant to e has been undermined by subsequent legislation and,to that extent,is no longer good law.we need look no further for support for this conclusion than the simple addition of section h granting jurisdiction to the tax court to review that decision.indeed,the vesting of jurisdiction in the tax court to review interest abatement challenges can be given no meaning other than that the abatement decision is no longer committed solely to agency discretion.accordingly,we can not say that either section a of the apa,or the absence of manageable standards of review generally,any longer precludes judicial review of the denial of a request for the abatement of interest 
exclusive jurisdiction in the tax court 
having concluded that the decision to abate interest no longer rests entirely with the secretary,the question remains whether review of that decision is limited to the tax court,or whether review is also available in federal district court.thus,although both parties concede,as they must,that review of the secretary decision is now available in the tax court,the government maintains that the grant of jurisdiction in section h to the tax court is exclusive,and that the district court is,therefore,without power to hear a claim under section e.we do not agree.
unlike our conclusion that the secretary abatement decision is no longer discretionary,determining whether congress intended for the jurisdictional grant in section h to be exclusive requires us to delve further into the legislative history of section than merely noting the simple fact of section h enactment.
the house report accompanying the taxpayer bill of rights indicates that congress was aware of the horton homes line of cases.in describing the state of the law governing the review of interest abatement denials,the report notes that f ederal courts generally do not have the jurisdiction to review the irs failure to abate interest.see,at.from this statement,the government argues that because congress was aware that federal courts would not review the secretary decision under section e,the decision to grant jurisdiction only to the tax court must mean that congress chose not to extend jurisdiction to the district courts 
there are,however,a number of problems with the government argument.first,it ignores the basis for the decisions in the horton homes line of cases.those decisions denied review not because the district courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the taxpayers claims but because the then extant version of section e committed the decision to abate interest to agency discretion.see argabright,at selman,at horton homes,at.in other words,the federal district courts have always possessed jurisdiction over challenges brought to section e denials,they simply determined that the taxpayers had no substantive right whatever to a favorable exercise of the secretary discretion at least absent unfavorable exercise on an unconstitutional basis,horton homes at.as we concluded above,however,in amending section e and in enacting section h,congress indicated that such is no longer the case,and thereby removed any impediment to district court review of section e claims.
not only did congress remove the barrier to district court review recognized in the horton homes cases but congress nowhere stated in the amendments that the district courts did not have jurisdiction to review interest abatement denials.on the contrary,the house committee report clearly states that n o inference is intended as to whether under present law any court has jurisdiction to review irs failure to abate interest.see,at 
viewed against a proper reading of the horton homes cases,therefore,the government argument essentially becomes a claim that congress,in granting jurisdiction to the tax court to review interest abatement denials,impliedly repealed the district court existing jurisdiction to review the same.repeals by implication,however,are disfavored.see traynor turnage,d jackson stinnett,cir it is hornbook law that repeals by implication are not favored.quoting crawford fitting gibbons,d.and there is nothing in the grant of jurisdiction to the tax court in section h that would preclude review in federal district court.moreover,as observed above,the house report clearly noted that congress grant of jurisdiction was not to be read as a statement regarding the existence vel non of jurisdiction in the district courts indeed,rather than reading the grant of jurisdiction to the tax court as implying the absence of jurisdiction in the district court,the more natural interpretation of section h is that congress simply chose to extend concurrent jurisdiction to the tax court over a certain class of claims 
we also find persuasive the bealls argument that reading the grant of jurisdiction to the tax court as exclusive of jurisdiction in the federal district courts,would be inconsistent with the general structure of the internal revenue code and the jurisdictional limitations of the tax court.
though the federal district courts have jurisdiction generally over suits for the refund of taxes,see,that jurisdiction is available only where the taxpayer first pays the entire amount of the disputed tax.see flora united states,d.the board of tax appeals,the predecessor of the tax court,on the other hand,was established by congress to relieve taxpayers of the burdens of and to permit them to obtain a determination of their tax liability before paying any deficiency.id.at,accordingly,the tax court,as a statutory court of limited jurisdiction,possesses only such power to adjudicate controversies as is conferred upon it by the internal revenue code.continental equities,commissioner,cir.it does not have the authority to order that a refund be given,or to review the commissioner denial of a refund claim.id.and a specific grant of jurisdiction,such as section h,is thus necessary for the tax court to exercise any jurisdiction.
the same is not true of the district court refund jurisdiction.having removed the impediment to district court review identified in horton homes by indicating that the irs decisions on requested interest abatement were not merely matters of administrative grace and that denials were subject to substantive challenge,it was not necessary for congress to provide for a specific grant of jurisdiction to hear abatement denials.to read a grant of jurisdiction to the tax court to hear an interest abatement claim,as exclusive would be to read too much into section h.
finally,we note that to deny district court jurisdiction to hear claims under section e would result in two anomalies.first,only certain taxpayers,namely those who meet the net worth requirements found in section h,would be able to seek judicial review of the irs failure to abate interest.those taxpayers whose net worth exceeds the limits found in section h,would be left entirely without recourse.second,denying district courts the power to hear claims under section e would force certain plaintiffs to split their abatement claims from their refund claims,and force them to seek relief in two courts.thus,a plaintiff who chose to pay his tax liability first and sue in district court under,would not be able to bring,at the same time,a challenge to the irs failure to abate interest already collected.instead,that taxpayer would have to sever his interest abatement claim from his refund claim and pursue the abatement claim separately in the tax court.such splitting of claims is generally considered undesirable,see,in re super van,cir discussing rule against,and we can not conclude,absent some indication to the contrary,that congress would have intended such a result.
for these reasons,we can not conclude that the grant of jurisdiction to the tax court in section h was meant to preclude the exercise of district court jurisdiction over interest abatement claims.
ministerial or managerial act 
finally,the government argues that even if the district court erred in dismissing the bealls complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,dismissal was nevertheless warranted as the interest at issue did not accrue as a result of any irs error or delay in performing a ministerial act.
the district court,however,dismissed the bealls complaint without addressing this issue.and because we conclude that this issue is best addressed in the first instance in the district court,we decline to address it here.
conclusion 
after examining the legislative history of e and h,we can not conclude that congress meant for the tax court jurisdiction to hear section e claims to be exclusive.nor can we conclude that sovereign immunity operates to bar relief in the district courts for a claim for the abatement of interest brought under section.
for these reasons,we find that the district court did have jurisdiction to hear the bealls claim for interest abatement.we accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
