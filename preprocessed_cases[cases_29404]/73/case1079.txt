pro se plaintiff steven dunmore sued the internal revenue service irs,or government in district court seeking,inter alia,refunds for his alleged overpayments of taxes.the irs contended that the bankruptcy estate,and not dunmore,owned the unscheduled claims following dunmore bankruptcy.pursuant to the parties stipulation,the district court transferred the matter to the bankruptcy court to permit the bankruptcy trustee to administer,and possibly abandon,the refund claims.the trustee abandoned the claims.the bankruptcy court then denied dunmore request to transfer his action back to the district court for further proceedings,concluding that his case was a core proceeding and that it had authority to decide the matter.it subsequently dismissed his case for failure to prosecute the case in the bankruptcy forum.dunmore appealed the bankruptcy court dismissal,but the district court affirmed.
we conclude that,although the bankruptcy court had related to jurisdiction over dunmore tax refund claims,those claims constituted proceedings.in view of this conclusion,the district court abused its discretion when it affirmed the bankruptcy court final order dismissing dunmore case for failure to prosecute.dunmore had not consented to a jury trial for his proceedings in the bankruptcy court forum.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
facts and proceedings below 
in,dunmore administratively sought refunds from the irs of three alleged tax overpayments made during and.while awaiting an irs decision on these refund claims,dunmore consulted with his tax attorney to determine whether he should list these refund claims as assets on a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition he was preparing.his attorney advised him that litigating the refund claims would be expensive and that,in view of the cost,it did not matter whether dunmore scheduled the claims the bankruptcy trustee likely would be unwilling to spend the money to litigate the matter,and dunmore could not afford to litigate them himself.dunmore then chose to omit the refund claims from his september bankruptcy petition.on october,dunmore received formal notice that the irs had disallowed the refund claims.around that same date,the irs also notified dunmore of an alleged tax deficiency for the tax year.
in february,the bankruptcy court granted dunmore chapter bankruptcy petition and discharged his debt.soon thereafter,the irs notified dunmore of additional alleged tax deficiencies for the,and tax years that,together with the alleged tax year deficiency,would offset any tax refund dunmore might recover.
on october,within two years of the date of the formal irs disallowance of his refund claims,dunmore timely filed his original complaint seeking a tax refund.a.he subsequently amended his complaint in april and filed a demand for a jury trial in may.his amended complaint alleged six causes of action three tax refund claims for overpayment of taxes to the irs during tax years a claim that the irs violated the bankruptcy court discharge injunction a quiet title action against irs tax liens and a request for a permanent injunction against the irs.
in late september,almost a year after dunmore filed his original complaint,the government raised for the first time its concern that dunmore lacked prudential standing to pursue the three tax refund claims in federal court dunmore,the government argued,had denied the bankruptcy trustee an opportunity to administer the refund claims when he failed to schedule them on his bankruptcy petition as assets potentially available to satisfy his creditors.the government contended that,as a result of dunmore failure to schedule these assets,the unadministered refund claims now belonged to the bankruptcy estate by operation of the bankruptcy code,d.accordingly,dunmore lacked prudential standing to pursue the estate refund claims.
the government urged the district court to dismiss dunmore complaint for lack of standing,without prejudice to refiling.in making this request,the government knew that the limitations period on the refund claims had since expired and that dunmore would be on refiling.aware of his dilemma,dunmore pleaded with the district court not to dismiss his case.as an alternative,he proposed that the district court sit in its original bankruptcy jurisdiction so as to permit him to reopen his bankruptcy case without refiling in the bankruptcy court and then seek the trustee abandonment,or relinquishment,of the estate refund claims to him.that approach would avoid dismissal and the attendant difficulty of his refund claims possibly being on refiling.
instead,judge patel proposed transferring dunmore case to the bankruptcy court so as to permit dunmore to seek the trustee abandonment of the claims.she allowed that,following the trustee abandonment of any of the claims,dunmore could reopen his case in the district court.the government stipulated to the transfer,and dunmore acquiesced to the dismissal of his complaint claims to quiet title relief and a permanent injunction against the irs.judge patel then approved the parties agreement and transferred dunmore case to the bankruptcy court.
in the bankruptcy court,dunmore secured the abandonment of the three tax refund claims.in a february proceeding,the bankruptcy trustee expressed no interest in pursuing the estate refund claims,considering them to be frivolous.the bankruptcy court then ordered the trustee to abandon the claims to dunmore.it concluded that the trustee cured dunmore lack of standing to pursue the refund claims when the trustee abandoned the claims to dunmore.
although this abandonment fulfilled the limited purpose initially motivating judge patel transfer of the case to the bankruptcy court,dunmore case remained in the bankruptcy court and the parties proceeded with the case to trial.
in june,dunmore failed to attend a status conference that the bankruptcy court had twice continued during the previous six months.the court neither dismissed the case nor sanctioned dunmore at that time,but issued a pretrial order that scheduled october,as a date certain for a bench trial in the bankruptcy court,and set dates for the completion of discovery and the exchange of documents.
six days prior to the scheduled bankruptcy trial date,dunmore,for the first time represented by counsel,moved the court to transfer the case back to the district court.he alleged that the bankruptcy court lost jurisdiction to hear his claims once the trustee abandoned the refund claims.in response,the irs moved to dismiss dunmore complaint on account of his failure at that point to comply with the bankruptcy court pretrial order.
on the scheduled trial date,dunmore admitted he was not prepared to proceed with trial in the bankruptcy court.during the hearing,the bankruptcy court concluded that it had core jurisdiction over dunmore allegation that the irs had violated the bankruptcy court discharge injunction.in response,dunmore voluntarily dismissed that claim,leaving only his three refund claims.the bankruptcy court then issued a final order dismissing his refund claims with prejudice for failure to prosecute.dunmore appealed to the district court,and judge walker affirmed.

discussion 
whether dunmore had standing to pursue his refund claims 
as a preliminary matter and alternative basis for affirming the district court,the government questions dunmore standing to pursue his tax refund claims.to assert constitutional standing in this case,dunmore must have suffered an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the united states and that a favorable court decision could likely redress.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.we conclude that dunmore has constitutional standing.his complaint alleges an injury in fact,the overpayment of federal income taxes,that is fairly traceable to the irs refusal to refund the sums purportedly due dunmore,and is redressable by the court if it were to award dunmore his asserted refund.
beyond this irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,id.at,we additionally require as a prudential matter that dunmore assert his own legal interests as the real party in interest,warth seldin,d.under this standard,dunmore lacked prudential standing when he filed his action.the bankruptcy estate,and not dunmore,was the real party in interest at that time.dunmore,as a debtor seeking bankruptcy relief,had a duty to carefully schedule his assets,including his tax refund claims,on his bankruptcy petition.cusano klein,cir.dunmore,however,breached this duty when he chose not to schedule his claims against the irs on his chapter petition.by operation of statute,assets that dunmore failed to schedule remained the bankruptcy estate property,even after the court discharged his debt.c,d.thus,the unscheduled tax refund claims remained the estate property.accordingly,we conclude that the bankruptcy estate was the real party plaintiff in interest at the time dunmore filed his action 
that dunmore lacked prudential standing when he filed his complaint does not end our preliminary standing inquiry.dunmore may have cured this standing defect.federal rule of civil procedure a permits dunmore to obtain the real party in interest ratification to proceed with the refund causes of action.rule a enables dunmore to avoid being dismissed for failing to be the real party in interest when he filed his complaint and being upon refiling.provided dunmore decision to sue in his own name was an understandable mistake,the real party in interest ratification relates back to the october,filing date of the complaint.united states cma,cir note of advisory committee on amendment to.
here,the bankruptcy estate was the real party in interest because it owned the refund claims when dunmore filed his october complaint.we assume without deciding that when the bankruptcy trustee abandoned the refund claims in february,the abandonment could constitute the estate ratification of dunmore lawsuit.this ratification would have the same effect as if the estate itself had originally commenced the action,so long as dunmore decision to sue in his own name represented an understandable mistake and not a strategic decision.see,wieburg gte,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,finding plaintiff did not make an understandable mistake where she sued in her own name after having concealed her discrimination claims from the bankruptcy trustee,aff without opinion.cir during oral argument,the government explained that whether dunmore decision to sue in his own name was an understandable mistake remained an open question because the bankruptcy court never made any factual findings on the issue.
we can not conclude on the present record whether dunmore may have recourse to rule a to cure his prudential standing defect because of any understandable mistake.accordingly,we will remand to the district court for appropriate further factual findings.because the district court and bankruptcy court dismissed this case on grounds,we address below the jurisdictional issues in the event that the court concludes on remand that dunmore cured his standing defect.
whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction 
assuming dunmore had prudential standing,we must resolve whether the bankruptcy court properly exercised jurisdiction over this case.in deciding this question,we first ask whether federal jurisdiction would exist in the district court over dunmore case in order to determine whether the bankruptcy court could have jurisdiction derivatively.fietz great sav.in re fietz,cir.the district court has original jurisdiction over all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title,b,but may refer any case or proceeding related to a case under title to the bankruptcy court for the district,a.dunmore tax refund action related to his bankruptcy case if the outcome of the proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.fietz,at quoting pacor,higgins,cir original emphases omitted.
the district court had original bankruptcy related to jurisdiction over dunmore case.as of october,the date that dunmore filed his complaint,the trustee had not yet abandoned the refund claims they remained the bankruptcy estate property until february.thus,dunmore complaint necessarily implicated the bankruptcy estate assets.because we determine jurisdiction as of the complaint filing date,dunmore lawsuit related to assets of the bankruptcy estate at the time relevant to our jurisdictional inquiry.id.at.
having determined that the district court had jurisdiction,we next examine whether the bankruptcy court derivatively had jurisdiction over dunmore case and exercised only those powers constitutionally available to it under.id.at.in northern pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,d,the supreme court entertained a constitutional challenge to the creation of article i bankruptcy courts pursuant to the bankruptcy act of.the court held that the act violated article iii by conferring judicial power on bankruptcy judges who lacked life tenure and protection against salary diminution.id.at.the act did not merely create the bankruptcy courts as adjuncts to the district courts,the court reasoned,because they were not subject to sufficient control by an article iii district court.the adjunct functions were not limited in such a way that an article iii court retained the essential attributes of judicial power,id.at,because the bankruptcy courts could issue binding and enforceable final judgments,id.at.
in response,congress amended the bankruptcy code in,providing the bankruptcy court with two tiers of judicial authority,depending upon whether the proceeding before it was core or.this distinction forms the linchpin for bankruptcy court adjudication under the amended act.in core proceedings,the bankruptcy court may hear,determine,and enter final orders and judgments.b.acting as appellate courts,the district courts and the courts of appeal review the bankruptcy court decisions in core matters.in contrast,in proceedings,the bankruptcy court is limited to hearing the matter and submitting proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.the district court reviews de novo any finding or conclusion objected to and enters a final order and judgment.see c.if the parties consent,the district court may expand the bankruptcy court power to adjudicate proceedings to include the power to issue final orders and judgments.see c.the distinction segregates those proceedings that an article i legislative court may hear and decide by a final order from those that an article iii court must subject to review as orders.
