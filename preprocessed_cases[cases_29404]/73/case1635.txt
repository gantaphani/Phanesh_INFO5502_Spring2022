this appeal concerns the valuation of oil and gas mineral property interests for the purpose of determining ad valorem taxes.appellant,california minerals,a texas limited partnership california minerals,challenges the enrolled base year value of mineral rights it purchased in nonproducing property.this interest was assessed at the purchase price allocated to that acreage.according to california minerals,this value should be zero because proved oil and gas reserves,as defined by the applicable state board of equalization sbe rule,have not yet been established.
as discussed below,the taxable value of a real property interest is presumptively the purchase price.california minerals had the burden of establishing a different value by a preponderance of the evidence and failed to do so.accordingly,the judgment in favor of respondent,county of kern county,on california minerals complaint for refund of taxes will be affirmed.
background 
in,peter paul petroleum company peter paul purchased the mineral rights in certain properties located in california counties from chevron,chevron.this interest included all rights,privileges,benefits and powers conferred upon the holder of such mineral rights but excluded the right to use the surface for open pit mining,quarrying,strip mining.the parties expressly agreed that the assets did not include any surface rights,other than rights of surface access for the purpose of exploring for,developing,producing,transporting and selling minerals from the property.personal property or fixtures associated with the property,well bores,water,and any existing oil,gas or mineral production from the property were also excluded.the purchase price was million for this mineral interest in approximately acres.
when peter paul acquired the mineral rights,there was no engineering or geologic data to support the recovery of any oil and gas reserves from the property.the purchase price was determined by using a monte carlo probability analysis based on information from analog fields located in kings and fresno counties.there was no evidence of proved reserves,but rather only a probability that reserves existed.peter paul considered the overall purchase price to be a fair market value for the rights acquired.
the sale agreement allocated of the purchase price to the kern county parcels on a per acre basis.this allocation was made without regard to the possible minerals under those parcels.
peter paul assigned its rights under the agreement to california minerals,one of its subsidiaries.california minerals leases potential oil and gas properties to exploration and development companies.
california minerals submitted a preliminary change of ownership report to the kern county assessor assessor describing the kern county property interest as nonproducing minerals purchased for.the assessor enrolled the base year value of the property at the purchase price under revenue and taxation code section the purchase price is rebuttably presumed to be the fair market value.the assessor did not apply sbe rule,tit,pertaining to the valuation of oil and gas producing properties.the assessor took the position that rule only applied to properties that were currently producing oil and gas.
california minerals filed an application for changed assessment based on its claim that the base year value was incorrect.according to california minerals,rule applied and,since there were no proved reserves,there was no assessable value.
following an evidentiary hearing,the assessment appeals board aab denied california minerals application.the aab found that the kern county purchase price had been fairly allocated based on relative market value and was entitled to the section purchase price presumption.the aab further concluded that california minerals had neither shown this presumption to be inapplicable to the subject properties nor rebutted the presumption.the aab noted that california minerals had not offered competent evidence establishing some other lower or higher fair market value.
california minerals also filed applications for changed assessments for the tax years through.pursuant to stipulation,these appeals were denied without any further proceedings.
california minerals paid all property taxes levied and filed a claim for refund with the county.the claim was denied and california minerals filed the underlying action for refund in the superior court.
the trial court ruled that the aab interpretation of section and the applicable sbe rules was correct.the court summarized its ruling as follows 
briefly stated,the statutory and regulatory scheme requires the assessor to adopt the purchase price as the presumed assessed value in the absence of evidence to choose another value as long as it meets the tests of fair market value freely acting,knowledgeable parties negotiating at arms length,etc.a taxpayer may rebut this presumption by the production of a preponderance of competent evidence of another value.sbe rules and do not exempt oil and gas or other mineral interests from this presumption nor substitute a scheme of taxation only for proven reserves.those rules merely allocate the proper value in the year of acquisition between various kinds of proven mineral reserves,and the balance of the value represented by other portions of the bundle of rights acquired.in subsequent years,the rules direct the assessor to adjust the proven reserves portion of the taxable value based on new information.it is possible such information in subsequent years could also affect the assessment of the remaining value if it shows other parts of the bundle of rights originally acquired are changed.
california minerals challenges this ruling on several grounds.first,california minerals argues that the valuation should be based only on oil and gas exploration and development,the highest and best use of the property.california minerals further contends that it rebutted the purchase price presumption because the undisputed evidence demonstrates that it purchased no rule proved reserves.according to california minerals,this should have been sufficient to establish that there was no assessable base year value for the speculative interests that it acquired.
discussion 
standard of review.
in reviewing a property tax assessment,the court must presume the assessor properly performed his or her duty and that the assessment was both regularly and correctly made.texaco producing,county of kern th,d.the burden is on the taxpayer to prove the property was improperly assessed.ibid.
when the taxpayer claims a valid valuation method was improperly applied,the court may overturn the assessment appeals board decision only if there is no substantial evidence in the administrative record to support it.maples kern county assessment appeals bd.th,d.however,if the taxpayer challenges the validity of the valuation method itself,the court is faced with a question of law.ibid.
the parties disagree on the correct standard of review for this case.california minerals contends that,because its appeal challenges the validity of the method used to assess the mineral rights and the proper interpretation and application of several cases,statutes and regulations,it is subject to independent review.in contrast,the county argues that the question before this court is simply whether the result reached was correct and thus the aab decision must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.
as noted by the trial court,at issue in this matter is the interplay of the statutory purchase price presumption and the sbe rules.such an analysis,the interpretation of a statute and regulations,is a question of law.shell western e p,county of lake d.further,the material facts are not in dispute.in such a situation,what might otherwise appear to be a factual challenge,and therefore subject to substantial evidence review,is actually a legal challenge.maples kern county assessment appeals,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the appeal is subject to our independent review.
the absence of proved reserves does not in itself rebut the purchase price presumption.
appraisal of oil and gas property.
california constitution,article xiii,section,provides that all property is taxable and shall be assessed at the same percentage of fair market value.fair market value or full cash value is the appraised value of real property when purchased,newly constructed,or a change in ownership has occurred after the assessment.cal,art.xiiia,subd.a.
the full cash value or fair market value of real property is the purchase price paid in the transaction unless it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the real property would not have transferred for that purchase price in an open market transaction,subd.b.the purchase price is rebuttably presumed to be the full cash value or fair market value if the terms of the transaction were negotiated at arms length between a knowledgeable transferor and transferee neither of which could take advantage of the exigencies of the other.ibid.in other words,the purchase price establishes a presumptive fair market value and the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish a different fair market value.maples kern county assessment appeals bd.th,d.
a land owner does not have title to the oil and gas that may underlie the property.lynch state bd.of equalization d.rather,the land owner has the exclusive right to drill for oil and gas and to retain all substances brought to the surface.ibid.this right to remove oil and gas from the ground is a taxable real property interest.id.at.however,due to the unique nature of this property interest,valuation is especially difficult.ibid.
before the voters adopted california constitution,article xiiia in,as proposition,tax assessors could reappraise oil and gas fields annually.maples kern county assessment appeals,supra,th at,d.as reserves were discovered and brought into production,the fields were reappraised to capture the new value on the tax rolls.ibid.
however,under proposition,annual reappraisals of real property are not permitted.rather,a base year value must be established that can then be increased by no more than two percent annually unless the property is sold or there is new construction on the property.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d.accordingly,in order to fit the intrinsically unknown value of oil and gas reserves into the base year value requirement,without forfeiting the ability to tax such property by freezing the base year value of new or unexplored oil and gas fields at zero,the taxing authorities needed to reconsider the appraisal technique for oil and gas property.maples kern county assessment appeals,supra,th at,d.
in the wake of proposition,the sbe adopted rule to establish valuation principles for the taxation of oil and gas interests.exxon mobil county of santa barbara th,d.this rule uses an appraisal unit valuation consisting of four components proved reserves wells,casings,and parts thereof land other than mineral interests and improvements.citation.ibid.it contemplates that the base year value of the nonpetroleum interest is fixed in accordance with proposition,but that the petroleum interest is subject to revaluation based on changes in proved reserves.maples kern county assessment appeals,supra,th at,d.
rule,subdivision b,provides that the market value of an oil and gas mineral property interest is determined by estimating the value of the volumes of proved reserves.proved reserves are those reserves that geological and engineering information indicate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future,taking into account reasonably projected physical and economic operating conditions.
the principles and procedures for establishing the base year value of the property are set forth in rule,subdivision c.this subdivision notes that the unique nature of oil and gas property interests requires the application of specialized appraisal techniques designed to satisfy the requirements of article xiii,section,and article xiii a,section,of the california constitution.however,this subdivision does not refer to proved reserves.rather,it uses the terms reserves,mineral reserves,and taxable reserves.
under rule,subdivision c 
a base year value market value of the property shall be estimated as of the lien date or as of the date a change in ownership occurs subsequent to lien date.newly constructed improvements and additions in reserves shall be valued as of the lien date of the year for which the roll is being prepared base year values shall be determined using factual market data such as prices and expenses ordinarily considered by knowledgeable and informed persons engaged in the operation,buying and selling of oil,gas and other properties and the production therefrom.once determined,a base year value may be increased no more than two percent per year.
however,the base year reserve values must be adjusted annually.these adjustments compensate for the value of depleted reserves and the additions to reserves established in a given year by discovery,construction of improvements,or changes in economic conditions.rule,subds.c and.
subdivision c provides for the valuation of land other than mineral reserves and improvements.these values remain at their factored base year value except when the market value of the appraisal unit,land,improvements and reserves,is less than the current taxable value base of the same unit.rule,subd.c.
as noted above,when california minerals acquired the kern county property interest there was no engineering or geologic data to support the recovery of any oil and gas reserves from the property,there was no evidence of proved reserves.rather,information from analog fields located in kings and fresno counties was used to determine the purchase price.based on this absence of evidence,california minerals contends that the base year value of its acquisition should be zero.
however,under section,subdivision b,the approximately million purchase price established the presumptive fair market value for the kern county property interest.accordingly,the burden was on california minerals to prove a different fair market value.as noted above,the aab and the trial court concluded that california minerals did not meet this burden.therefore,the pivotal issue on appeal is whether,as a matter of law,california minerals provided sufficient evidence to establish its claim that the base year value of the kern county mineral interest is zero.
oil and gas production is the highest and best use of the property.
california minerals purchased all subsurface minerals,including oil and gas,and the right of surface access for the purpose of exploring for,developing,producing,transporting and selling such minerals.nevertheless,california minerals analysis begins with the argument that the valuation method for its mineral interest must be limited to the rules for oil and gas producing properties,rule.according to california minerals,this is the highest and best use of the property in that the exploration and development of minerals other than oil and gas is neither likely nor financially probable.
real property appraisals must be based on the most productive,or highest and best use of the property.assessors handbook.the assessor appraiser concluded,based on the evidence and review of the documents,that the buyers considered the exploration and development of oil and gas to be the most valuable aspect of the property rights.he testified that the highest and best use of the property was oil and gas production,not other mineral production.in fact,by excluding the right to use the surface for open pit mining,quarrying,and strip mining,the seller effectively precluded california minerals from extracting anything but oil and gas.thus,although california minerals purchased the right to all subsurface minerals,in actuality it only purchased the right to explore for,develop,and produce oil and gas.therefore,the aab and the trial court should not have considered the right to explore for subsurface minerals other than oil and gas.a use that is not reasonably probable should be excluded from the valuation.mcdonnell douglas county of los angeles d.
nevertheless,this conclusion does not affect the ultimate analysis of the case.the fair market value concept as expressed
