this case presents the question of whether a fee imposed on telephone lines by defendant city of union city the city to fund its emergency communication system is a special tax that must be approved by of the voters in the city.the trial court ruled it was a tax,and entered judgment against the city and in favor of the plaintiffs in this action for declaratory relief we affirm.
background 
the legislature enacted the assistance act et the warren act in.the warren act declared that the establishment of a uniform,statewide emergency number was a matter of statewide concern,and required every local public agency to establish and operate,or to be part of,a basic system that automatically connects a person dialing the digits to a public safety answering point.
in,the city established an emergency communication system response fee the fee city,ch.by adopting ordinance the ordinance.the fee was imposed on every person who maintains access to the communication system by subscribing to local telephone service within the city of union city w ith respect to wireless telephone services,a person shall be construed to subscribe to local telephone service within the city of union city if he or she has a place of primary use,as such term is defined in the mobile telecommunications sourcing act,section,within the geographic boundaries of the city.city,ch,subd.the fee is paid on a flat rate,basis,in an amount established by city council resolution,subd.certain access lines are exempted from the fee,including telephones,nonprofit hospitals,and nonprofit educational organizations.the fee is collected from the telephone subscriber by the service supplier,which remits the revenues to the city,subd.the revenues collected are deposited into an emergency response fund,to be used only for the expenses of the communication system.they are never commingled with any other city funds.the fee was expected to recover percent of the operating,maintenance,and improvement costs for the city emergency communication system.after calculating the costs of the system the city distributed the cost among all access lines by dividing the cost by the estimated number of lines in the city,including those that were exempt from the fee.regular access lines are charged per month trunk the capacity of individual access charged per month and trunk the capacity of individual access charged per month.
the pertinent facts regarding the emergency communication system and the fee are largely undisputed.the city operates an emergency dispatch system available to persons dialing from a location within the city.before the ordinance went into effect,services were funded from the city general fund.in fiscal year,after the ordinance went into effect,services were funded from the general fund and from revenues obtained under the ordinance.funds from the ordinance were designed to finance improvements to and operation of the city enhanced communication system,which the ordinance provided would include selective routing,automatic number identification,automatic location identification,and wireless access.city,ch,subd.a,subd.
the city describes the system as a emergency communication response system that allows individuals located within union city dialing the digits,or designated police and fire emergency numbers,or city business phone lines,to gain direct access to an emergency communication center that provides emergency services dispatch.calls to a emergency line and to are handled by the same dispatchers in the same manner.however,the city enhanced system automatically provides the location and number identification for the caller.wireless calls are answered initially by the california highway patrol,which forwards those emergency calls needing a police response to the city police department emergency line.
over percent of households in the city have telephone service,and the city is unaware of anyone in the city who is not part of a household with an access line or of anyone who maintains a place of employment in the city without an access line.any person physically in the city has access to the emergency communication system.the city has not limited access to either the system or emergency services to those who are subject to the fee.telephone subscribers who are subject to the fee but have not paid it are not denied access to the system and emergency services.
plaintiffs brought this action for declaratory relief in june.they alleged in their first cause of action that the fee was an invalid tax in violation of california constitution,article xiii c,section proposition in their second cause of action that the fee was an illegal fee in violation of proposition in their third cause of action that it was an illegal special tax under section as to wireless phone subscribers and required voter approval under proposition and in their fourth cause of action that it was an illegal fee imposed on wireless subscribers.
plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication of the first cause of action,and the trial court granted the motion.the city made a for summary adjudication of the first,second,and third causes of action.the trial court denied the on the ground that the accompanying separate statement of undisputed material facts did not comply with california rules of court,rule at plaintiffs request,the court dismissed the remaining causes of action,and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs,declaring that the fee was a special tax under california law,and that it was void because it was enacted without a vote of the electorate in violation of california constitution,articles xiii a and xiii c.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
guiding legal principles 
proposition,passed by the voters in,added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.as pertinent here,proposition defines a special tax as any tax imposed for specific purposes,including a tax imposed for specific purposes,which is placed into a general fund cal,art.xiii c,subd.d,and provides that no local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless the electorate has approved it by a vote,subd.d.the proposition,entitled the right to vote on taxes act,included this statement of purpose the people of the state of california hereby find and declare that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.see historical notes,west ann.cal.const.supp.foll.art.xiii c,apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles cal th,d.barratt american,city of san diego th,d.section of proposition required that the provisions of the act be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.ballot,elect,text of,reprinted as historical notes,west ann.cal.const.supp.foll.art.xiii c,historical notes.
certain kinds of impositions for specific purposes,however,are treated not as special taxes subject to the voter approval requirements but as fees not subject to those requirements.whether an imposition is a tax or a fee is a question of law for the appellate court to decide on an independent review of the facts.sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th,d,sinclair california of scientists department of fish game th,d northwest energetic services,llc california franchise tax bd.th,d northwest energetic.
our supreme court in sinclair,supra,cal th at pages,d,discussed certain general guidelines used in determining whether taxes are involved in particular situations.as the court noted the cases recognize that tax has no fixed meaning,and that the distinction between taxes and fees is frequently blurred,taking on different meanings in different contexts.citations.in general,taxes are imposed for revenue purposes,rather than in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted.citations.most taxes are compulsory rather than imposed in response to a voluntary decision to develop or to seek other government benefits or privileges.citations.but compulsory fees may be deemed legitimate fees rather than taxes.citation.the special tax cases have involved three general categories of fees or assessments special assessments,based on the value of benefits conferred on property development fees,exacted in return for permits or other government privileges and regulatory fees,imposed under the police power.sinclair,at,d.in connection with the last category,the court in kern county farm bureau county of kern th,d kern county stated special taxes must be distinguished from regulatory fees imposed under the police power,which are not subject to the constitutional provision since they are not taxes at all.citation.special taxes do not encompass fees charged to particular individuals in connection with regulatory activities or services when those fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service or activity for which the fee is charged,and are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.see also collier city and county of san francisco th,d.
the courts have also recognized that certain user fees are not taxes.see isaac city of los angeles th,d isaac.in isaac,the court described user fees as those which are charged only to the person actually using the service the amount of the charge is generally related to the actual goods or services provided.thus,a user fee is payment for a specific commodity purchased.see also utility audit,city of los angeles th,d sewer service fees.
despite these classifications,a revenue measure may have attributes of more than one of the traditional revenue devices,and may be valid despite the measure hybrid nature.kern county,supra,th at,d.therefore,a local government may seek to justify a revenue device under alternative classifications.ibid.
the court in isaac made clear that regardless of the type of fee,it must bear some reasonable relation to the benefits and costs associated with the service a special assessment is based on the benefit to the specific property a development fee is not considered a special tax if it bears a reasonable relation to the development probable cost to the community and benefits derived from the community a regulatory fee is limited to the reasonable cost of the services necessary for the activity for which the fee is charged and for carrying out the purpose of the regulation and a user fee is charged to the person using the service and its amount is related to the goods and services actually provided.isaac,supra,th at,d.thus,in explaining the reasons that regulatory and development fees and special assessments are not regarded as special taxes,the court in evans city of san jose th,d evans,stated,with each of these cases,a discrete group receives a benefit for example,a permit to build or inspection of produce or a service for example,providing and administering a rental dispute mediation and arbitration hearing process or a permanent public improvement such as a local park or landscaped median islands on a local road which inures to the benefit of that discrete group.the public as a whole may be incidentally benefitted,but the discrete group is specially benefitted by the expenditure of these funds.citations.the public should not be required to finance an expenditure through taxation which benefits only a small segment of the population.
a tax,on the other hand,can be levied without reference to peculiar benefits to particular individuals or property.citations.indeed,n othing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure,and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied.knox city of orland cal th,d.
b.the fee is a special tax 
the principles discussed above lead us to conclude that the fee is a special tax,and as such is subject to proposition.as noted by the trial court,the parties essentially concede d that the charge does not fit into the category of a special assessment,a development fee,or a regulatory fee,and the issue was whether the fee was properly characterized as a user fee rather than a tax.in concluding the fee was a tax,the court pointed out that those who paid the fee received no benefit not received by those who did not pay and thus by the general public,thereby negating the distinguishing feature of a user fee.
on appeal,the city acknowledges that the fee does not fall neatly into any of the recognized categories of fees,stating the fee at issue here defies simple classification.the reason the fee defies such classification is that it does not share the essential characteristics of the assessments and fees that have been held not to be special taxes.most fundamentally,there is no discrete group that is specially benefitted by the imposition.see evans,supra,th at,d.the system benefits every inhabitant of the city,and in fact benefits anyone who is in the city when an emergency arises,whether or not an inhabitant and whether or not subject to the fee.the fee inures to the benefit of the public as a whole,not to any particular group within the public.see ibid.
furthermore,the fee is not charged for use of the system,but for access to the system,whether or not a resident ever places an emergency call.the access is to a system that is part of a governmental service.in enacting the warren act,the legislature declared that it was in the public interest to shorten the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid,that the establishment of a uniform emergency number was a matter of statewide concern,and that one of the purposes of the act was to encourage local governments to develop and improve emergency communication procedures and facilities so as to be able to respond quickly to emergency calls,subd.b.we see no principled distinction between an imposition charged simply for access to a governmental service that is equally available to the public as a whole and a special tax.
the city disagrees,arguing that the fee does not have the characteristics of a tax.according to the city,t he fee is voluntary,is paid by phone service subscribers in exchange for efficient access,and does not raise revenues for the city general fund.we have already rejected the argument that the fee is imposed in exchange for access to a governmental service and therefore is not a tax.and the fact that the fee does not raise revenues for the city general fund does not change our conclusion.the essence of a special tax is that its proceeds are earmarked or dedicated in some manner to a specific project or projects neecke city of mill valley th,d,and proposition definition of special taxes encompasses any tax imposed for specific purposes cal,art.xiii c,subd.d.although proposition specifies that a special tax includes a tax imposed for specific purposes even if the proceeds are placed into a general fund see howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d,it is not limited to such taxes but by its terms encompasses those placed into a separate fund.
finally,we also reject the city contention that the fee is not a special tax because it is voluntary.according to the city,the fee voluntary nature is shown by the fact the fee is compulsory for nonexempt individuals and businesses with telephone subject to the fee voluntarily consented to pay it when they chose to obtain telephone service.for this contention,the city relies on richmond shasta community services dist.cal th,d,richmond.there,our supreme court concluded that a capacity charge for new water service connections did not violate the restrictions on assessments of article xiii d of the california constitution and was consistent with proposition goal to enhance taxpayer consent,stating that presumably any costs imposed on customers receiving service through existing connections would be subject to proposition voter approval requirements,and that customers who apply for new connections give consent by the act of applying.richmond,at,d.
