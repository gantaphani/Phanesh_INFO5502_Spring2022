under proposition,real property may be reassessed at its current market value when ownership of the property changes.pacific southwest realty county of los angeles cal th,d,pacific southwest.in this appeal,we consider whether there is a change in ownership of real property held by a testamentary trust when an income beneficiary of the trust dies and is succeeded by another income beneficiary.the city and county of san francisco the city reassessed real property held by a trust after a new income beneficiary succeeded a beneficiary who died.the trustee filed suit and sought a property tax refund,arguing there was no change in ownership under revenue and taxation code section,which generally defines what constitutes a change in ownership for purposes of reassessing property the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city.we conclude there was a change in ownership under section because the beneficiary death caused a transfer of the property primary economic value to the successor beneficiary,who acquired a present beneficial interest in the property.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
in,francis executed a will providing for the creation of a testamentary trust upon his death containing all of his personal and real property.died in.under the terms of the will,grandniece,geraldine mcgovern,was entitled to receive all of the net income derived from the francis testamentary trust the trust for the remainder of her life.the trust assets included the real property at issue in the litigation,described as apartments located at buena vista east avenue in san francisco the property.
beginning in march,when the property was distributed to the trust,mcgovern was the trust sole present income beneficiary.the terms of will provided that upon mcgovern death,the trust would terminate and the entire remaining corpus of the trust would be distributed to mcgovern issue or survivors of her predeceased issue.however,the will also provided that,should mcgovern die without issue surviving her,then nephew,appellant dwight reilly identified as dwight in the will would become the income beneficiary of the trust for the duration of his life.
mcgovern died without issue in november.accordingly,reilly became the sole income beneficiary of the trust for the duration of his life upon mcgovern death.there was no or spousal relationship between mcgovern and reilly.upon reilly death,the trust will terminate and its assets will be distributed as provided in the will.reilly is not a beneficiary of the trust principal.
after mcgovern died,reilly succeeded her as trustee.we shall refer to reilly as trustee when he is acting in that capacity to avoid confusion about reilly status as beneficiary or trustee.the trust held legal title to the property continuously since march,and at no time prior to this appeal did the trustee transfer the property by way of deed or quitclaim to any other person or entity.the trustee reported that the trust sold the property during the pendency of this appeal.
the city assessor determined that a assessable change in ownership in the property occurred when reilly replaced mcgovern as the sole present income beneficiary of the trust.the assessor did not rely upon the fact that reilly succeeded mcgovern as trustee in determining that a change in ownership occurred.the property was reassessed,raising its assessed value from in tax year to in tax year.as a result of the reassessment,the trust paid at least more in property taxes through early than it otherwise would have.
reilly,in his capacity as trustee,appealed to the city assessment appeals board,challenging the determination that a change in ownership occurred following a hearing,the assessment appeals board upheld the assessor determination,concluding that the present beneficial interest in the property transferred to trust beneficiary reilly upon the death of the predecessor beneficiary,mcgovern.the trustee paid the disputed taxes owed and filed a claim for refund of taxes due with the san francisco board of supervisors,which took no action on the claim.
reilly,in his capacity as trustee,thereafter filed suit against the city,seeking a refund of taxes paid and declaratory relief.the trustee and the city entered in a joint stipulation of facts and also stipulated to the admissibility of relevant documents,including will and the written decision of the assessment appeals board.both parties filed motions for summary judgment on the stipulated facts.the trial court granted the city motion,denied the trustee motion,and entered judgment for the city.the trustee timely appealed from the judgment.

standard of review 
the interpretation and application of section is a question of law.we review de novo a determination that an assessable change in ownership occurred under section.shuwa investments county of los angeles th,d.
general principles governing change in ownership under proposition 
proposition generally provides that real property shall be taxed at an ad valorem rate not to exceed percent of its full cash value.cal,art.xiii a,subd.a.f ull cash value means the county assessor valuation of real property shown on the tax bill under full cash value or,thereafter,the appraised value of real property when purchased or newly constructed,or when a change in ownership has occurred after the assessment,subd.a,italics added.a property appraised value may be adjusted to account for inflation but any increase may not exceed percent per year,subd.b.
proposition did not define change in ownership.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.instead,it fell to the legislature to define the term.id.at,d.the main effort to create consistent and uniform guidelines to implement proposition undefined change in ownership provision was undertaken by a panel the panel work culminated in the report of the task force on property tax administration hereafter task force report,which was submitted to the assembly committee on revenue and taxation on january.ibid.the panel basic test was adopted verbatim and codified as section.in addition to the basic test in section,the panel identified common types of transfers and established concrete rules for them in sections and.ibid.section contains examples of transfers constituting a change in ownership,while section contains examples of transfers not constituting a change in ownership.see.the task force report stressed that the examples in sections and must be consistent with the overarching rule governing change in ownership contained in section.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.
section provides a change in ownership means a transfer of a present interest in real property,including the beneficial use thereof,the value of which is substantially equal to the fee interest.thus,three elements are required to effect a change in ownership a transfer of a present interest in real property a transfer of the property beneficial use and a transfer of value substantially equal to the fee interest.see pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.the general purpose of section,evident from its three subdivisions,is to ensure that it is the fee interest,or its equivalent value,that is generally subject to property taxation,and that tax reassessment follows the fee interest or its equivalent through various changes in ownership.auerbach assessment appeals bd.for the county of los angeles cal th,d,auerbach.
particularly relevant to our analysis are statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to real property held by trusts.the general rule is that the transfer of real property into a trust constitutes a change in ownership,tit,subd.a.similarly,the termination of a trust,or a portion of the trust,gives rise to a change in ownership of property held by the trust,subd.c.these general rules are subject to numerous exceptions.for example,a transfer of real property to a trust revocable by the trustor is not a change in ownership,subd.d,tit,subd.b.in addition,a transfer of real property to an irrevocable trust in which the trustor is the sole present beneficiary does not qualify as a change in ownership,subd.d,tit,subd.b a.however,a transfer of real property to an irrevocable trust constitutes a change in ownership if persons other than the trustor are present beneficiaries of the trust,unless an exclusion from change in ownership otherwise applies,tit,subd.b a.
the task force report explained the treatment of trusts in part as follows revocable living trusts are merely a substitute for a will.the gifts over to persons other than the trustor are contingent the trust can be revoked or those beneficiaries may predecease the trustor if the trust is revocable it is excluded because the rights conferred are contingent.if the trustor is the sole beneficiary during his lifetime,his retained interest is considered to be substantially equivalent in value to the fee interest in any real property covered by the trust.he is therefore the true owner and the change in ownership does not occur until the property passes to the remaindermen on the trustor death.task force report,supra,at.
the treatment under proposition of real property held by a trust derives from the principle of trust law that the creation of a trust divides legal title in the trustee,and equitable title in the beneficiaries.citations.allen sutter county bd.of equalization d.allen.for purposes of determining change in ownership,the relevant inquiry is who has the beneficial or equitable ownership of the property,not who holds legal title,tit,subd.a transfer of bare legal title is not change in ownership.thus,if there is a transfer of property to a trust in which the proportional interests of the beneficiaries remain the same before and after the transfer,there is no change in ownership,even though there is a change in legal title.see,tit,subd.b.
the question presented here is whether there is a change in ownership when one trust beneficiary succeeds another.the pertinent statutes do not answer the question.nevertheless,the regulations suggest that a change in trust beneficiaries triggers a change in ownership.for example,in the regulation establishing that the creation of a trust does not constitute a change in ownership when the beneficiary is the trustor or someone else entitled to an exclusion,the regulation also provides that there is a change in ownership to the extent that persons not entitled to an exclusion are or become present beneficiaries of the trust,tit,subd.b a,italics added.thus,the regulation provides that a change in ownership occurs not just when certain persons are present beneficiaries upon creation of a trust,but also when certain persons become present beneficiaries after a trust has been created.the inclusion of the words or become signals that the addition or substitution of present beneficiaries during the term of a trust may constitute a change in ownership.interpreting the regulation otherwise and limiting its application to present beneficiaries at the creation of a trust would render the words or become mere surplusage.see people hudson cal th,d,interpretation rendering statutory term surplusage to be avoided.the regulation addresses the situation in which a person not entitled to an exclusion from change in ownership becomes a present beneficiary in place of,or in addition to,a present beneficiary entitled to such an exclusion.it does not specifically address the situation presented here,when one beneficiary not entitled to an exclusion from change in ownership is succeeded by another such beneficiary.however,because the regulation rests on the concept that the addition or substitution of a beneficiary during the term of the trust constitutes a change in ownership unless an exclusion applies,this general principle would appear to govern the circumstances presented by our facts 
a treatise for tax practitioners underscores the importance of recent changes to the governing regulation reflecting that the succession of beneficiaries during the term of a trust may constitute a change in ownership.according to that treatise,t he state board of equalization has rewritten its rules relating to trusts probably the most significant change is the frequent reference to some one becoming a present beneficiary as a triggering event.ehrman flavin,taxing cal.property ed supp,fns.omitted.the treatise offers the following cautionary note a special topic survey by the state board of equalization issued in april indicates that practitioners not infrequently tell their clients that there is no change in ownership of trust property until a deed is recorded transferring title out of the trust.in fact,the change in ownership may be triggered by the death of one beneficiary and the succession of another beneficiary,without a termination of the trust,much less the recordation of a deed transferring title out of the name of the trust.ibid.
the trustee contends there was no change in ownership when reilly succeeded mcgovern as trust beneficiary because as an income beneficiary he did not possess rights typically associated with fee ownership of property,such as the right to possess and sell the property.we know of no reported decision addressing a situation similar to reilly,in which a successor beneficiary receives a lifetime interest in income generated by a property but not the right to possession.however,state board of equalization board property tax annotation,which reflects a board advice memorandum directed to the san diego county assessor,is directly on point.the annotation provides trusts.the creation of a life estate in property or in all of the income from that property constitutes a change in ownership unless a specific statutory exclusion applies.likewise,on the termination of the first life estate,a second life estate,whether in property or in all of the income it generates,may be created and constitute a change of ownership or not,again depending on the applicability of the various statutory exclusions.property taxes law guide property tax annotations,italics added.
the trustee disputes the applicability of the board annotation,claiming it is simply an attorney opinion as to the property tax implications in a specific and unique situation without the force or effect of law.the trustee claims the situation presented in the annotation is utterly unlike the one before this court,arguing that reilly is not entitled to income for life directly from the property but only receives net income from the trust,which may sell the property at any time.
our supreme court considered the deference accorded to the board annotations in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.an administrative agency rules,such as regulations enacted pursuant to powers delegated by the legislature,have the dignity of statutes.id.at,d.in reviewing the legality of a regulation,our inquiry is generally confined to whether the regulation is arbitrary,capricious,or without reasonable or rational basis.id.at,d.by contrast,the binding power of an agency interpretation of a statute or regulation is contextual its power to persuade is both circumstantial and dependent on the presence or absence of factors that support the merit of the interpretation.id.at,d.among other factors to consider in weighing the persuasive value of an agency interpretation are whether the agency is assumed to have pertinent expertise and technical knowledge,whether the agency interpretation is longstanding and consistently maintained,and whether the interpretation was reached after public notice and comment.id.at,d.
the board property tax annotation is not binding on this court,although the context in which it arose suggests it is entitled to some degree of weight.because there is no other annotation on the topic of which we are aware,the board interpretation appears to be consistent as well as since at least,when the board issued the memorandum underlying the annotation.further,while there may be areas of agency expertise more complex or technical than the determination of a property beneficial ownership,this much is clear because part of the board function is to assess the tax consequences resulting from the myriad ways in which property may be held,it has practical expertise this court lacks.with its expertise and background,the board is positioned to establish consistent rules regarding change in ownership.and,while it is true the annotation results from an advice memorandum arising out of a specific set of facts,we disagree with the trustee that the facts underlying the annotation are utterly unlike the facts here.we find no support for the distinction urged by the trustee that the annotation concerned a beneficiary who,unlike reilly,had a lifetime right to income directly from the property.rather,like reilly interest,the beneficiary interest was in the net income from the trust,which held title to the property.the analysis supporting the annotation does not turn on whether the trust was required to hold the property for the remainder of the beneficiary lifetime.indeed,because the trustee was empowered to invade the principal to support the beneficiary,it is reasonable to assume the trustee,like the trustee here,possessed the power to sell the property before the beneficiary died.
ultimately,even though the board annotation has some persuasive value,it is this court task to interpret section independently and determine whether the facts presented here give rise to a change in ownership.see yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we proceed to consider the test for change in ownership contained in section.
application of change in ownership test 
present interest 
the task force report explained the present interest requirement as an attempt to avoid treating contingent or future transfers as changes of ownership everyone would agree that the making of a will is not a change in ownership of the real property covered by the will,because during the testator life everything is contingent.he can change his will he can sell his property or the beneficiary can predecease him.there is no transfer of a present interest in the testator property.this element is necessary to protect a variety of contingent or inchoate transfers from unintended change in ownership treatment,including future interests,revocable transfers and transfers with retained life estates.task force report,supra,at.
reilly plainly acquired a present interest in the property upon mcgovern death in.because a change in ownership may occur by operation of law or through a trust,formal transfer of legal title was not required.see,tit.when reilly became the sole present income beneficiary of the trust,he became the property equitable owner.see allen,supra,d at.as such,he had the requisite present interest in the property for purposes of section.see generally id.at.
the trustee advances a number of arguments in support of his contention there was no transfer of a present interest in the property upon mcgovern death.first,he points out that the civil code defines a present interest in property as one that entitles the owner to its immediate possession.because reilly had no such right to possession,the trustee claims,he did not have a present interest in the property.we are not persuaded.
as a general rule,we may rely on the definition of a common law property term in the civil code unless it is inconsistent with the term usage in the revenue and taxation code.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at fn,d.the revenue and taxation code does not contain a definition of present interest.nevertheless,it is apparent that the focus of the task force in proposing a present interest requirement was to prevent the grant of a contingent or future interest in property from being treated as a present transfer giving rise to a reassessable change in ownership.see task force report,supra,at.nothing in the task force report or in subsequent case law construing section suggests that the right to immediate possession is a prerequisite to finding a change in ownership.moreover,our supreme court has found a change in ownership even in circumstances where a lessee is in possession of the property at the time of transfer and the new beneficial owner has no immediate right of possession.see auerbach,supra,cal th at,d,see also pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.because the civil code definition of present interest is inconsistent with that term usage in section,it is inapplicable in the reassessment context.
the trustee also argues that reilly was not the property sole equitable owner,contending that all trust beneficiaries,including mcgovern and reilly,became the property equitable owners upon creation of the trust.according to the trustee,reilly rights as an income beneficiary vested in,when the property was distributed to the trust.
the trustee argument is incorrect as a matter of basic property law.in,reilly had no present interest rather,in reilly acquired a future interest that was contingent on mcgovern dying without issue.once mcgovern died without issue,reilly interest vested and became a present interest.reilly interest in was precisely the type of contingent,inchoate interest that the task force report sought to exclude from treatment as a present interest giving rise to a change in ownership.
the trustee premises his argument in part on allen,supra,d.the trustee reliance on allen is misplaced.in allen,real property was placed in an irrevocable trust in.id.at.the beneficiaries were four grandchildren of the trustors.the trustee was directed to distribute to each beneficiary his or her share of the trust estate when the beneficiary reached the age of.in,the youngest beneficiary reached the age of and the trustee conveyed the trust property to the four beneficiaries as tenants in common.the assessor reassessed the property for the tax year,reasoning that the termination of the trust constituted a change in ownership.ibid.the court of appeal concluded that the change in ownership took place in,when the trust was created,because the four grandchildren became the equitable owners of the property at that time.id.at.there was no change in ownership in when the trust was terminated,because the beneficial ownership of the property remained the same before and after the termination of the trust.ibid.
contrary to the trustee contention,allen does not stand for the proposition that all current and future beneficiaries of a trust are considered the equitable owners of property held by the trust.in allen,the four grandchildren became the property beneficial owners when the trust was created because they were all present income beneficiaries at the trust inception.it is for this reason that the court in allen declared that b eneficial use of the property was transferred to the beneficiaries at the creation of the trust,and remained there.allen,supra,d at,fn.omitted.by contrast,reilly had no such present interest upon the creation of the trust.when the property was placed in the trust,its beneficial use transferred to the beneficiary,mcgovern,but not to future or contingent beneficiaries.
the trustee position is also inconsistent with the language of the governing regulation,which specifies that a change in ownership occurs with respect to property held by a trust when persons other than those entitled to an exclusion are or become present beneficiaries of the trust,tit,subd.b,italics added.for purposes of reassessing property held in trust,the analysis focuses on identifying the present beneficiary.treating all beneficiaries as equitable owners of trust property,irrespective of whether their interests are vested,contingent,present,or future,is incompatible with this approach.
beneficial use 
the second prong of section requires the transfer of a property beneficial use as a prerequisite to finding a change in ownership.see pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.the task force report explained beneficial use is necessary to protect custodianships,guardianships,trusteeships,security interests,and other fiduciary relationships from unintended change in ownership treatment.task force report,supra,at.thus,the focus is on the person or entity that enjoys the benefits of the property,not upon the fiduciary that holds title to property for the benefit of another.
the receipt of income generated by property qualifies as a beneficial use of the property possession is not required.see pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,d.in pacific southwest,our supreme court held
