background 
a dispute arose between ricoh,the owner of patent the patent directed to systems and processes for the design of integrated circuits and synopsys,which was alleged to sell software for an infringing process.in january,ricoh filed a patent infringement action in the district of delaware against seven of synopsys customers,all of whom designed and manufactured computer chips using synopsys software,asserting that the manufacturing process infringed the patent.in may,synopsys responded by filing a declaratory judgment action against ricoh in the northern district of california,seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement,invalidity,and unenforceability of the patent.the two actions were eventually consolidated in the northern district of california.after nearly seven years of litigation,the district court granted synopsys motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on april.we affirmed without opinion.in re ricoh.patent.

discussion 
the federal rules of civil procedure provide that u nless a federal statute,these rules,or a court order provides otherwise,costs should be allowed to the prevailing party.d.synopsys is clearly the prevailing party.section,however,control s a federal court power to hold a losing party responsible for the opponent fees by limiting what costs can be awarded.crawford fitting gibbons,d.in pertinent part,section grants the district court the authority to tax as costs 
fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case 
fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case and 
compensation of court appointed experts,compensation of interpreters,and salaries,fees,expenses,and costs of special interpretation services under section of this title.
there are disputes as to three categories of costs taxed against ricoh the costs of an electronic document database under subsection,exemplification fees and copy costs under subsection,and deposition and interpreter costs under subsections and.the total amount in dispute is.
we apply regional circuit law,in this case ninth circuit law,in interpreting section.see summit,nidek.the burden is on the losing party to demonstrate why the costs should not be awarded.stanley of,cir.a district court award of costs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.summit,at miles california,cir.however,whether a particular expense falls within the purview of section,and thus may be taxed in the first place,is an issue of statutory construction,subject to de novo review.summit,at.
ricoh contends that the district court erred in awarding to synopsys for stratify,a electronic database service,representing the portion of the database costs paid by synopsys.a brief history of the stratify database is necessary.ricoh sought the production of and other internal documents from synopsys customers who used its software to design and manufacture integrated circuits.the parties were unable to agree on the form of production.synopsys proposed three alternatives providing a hard copy production of the,converting them to tiff format and producing them as such,or loading them onto a local terminal at its offices and allowing ricoh counsel to review them on site only.ricoh objected to these forms of production,demanding that the be produced in native format,in their ordinary course of business.ricoh suggested doing so using stratify,an electronic discovery company that provides secure document processing,review,production and hosting services,and that the costs be divided between the parties.as described below,synopsys agreed to the use of stratify and to the division of costs.
synopsys contends that,because stratify was used as the exclusive means for producing,the full cost of stratify is taxable as fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case under section.ricoh in turn argues that stratify does not fall under section because it was a document review database as opposed to a form of document production for the convenience of counsel and not necessary for use in the case.
under section,exemplification and copying costs for producing documents in discovery are recoverable.this is reflected in northern district of california civil local rule d,which permits taxing t he cost of reproducing disclosure or formal discovery documents when used for any purpose in the case.cal.civ.d.here,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that,absent a contrary agreement such as we conclude existed in this case,costs associated with stratify were taxable because the stratify database was used as a means of document production in this case.taxation order,slip op.at.
the act of producing documents is not so narrowly construed as to cover only printing and a document.see black law dictionary ed.defining produce as t o provide a document,witness,in response to subpoena or discovery request.in the era of electronic discovery,courts have held that electronic production of documents can constitute exemplification or making copies under section.see,bdt,lexmark int l,cir e lectronic scanning and imaging could be interpreted as exemplification and copies of papers.notably,in,congress amended section by replacing the phrase copies of papers with making copies of any materials judicial administration and technical amendments act of,pub,stat,emphasis added,to reflect the idea that electronically produced information is re coverable in court costs,cong.rec,daily ed,statement of zoe lofgren.thus,the costs of producing a document electronically can be recoverable under section.
here,it was ricoh that initially suggested using stratify because it addresses all of synopsys integrity and security concerns,while allowing you to easily comply with the requirements for producing the email documents in native format.the district court did not err in concluding that synopsys act of making available all of the requested to ricoh through stratify constituted electronic production of the.we do not consider any of the stratify database costs to fall into the unrecoverable category of intellectual efforts.see romero city of pomona,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by townsend holman consulting,cir.since the documents were produced in their native form via the database,taxation order,slip op.at,we hold that the basic stratify costs would be recoverable under section,absent an agreement to the contrary.in light of our decision,we need not decide if the additional challenged items related to the database were improperly allowed.
however,ricoh argues in the alternative that the parties agreed by contract to share the cost of stratify,and that this agreement precludes.there is no question that parties may agree to share costs that would otherwise be taxable.in crawford,the supreme court held that absent explicit statutory or contractual authorization for the taxation of the expenses of a litigant witness as costs,federal courts are bound by the limitations set out in and.at.emphasis added.in monsanto david,the parties
