opinion of the court 
this appeal involves a dispute between a taxpayer and the internal revenue service about the proper time to recognize income and losses.the taxpayer maintains that it was not required to recognize the proceeds from the sale of goods as income in the year it received those proceeds because the funds were subject to a governmental blocking order and,under the claim of right doctrine,it did not have unfettered discretion as to the funds.it also seeks to deduct the manufacturing costs of other goods in a year prior to that in which it sold those goods,reasoning that the iraqi sanctions regulation then in place which prohibited the taxpayer from selling those goods either was in effect a confiscation or deprived the goods of any market value.the district court held in favor of the government as to both claims.we affirm.
background 
in,taxpayer inductotherm industries,inductotherm,through its subsidiary consarc contracted with iraq to manufacture three vacuum furnaces.one furnace furnace a is an induction skull melting furnace.the other two furnaces b and c are electron beam furnaces a technology that later became disfavored and apparently is no longer in widespread use today.iraq represented that the furnaces would be used to manufacture prosthetics for veterans of the war.it later came to light that iraq instead intended to use the furnaces in its nuclear weapons program.inductotherm was unaware of iraq true intentions.
as the three furnaces were about to be exported to iraq,it invaded kuwait.in response,on august,president george bush entered an executive order the iraqi sanctions regulation blocking all property in which iraq had an interest.as applied to inductotherm,the executive order precluded the sale or transfer of the three furnaces without the permission of the office of foreign assets control ofac.moreover,all funds in which inductotherm had an interest due to the iraqi contract were blocked pursuant to the executive order unless ofac issued a license unblocking them.see,et.at the time,those funds in which iraq potentially had an interest included a million letter of credit lc and iraq million deposit for the three furnaces.moreover,because inductotherm had received this million deposit,ofac took the position that iraq had a property interest in all three furnaces and thus they were blocked property.
to mitigate its losses,inductotherm attempted to find new buyers for the furnaces.it sold furnace a to mitsubishi in its tax year for approximately million rather than place the sale proceeds in a blocked account,inductotherm commingled them with other corporate funds.it was unable to sell furnaces b and c in that year.eventually,however,inductotherm sold the furnaces in to reading alloys for what inductotherm alleges was less than its production and carrying costs.
when the government learned of the mitsubishi sale,it directed inductotherm to block the sale proceeds.on june,during inductotherm tax year,the government confirmed those instructions by issuing a directive license,which specifically applied the executive order to inductotherm.inductotherm disputed,inter alia,the applicability of the executive order to the sale proceeds,and protracted litigation ensued in the united states district court for the district of columbia and then in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.ultimately,the circuit held that the furnaces,and the proceeds therefrom,were blocked property but could be released if inductotherm placed the million deposit in a blocked account a procedure clearly contemplated in the executive order.consarc united states treasury dep t office of foreign assets control.
meanwhile,when filing its tax returns,inductotherm did not record the furnace a sale proceeds as taxable income in,reasoning that,as a result of the executive order and the directive license,it did not have unfettered discretion to dispose of the proceeds.it urges that,under the claim of right doctrine discussed in section ii below,if a taxpayer does not have unfettered discretion with respect to funds,those funds need not be recognized as income.the irs disputed inductotherm reasoning and assessed a tax deficiency.inductotherm paid the back taxes on furnace a as the irs required and filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey to recover the alleged overpayment.the court held against inductotherm on this issue,granting summary judgment in favor of the government.
in its and tax years,inductotherm took deductions on account of the production costs of furnaces b and c,despite the fact that it did not sell them until.inductotherm argued that,while normally costs may be deducted only in the year that an item is sold,see united states catto,d,in its case an exception should apply as a result of the executive order,the furnaces,in effect,were no longer inductotherm property and indeed were confiscated from it.the irs disallowed this deduction.again,inductotherm paid the required tax deficiency and filed suit to recover.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the irs on this claim as well.
inductotherm appeals both rulings 
ii.discussion 
inductotherm argues that it was not required to treat the sale proceeds for furnace a as income in under the claim of right doctrine.that doctrine,set out in north american oil consolidated burnet,holds that funds received by a taxpayer will be considered income if a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without restriction as to its disposition,even though it may still be claimed that the taxpayer is not entitled to retain the money,and even though the taxpayer may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.id.at.
here,inductotherm has conceded that it received the furnace a proceeds under a claim of right,it acknowledged its entitlement to the proceeds.however,it disputes that it held the furnace a proceeds without restriction as to disposition in.inductotherm reasons that the executive order,issued during its tax year,required it to place the funds in a blocked account which,however,it did not do and thus restricted its discretion as to those funds in.inductotherm relies principally on a line of cases holding that public utilities were not required to recognize as income customers deposits,prepayments,or overrecoveries,which those utilities clearly were obligated to return,despite the fact that the utilities commingled the funds as inductotherm did.see,commissioner indianapolis power light,d customer deposits made to assure prompt payment of future bills not income even though funds commingled with general funds,deposits represent merely loans because customers are entitled to demand return of funds under specified circumstances mutual.united states,cir monies utility held in reserve at the direction of the public utilities commission were not income because it can not be said that the receipts came into the possession of the utility subject to its unfettered command and that it was free to enjoy the receipts at its option florida progress commissioner,wl because the time and method of refunding overrecoveries is controlled by agencies rather than by florida power,it does not have complete dominion over the overrecoveries and is not required to recognize them as income when received.houston indus.subs.united states,fed.cl,overrecoveries for fuel costs are not income because e very dollar of overrecovery must eventually be repaid.
the government argues that these utility cases are not analogous because the first prong of the claim of right doctrine was not satisfied the utilities did not claim that they were entitled to the funds for their own benefit.rather,they conceded at all times that they held the funds in a fiduciary capacity or,at least,with a clear obligation to return the funds.moreover,as to the second prong,the utilities discretion with respect to the funds was at all times limited by extensive regulatory oversight by state administrative agencies.the government directs our attention instead to james united states,d,which held that money embezzled must be included in income,even though it l
