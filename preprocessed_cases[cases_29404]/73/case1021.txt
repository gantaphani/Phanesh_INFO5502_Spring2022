michael kayser appeals from his conviction for tax evasion in violation of for the year.he alleges,among other things,that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury in accordance with his theory of defense.we have jurisdiction under and we reverse and remand.
background 
from november to may,usa,employed kayser first as a salesperson and later as a vice president for its shopping mall.compensated kayser as an independent contractor and paid him a commission by checks made out to his name.in july,kayser incorporated aspen ventures aspen ventures to receive income and take business deductions related to that income.
after failing to file timely tax returns for through,kayser ultimately filed his delinquent individual and corporate tax returns for those years in august.kayser was subsequently indicted on two counts of attempted income tax evasion for and in violation of 
at trial,the government alleged that kayser had improperly structured his individual and aspen ventures corporate returns for and to evade the payment of taxes on his activities.for the year count,the government contended that kayser received of income that should have been reported on his individual return,but kayser improperly reported this income on aspen ventures corporate return.for the year count,the government showed that kayser failed to report his income on either his individual or aspen ventures corporate return 
however,kayser did report in deductible business expenses on aspen ventures return.these deductions were composed of automobile expenses,office expenses,utilities,travel and entertainment expenses,and rents.kayser accountant testified that the deductions were calculated from receipts and records maintained by kayser.as reported,the expenses generated a net operating loss of on aspen ventures return,which kayser then carried back to eliminate the corporate taxes owed by aspen ventures on the income it reported for.
the government alleged that kayser willfully structured his individual and corporate returns in the manner described above to evade taxes,and that as a result of this improper reporting,kayser was able to declare virtually no tax due on the or more he received from as income in and.
at trial,kayser primary theory of defense was that he had not willfully evaded paying taxes.during the course of the trial,kayser raised a second theory,namely,that the income he failed to report on his individual return in should be offset by the in business deductions he improperly reported on aspen ventures corporate returns in and carried back to.this theory was supported by two principal pieces of evidence.first,kayser testified that he incurred the entire in business deductions in connection with the production of the individual income he received in.in addition,kayser accountant and the government expert both testified that an independent contractor legitimate and allowable business deductions could generally be used to reduce business income on an individual return.
on the last day of trial,kayser asked the district court to approve the following jury instruction if the defendant had unclaimed deductions which would have offset his tax liability such that there was no tax due and owing,then there is no tax deficiency.the government argued that this instruction was unwarranted because kayser had introduced no evidence of previously unclaimed deductions.the government also argued that kayser theory of defense was improper under united states miller,cir,which the government read as precluding kayser from arguing that the business deductions he reported on aspen ventures returns could be used to negate his individual tax deficiency.
the district court agreed with the government and declined to give the requested instruction.the district court noted that the evidence did not support the instruction and also implicitly agreed with the government argument that miller precluded the theory of defense in this case.
following trial,the jury found kayser guilty of tax evasion for the year,but failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the count concerning tax evasion in.on appeal,kayser argues that the district court erred by rejecting his proposed jury instruction.
discussion 
kayser contends he was entitled to a jury instruction on his theory that the government could not prove there was a tax deficiency in if kayser had sufficient allowable business expenses to offset his unreported income for that year.our cases hold that a defendant is entitled to have the judge instruct the jury on his theory of defense,provided that it is supported by law and has some foundation in the evidence.united states fejes,cir internal quotations omitted.here,the district court declined to give kayser proposed instruction on two grounds,namely,that the instruction was erroneous as a matter of law under united states miller,cir and that the evidence was insufficient to support the instruction.we examine both of these determinations in turn.
we first consider whether kayser proposed instruction was erroneous as a matter of law.the elements of attempted income tax evasion under are willfulness the existence of a tax deficiency and an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.sansone united states,d see also united states marashi,cir.a tax deficiency occurs when a defendant owes more federal income tax for the applicable tax year than was declared due on the defendant income tax return.see cir.crim.jury instr.
a defendant may negate the element of tax deficiency in a tax evasion case with evidence of unreported deductions.see united states marabelles,cir elwert united states,cir.both marabelles and elwert involved small business owners who among other things their income for one or more years.marabelles,at elwert,at.at trial for criminal tax evasion,the defendants introduced evidence of deductions for labor costs that had not been claimed on their returns in order to disprove the element of tax deficiency.marabelles,at elwert,at.in rejecting the defendants challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their respective convictions,we held that the burden is on the defendant to prove that he had allowable deductions that were not shown in his return,once the government establishes unreported income and allows the deductions claimed by the defendant in his return and others that it can calculate without his assistance.marabelles,at elwert,at.
notwithstanding the greater sophistication of kayser alleged tax evasion scheme,marabelles and elwert are controlling in kayser case.like the defendants in those cases,kayser failed to report income on his individual return and was entitled to demonstrate at trial that he had deductions that could offset this previously unreported income.see marabelles,at elwert,at.
the government,however,argues that united states miller prohibits a defendant who reports his income and deductions in one manner from arguing for an alternative characterization at trial.see miller,at rejecting defendant defense because the defendant presented no concrete proof that the amounts were considered,intended,or recorded on the corporate records as a return of capital at the time they were made see also united states boulware boulware ii,cir same.the government thus contends that kayser decision to report the in business expenses on aspen ventures returns prevents kayser from now arguing that these expenses were actually incurred by him individually in relation to his activities as an independent contractor.
contrary to the government argument,miller does not preclude a defendant in a tax evasion case from asserting a defense that is inconsistent with information falsely reported on his challenged tax returns.miller,at.rather,miller allows a defendant to present evidence at trial regarding the facts of the transaction at issue,notwithstanding the defendant improper or scrambled reporting of those facts.id.in miller,the government alleged that the defendant had diverted substantial sums from his closely held corporation and failed to report the funds as income.id.at.the diverted funds had been recorded on the corporation books as repayments of loans,which were later shown to be or false.id.at.
miller tried to convince the district court to apply certain technical tax rules to transform a taxable diversion of funds into a return of capital.id.at.miller argued that a court must automatically treat funds diverted by a shareholder from a closely held corporation as a constructive corporate distribution,pursuant to a rule established in civil tax decisions.id.under the facts of his case,miller contended that such a distribution would be a return of capital.id.at.therefore,the government could not prove a tax deficiency and miller could not be convicted of tax evasion.id.at.
we rejected miller theory,holding that the civil constructive distribution rules did not automatically apply in a criminal tax evasion case.id.at.instead,we held that a criminal defendant wishing to raise a defense had to introduce evidence that the diverted funds were,in fact,a return of capital.id.at.for example,the defendant could demonstrate that the diverted funds were intended to be a return of capital by showing an adjustment in the corporate records indicating a reduction in his basis at the time of distribution.see id.at.
consistent with this ruling,miller was allowed to present evidence to establish his defense at trial.see id.at.however,the record did not support his defense among other things,there was a substantial question whether miller was even a shareholder of the corporation who could receive payments as a return of capital.id.based on the evidence,the district court concluded that the diverted funds constituted additional taxable salary,rather than a return of capital.id.at.we held that the district court conclusion was not clearly erroneous.id.at.
neither we nor the district court suggested that miller was bound by the original characterization of the diverted funds,the corporation characterization of the diverted funds as repayments of loans or miller failure to report the diverted funds on his tax returns.id.at.rather,we concluded that whether diverted funds constitute constructive corporate distributions depends on the factual circumstances involved in each case under consideration,id.at,and the demonstration made by the defendant at trial,id.at.
the import of our holding in miller is that a defendant remains free to present evidence that funds diverted from a corporation are a return of capital,regardless of the manner in which he or the corporation originally reported the transaction.see id.at see also boulware ii,at miller is thus consistent with marabelles and elwert,which provide the controlling authority in this case.like miller,marabelles and elwert permit defendants to present evidence at trial to establish the nature of their business their actual business when the position they take at trial is inconsistent with their original tax reportings.marabelles,at elwert,at.
following marabelles and elwert,we hold that if kayser had business expenses that were allowable offsets against his individual income,he had the right to show them and explain them as part of his defense for tax evasion.marabelles,at elwert,at.the fact that kayser improperly reported the deductions he now claims negate his individual deficiency,while the defendants in marabelles and elwert simply failed to report certain deductions,does not alter our conclusion.kayser improper report of deductions on his corporate return does not change the underlying nature of these expenses,although the filing of a false return itself may constitute a separate offense.see.when the supreme court held that a tax deficiency is a necessary element of tax evasion under section,it made no exception for cases where the defendant owed no tax to the government but had improperly reported the underlying income and deductions that demonstrated this lack of a tax deficiency.see lawn united states,d sansone,at.therefore,kayser prior report of in deductions on aspen ventures returns does not preclude him from now arguing that these deductions are offsets to his individual income,provided that he carries the burden of demonstrating the legitimacy and allowability of these deductions.see marabelles,at the burden is on the defendant to prove that he had allowable deductions that were not shown in his return emphasis added citing elwert,at 
having concluded that kayser theory of defense represents a correct application of marabelles and elwert,we next turn to the question whether kayser established an adequate foundation in the record to warrant an instruction on this theory.the legal standard is generous a defendant is entitled to an instruction concerning his theory of the case if the theory is legally sound and evidence in the case makes it applicable,even if the evidence is weak,insufficient,inconsistent,or of doubtful credibility.united states washington,cir.a defendant needs to show only that there is evidence upon which the jury could rationally sustain the defense.united states jackson,cir per curiam see also united states johnson,cir.where,as here,factual disputes are raised,this standard protects the defendant right to have questions of evidentiary weight and credibility resolved by the jury.jackson,at see also johnson,at.
we review the district court conclusion that kayser proposed instruction was not supported by sufficient evidence for an abuse of discretion.fejes,at.
kayser theory of defense was that the jury should apply the in deductions he initially reported on his corporate tax return in to eliminate the deficiency on his personal return for that year.under marabelles and elwert,this theory required kayser to establish two elements first,kayser had to show that the represented legitimate business expenses actually incurred by him in an individual capacity.second,kayser had to demonstrate that the of business expenses represented allowable deductions on his individual return within the meaning of the tax code.marabelles,at citing elwert,at.we conclude that kayser evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury instruction on this theory.
through his own testimony,and the testimony of his accountant,kayser presented evidence that he maintained records and receipts of his business expenses and that from those records,his accountant calculated the of business expenses reported on kayser corporate return.kayser further testified that all of the in business expenses was incurred in connection with his previously unreported individual income for on this record,a rational jury could have concluded that kayser actually incurred in business expenses and that these expenses were legitimate.
we also conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could find that the represented allowable business expenses with respect to kayser personal return.the record included aspen ventures tax return,which detailed that the business deductions in the amount of were composed of automobile expenses,office expenses,utilities,travel and entertainment expenses,and rents.the government did not challenge either the character,amount,or validity of the expenses.at the same time,both the government expert and kayser accountant testified that as a general matter,business expenses of the type reported on aspen ventures return could be used to reduce business income on an individual return.this evidence,though arguably weak,was sufficient to allow a rational jury to sustain kayser defense.the district court therefore abused its discretion in failing to instruct the jury on this theory 
we thus conclude that the requested jury instruction was supported by law and had sufficient foundation in the evidence.because the district court erred in declining to instruct the jury on kayser theory of defense,we reverse kayser conviction 
reversed and remanded.
the majority begins its analysis by dutifully reciting a rule a defendant may negate the element of tax deficiency in a tax evasion case with evidence of unreported deductions.op.at citing united states marabelles,cir elwert united states,cir.but it then jumps the rails by removing the word unreported and allowing a defendant to escape a criminal tax conviction by reported deductions.id.at.this new rule finds no support in our caselaw and conflicts with united states miller,cir,and united states boulware boulware ii,cir.even if this new rule were permissible,defendant did not present evidence that could support such an instruction.for both these reasons,i respectfully dissent.
kayser was charged with tax evasion for failing to report income on his individual return.his proposed instruction would have allowed the jury to apply the in deductions,which he had reported on his corporate tax return,to his personal income.as the government argued at trial,this defense is foreclosed by miller.in miller,we dealt with a highly analogous situation,where the taxpayer wished to a distribution from his corporation as a return of capital,rather than as a dividend.miller argument,like kayser,was that what mattered was the reality of the transaction,not the way he initially papered it.we rejected this contention.our rationale for reaching this conclusion is highly instructive 
in civil tax cases the purpose is tax collection and the key issue is the establishment of the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer.in a criminal tax proceeding the concern is not over the type or the specific amount of the tax which the defendant has evaded,but whether he has willfully attempted to evade the payment or assessment of a tax.goldberg,supra,at simon,supra,at.
the difficulty in automatically applying the constructive distribution rules to this case is that it completely ignores one essential element of the crime charged the willful intent to evade taxes,and concentrates solely on the issue of the nature of the funds diverted.that latter aspect is not the important element.where the taxpayer has sought to conceal income by filing a false return,he has violated the tax evasion statutes.it does not matter that that amount could have somehow been made if the taxpayer had proceeded on a different course to apply the constructive distribution rules to this situation would nullify all of the taxpayer prior unlawful acts.
miller,at see also boulware ii,at same.
under this rule,a defendant in a criminal tax case is bound by the way he papered the transaction at the time he earned the income in question.in miller,the taxpayer was bound by the fact that his corporate books did not reflect the distribution as a return of capital.that he could later,as a matter of economic reality,claim that the distribution was a return of capital was of no consequence,because contemporaneously maintained records did not support that.miller went on to explain 
in holding that the constructive distribution rules should not automatically be applied,it is not herein asserted that diverted funds could never be a return of capital.however,to constitute the latter,there must be some demonstration on the part of the taxpayer the corporation that such distributions were intended to be such a return.to hold otherwise would be to permit the taxpayer to divert such funds and if not caught,to later pay out another return of capital or if caught,to avoid conviction by raising the defense that the sums were a return of capital and hence.
at footnote omitted see also boulware ii,at d efendant must show not merely that the funds could have been a return of capital,but that the funds were in fact a return of capital at the time of the transfer.
although this rule creates some tension with marabelles and elwert these cases can be reconciled because marabelles and elwert deal with the situation where the taxpayer failed to claim deductions.in such circumstances,the deductions are unreported,so the taxpayer is not bound under miller by any prior characterization.unlike in marabelles and elwert,defendant here did not fail to report business expenses on his return he claimed the deductions on his corporate return and carried back the losses to wipe out tax liability for the prior year.kayser act of claiming the deductions on his corporate return was not merely proof of the underlying reality it was the reality because it had a legally operative effect had kayser not been audited,these deductions would have been carried back to reduce his corporate tax liability to zero for his personal tax liability would have been zero because of his failure to declare income.
the irs,however,did audit kayser and found that he had underreported his personal income in.if the deductions are shifted from his corporate to his individual return,this would affect his corporate tax liability.the same deductions can not be used twice he can either use them to wipe out his personal income or he can carry them back to wipe out his corporate income.having chosen to do the latter when he filed his returns,the deductions are used up and are not available to offset his personal income.contrary to the majority holding,marabelles and elwert are thus not on point because kayser does not have allowable deductions that were not reported on his return.even if the deductions in question could have been treated as personal deductions,had kayser claimed them as such on his individual return,the district court properly concluded that kayser is stuck with the way he reported them at the was as corporate deductions.to let him now go back and treat the deductions as applicable to his personal income allows for precisely the kind of,scenario that miller sought to foreclose.
even under the majority new rule,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the proposed instruction because kayser did not present sufficient evidence to warrant the instruction.kayser needed to establish that he had enough allowable deductions to eliminate tax liability.in other words,he needed to show that he would have and could have reported sufficient deductions to offset all income.the majority strains to find arguably weak evidence in the record to support both propositions,see op.at,but the evidence on both counts falls far short of providing a sufficient basis upon which the jury could rationally sustain the defense.united states jackson,cir per curiam see also united states streit,cir same the merest scintilla of evidence,however,will not suffice.quoting jackson,at 
kayser reported in business expenses on his corporate return and carried back these expenses to eliminate his corporate tax liability for.he was able to carry back these losses because he failed to report of personal income from in and thus had no reported income against which to claim deductions unlike marabelles and elwert,therefore,the deductions kayser wanted to use to offset his unreported income at the time of trial were not unused.rather,they were doing work in sheltering his corporate income.had the tax year been beyond the government reach,perhaps kayser could have argued that he had erred in assigning the deductions for his expenses to his corporate return and carrying them back to.the majority new rule would allow that though miller would,in my view,prohibit it.
but the tax year was not beyond the government reach.in fact,kayser was being tried for tax evasion for both and.to escape conviction,therefore,kayser had to show that he had enough deductions to shelter both his and income.there just were enough deductions to do this.on his corporate return,kayser reported in income he paid taxes on none of it because he claimed in deductions to wipe out his corporate in carryback losses from.if he shifted of these deductions to cover his unreported income for,that would have left him only in deductions for to offset the in income reported on his corporate return.thus,even assuming kayser were allowed to reassign some or all of his deductions from to,he would have some unsheltered income in one or both years the majority admits as much.see op.at.
which is no doubt why the record is so muddy as to whether kayser would or could have reassigned the deductions to his personal income had kayser shown unequivocally that the deductions were available in,and that he would have claimed them that year,he would have exposed himself to a conviction for tax evasion in.kayser therefore hedged his testimony.on direct examination,kayser indicated that every deduction on his corporate return related t
