elaine martin appeals her convictions for subscribing false federal tax returns and her sentence for those convictions and several convictions first,we address martin contention that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence that,years before the conduct underlying this case,she had submitted idaho state tax returns on which she improperly characterized several thousand dollars in personal expenses as deductible farm expenses and had been audited by idaho tax authorities.second,we address whether the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines in calculating the losses that resulted from martin fraud,where her company was awarded government contracts under programs meant to aid disadvantaged businesses,for which martin company did not legitimately qualify.we have jurisdiction under.for the reasons that follow,we vacate martin tax convictions,vacate her sentence,and remand for further proceedings.
martin owned a construction company,marcon,which specialized in installing steel guardrails and concrete barriers on public highways.marcon also earned revenue by selling used materials the company removed from its construction sites.but martin never reported the income from the used material sales to the irs,and instead kept it off the company books and sent it to a bank account hidden from her external accountants by keeping several hundred thousand dollars of this income off of her personal and company tax returns between and,martin avoided paying about in income taxes.
martin also fraudulently obtained government contracts by misrepresenting her assets to qualify for programs designed to aid disadvantaged businesses.a federal program run by the small business administration sba qualifies small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged persons for certain federal contracts without going through the normal competitive bidding process.martin also obtained contracts through a disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program,which sets targets for awarding a percentage of contracts to participants.between and,marcon received nearly million from contracts awarded through the dbe program,and successfully performed each contract.marcon was admitted to the sba program and awarded three contracts worth nearly million,all of which the company successfully performed.
to prove that martin knew she had a duty to truthfully report her income on her tax returns,the government was allowed to introduce evidence that idaho tax authorities had audited martin and that in tax years and she had improperly claimed less than as deductible farm expenses on her state tax returns.martin was accused of incorrectly characterizing student loan payments for her children and expenses related to her divorce as farm expenses.martin settled the issue without conceding liability.
during closing arguments,the government reminded the jury in its rebuttal of the idaho audits and argued that martin knew what she was doing when she subscribed false tax returns because she had tried it before 
the government is focused obviously on the used materials,but the same thing was brought up and elaine martin agreed it was wrong when she tried to charge various things as a farm expense.things like her divorce fees.things like her children health insurance and payment of student loans.remember that.remember how you were told that she tried this before.that she tried to say those were farm expenses.now a farm needs fertilizer,it needs seed,it needs equipment,but does it really need to pay for student loans well,in elaine martin book it does.
the jury convicted martin of the tax counts and of several counts.
at sentencing,martin,relying on the procurement fraud rule found in application note a v ii of of the sentencing guidelines,argued for a loss amount of zero.relying on the government benefits rule found in application note f ii,the government advocated for a loss amount equal to the total value of the contracts about million and the resulting level enhancement that loss amount permitted.
the district court held that the government benefits rule applied.it disagreed,however,that the loss under that rule was million and instead set the loss amount at million,the profit from martin fraudulently obtained contracts.acknowledging that its focus on profit was possibly erroneous,it invoked application note c and found that a higher loss amount would overstate the actual loss.
the district court loss calculation led to an level enhancement.with a base offense level of and additional enhancements for defendant role and sophisticated means,the adjusted offense level was,for which the guidelines range for someone in criminal history category i is to months.the district court imposed a sentence of months.
the district court also entered an order of forfeiture,pursuant to the parties stipulation,requiring martin to forfeit over million.
martin timely appealed her convictions and sentence.
we review a district court evidentiary decisions for an abuse of discretion.united states mcfall,cir.even if an evidentiary ruling was incorrect,we will vacate a conviction only if that ruling more likely than not affected the verdict.united states pang,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted 
the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is reviewed de novo.united states treadwell,cir.
we first address martin argument that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence about her audits by idaho state tax authorities.we agree and conclude that the error was not harmless.as a result of this substantial error,we vacate martin convictions for subscribing false tax returns.
federal rule of evidence b provides that evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is inadmissible to prove character or criminal propensity but is admissible for other purposes,such as proof of intent,plan or knowledge.united states rizk,cir quoting.b.
this general rule reflects our concern that a person charged with a crime be convicted only if its elements are proved beyond a reasonable doubt.a person should not be convicted merely because he or she has done prior bad acts.rule b will not be violated if the prior bad acts are relevant on some issue in the current prosecution,such as motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.b.but when bad acts are not relevant,they can only be viewed as being presented to inflame prejudice in the trier of fact,in which case they are at odds with our fundamental premises on the need for a fair trial.and even when relevant on some issue,evidence of prior bad acts should not,under federal rule of evidence,be admitted when its probative value is substantially outweighed by dangers of unfair prejudice,confusion on issues,waste of time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.
in united states bailey,cir,the government,prosecuting a defendant for the sale of unregistered securities,introduced an sec civil complaint alleging that the defendant had previously issued securities in violation of the same sec rules as those at issue in the criminal trial.we held that the admission of the complaint was an abuse of discretion that required a new trial.id.at.we outlined the four part test for admitting evidence under rule b the government must show that the evidence tends to prove a material point the other act is not too remote in time the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that defendant committed the other act and in certain cases the act is similar to the offense charged.id.at quotations omitted.if the evidence meets this test under rule b,the court must then decide whether the probative value is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial impact under rule.id.quotation omitted.
under these standards,admitting evidence of the prior state tax audit for a prosecution of federal tax violations was serious error.here,the state tax auditors described their investigation and the settlement agreement that martin had signed,providing more information than merely the civil complaint introduced in bailey.but this is a distinction that makes no substantive difference.the government introduced evidence that martin was accused of incorrectly deducting farm expenses on a state tax form in and,apparently to show her knowledge of federal tax laws related to reporting income in the mid.but we can perceive no relevant connection between martin awareness of rules about the characterization of farm expenses under idaho tax law,and whether she had knowledge of federal tax law governing the reporting of income.moreover,there is a substantial probability that the jury took this evidence as proof that martin is a liar who does not want to pay taxes and will cheat to avoid them a theme the government emphasized at closing,and a line of thinking the evidence rules are meant to discourage.the government has failed to meet its burden under our normal test for admitting evidence under rule b.also,even if relevant,introducing this evidence fails the rule balancing test.
the government argues that unlike the securities violation in bailey,the government in criminal tax cases must prove that the defendant knew the tax laws,and that extending bailey to prohibit evidence of prior audits in criminal tax cases would impair the government ability circumstantially to prove a defendant knowledge of the tax laws.we disagree.when the government seeks to admit evidence of a defendant knowledge,we have emphasized that the government must prove a logical connection between the knowledge gained as a result of the commission of the prior act and the knowledge at issue in the charged act.united states mayans,cir.mayans instructs that in cases such as this one,the materiality and similarity prongs of the test merge essentially into one similarity is necessary to indicate knowledge and intent because it can furnish the link between knowledge gained in the prior act and the claimed ignorance of some fact in the offense charged.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
evidence of an audit by,or settlement with,state authorities for unrelated conduct is only minimally if at all probative of martin knowledge of the federal tax laws at issue in this case,and there is an insufficient connection,for rule b purposes,between the prior audit and the knowledge,in the context of the crime charged,of federal tax laws governing the reporting of income.id.
to show that the admission of the evidence here was not an abuse of discretion,the government cites several criminal tax cases where evidence of prior encounters with tax officials was used.but all of the cases the government cites involve prior with the irs,not state authorities.see united states jackson,fed.app x,cir evidence that defendant continued filing false returns after irs instructed him that his conduct was illegal used to show willfulness united states matthies,fed.app x,cir introduction of irs publication related to tax protestor arguments used to show defendant was on notice of legal duty to pay income taxes united states voorhies,cir evidence that defendant was put on notice of tentative tax deficiencies by irs audit used to prove willfulness when defendant moved assets overseas the next year.none suggests that learning about obligations related to claiming personal expense deductions for state tax purposes shows knowledge of federal tax laws barring the of income.we conclude that the state tax audit evidence was not relevant on the federal tax claims and so should have been excluded under rule b.but even if relevant,it was unduly prejudicial and not admissible under rule.the government in substance told the jury that martin had lied on her taxes before and should be convicted of doing so again an argument not supported by the facts and barred under the rules of evidence.
was this mistake harmful or harmless the evidence about the audit was introduced through the testimony of two witnesses and several documents and the government emphasized its importance in closing.rather than merely arguing that the evidence showed martin knowledge of federal tax laws,the government also insinuated,impermissibly,that it showed martin to be a dishonest person d oes a farm really need to pay for student loans well,in elaine martin book it does.united states brooke,cir stating that evidentiary ruling was not harmless in light of the volume of testimony and references to it in the government closing argument.the government was permitted to argue at closing that martin knew what she was doing when she her income because she had been there before,and she tried this before.the government incorrectly used the state audit to make a propensity argument that more likely than not affected the verdict on the false tax return charges.bailey,at noting government numerous references to the prior sec civil complaint at closing united states brown,cir stating that continued references to defendant prior bad acts at the government closing arguments make it impossible to say the error was harmless martin convictions for subscribing false tax returns must be vacated.
considering the totality of the circumstances,however,we reach a different conclusion on the fraud and obstruction of justice convictions.there are several reasons for this.first,except for a brief reminder that income and net worth matter with regard to the dbe and sba programs at the close of the discussion of the idaho audit,the government remarks at closing about the audit related only to the charges of subscribing false tax returns.second,this propensity evidence likely affected the jury decision differently on the tax charges than on the other charges.if jurors think that a person cheats on state taxes,they are likelier to infer that such a person cheats on federal taxes than to infer that the person is guilty of a more complex fraud scheme.third,during a trial that lasted days,there was overwhelming evidence presented that martin had fraudulently qualified her business for the dbe and sba programs and had obstructed justice by concealing her true net worth.we see no realistic possibility that a jury would have reached a different conclusion on the fraud and obstruction charges if the state audit had not been mentioned.we conclude that unlike martin tax convictions,it was not more likely than not that the evidence of the idaho tax audit affected the jury decision on martin other charges.
martin is entitled to a new trial on the tax charges,but not on the other convictions.
because we vacate martin tax convictions,we vacate martin sentence.see united states bennett,cir vacating defendant entire sentence where one count of conviction was vacated.martin must be after liability on a potential for tax violations is resolved.but because we affirm martin fraud convictions in a memorandum disposition,the issue of calculating the losses from martin fraud is certain to come up again at,and any error by the district court in interpreting the guidelines may likely be repeated unless we provide guidance here.accordingly,we next address how the district court should have calculated loss where marcon gave valuable construction services under the contracts that it gained,but martin defrauded the government into wrongly concluding that marcon was qualified to participate in the dbe and sba programs.
a district court must correctly calculate the sentencing guidelines range before imposing a reasonable sentence.see gall united states.the commentary in the guidelines manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.stinson united states,see also united states jackson,cir per curiam.
as the general rule for fraud cases,the guidelines define loss as pecuniary harm.cmt.nn a i,ii.pecuniary harm is harm that is monetary or that otherwise is readily measurable in money.id.cmt.a iii.they further state that l oss shall be reduced by the fair market value of the services rendered by the defendant to the victim before the offense was detected.id.cmt.e i.this is consistent with the idea that fraud is not always the same as theft.sometimes,the scheme is to obtain a contract or other opportunity the scheme still amounts to fraud if a person gains by deceit something to which the person was not entitled,but t
