this appeal is from a judgment denying a petition for a writ of mandate,to require the los angeles county assessment appeals boards board to set aside the denial of petitioner helene curtis,curtis application for reduction of property tax assessment,hold a hearing on that application,and enroll curtis opinion of market value,because of the board failure to determine the application within two years after its filing tax.code,section,subdivisions c,d the trial court denied the petition,principally on grounds curtis was estopped from claiming the benefits of subdivision c.although we agree with that conclusion,we also conclude that curtis is entitled to a board hearing on the merits of its application.we therefore reverse the judgment and direct the issuance of a limited writ of mandate,requiring the board to determine curtis application on its merits.
the backdrop of the contest in this case is subdivision c,which relevantly provides if the county assessment appeals board fails to hear evidence and fails to make a final determination on the application for reduction in assessment of property within two years of the timely filing of the application,the taxpayer opinion of market value as reflected on the application for reduction in assessment shall be the value upon which taxes are to be levied for the tax year covered by the application,unless the taxpayer and the county assessment appeals board mutually agree in writing,or on the record,to an extension of time for the hearing.
on september,curtis filed an application for reduction of the property tax assessment of certain business personal property and fixtures.a year and a half later,in march,the board notified curtis that the application would be heard on june.on that date,linda offringa,of property tax assistance,pta,appeared as curtis representative.the board chair initially recognized pta as the authorized agent.however,during ensuing argument regarding curtis request for a continuance,the chair observed that curtis application had been filed by attorney david gangloff,and curtis had not authorized pta as its agent on the application form.offringa responded that she had presented an authorization to the clerk that morning.curtis had executed this authorization of tax agent,naming pta,on a board form on january.after a brief adjournment,the chair recognized the clerk,who advised the board that because curtis authorization of pta had been executed prior to the filing of the application form gangloff would have to be present this morning in order for us to go forward.accordingly,the clerk concluded that the application would have to be denied due to nonappearance.with the concurrence of another board member,the chair so ordered 
under rule g and local rule,this denial for nonappearance or was subject to reconsideration,upon request filed within days after mailing of notice of the denial.although such notice was sent to curtis and to gangloff on june,curtis did not proceed to request reconsideration,through a letter by gangloff,until september,days after the notice,and days before expiration of the period under subdivision c.
on october,the period having expired,the board responded with a letter to the effect that the request for reinstatement of curtis application would not be considered unless a waiver of the period were signed and returned.the board directed and sent this letter not to gangloff but to act inconsistent with the board previous refusal to recognize pta as curtis representative in the proceedings.an enclosed form provided that curtis agreed to waive its entitlement under subdivision c to have its application heard and decided within two years of filing,and gave the board a further days to hear and decide the application.
curtis representatives did not sign or return the waiver form.apparently assuming they had,the board on october,notified gangloff that it would hear curtis request for reinstatement,on november.gangloff and offringa appeared at the hearing.the board ordered the application reinstated,based on gangloff presence,but advised him that at future hearings a current rather than preapplication authorization should be submitted.
following a recess,the board took up the matter of a subdivision c waiver.the chair informed gangloff that a waiver would be necessary to evaluate the application.gangloff replied,i sorry,i talked to my client about this but we just lost a case in the court of appeal for curtis on a very technical ground and my client will not authorize a waiver.
in a following colloquy,the board chair responded o ur situation today stems from the fact that in order for us to continue an application it a practice to ask to have a waiver in place.and it appears to me that you came in this board room with that determination already made that you were not going to sign a waiver.if we ha d known this,what your intention was,we would not have taken this action to continue this application because we can not,we will not continue an application to be heard when it been passed the statute of limitation.gangloff responded that a waiver is completely and utterly irrelevant to the reinstatement of an application,and argued that the board was asking curtis to give up their rights to get due process.the chair replied that the board had acted in good faith this morning.apparently you came in with your mind set already that you were not going to sign a waiver gangloff told the chair,y ou are absolutely correct when you say we have not signed a waiver,we had no intention of signing a waiver.i had already spoken to my client about that possibility and they basically said absolutely not.the chair replied,well,that the unfortunate misunderstanding we had here,that if we would have known your intentions,we would absolutely not have continued the application.
the board proceeded to adjourn the matter for a default hearing,in the words of an officer,to see if it stops here or if the applicant opinion of value would be read in.the officer advised the board that curtis application had been reinstated.on december,the board sent a letter to gangloff stating that it had set a hearing on the application,based on subdivision c,for january.
at that hearing,gangloff acknowledged that curtis would have given a waiver had its june,request for a continuance been granted.the chair suggested that gangloff now provide such a waiver,but he replied that because of the previous,unconnected litigation,curtis had not authorized him to,and instead intended to stand on its rights.the chair pointed out that the board october,letter had stated that a waiver was a precondition to considering reinstatement gangloff replied that he did not agree this was a legal requirement.
after a recess,the board stated that it intended to nullify its reinstatement of the application,because it did not believe reinstatement could be granted after expiration,and without a waiver,of the two year statute.expressing a desire,however,that curtis receive a merits hearing,the board invited gangloff to obtain authority to waive the statute,given which the board would again reinstate the application.after an adjournment to consult with curtis,gangloff announced that curtis would not sign a waiver,for fear it will hurt any litigation position that we might have the board then ruled that the decision to reinstate the application had been made without authority,was null and void,and therefore the denial of june,remained the board decision.
two and years later,on june,curtis filed a petition for writ of mandate against the board,purportedly under code of civil procedure section,with a request for attorney fees,under government code section.after averring that curtis had in the interim filed a refund application,which had not been acted on,the petition alleged that the board had improperly failed to enroll curtis estimate of value after the expiration of two years following the reassessment application subd.c,and had unlawfully rescinded its november,reinstatement order.curtis prayed that the board june and january decisions be set aside,that the board order an equalization hearing under section,subdivision b,and that it order enrolled as the assessed value,for all intervening years,curtis opinion of value expressed in its application,in accordance with subdivision c and section,subdivision d with the petition,curtis filed a declaration by gangloff,identifying and attaching copies of transcripts and documents from the board files,and narrating the events and proceedings reflected.curtis also filed a declaration by orringa,affirming her and pta agency for curtis,describing other instances in which pta was recognized by the board,and outlining the proceedings of june.
curtis moved for a peremptory writ of mandate.with its opposition,the board filed a declaration by an officer,attaching and authenticating various documents from the file of curtis application,and stating that one of the documents filed with gangloff authorization of pta by not appear in that file.in addition,the board requested judicial notice of certain of the rules and local rules,as applicable in the period surrounding the administrative proceedings 
the trial court first ruled that the proceeding was governed by code of civil procedure section administrative mandamus rather than section ordinary mandamus,and therefore evidence outside the administrative record could not be considered,unless it qualified under subdivision e of code of civil procedure section.on this basis,the court received in evidence only the exhibits to gangloff declaration,excluding the authorization,and those attached to the board officer declaration.
the court then rejected curtis ultimate contention,that it was entitled to enrollment of its estimate of value under subdivision c,for several reasons.first,the court held,the board had heard and determined curtis application on june,less than two years after its filing.second,the court ruled that curtis was estopped to claim the benefit of subdivision c,because,as in stocker resources,assessment appeals bd.th,d stocker,it had misled the board to believe that the waiver the board required had been provided.
discussion 
curtis first claims error in the trial court exclusion of curtis declarations and the authorization of pta.curtis contends that its writ petition should have been treated as one in ordinary mandamus,or alternatively that the excluded evidence warranted admission in administrative mandamus,under code of civil procedure section,subdivision e.the trial court,however,correctly discerned that code of civil procedure section governed the case,inasmuch as it sought review of a proceeding that required a hearing,the taking of evidence,and discretionary administrative determination of facts,subd.a.in such cases code of civil procedure section applies whether not a hearing actually was held.pomona college superior court th,d see kirkpatrick city of oceanside d.
nor did the court exceed its discretion by limiting the evidence to the administrative record.code of civil procedure section,subdivision e,on which curtis relies,permits consideration of relevant evidence that either was improperly excluded by the administrative agency or could not with reasonable diligence be produced before it.the subdivision opens a narrow,discretionary window for additional evidence fort mojave indian tribe department of health services th,d.curtis declarations of gangloff and offringa,which summarized and characterized the proceedings that the record reflected,were redundant and did not require addition to the record.and curtis authorization of pta,which apparently had been filed with the board separately from and before these proceedings,also was superfluous,because it did not enhance the showing of pta agency made by the authorization that offringa presented to the board on june.
curtis next contends that the requirements that the board applied when it ruled that offringa could not represent curtis on june,were unlawful,because,without statutory authorization,they conflicted with the civil code requirements for authorization of an agent.this contest of the board june,decision is unfounded.
the board ruled that pta and offringa written authorization did not qualify them to represent curtis at the june,hearing because that authorization had been given executed by curtis before the instant application was filed by,in january,almost nine months preceding that filing.this sequence rendered the authorization defective in several respects.first,the authorization form itself,apparently prepared by the county,recited that this form may only be used for an assessment appeal by a taxpayer who has already filed an application.that this meant the authorization had to be given after filing of the application was made clear by the printed text of the authorization,which required that a copy of the application in question be attached to it.
the authorization form,in turn,implemented rule,which provides that an applicant may be represented at the assessment hearing by an agent,but that any person,other than an attorney at law,purporting to act as an agent for the applicant shall prior to the hearing file with the clerk written authority,signed by the applicant,to represent the applicant at the hearing.italics added.officers and employees of corporate taxpayers,and spouses,parents,and children of individual taxpayers are exempted from this requirement.rules.the authorization that offringa presented on june,did not and could not comply 
curtis position is that the requirement of written authorization to appear at a hearing conflicts with civil code section,which provides,with regard to an agent authority,that an oral authorization is sufficient for any purpose,except that an authority to enter into a contract required by law to be in writing can only be given by an instrument in writing.we do not perceive a conflict.civil code section concerns the form of authorization sufficient to empower an agent to act for a principal.the board requirements of filed written authorization do not define or restrict how such authority may be created.rather,they provide for notification or proof of authority,to satisfy the board that a representative who purports to appear for the taxpayer at a hearing,and who is not an employee of a corporate taxpayer or a close relative of an individual taxpayer,has been empowered to do so.such specific and convenient proof subserves the legislative and administrative scheme,under which the agent must be thoroughly familiar with the facts rule,and will generally be examined by the board.it also ensures,as the trial court noted,that board proceedings will not be disrupted by postdecision protests that the agent who participated was not authorized to do so.these considerations refute curtis correlative arguments that rule and local rule exceed the regulatory authority of the state board of equalization and the board.see helene curtis,assessment appeals bd.supra,th at,d.
nor is the board june,action impaired because the board recognized pta as curtis agent in other contexts,such as mailing the waiver form and notice to pta on october,and answering the petition for mandate which admitted that offringa was an employee of curtis agent,property tax assistance,inc.it was not inconsistent for the board to treat pta as curtis agent,but also to require that offringa supply the form of authorization specifically required in order to participate in the hearing.by doing so,the board acted not to negate pta authority,but only to assure itself,as prescribed,that pta,which had not filed the application,was now authorized to pursue it.
even if the board june decision based on curtis nonappearance had been improper,the rules provided curtis with a ready remedy,through a request for reinstatement,under rule and local rule.curtis was bound to exhaust that administrative remedy,as a jurisdictional precondition to seeking judicial relief.and curtis did.although its request for reinstatement was filed days beyond the period fixed by the rules,the board not only entertained the request but granted it.however,as previously described,when the board ascertained that curtis had not and would not waive the provision of subdivision c,the board nullified the reinstatement.the trial court subsequently approved this disposi
