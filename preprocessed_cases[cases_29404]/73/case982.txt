michael keller appeals the tax court order upholding the commissioner of internal revenue imposition of penalties for his tax underpayment for years and.keller now concedes that a percent penalty for negligence is appropriate under b but contests the enhancement to a percent penalty for gross valuation misstatements under h.because we agree with keller that,under the law of this circuit,his tax underpayment is not attributable to a valuation overstatement,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand to the tax court for calculation of the percent negligence penalty.
keller is one of hundreds of individuals who obtained illegitimate tax benefits through the sheep and cattle investment shams directed by walter hoyt,iii.this court is,by now,quite familiar with hoyt inspired cases.see,river city ranches comm r,cir durham farms,comm r.cir unpublished river city ranches comm r.cir unpublished.unlike many of his fellow investors,keller was not a hoyt,his participation was limited to contributing money as a solo investor.
keller is employed by the united states government military sealift command and has been since.in the three years preceding his investment with hoyt,keller income ranged from to.although keller first learned of the hoyt investment scheme as far back as,his interest was piqued in december by colleagues while on a tour of duty at sea.the captain,and many other shipmates,were partners involved in the business of owning registered cattle.
keller colleagues informed him the investment scheme,which afforded significant tax savings,was found to be legitimate by the tax court in the bales case and gave him promotional materials to review.he found the promotional materials was described as one of the top cattlemen in the industry who had been in business for forty years.in keller opinion,if the investment scheme were not legitimate,it would already have been shut down by the securities and exchange commission.although keller recognized he would receive significant tax savings through depreciation deductions at the beginning of the investment,he also claims to have expected a profit.
in february,keller requested additional information from hoyt and was contacted by dave barnes,a hoyt representative.barnes provided promotional materials and asked keller to fill out a credit application and attach tax returns from the previous years.eventually the two met at a hoyt ranch in elk grove,california.the meeting lasted several hours and covered the investment opportunity generally and also included a description by barnes of the outcome in bales.keller was additionally given independent media publications and cattle count reports.
keller ultimately decided to invest in late february or early march.he signed a promissory note to repay in exchange for of which were only in the embryonic stage at purchase.other sales documents included a bill of sale,a certificate of warranty,a sales order,and a security agreement.at no time in the purchasing process did keller ever consult a tax expert or attorney regarding his investment.
keller made no initial payments,other than a application fee,to hoyt to finance his investment.instead,he agreed to allocate percent of the tax savings he enjoyed from the investment back to hoyt.he did,however,eventually begin making payments on the promissory note of a little over each month.upon finalization of the investment,hoyt accounting department immediately began preparing keller tax returns for and.
as it turns out,keller may not have acquired any cattle in the first instance.during hoyt and his criminal trial,the government described the cow shortage as severe and pervasive.the shortage was growing,and yet nonexistent phantom cows continued to be sold to new investors.additionally,the same identified by name and ear tag often sold to more than one investor.regardless,and although the purported cattle purchase did not occur until,keller return contained a schedule schedule on which profits or losses associated with farming are did the return.the return reported a net loss of and the return a loss of.depreciation schedules showed the cost basis of the cattle to be in and in.
because keller losses for were so large and eliminated the totality of his income taxes with some loss leftover,he was able to carry back losses to eliminate any taxes that had been owed for,and.keller was issued a refund of for and a total of for the carry back years.hoyt collected for and for the carry back years for his services.including the allocation of tax savings and the payments made on the promissory note,keller ultimately paid hoyt a total of.
prior to the filing of the return,the commissioner sent keller notice that deductions stemming from the hoyt tax shelter were unlikely to be allowable.any return claiming a refund was to be reduced by the amount generated from the hoyt investment scheme.it also warned of the penalties under that would be applied in appropriate cases.the return was nonetheless filed,including deductions,and requested a refund of.a refund was never issued.
on february,the commissioner sent keller a letter informing him that his and returns were under examination.a notice of deficiency,dated may,was later sent indicating a deficiency of for and for.the commissioner also assessed accuracy penalties under h of for and for is,an additional amount equal to percent of the underpayment.the deficiency was based on the commissioner conclusion that the cattle were not actually being used in a trade or business or to generate income.the percent penalty was applied due to alleged gross valuation misstatements in the claimed value of the cattle.
keller petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.however,prior to trial,keller and the commissioner stipulated that keller should not have been entitled to any deductions.the issue at trial was thus reduced to the imposition of penalties.the tax court determined that if keller had in fact not acquired any cattle,his basis in the cattle would be zero for the relevant tax years,far below the claimed bases,and thus supported the percent penalty for gross valuation misstatements.the court also found the percent penalty for negligence applicable and rejected keller other defenses.accordingly,it upheld the deficiency and penalty amounts in full.this appeal followed.
the factual findings underpinning whether an underpayment is attributable to a valuation overstatement are reviewed for clear error.wolf comm r,cir.application of the facts to the requirements of is a question of law reviewed de novo.see gainer comm r,cir reviewing,a statute also imposing penalties for underpayment attributable to valuation overstatements.
in his briefing before this court,the commissioner concedes that application of the gross valuation misstatement penalty to the tax year was inappropriate because keller purported purchase of cattle did not occur until.keller,on the other hand,concedes that a negligence penalty under b is appropriate for both tax years and.the question that remains for us is whether,for tax year,the percent penalty for gross valuation misstatements under h should be imposed other words,whether keller owes around plus interest as the tax court held or around plus interest as keller claims.
section of the internal revenue code imposes a variety of penalties for tax underpayment.as a general rule,when is applicable,the taxpayer is penalized an amount equal to percent of the portion of the underpayment.a.examples of when the percent penalty applies include taxpayer negligence,b,and substantial valuation misstatements,b the percent penalty is enhanced to percent,however,in the case of gross valuation misstatements.h.keller makes no argument that if h applies to him,he did not make a gross valuation is,he does not contest that the claimed value of the cattle was more than percent greater than their actual value.
instead,he challenges whether h is applicable in the first instance.the statute applies to situations where the tax underpayment is attributable to one or more gross valuation misstatements.h.keller argues his tax underpayment is not attributable to the valuation overstat
