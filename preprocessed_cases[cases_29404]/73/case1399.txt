background 
this appeal involves a claim for a drawback.a drawback is defined as the refund or remission,in whole or in part,of a customs duty,fee or internal revenue tax which was imposed on imported merchandise under federal law because of its importation.i.section j of title provides for a drawback when imported merchandise is subsequently exported.section j provides for a drawback when substituted merchandise that is commercially interchangeable with the imported merchandise is subsequently exported.section j a,added pursuant to the north american free trade nafta implementation act,mostly eliminates drawback for the type of merchandise listed in j exported merchandise that is fungible with and substituted for the imported that merchandise is exported to a nafta country.however,certain types of merchandise set forth in a are not subject to the j a nafta drawback restriction.those exceptions will be discussed infra.
the relevant provisions of j are as follows,with emphases provided 
drawback and refunds 
j unused merchandise drawback 
subject to paragraph,if there is,with respect to imported merchandise on which was paid any duty,tax,or fee imposed under federal law upon entry of importation,any other merchandise whether imported or domestic,that 
a is commercially interchangeable with such imported merchandise 
then,notwithstanding any other provision of law,upon the exportation or destruction of such other merchandise the amount of each such duty,tax,and fee paid regarding the imported merchandise shall be refunded as drawback under this subsection,
a effective upon the entry into force of the north american free trade agreement,the exportation to a nafta country,as defined in section of the north american free trade agreement implementation act,of merchandise that is fungible with and substituted for imported merchandise,other than merchandise described in paragraphs through of section a of that act a,shall not constitute an exportation for purposes of paragraph.
by its terms,j a generally eliminates drawback for merchandise substituted for the imported merchandise and subsequently exported to a nafta country.as provided for in j a,there are eight types of merchandise listed in a,however,that are not subject to the nafta drawback restriction and that therefore qualify as merchandise under j for which drawback can be obtained.in other words,drawback provided for under j is negated for nafta countries under j a but is rejuvenated by the other than clause reciting eight exceptions.the exception relevant to this appeal is a,which reads as follows,with the relevant portion emphasized 
a good subject to nafta drawback defined 
for purposes of this act and the amendments made by subsection b of this section,the term good subject to nafta drawback means any imported good other than the following 
a good exported to a nafta country in the same condition as when imported into the united states.
on may,merck imported kilograms of famotidine the imported merchandise to the united states from its manufacturer in ireland,at a duty rate of ad valorem.during july and august,merck imported an additional kilograms of famotidine,which,pursuant to the uruguay round trade agreement,was on july and august,merck exported kilograms the exported merchandise of imported famotidine to mexico and canada.although the exported kilograms was not the same material that was imported on may,merck then filed a claim for drawback seeking a refund of the duties paid for the kilograms of famotidine imported in.merck alleged that the exported merchandise was fungible with and substituted for the imported merchandise and thus that it was entitled to a drawback under j,which permits drawback for such merchandise.customs denied merck drawback claim,reasoning that j a generally prohibits drawback for merchandise fungible with and substituted for the imported merchandise when that merchandise is exported to a nafta country,unless the merchandise is of the type listed in a.because merck merchandise was exported to mexico and canada,and the imported merchandise did not meet any of the exceptions in a,customs determined that merck was not entitled to a drawback.
merck then filed suit in the court of international trade seeking reversal of customs decision.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.merck asserted that its exported merchandise was not subject to the nafta drawback restriction in j a because it met one of the exceptions in a,a good exported to a nafta country in the same condition as when imported.the government argued that the imported merchandise was the basis for the drawback claim,and,under the plain language of j a,the a exceptions apply to the imported merchandise,not to the substituted exported merchandise.because the imported merchandise was not itself subsequently exported,the government argued that it was not a good exported to a nafta country in the same condition as when imported under a and therefore was subject to the nafta drawback restriction in j a.the court agreed with the government and granted its motion for summary judgment.
the trial court first noted that the statutory scheme is inartfully drafted because portions of it lie within the laws governing nafta,while other parts are embedded within the statutes on duty drawback.merck,d at.the court then noted that the parties disagreed over the interpretation of the clause in j a that provides that the exportation to a nafta country of merchandise that is fungible with and substituted for imported merchandise,other than merchandise described in a,shall not constitute an exportation subject to duty drawback.emphasis added.merck argued to the court that the other than merchandise clause refers to the substituted exported merchandise.the government,on the other hand,argued that the other than merchandise described in a clause refers to the imported merchandise.
the trial court determined that,applying the last antecedent rule the term imported merchandise that immediately precedes the other than merchandise clause modifies that clause.the court therefore adopted the government interpretation that the other than merchandise refers to the imported merchandise and that j a eliminates drawback for substitute goods exported to a nafta country unless the imported merchandise is of the type listed in a.the court observed,however,that both interpretations lead to ambiguous,absurd results and renders impotent portions of the statutory scheme.merck,d at.hence,the court examined the legislative history and administrative regulations pertaining to j a.
according to the trial court,the legislative history of the nafta implementation act makes clear that congress sought to eliminate nearly all drawbacks for substitute unused merchandise exported to mexico and canada.the court observed that under merck interpretation of the relevant statutory provision,nearly all substituted merchandise exported to mexico or canada would be eligible for duty drawback.the court therefore determined that merck interpretation of the statute could not be correct.moreover,the court observed that customs regulations and headquarters rulings were consistent with the statutory construction that it proposed.the court therefore afforded that interpretation deference.the court concluded that the government interpretation of j a was valid,granted its motion for summary judgment,and denied merck motion for summary judgment.
merck timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
