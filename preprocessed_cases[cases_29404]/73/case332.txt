opinion of the court 
appellant cm holdings,the parent company of camelot music,challenges the district court holding that loading dividends used to fund insurance premiums for life insurance coli policies were shams in fact,and that the transactions as a whole lacked economic substance.we affirm,based on the latter reasoning,that the coli policies lacked economic substance and therefore were economic shams.we also affirm the district court assessment of penalties against camelot for inaccuracies in stating its income.
background 
the district court excelled in its explication of the facts.in re cm holdings.we review here only the minimum necessary,and begin with the basics of whole life insurance policies.
throughout an insured life,the insurer receives annual premiums to fund the policy.most of each premium is credited to the policy value.however,a percentage,known as an expense charge,is set aside to cover the projected costs of administering the policy.as insurers are,it is unsurprising that often these projected costs exceed actual expenses by a small amount known as a margin,which is credited back to the policy value at the year end when the actual expenses are known.
the policy value rises in time,not only because premiums add to the accumulating total each year,but also because interest accrues on the growing policy value at a rate specified by the insurer.this value may be used as collateral for a loan,called a policy loan,borrowed from the insurer.even when a policy is fully encumbered,the insurer still credits interest on its value.
life insurance policies are in two ways.first,upon death of the insured,the beneficiary receives policy proceeds free of federal income tax.second,the gain the policy value receives from the interest rate credited to it,known as the inside,accrues on a basis.
in the case before us,camelot purchased life insurance policies for of its employees known as coli viii policies because they were the eighth version of the coli plan underwritten by mutual benefit life insurance company mbl.camelot designated itself as the beneficiary of those policies.mbl coli business was later purchased by the hartford life insurance company hartford.we will first describe certain features of the plan,and then the events leading up to camelot decision to buy the policies.
a.the coli viii plan 
the coli viii plan purpose was to achieve positive cash flows from its inaugural year.its success turned on safe harbor.this permits life insurance premiums to be paid with the proceeds of a loan whose collateral is the policy itself,but only as long as this payment method is used for no more than three of seven consecutive years.to comply with this stricture,in years several events happened simultaneously on the first day of the policy year 
i camelot paid a premium of about million,creating million in policy value 
ii camelot took a policy loan of about million,using the policy value created by the premium as collateral 
iii the million loan offset almost fully the million premium payment 
iv in net effect,camelot paid only million cash.
cm holdings,at.the payment of a premium with the proceeds of a loan whose collateral is the premium it pays for is somewhat chimeral,but permits such a payment mechanism for up to three years,as long as policy loans do not fund the premium payments for the other four years.the result is that in years,in a simultaneous netting transaction,over of the payment for annual premiums and accrued policy loan interest came from a policy loan,with only the remainder paid in cash.
the payment mechanism for the following four years used a loading dividend to fund the premiums.for those years,in a simultaneous netting transaction occurring on the first day of the policy year 
i camelot paid the annual premium plus accrued interest 
ii approximately of the annual premium was taken by mbl as an expense charge,while approximately was credited to the policy value 
iii approximately of the expense charge was set aside to cover mbl actual expenses 
iv approximately of the expense charge was immediately returned to camelot in the form of a loading dividend 
v camelot received a partial withdrawal of policy value in an amount equal to approximately of the accrued loan interest 
vi the loading dividend and partial withdrawal were used to offset payment of the annual premium and accrued loan interest and 
vii camelot paid the balance due in cash.
cm holdings,at.the broad structure of the plan,then,was to fund year premiums with proceeds from the policy loans,and year premiums with a loading dividend that offset the payments due.
the interest rate camelot paid mbl on the loan it received affected the amount of deductions to which it was entitled.of several available interest rates,camelot always selected the highest one.cm holdings,at 
camelot decision to purchase the coli viii plan 
the evolution of camelot coli plan began in,when henry mccamish,a life insurance entrepreneur,developed a series of coli policies to produce maximum cash flow through interest deductions for the companies that bought them.cm holdings,at.the original plan evolved over time to reflect changes in the tax law.in response to a amendment limiting deductibility of policy loan interest to per insured,the payment schedule was altered so that payments ceased once the loan limit was reached.id.at.the plan was further modified to reduce the amount of premium paid per thousand dollars of death benefits to comply with,also enacted in.id.at.as noted,camelot purchased the eighth version of the plan developed,known as the coli viii plan.
the newport group,newport marketed the coli viii plan to camelot.jack rogers,the cfo of camelot,spoke with james campisi of newport in detail about it.campisi described the coli viii plan key factor to be its ability to absorb the interest deductions.id.at.in december,campisi sent rogers a set of sales illustrations showing projected cash flows and earnings performance.id.at.in a memorandum,rogers enumerated the risks attendant for camelot a retroactive tax law change,camelot failure to generate taxable income over several years in a row,and irs attack.id.at.
despite these risks,the policies went into effect on february.although the policies were designed to be mortality neutral,neither camelot nor mbl expected to profit from the timing of employees deaths,camelot did receive an unexpected aggregate mortality gain of million for the first eight years.cm holdings,at.however,even with this gain,absent interest deductions the plan would not have been profitable to camelot.id.at.hartford which,as noted,purchased mbl coli business later added surcharges to recoup its mortality losses and ensure that such losses would not recur.id.
after congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act of,stat,which phased out interest deductions on coli loans,camelot quickly instructed hartford to stop billing it for annual premiums and to allow the policies to function as policies for a reduced amount of death benefit coverage.cm holdings,at.at the same time,camelot made a partial withdrawal of policy value,called a,and used it to pay off million of the loan.camelot recognized the million as income,but was able to offset it with net operating loss carry forwards.id.at.
in august,camelot filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the district of delaware.the district court automatically referred the proceeding to the bankruptcy court.in november,the internal revenue service irs filed a proof of claim for million in taxes,million in interest,and a million penalty.camelot objected,creating an adversary proceeding,and the government requested the district court to withdraw the automatic reference from the bankruptcy court pursuant to d.the district court granted the motion.internal revenue serv.cm holdings.
on the merits,the district court held that the loading dividends for years four through seven were shams in fact,and that the plan as a whole was a sham in substance.it also imposed penalties under for camelot substantial understatement of taxable income.cm holdings,at 
ii.discussion 
the relevant internal revenue code provisions are relatively simple.section a of the code allows a deduction for all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness.a.however,provides that 
n o deduction shall be allowed for any amount paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry a life insurance contract pursuant to a plan of purchase which contemplates the systematic direct or indirect borrowing of part or all of the increases in the cash value of such contract.
section d provides a safe harbor,however,if no part of of the annual premiums due during the period is paid under such plan by means of indebtedness.d.in other words,although the irs generally allows deductions for interest payments on loans,if the loan in question is being used to pay the premiums for a life insurance contract whose cash value is itself the collateral for the loan,a deduction is allowable only if this mechanism is used to pay premiums for three years or fewer out of seven.
we can forgo examining the intersection of these statutory details,for pursuant to gregory helvering,and knetsch united states,d,courts have looked beyond taxpayers formal compliance with the code and analyzed the fundamental substance of transactions.economic substance is a prerequisite to the application of any code provision allowing deductions.lerman commissioner,cir.it is the government trump card even if a transaction complies precisely with all requirements for obtaining a deduction,if it lacks economic substance it simply is not recognized for federal taxation purposes,for better or for worse.acm partnership commissioner,cir quoting lerman,at see stores,commissioner,aff cir.the rationale behind the gregory and knetsch line of cases is that courts should not elevate form over substance by rewarding taxpayers who have engaged in transactions that lack any purpose save that of tax savings.the taxpayer has the burden of showing that the form of the transaction accurately reflects its substance,and the deductions are permissible.national starch and chemical commissioner,cir.
economic substance 
we analyze two aspects of a transaction to determine if it has economic substance its objective economic substance and the subjective business motivation behind it.acm partnership,at stores,commissioner,cir.however,these distinct aspects of the economic sham inquiry do not constitute discrete prongs of a rigid analysis,but rather represent related factors both of which inform the analysis of whether the transaction had sufficient substance,apart from its tax consequences,to be respected for tax purposes.acm partnership,at citations omitted.although our court has hinted that the objective analysis may be more important than the subjective,the latter analysis remains important.id.at w here a transaction objectively affects the taxpayer net economic position,legal relations,or business interests,it will not be disregarded merely because it was motivated by tax considerations.
camelot coli plan lacked economic substance.it fails the objective prong because,outside of tax considerations,the transaction had no net economic effect on camelot financial position.it fails the subjective prong because at the time the plan was under consideration and agreed on,all parties focused solely on the tax benefits the plan provided.ultimately the most damning piece of evidence against camelot is that the marketing information presented to its executives showed that,absent tax deductions,the plan would lose money.camelot agreed to the plan knowing the tax deductions were the only thing that made it worthwhile.
objective economic substance 
there are several different formulations of the objective portion of the economic substance inquiry.knetsch voided a transaction because it did not appreciably affect the taxpayer beneficial interest except to reduce his tax.at.internal citations omitted.in united states wexler we held that w here a transaction has no substance other than to create deductions,the transaction is disregarded for tax purposes,cir.in acm partnership we required a net economic effect on the taxpayer economic position.at.the main question these different formulations address is a simple one absent the tax benefits,whether the transaction affected the taxpayer financial position in any way.
we examine the coli viii plan deduction profitability just as the district court did.the plan was never profitable.as the district court pointed out,without interest deductions the cash flow illustrations camelot reviewed showed a loss of over million.cm holdings,at.
the main nontax benefits insurance plans generally offer are mortality gains to the beneficiary,who does not pay tax on proceeds,and inside.these benefits did not make the camelot coli plan profitable,however.even in the anomalous period where camelot received million in benefits,the plan was profitable only if deductions on interest are factored in.cm holdings,at.to correct for the problem of the unforeseen mortality gains during this period,hartford assessed camelot surcharges since to recoup its losses and ensure mortality neutrality going forward.id.at.
similarly,the coli viii plan did not use the second potential benefit of insurance contracts.no inside was possible because each month the policies had zero net equity id.at.
camelot attempts to characterize both supreme court and third circuit jurisprudence on economic shams as hinging on their fleeting and inconsequential nature.appellant br.at,citing acm partnership,at.for example,it points to the corporate reorganization plan in gregory ending as soon as its use was served,and to knetsch,wexler,and lerman.it argues that in contrast to those fleeting and inconsequential investments,the coli viii plan was a investment.
camelot misreads the case law on this point.duration alone can not sanctify a transaction that lacks economic substance.the appropriate examination is of the net financial effect to the taxpayer,be it short or long term.the point of our analysis in acm partnership is that the transactions offset one another with no net effect on acm financial position.acm partnership,at.it is not the brevity of the transaction that renders it an economic sham,but the fact that it is solely.the net effect in all these cases is the same a flow of transaction upon transaction that yields no appreciable financial benefit to the taxpayer absent tax deductions.
regardless,the individual transactions that made up the coli plan were fleeting and inconsequential.take,for example,the dividend payment mechanism of years,where a premium payment was made and simultaneously credited back in the form of a dividend from mbl,so that the net payment was far less than the credited one.or consider that the use of sophisticated computer programs ensured that the net value of each policy was zero at the end of the month,taking up what little value mbl credited to the policy each month.each separate transaction was fleeting and insubstantial.repeating a series of such impermanences can not lend substance to the scheme as a whole.
comparing this case with knetsch provides a helpful gloss on the objective economic substance inquiry.striking similarities exist.knetsch purchased in annuities paying annual interest,financed with nonrecourse loans with an interest rate of,secured by the bonds themselves.this investment cost more money than it made,unless interest deductions were factored into the calculation.the supreme court found that the transaction lacked economic substance.as the court in american electric power united states pointed out,
t he similarities between knetsch annuity transactions and the aep coli viii plan are striking.they include,loans,which paid for all but a small percentage of the total premium and generated substantial interest deductions.there was a pattern of annual borrowings,which consumed nearly all of the equity in the annuity bonds and produced even more interest expense.the potential economic benefit of the annuity bonds,substantial annuity payments thirty years hence,was wiped out by the borrowings.the only real benefit to knetsch was the tax deductions.
