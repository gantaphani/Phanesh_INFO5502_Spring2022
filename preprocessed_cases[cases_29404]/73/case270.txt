opinion of the court 
introduction 
an s corporation s is a small business corporation that is permitted to have its corporate income,losses,deductions,and credits attributed to its shareholders.this appeal arises out of nine consolidated cases before the united states tax court regarding the tax implications of an s election to treat its subsidiary as a qualified subchapter s subsidiary qsub under internal revenue code specifically,the parties disagree as to whether the qsub election and subsequent sale of the s parent creates an item of income under a a thereby requiring the parties who held stock in the parent s to adjust their bases in stock under a a for reasons which follow,we affirm the decision of the tax court,finding an increase in stock bases and declared losses to be improper.
in june,ten trusts for the benefit of the ball family trusts acquired direct ownership of all shares of american insurance service,ais with an aggregate basis in ais stock totaling.in,the trusts formed wind river investment corporation wind river,a delaware corporation.the trusts then contributed their shares in ais in exchange for all of the shares of wind river.this resulted in wind river owning all of the shares of ais.effective june,wind river designated itself a subchapter s corporation.on february,wind river elected to treat ais as a qsub under b prior to the qsub election,the trusts aggregate adjusted basis in the wind river stock was.following the qsub election,the trusts increased their bases in the wind river stock from to a new basis of 
following the qsub election and stock basis adjustments,the trusts sold their interests in wind river to a third party,fox paine,on september.after transaction costs,this sale yielded in cash and securities in exchange for all of the wind river stock even though they had received from the sale,the trusts claimed a loss in the amount of this was calculated as the difference between the amount actually received for the sale and the new basis in the wind river stock.the trusts shareholders tax returns were filed citing the aforementioned capital loss.
the internal revenue service irs determined the trusts should not have increased their bases in the wind river stock to following the qsub election.the irs determined instead that a capital gain of approximately million had been realized from the sale of wind river to fox paine.this resulted in a cumulative tax deficiency of for the nine trusts that have filed appeals in this case.deficiency notices were sent to the trusts on may and,stating the qsub election and the resulting deemed liquidation did not give rise to an item of income under a a therefore,the trusts could not increase the basis of their wind river stock under a a.appendix app.at.the trusts filed petitions with the united states tax court seeking a redetermination of deficiencies under the jurisdiction of a and.the cases were consolidated and submitted for decision on stipulated facts,under tax court rule as ball for ball iii by,et commissioner,cch,wl.as previously noted,the tax court found the increase in stock basis and declared loss to be improper.
iii.tax court proceedings 
the main issue before the tax court and now on appeal is whether or not a qsub election creates an item of income for the parent corporation under a a.the trusts relied on their assertion that the election resulted in a gain derived from dealings in property and,therefore,created an item of income under a.ball,wl,at.if the election resulted in an item of income,the new higher bases and resulting tax losses are proper.if it did not result in an item of income,the increase in stock bases and declared tax losses are improper.
more specifically,before the tax court,the trusts argued that the deemed liquidation of ais was,under,a sale or exchange of property creating a realized gain to wind river.they further claimed that gains from dealings in property are expressly included in gross income under a.they then contended that,although provides for the nonrecognition of that gain,it was still an item of income including tax exempt income under a a,which passed through to them and increased their bases in wind river stock under a a.to support their position,the trusts raised several contentions to the commissioner deficiency finding their bases were properly adjusted pursuant to a a,the losses were properly claimed from the sale of wind river,and the qsub election resulted in an item of income pursuant to a a.see ball,wl,at.lastly,the trusts cited united states and gitlitz commissioner arguing that the realized liquidation gain under and a,allowed an increase in basis,but that gain is not taxable under the provision of a.the commissioner responded to the trusts arguments by asserting that the qsub election did not create an item of income including tax exempt income under a a.
the tax court rejected the trusts arguments,relying on the differences between realization and recognition of income in determining what constitutes an item of income under as it relates to,and a.ball,wl,at.the tax court held that gain from a qsub election is realized and calculated under yet it is not recognized due to the provision of.id.once the amount of the realized gain has been calculated,the entire amount of the realized gain is recognized unless a code section provides for nonrecognition treatment.furthermore,the court found,under,that when a gain is unrecognized,it does not rise to the level of income and is not an item of income for tax purposes.id.at.finally,the court distinguished gitlitz and farley and determined that neither case is squarely on point.ball,wl,at.the court reasoned that gitlitz and farley only established that the nature of discharge of indebtedness as income is not affected by an exclusion elsewhere in the code.see id.here,however,realized gain from the qsub election was never included explicitly in gross income and was never excluded from gross income.id.therefore,the tax court determined gitlitz and farley were unpersuasive in qualifying the qsub election as an item of income under id.
in sum,the court held that unrecognized gain resulting from the qsub election did not create an item of income or tax exempt income pursuant to a a.id.at.accordingly,the trusts were found deficient for improperly adjusting their bases in wind river stock following the qsub election and this appeal followed.id.

discussion 
items of income 
as previously noted,the main issue before us is whether or not the qsub election created an item of income.an item of income is required for a shareholder of an s to increase the basis in his or her of the s.see a a despite use of the term item of income in,it is not defined in the internal revenue code and the treasury regulations provide only guidance see a see also comm r glenshaw glass.gross income,however,is defined.it is governed by,and includes g ains derived from dealings in property,as well as i ncome from discharge of indebtedness.id.a.further,the supreme court has defined gross income as accessions to wealth,clearly realized,and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.glenshaw glass,at.gains derived from the property obtained by electing and liquidating the qsub are claimed by the trusts to be items of income for the purpose of.fundamentally,the trusts claim there was a gain from liquidation a,that gain was realized and calculated,and thus is an item of income.appellant br.at.the trusts summarily dismiss the effect of on whether a gain is income however,this premise is undermined by regulations corresponding to a under the a treasury regulations,gains from the sale or exchange of property,including those derived under,are not recognized,and thus not included in or deducted from gross income at the time the transaction occurs.c.b.
while item of income is a broad and undefined term,it is not one without limits.a provides a broad definition of gross income,that is sweeping in scope,unless excepted by another provision in the tax code.comm r schleier,d.the supreme court concluded that income requires an accession to wealth.glenshaw glass,at.the qsub election did not add wealth,it merely changed the tax treatment of the income flowing from the qsub.this reformation by liquidation did not provide an accession to wealth for the corporation and therefore could not create income for the trusts.
realization and recognition of gains 
the internal revenue code 
defers the tax consequences of a gain or loss in property value until the taxpayer realizes the gain or loss.the realization requirement is implicit in a of the code,which defines t he gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property as the difference between the amount realized from the sale or disposition of the property and its adjusted basis.
cottage sav.ass comm r,quoting.to realize a gain or loss in the value of property,the taxpayer must engage in a sale or other disposition of the property.id.quoting a.the commissioner and the trusts differ as to whether realizing a gain is enough to create an item of income under,or whether this section requires the gain to be recognized.the tax court concluded that nonrecognition provisions prevent realized gain from being included in a taxpayer gross income.ball,wl,at.the trusts contend that the tax court confused the concepts of realization and recognition.appellants opening br.at.they argue that the tax court reached the unprecedented conclusion that because no gain was recognized,the unrecognized gain did not create an item of income under a,or a a.id.at quoting app.at.the trusts assert that the crux of the tax court error is its determination that unrecognized gain does not rise to the level of income.id.they argue that the code can not be parsed to create some realized gain that is income and some realized gain that,by virtue of nonrecognition,is not.according to the trusts,realized gain is always income,a categorization that does not change if that realized gain is then unrecognized.
inherent in this conflict is which statutory provision,or,applies to the liquidation of ais via qsub election.section,governing gain or loss to shareholders in corporate liquidations,states a mounts received by a shareholder in a distribution in complete liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock.the payment via liquidation is realized and calculated by adding any money received plus the fair market value of the property other than money received.b.at this point,the trusts argue that the realized gain becomes an item of income by way of a and the supreme court holding in gitlitz.id.a g ross income means all income from whatever source derived,including g ains derived from dealings in property at.the trusts argue applies to realize the gain.the trusts claim the gain is defined in a and that it is then calculated under a.the trusts deem provision to apply only after realization under,without effect on whether the gain is an item of income.the trusts position is that this realized but unrecognized gain is considered an item of income and they are permitted to increase their bases in their wind river stock.
in contrast,the commissioner claims the gain must first be recognized to qualify as an item of income,and the gain in this case is not recognized due to provision.section governs complete liquidations of subsidiaries.id.emphasis added.an s may elect qsub status for its subsidiary if the s parent holds percent of the subsidiary stock,the subsidiary is otherwise eligible to qualify as an s on its own,but for the fact that it has a corporate shareholder,and the s parent makes the appropriate election in re majestic star casino,llc,after a qsub election,for tax purposes,the subsidiary is deemed to have liquidated into the parent under and.thus,a qsub does not even exist for federal tax purposes.majestic star casino,at.section then states n o gain or loss shall be recognized on the receipt by a corporation of property distributed in complete liquidation of another corporation.a emphasis added see also a no gain or loss shall be recognized to the liquidating corporation on the distribution to the percent distributee of any property in a complete liquidation to which section applies.
the treasury regulations further distinguish between and section applies only to those cases in which the recipient corporation receives at least partial payment for the stock which it owns in the liquidating corporation.b.
ultimately,the tax court rejected the trusts arguments under,specifically noting that,which governs the liquidation of a subsidiary of which the parent corporation owns eighty percent or more,applies here,not,which governs all other liquidations.ball,wl,at.the court held that a liquidation can not be governed by both and,thereby foreclosing the trusts argument that the gain was first realized under and then subject to nonrecognition treatment under.
the tax court is correct.the trusts fail to address the fact that,by its plain text,applies to a special set of liquidations that are treated under a different statutory scheme and do not create items of income.under the internal revenue code,a qsub election results in a liquidation.see providing that a qsub election is a deemed liquidation into the parent corporation covering the complete liquidation of a wholly owned subsidiary.section applies to the liquidation of a controlled subsidiary into its parent.boris bittker james eustice,federal income taxation of corporations shareholders ed.a qsub is a wholly owned subsidiary under b b i one hundred percent of the stock of such corporation is held by the s corporation.
the trusts argue that d recognition of gain on liquidation of certain holding companies provides that subsection a and section shall not apply to such distribution.d a.this,according to them,is proof that the sections are not mutually exclusive,because,if they were,there would be no need for the exception.that subsection,however,does not affect the analysis of a qsub liquidation at issue here.instead,it focuses on distribution s to foreign corporation in complete liquidation of an applicable holding company.id.it is not incongruous to say that a qsub liquidation,governed by,is only covered by but that other liquidations,covered by other sections of the code,may be covered by both and.rather,the complexities of intersecting provisions should be maintained.the tax treatise cited by both parties states that is an important exception to the general rule provided in.bittker eustice.as such,a liquidation is either governed by the general rule in,or it is covered by the exception in.as the tax court correctly held,a liquidation can not be governed by both.ball,wl,at.
gitlitz and farley 
the trusts contend,however,regardless of whether or not sections and are viewed as separate corporate liquidation schemes does not alter the result.appellants opening br.at.rather,the results of gitlitz and farley and the treatment of gains as income under a are dispositive.
the trusts rely on the holdings of gitlitz and farley,allowing a discharge of indebtedness to pass through to shareholders as an item of income,as justification for their own items of income argument specifically,the trusts argue that an item of income may be defined as gross income under one provision of the code,yet not recognized under another provision,and still remain an item of income for the purpose of.in gitlitz,petitioners were shareholders of an insolvent s corporation,which realized over two million dollars of discharge of indebtedness income in.at.even after the discharge of indebtedness income,the s was still insolvent and so the entire discharge of indebtedness was excluded from gross income under a and d a.id.at.on their tax returns,the gitlitz petitioners increased their bases in the s stock by their pro rata share of the discharge of indebtedness income under the theory that the discharge of indebtedness income was an item of income that was passed through to the taxpayers under a a.id.at.the petitioners in gitlitz then used the increased bases to deduct their
