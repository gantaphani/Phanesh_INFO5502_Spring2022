under section of the internal revenue code,interest is calculated at a higher rate for corporate tax underpayments than it is for corporate tax overpayments in principle,therefore,a corporate taxpayer could owe the treasury underpayment interest even if the amount by which the taxpayer had underpaid its taxes in one tax year or set of tax years was entirely offset by the amount by which it had overpaid in another tax year or set of tax years to remedy this apparent inequity,congress amended section in to include a provision for global interest netting,by which the interest rate differential is adjusted to yield a net interest rate of zero for periods of reciprocal indebtedness that is,periods during which the taxpayer overpayments in one set of tax years overlap and offset its equivalent underpayments in another set.see d,d.
along with section d,congress adopted a statutory,but uncodified,special rule,which makes section d applicable under certain circumstances to periods of overlapping indebtedness that occurred prior to the effective date of the statute,july.see internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of rra,c,stat.among other conditions,the special rule is s ubject to any applicable statute of limitation not having expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment,as amended by,d,stat.the question presented in this appeal is whether retrospective global interest netting is permitted when the limitations period for either of the legs of the period of overlapping indebtedness has not expired,or only when the period of limitations for both legs is open 
we conclude that the language of the special rule is ambiguous,but hold that the structure of section d as a whole,as well as its historical context and purpose,makes clear that taxpayers may benefit from retrospective global interest netting even when the limitations period for one of the legs of the overlap has expired.in so holding,we reject the argument of the commissioner of internal revenue the commissioner derived from an opinion of the court of appeals for the federal circuit on this issue,see fed.mortg.ass united states fannie mae ii,that the special rule is a waiver of sovereign immunity,and must therefore be strictly construed in favor of the government.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the tax court in favor of appellees exxon mobil and affiliated companies jointly,exxon.
background 
section d and the special rule 
as part of the tax reform act of,congress amended section of the to introduce an interest rate differential interest owed by a taxpayer on underpayments is calculated at a higher percentage rate than interest owed to a taxpayer on overpayments.see tax reform act of tra,a,stat as a result of the interest rate differential,a taxpayer may be liable for interest owed to the treasury even when the amount of its underpayments and overpayments offset each other such that the taxpayer owes no net tax.
even as it introduced the interest rate differential,congress recognized that it was inequitable for a taxpayer to be liable for interest owed to the treasury when no net tax is due.in the conference report accompanying the tra,congress directed the internal revenue service irs,by the close of a transition period,to implement the most comprehensive interest netting procedures that are consistent with sound administrative practice,pt,at.over the years,as congress revisited and increased the interest rate differential,it reiterated its expectation that the irs would institute global procedures that would result in no net interest being owed whenever no net tax is owed.see,at accompanying the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat,at accompanying uruguay round agreements act,stat,and urging the irs to implement the most comprehensive interest netting procedures that are consistent with sound administrative practice as rapidly as is practicable.emphasis added.
the irs had still not implemented global interest netting by when,as part of the taxpayer bill of rights,congress directed the secretary of the treasury to conduct a study of the manner in which the internal revenue service has implemented the netting of interest on overpayments and underpayments and of the policy and administrative implications of global netting.taxpayer bill of rights,stat.the treasury department submitted its report to congress in april.see dep t of the treasury,office of tax policy,report to the congress on netting of interest on tax overpayments and underpayments treasury report,available at.pdf.
the treasury report acknowledged that congress has repeatedly instructed the irs to implement the most extensive interest netting procedures possible,consistent with sound administrative practice,but reiterated the irs previously stated position that it lacked adequate statutory authority to institute global interest netting without express authorization.id.at.the treasury report proceeded to offer several suggested limitations in the event that congress acted to expressly authorize global interest netting.
first,it recommended that global interest netting should be implemented legislatively through an interest equalization approach,rather than through a approach.id.at.as explained elsewhere in the treasury report,under the interest equalization approach,a zero net interest rate can be achieved by crediting the taxpayer with a rate equalization amount equivalent to the interest rate differential for the period and amount of mutual indebtedness.id.at.in other words,interest equalization works either by increasing the interest rate applied to the taxpayer overpayment or by decreasing the interest rate applied to the taxpayer underpayment.see id.at.according to the irs,employing the interest equalization approach would require that at least one leg of the overlap have an outstanding balance.id.at.
citing the irs interests in finality and ease of administration,the treasury report proceeded to recommend that global interest netting should apply only to tax years that are not barred by statute.id.at.in addition,the treasury report recommended that global interest netting be limited to income taxes only,id.at that the taxpayer should have the burden of requesting,and demonstrating entitlement to,global interest netting,id.at and that congress make additional appropriations to cover the costs to the treasury associated with the implementation of global interest netting,id.at.
when congress enacted the rra,it rejected,in whole or in part,most of the suggestions contained in the treasury report.section d of the rra,codified as d,provides as follows 
elimination of interest on overlapping periods of tax overpayments and underpayments.to the extent that,for any period,interest is payable under subchapter a and allowable under subchapter b on equivalent underpayments and overpayments by the same taxpayer of tax imposed by this title,the net rate of interest under this section on such amounts shall be zero for such period.
d,d see note,ante.as evident from the text of the statute,congress rejected the treasury report suggestion that interest netting be limited to income taxes,making it available instead for any tax imposed by this title.d,d.congress also rejected the treasury report suggestion that the taxpayer generally bear the burden of establishing its entitlement to interest netting.instead,section d requires the irs to automatically apply a net interest rate of zero on equivalent overpayments and underpayments.see id.t he net rate of interest under this section shall be zero emphasis added as the tax court recognized in this case,the resulting provision significantly broadened the availability of interest netting beyond what was recommended by the treasury r eport.exxon mobil affiliated comm r,exxon.
congress did,however,accept the treasury report suggestion that global interest netting be achieved through the approach,albeit without requiring that there be a balance outstanding for one leg of the overlap period.see,at describing establishment of a net interest rate of zero w here interest is payable and allowable on equivalent amounts of underpayment and overpayment emphasis added proc,describing irs method for applying the net rate of zero,either by decreasing underpayment interest owed by the taxpayer or increasing overpayment interest owed to the taxpayer,depending on which period of limitation is open at the time the claim for interest netting is filed.
as noted above,the enactment of section d was accompanied by the adoption of an uncodified statute,styled a special rule,which permits taxpayers to seek retrospective global interest netting for periods of overlap beginning prior to july,section d effective date.the special rule provides as follows 
special rule.subject to any applicable statute of limitation not having expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment,the amendments made by this section shall apply to interest for periods beginning before the date of the enactment of this act if the taxpayer 
a reasonably identifies and establishes periods of such tax overpayments and underpayments for which the zero rate applies and 
b not later than december,requests the secretary of the treasury to apply section d of the internal revenue code of to such periods.

ii.procedural history 
over a period of years beginning in the,the irs conducted an examination of exxon federal tax returns for the taxable years of through.the result of the audit as tempered by numerous administrative and court challenges by exxon revealed that exxon had underpaid its income tax liabilities for the tax years through and overpaid its income tax liabilities for the tax years and.it is not disputed that,as a result,exxon owed no net tax.the irs had already collected interest from exxon on its underpayments,however,even though those underpayment liabilities were offset by exxon overpayments.accordingly,in december,exxon requested administrative interest netting relief by filing form with the irs,pursuant to the guidance of irs revenue procedure.see proc,c.setting forth procedures for requesting the net rate of zero.at the time exxon made its request,the period of limitations for the underpayment leg of the overlapping period that is,tax years may have expired,but the period of limitations for the overpayment leg that is,tax years was still open 
on february,after a final ruling by the tax court in related litigation,exxon filed a motion pursuant to c,requesting that the court determine the interest owed to exxon pursuant to section d global interest netting provision before the tax court,the parties disputed the meaning of the prefatory phrase of the special rule subject to any applicable statute of limitation not having expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment.see note,ante.the commissioner argued that this language required that the period of limitations for both legs of the overlapping period be open as of july,the date of the statute enactment,while exxon argued that only one applicable period of limitations need be open as of that date for the special rule to apply.both parties pointed to the language of the rule and certain extrinsic indicators of congressional intent.the commissioner,citing the opinion of the court of appeals for the federal circuit in fannie mae ii,further urged the tax court to construe the provision strictly,under the canon of statutory construction relating to statutory waivers of sovereign immunity.
the tax court sided with exxon,holding that the special rule applies when at least one leg of the period off overlapping indebtedness remains open.it rejected the commissioner argument that the special rule constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be strictly construed in the government favor.exxon,at.rather,the tax court construed the provision broadly,in view of the fact that it is a remedial provision,designed to provide the maximum feasible relief to taxpayers who owe no net tax.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded after considering the statutory text,legislative history and relevant policies surrounding section d,and the special rule,we hold that interest netting should be available even if only one applicable limitations period was open on july.id.at.
the commissioner timely appealed.before us,the commissioner argues primarily that the tax court erred in failing to recognize that the special rule is a waiver of sovereign immunity and therefore must be construed narrowly in favor of the government.like the tax court,we reject this argument.we further hold,with the tax court,that the structure,context,and evident purpose of section d and the special rule indicate that the special rule is to be read broadly,such that global interest netting may be applied when at least one leg of the overpayment underpayment overlapping period is not barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
discussion 
in reviewing a decision of the united states tax court,we accept the stipulated facts the parties submitted to the tax court as true and review the tax court legal conclusions de novo.nathel comm r,cir.
as noted above,whether exxon is entitled to a zero net interest rate on its overlapping periods of reciprocal indebtedness with the irs depends upon the meaning of the uncodified special rule included in the rra alongside section d.the precise issue before us is whether exxon has complied with the requirement of the special rule that any applicable statute of limitation not hav e expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or a tax overpayment.rra c,as amended by,d.the tax court interpreted this language in exxon favor to apply rules when a period of limitations remains open for either the overpayment leg or underpayment leg of the period of overlapping indebtedness.the commissioner argues that the special rule requires that the limitations period for both the underpayment and overpayment legs must be open for rules to apply to a pre period of mutual indebtedness.
i.the language of the special rule is ambiguous 
as in all statutory construction cases,we begin with the language of the statute.townsend benjamin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.every court to have considered the special rule has found that its language is ambiguous.see fannie mae ii,at t he language at issue is equally subject to both proffered interpretations,the parties efforts to persuade us to the contrary notwithstanding.exxon,at we also find the subject to language susceptible to either interpretation and can not determine,from the language itself,which interpretation congress intended.fed.mortg.ass united states fannie mae i,fed.cl,i t is impossible to tell from the plain language of the statute whether congress intended that the expiration of any statute of limitations renders a claim beyond the purview of the special rule,or that as long as any statute of limitations remains open,the special rule is applicable.we agree that the provision is susceptible to both proffered interpretations and that the intended meaning of the special rule can not be derived from the text alone.it is necessary,therefore,to consult the provision structure,historical context,and purpose as well as applicable canons of statutory construction in order to determine its meaning.
in so doing,we are particularly mindful of the longstanding canon of construction that where the words of a tax statute are doubtful,the doubt must be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer,united states merriam.
ii.neither revenue procedure nor the blue book of the joint committee on taxation are entitled to deference 
in an earlier case involving the same issue we face here,the commissioner advanced two arguments in favor of its interpretation of the special rule,each of which was rejected,first,by the court of federal claims and,on appeal,by the court of appeals for the federal circuit.see fannie mae ii,at fannie mae i,
the commissioner pointed,first,to irs revenue procedure,which states that the special rule requires that both periods of limitation applicable to the tax underpayment and to the tax overpayment have been open on july,proc,and argued that the revenue procedure is entitled to administrative deference.the court of claims and the federal circuit rejected this argument,concluding that an agency pronouncement not promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit congressional delegation of authority is not entitled to deference under chevron.fannie mae ii,at citing fannie mae i,fed.cl.at in turn citing united states mead,see also christensen harris,interpretations such as those in opinion letters like interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of law do not warrant deference.these courts similarly rejected the commissioner argument that revenue procedure is entitled to skidmore deference concluding that,because it sets forth no reasoning in support of its conclusion regarding the introductory language of the special rule,fannie mae ii,at,can not claim validity as a interpretation,and arguably conflicts with other irs statements of procedure,fannie mae i,fed.cl.at,the revenue procedure is entitled to little,if any,deference 
second,the commissioner relied on the general explanation of tax legislation enacted in,prepared by the joint committee on taxation,november,the blue book.see fannie mae ii,at.in describing the special rule,the blue book clearly states that a statute of limitations must not have expired as of the date of enactment july,with respect to both the underpayment and overpayment for the provision to apply.blue book at emphasis added.however,both the court of claims and the federal circuit declined to defer to the blue book interpretation,noting that it is a explanation and therefore entitled to little weight.fannie mae ii,at see also fannie mae i,fed.cl.at reiterating view that the blue book is not legislative history at all and finding it unhelpful in this case internal quotation marks omitted 
we register our agreement with the rejection of these arguments.however,it appears in any event that the commissioner has abandoned these arguments in this appeal.instead,the commissioner relies on a separate argument,which was raised sua sponte by the court of appeals for the federal circuit in fannie mae ii namely,that the special rule is a waiver of sovereign immunity because it authorizes recovery of certain retroactive refund claims for overpaid interest and thus discriminates between those claims for overpaid interest congress has authorized and those it has not.gov t br.at quoting fannie mae ii,at.like the tax court in the instant case,we reject the view that the special rule amounts to a waiver of sovereign immunity,and we therefore decline to strictly construe it in the government favor.
iii.the special rule is not a waiver of sovereign immunity 
under settled principles of sovereign immunity,the united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit,save as it consents to be sued united states dalm,internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.id.internal quotation marks omitted.it is true,as the commissioner argues,that a waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text and will be strictly construed,in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign.lane pena.these principles do not pose an obstacle in this case,however,for the simple reason that the special rule is not a waiver of sovereign immunity.
a waiver of sovereign immunity is a consent on the part of the government to be sued.dalm,at.it authorizes in a necessarily unequivocal way an aggrieved party to make a claim against the united states.see id.the special rule at issue here does no such thing.it does not create jurisdiction or authorize claims against the united states.other provisions of the tax code perform that function.as relevant here,congress waived immunity with respect to claims for interest in section a,which provides that i nterest shall be allowed and paid upon any overpayment in respect of any internal revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under section.a,a emphasis added see int l bus.mach.united states,observing,with reference to section a,that congress has waived sovereign immunity in the tax code to permit interest to be paid on certain refunds schortmann united states,fed.cl,the language of section a is too explicit to be misunderstood.it means what it says that the united states has waived its sovereign immunity to authorize the allowance of interest on any overpayment.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted doolin united states,cir reciting government argument that section must be strictly construed since it is a waiver of sovereign immunity.the special rule,in contrast,merely allows for the provision of section d to be applied retrospectively to claims raised under section a.
the supreme court has made clear that where one statutory provision unequivocally provides for a waiver of sovereign immunity to enforce a separate statutory provision,that latter provision need not be construed in the manner appropriate to waivers of sovereign immunity.gomez perez potter,quoting united states white mountain apache tribe,additional internal quotation marks omitted see also united states mitchell,where one statute supplies a waiver of sovereign immunity for a specific type of claim,related statutes and regulations need not provide a second waiver of sovereign immunity,nor need they be construed in the manner appropriate to waivers of sovereign immunity.here,section a unequivocally waives sovereign immunity for claims for interest,the calculation of which depends upon section d,which itself is made retroactive under certain circumstances by the special rule.the special rule might therefore be understood as a waiver of the general rule that congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect,bowen georgetown,but we do not believe it can be properly understood as a waiver of sovereign immunity.
we therefore respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the court of appeals for the federal circuit that the special rule must be strictly construed in favor of the commissioner.
iv.the structure,historical context,and purpose of section d as a whole favors broad application 
having declined the commissioner invitation to strictly construe the special rule pursuant to the canon,we turn to other means of interpreting the provision.
as stated above,the language of the special rule is ambiguous.but,as with any provision,the meaning of the special rule is informed by its context.see brown gardner,t he meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context.internal quotation marks omitted.interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.dolan postal.in interpreting the special rule,therefore,we consider not only the bare meaning of the critical word or phrase but also its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme,holloway united states,internal quotation marks omitted namely,the scheme created by congress in d to erase the inequitable effects of the interest rate differential.
the structure of d as a whole and particularly its use of interest equalization strongly suggests that the special rule is meant to apply whenever the period of limitations for at least one leg of the overlapping period of reciprocal indebtedness remains open.see reese united states,fed.cl,when interpreting ambiguous statutory tax provisions,it is appropriate to analyze other related tax provisions and seek an interpretation consistent with the tax statute viewed as an organic whole.internal quotation marks omitted,aff.as described above,under the approach,the irs can achieve the zero net rate required by d by either increasing overpayment interest owed to the taxpayer or decreasing underpayment interest owed by the taxpayer.see treasury report at u tilizing the rate equalization computation,a taxpayer would simply be charged less underpayment interest or paid more overpayment interest to effectively equalize the interest during any period of mutual indebtedness.because it is not necessary to adjust
