an employee of the city of chicago mistakenly addressed a notice to all nations church at east street,instead of true address,west street.the notice was pretty important it advised the church of its right to redeem title to the street property after the parcel was sold for delinquent taxes.despite the misaddressed notice,the city acquired a tax deed to the street property in.finally,after failed attempts to challenge the tax deed through state postjudgment proceedings,the city sought to oust from the property in.on the very day in march when the city came to take the property,turned to federal court and filed a complaint claiming violations of the fourth amendment.it also sought a temporary restraining order,which the district court granted after an ex parte hearing.the church then amended its complaint to state a procedural claim and moved for a preliminary injunction.the city opposed the injunction,claiming that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the suit under the doctrine according to the city,the church had already litigated the property dispute in state court.see court of appeals feldman,d rooker fid.trust.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court granted the preliminary injunction,reasoning that was inapplicable because the church never had an opportunity to challenge the city acquisition of the tax deed in state court.the city now appeals.
an church in the chicago neighborhood of englewood,took title to the street property in.rehabilitated the property and began operating there in.the church was not,however,deemed to be during the period from to,and so real estate taxes,totaling over,were assessed by cook county against the property.because of the delinquent taxes,the property was sold at a scavenger sale,a sale authorized by illinois law for properties that have been tax delinquent for more than two years,if annual forfeiture sales have not satisfied the delinquency.see ill.comp.stat,see also people meyers,noting primary purpose of scavenger sales is to return property to the tax rolls.under the rules governing these sales,cook county itself could acquire the property if no private purchaser bid the full amount of the unpaid taxes.see.comp.stat.g.apparently no purchaser bid the full amount of the taxes here because cook county acquired a certificate of purchase to property on august,which was confirmed by the circuit court of cook county about a month later.
cook county did not own the property yet,though.the certificate of purchase gave it the right to,among other things,assign the certificate of purchase to any party,including taxing districts.see.comp.stat.the city of chicago happens to be a taxing district,so cook county assigned the certificate of purchase to it as part of the city tax reactivation program,which,as its name suggests,attempts to reintroduce chronically property to the tax rolls.
with the certificate in hand,the city next step was to obtain a tax deed by filing a petition in the circuit court,which the city did in january.but before a tax deed issues,the owner whose taxes are delinquent is entitled to notice of the right to redeem the property by paying the full amount of taxes and penalties.see.comp.stat.f meyers,at.and this is where the mistake happened when the city addressed the notice,required by of the illinois property tax code,see.comp.stat,it used the wrong address.the city was relying on a document from the chicago title insurance company,which was also apparently incorrect.at the city request,chicago title performed a tract index search on property described by the city by pin number.the search revealed that the last recorded conveyance of the property was to beythel outcast church a name all nations church formerly used,and referred to the address as chicago,illinois.
there were two other notices that the tax code requires,one under,and one under.see.comp.stat.the former requires the purchaser,within four months and days following a tax sale,to deliver to the county clerk a notice of the tax sale addressed to the party in whose name taxes were last assessed.see.comp.stat.section requires a purchaser to publish notice of the tax sale in the newspaper.the city complied with the former section by delivering to the county clerk a notice that,this time,was properly address to at street.the city also published notice of the sale and redemption the correct address on west the chicago daily law bulletin.
after the city filed its petition for a tax deed,and the redemption period expired,the city filed an application for an order directing the county clerk to issue a tax deed.the application recites that the required,and been served,and the city counsel represented orally to the circuit court that all required notices had been served.based on these representations,on july,the circuit court ordered the county clerk to issue the city a tax deed the judgment.the county clerk issued the city tax deed that day,and the city recorded it seven months later.
the next thing we know for sure is that five years after taking title to the property the city filed an application in the circuit court of cook county seeking actual possession of the property.nine days later,through counsel,moved to vacate the judgment by filing a petition under of the illinois code of civil procedure.comp.stat.the petition alleged,among other things,that the city fraudulently concealed the proceedings by sending the notice of the right of redemption to at the wrong address.as for the notice required by,counsel for the church told the circuit court that he had no argument there and conceded that someone walked the correctly addressed notice to the county clerk office.but still the church claimed that under of the tax code.comp.stat,the judgment awarding the city a tax deed should be set aside because the tax deed had been procured by fraud or deception.attached to the petition was an affidavit from bishop edgar jackson,a pastor at since,who attested that the church has never been located at east street,and that he was always under the impression that the church was tax exempt.
the city moved to dismiss petition under.comp.stat,arguing that the petition was filed outside statute of limitations.see c.moreover,argued the city,what alleged did not amount to fraudulent concealment.at the outset of the hearing on the,counsel stated that he would like to reserve,if possible an argument that taxes should never have been assessed against the church because it was tax exempt.he then stated i not asking this court to hold this case up because that can be brought at any time.that would make it absolutely void because there would be no jurisdiction.but then,puzzlingly,counsel focused on his argument that the tax deed was void because the tax sale had been fraudulently concealed.counsel undoubtedly meant that he wanted to preserve the issue of tax exemption,rather than reserve he never actually made the argument in order to preserve it.
the circuit court ultimately held that the city mistake in addressing the notice did not amount to fraudulent concealment of the tax sale.thus,the court continued,provided nothing to circumvent the statute of limitations for actions under,and the motion to dismiss had to be granted.the court denied a petition for rehearing.the appellate court of illinois affirmed,city of chi.all nations church of god in christ,unpublished order,and the supreme court of illinois denied leave to appeal,city of chi.all nations church of god in christ,unpublished order.
once the mandate issued,the city renewed its application for possession of the property,which was pending during the proceedings.the circuit court held a hearing on the application in early january,at which agreed to an order granting possession to the city,provided that the order be stayed until february.on march,when a city employee came to put new locks on the property pursuant to the agreement transferring possession,he was asked by bishop jackson by telephone if the church could have just one more day.after discussing the matter with counsel for the city,the employee agreed and left.
bishop jackson spoke with the employee by phone because at that very moment
