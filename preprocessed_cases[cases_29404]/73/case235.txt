this case arises out of the plaintiff daniel carroll investment in a limited recycling associates stevens or stevens partnership.on the basis of a investment in,daniel and ingrid carroll the carrolls reduced the amount of the income tax liability that they reported for that year by.after the tax court held in a related case in that transactions of the kind employed by the stevens partnership were a sham,the tax matters partner of the stevens partnership entered into a settlement with the irs reducing the deductions and credits claimed by stevens to zero.
this settlement,which cost the carrolls all of their deductions and credits for,was confirmed by an order and decision signed by the chief judge of the united states tax court that bore a date stamp indicating that it was served on february.at the bottom of the order and decision,after the signature of the chief judge,there appears the word entered,but the line thereafter is entry date appears.the tax court vacated that decision some four months later and issued a second order and decision,identical to the first except that it included an introductory section explaining the purpose of the second order and decision a new served date and a date stamp on the entered line at the foot of the decision so that it reads,entered jun.the irs thereafter filed a notice of deficiency against the carrolls within the statutory limitations period applicable to the second order and decision,but after the expiration of the statutory limitations period applicable to the first.
on september,having paid the taxes and penalties assessed against them and filed refund claims with the irs,the carrolls brought suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york contending,inter alia,that the notices of deficiency were untimely because the initial decision without the entered date started the statutory limitations period running.the district court denis hurley,judge initially ruled against the carrolls.carroll united states,no.cv,wl,dist.lexis,carroll i.on reconsideration,however,the court decided in the carrolls favor as to the untimeliness of the notices of deficiency.carroll united states,no.cv,wl,dist.lexis,carroll ii.on further reconsideration,the court granted the irs motion to deny the carrolls relief in excess of,the amount of the penalties paid by the carrolls in the two years immediately preceding the date of their refund claim,pursuant to b b.carroll united states,d carroll iii.
the irs appeals from the entry of partial summary judgment for the carrolls.it argues that the initial tax court decision without the entry date was not validly rendered under section c and therefore did not start the statutory limitations period running.the irs also argues that res judicata bars the district court from ruling on the matter because the matter should have been raised as an appeal from the second tax court decision.in a,the carrolls assert that they are entitled to a full refund of the disputed penalties.
like the district court,we conclude that the irs notice of deficiency was untimely and that this suit is not barred by principles of res judicata.we disagree with the district court,however,as to the amount refundable to the carrolls,concluding that the provision of section b b does not prevent the carrolls from recovering the full amount of the penalties that they paid for.we therefore affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
background 
the relevant facts,which are set forth in detail in carroll i,carroll ii,and carroll iii,are undisputed.we rehearse them here only insofar as we think it necessary to explain our resolution of this appeal.

the first tax court decision 
on february,tax court special trial judge norman wolfe granted the irs motion by endorsing it with the stamp granted.on february,the decision was served on the parties.also on february,tax court chief judge hamblen,signed an order and decision the first tax court decision or the first decision resolving all of the issues relating to stevens income for the tax years through.carroll ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.this decision bore no date in the space after the word entered at the bottom of the document,following chief judge hamblen signature.id.the only date on the decision was a stamp on its first page served feb.id.the tax court docket sheet reflected the entry,decision entered,judge hamblen,on the date,and indicated service of the decision upon all parties on the same date.id.

the notice of deficiency 
the internal revenue code the irc or the code provides a period of limitations after a tax court judgment becomes final in which the irs may assess the taxpayer for a deficiency.d.on july,one year after the second tax court decision became final,but more than one year after the first tax court decision became irs issued a notice of deficiency to the carrolls for the tax year.the notice asserted deficiencies for negligence,tax motivated interest,and valuation overstatement penalties under sections a and of the irc,a.carroll ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.

proceedings in the district court

in a judgment dated february,the district court awarded the carrolls plus statutory interest with respect to the penalties plus statutory interest for income averaging in and plus statutory interest as a pro rata reduction of the assessed additions for interest.

ii.principal applicable statutory provisions 
the principal statutory provisions,the interplay among which is at the heart of the appeal,are the following sections of title of the united states code 
period of limitations for making assessments 
a general as otherwise provided in this section,the period for assessing any tax imposed by subtitle a with respect to any person which is attributable to any partnership item or affected item for a partnership taxable year shall not expire before the date which is years after the later of

notice of appeal 
review of a decision of the tax court shall be obtained by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the tax court within days after the decision of the tax court is entered 
iii.whether the notice of deficiency was timely 
the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,establishes uniform procedures for taxation of partnerships.tefra requires,among other things,that the tax treatment of partnership items item s required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year must be determined at the partnership level.a.as tax matters partner for the stevens partnership,acting for the partnership,sam winer entered into a settlement with the irs for the final adjustment of the taxes related to stevens.after winer settlement was reduced to judgment by the tax court,a appeal to that judgment had to be brought in tax court within ninety days if the partnership did not appeal,the decision would become final upon the expiration of the period.id.a.no such appeal was taken.the judgment then became final,and no individual stevens partner could thereafter contest the taxes and interest determined in that proceeding.see monti united states,cir 
unlike taxes and related interest,penalties are determined on an individual partner level.the irs asserts such a claim by sending individualized notices of deficiency to the partners whom the irs contends are subject to penalties.chimblo comm r,cir,cert.denied,d.the irs must issue any notices of deficiency within one year of the date upon which the judgment becomes final.see d.an individual partner may then challenge his or her notice of deficiency by paying the assessment and bringing suit for a refund in district court,or,if the partner does not first pay the assessment,by seeking relief in tax court.see flora united states,d.
as we have noted,the tax court first decision in this matter was signed,served on the parties,and stamped served feb,but no date was printed after the word entered following the chief judge signature at the foot of the decision.the chief judge therefore issued a second decision on june,after the first decision if it was valid and effective became final.the second decision attributed the omission of the requisite entered date on the first decision to a clerical error,vacated and set aside the first decision,and repeated the first decision in haec verba,except that the date of service was june,and the date line at the foot of the document,marked entered,was completed.carroll ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
because there was no appeal from the first decision,it is undisputed that,if that decision was effective despite the missing date,then it became final pursuant to sections and ninety days after that may,the irs time to issue a notice of deficiency to the individual stevens partners,including the carrolls,under section d expired one year may.the notice of deficiency was not in fact issued until july,long after that limitations period had ended.but if the first decision was ineffective because of the absence of an entry date,and the second decision which had an entry date of june was the effective one,then the time for the irs to issue the deficiency notice did not expire until early september,and the irs july notice of deficiency to the carrolls was timely.
section of the code is entitled date when tax court decision becomes final and provides in relevant part that the decision of the tax court shall become final u pon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a notice of appeal.a.section limits the time in which to file for review of a tax court decision to days after the decision of the tax court is entered.id.
the carrolls argue that the first decision was entered under section when,on february,having been signed,it was served and entered into the court docket,and that it therefore became final ninety days after may.agreeing with the district court,they assert that the tax court had no authority under these circumstances to vacate the first decision once it became final,see carroll ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing cases,and that,even if the tax court could vacate its first decision,then its second decision,by merely correcting a clerical error,could not restart the limitations period for the issuance of the notice of deficiency.carroll iii,d at citing lieberman gulf oil,cir,cert.denied,d.we agree.
the irs does not contest the meaning of sections a and.it argues instead that c establishes a necessary additional step before a decision becomes final in an action under section,the type of action that resulted in the first and second decisions.the crucial statutory language reads 
date of decision of the tax court shall be held to be rendered upon the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered in the records of the tax court or,in the case of a declaratory judgment proceeding or in the case of an action brought under section,a,c,or the date of the court order entering the decision.
c emphasis added.the irs argues that this provision distinguishes between the generally applicable date of rendering for deficiency judgments brought in tax court and the date of entry in the case of action s brought under section,id.c,such as the first and second tax court decisions.for the first group of judgments,the decision is rendered on the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered in the records of the tax court.id.for the second group,including the decisions in this case,the decision is rendered on the date of the court order entering the decision.id.the irs argues that this variation in language is important in light of the canon of statutory interpretation that urges against treating any words as superfluous.see,mountain states telephone telegraph pueblo of santa ana,d.
the irs argument proceeds as follows because section c uses different language with respect to dating the first group of judgments from that used for the second group which includes the judgments at issue in this case,the language variation must be meaningful.in contrast to the group phrase the date that an order is entered in the records,the group phrase the date of the court order entering the decision means the date printed on the entered line of the decision.since a section decision is within the second group,if it does not have a date on its entered line,then it has not been rendered.since it has not been rendered,it has not been validly entered.thus,the first tax court decision,having no date on the entered line,was not rendered having not been rendered,it was not entered having not been entered,it was never final and any time limitation with respect to it therefore never began to run.the second decision,by contrast,had a date on the entered line was rendered and thus validly entered became final ninety days after its entry and began the running of the applicable limitations periods on june.there were then ninety days during which an appeal could be brought before it became final,and one year thereafter during which the irs could issue deficiency notices to the carrolls and other stevens partners.the irs argument has the support of the other circuit to consider this claim by a former stevens partner.see conway united states,fed.cl.conway i,aff,conway ii.we nonetheless disagree.
section c does not say that the decision of the tax court in cases such as this one is rendered on the date on the court order entering the decision,it says that the decision is rendered on the date of the court order entering the decision.to be sure,the date on the court order entering the decision might be construed to be the date on the entered line,and there was none on the first decision.but the date of the court order entering the decision,using the plain import of the term,could have been no later than the date on which the decision was signed by the chief judge,docketed,and served on the parties.it is undisputed that that date was february 
we do not doubt that the difference between the language in the first and second clauses of section has meaning.there may well be circumstances in which the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered in the records of the tax court differs from the date of the court order entering the decision,and that the latter,not the former,applies to decisions under section such as the ones now before us.the notion,however,that the the date of the court order entering a decision,depends not on its signing,docketing,or service,but on the completion of the task of stamping the date at the bottom of the decision seems to us to border on the frivolous.
the irs argument that the first tax court decision was not validly entered,because not validly rendered under section c,therefore fails.the first tax court decision became final ninety days after february.once the first decision became a valid final decision,the tax court had no jurisdiction to vacate it under these circumstances see,lasky comm r,cir holding,at a time when the tax court was an agency rather than a court,that it lacked the power to vacate its own decisions,aff per curiam,d abatti comm r,cir holding that,although now an article i court,the tax court lacks the equitable power to vacate its own decisions except under limited circumstances such as fraud on the court see also vibro comm r,cir per curiam observing that the failure to file a petition for redetermination within days of the mailing of the notice of deficiency is a jurisdictional defect and that the period to file an appeal under section is an absolute restriction,and holding that failure to comply with the latter deprives this court of jurisdiction drobny comm r,cir.explaining that the tax court may vacate a valid final decision only in certain narrowly circumscribed situations internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d senate realty comm r,cir noting that the tax court may vacate a valid final decision on the grounds of fraud upon the tax court.the second tax court decision was therefore a nullity,at least for purposes of calculating the time in which to file an appeal or a notice of deficiency,and the limitations period expired on may,long before the irs issued the notice of deficiency.
moreover,even if the tax court did have jurisdiction to vacate and then its decision,we do not think that that act would restart the statute of limitations.the tax court stated that it was correcting an inadvertent clerical error and then repeated the first tax court decision in haec verba,with the clerical error the omission of the entered.because the court merely reentered or revised the first decision in an immaterial way,the second decision does not toll the time within which review must be sought.ftc regulator.lieberman gulf oil,cir.holding that the entry of an order correcting a technical mistake in a judgment pursuant to.a did not restart the time for appeal,cert.denied,d.
the court of appeals for the federal circuit,in conway ii,at,decided that such a conclusion was inconsistent with the practical approach of honeywell and its progeny.again we disagree.in honeywell,the supreme court considered the timeliness of a petition for certiorari filed within the filing period after the seventh circuit had issued a final decree that did not touch on the substance of an earlier decision which formed the basis for the petition for certiorari,but outside the filing period after the seventh circuit had issued a certified copy of the earlier judgment.at.the supreme court held that the petition was untimely because the final decree did not alter the substance of the earlier decision,so it did not restart the limitations period.the court observed 
while it may be true that the court of appeals had the power to supersede the earlier judgment with a new one,it is also true,as that court itself has recognized,that the time within which a losing party must seek review can not be enlarged just because the lower court in its discretion thinks it should be enlarged.thus,the mere fact that a judgment previously entered has been reentered or revised in an immaterial way does not toll the time within which review must be sought.only when the lower court changes matters of substance,or resolves a genuine ambiguity,in a judgment previously rendered should the period within which an appeal must be taken or a petition for certiorari filed begin to run anew.
id.at.footnotes containing citations omitted.the court continued the test is a practical one.the question is whether the lower court,in its second order,has disturbed or revised legal rights and obligations which,by its prior judgment,had been plainly and properly settled with finality.id.at.in this case,the tax court second decision did not alter,let alone disturb or revise,the legal rights and obligations of the parties the second decision merely restated the first while correcting a clerical error.
the irs argument might prevail if the first decision was a nullity and therefore gave rise to no legal rights or obligations then,the second decision might be viewed as disturbing or revising an ineffective first decision.as we have already discussed,however,we think that a tax court order and decision that is signed by the judge,served and docketed,and completed except for the entered date,is rendered and is effective.the absence of the date at the foot of the document does not render it a nullity 
in the final analysis,any consideration of honeywell practicality must work against the irs.while we understand the irs desire to construe the first decision of the tax court to be without effect so as to render timely its notice of deficiency,there is nothing practical about the notion that a decision otherwise final but,as a result of a clerical error,missing the entered date is a nullity.were that the case,the limitations periods for both taxpayer and the irs with respect to such a decision would run indefinitely until either someone caught the error or some other limitations period,if any,took effect.we can see nothing practical about creating that sort of administrative limbo.
we therefore conclude that the first tax court decision was validly rendered and entered no later than february,the period in which the irs could issue a notice of deficiency began to run ninety days later,when the decision became final the second tax court decision did not restart the limitations clock and the notice of deficiency issued by the irs on july,was therefore untimely.
iv.whether the carrolls suit is barred under the doctrine of res judicata 
the irs argues that the carrolls claim of untimeliness is barred by the doctrine of res judicata because all issues related to the tax court judgment were resolved in the tax court second decision or should have been resolved through an appeal from it.the irs contends that the second tax court decision resolved the questions of whether the first decision was valid under section c and therefore of when the limitations period for the notices of deficiency started to run.according to the irs,the second decision held that the first decision was a legal nullity because otherwise the tax court would have lacked jurisdiction to vacate it more than ninety days later.as the second decision was a determination,the irs asserts that these issues should have been contested at the partnership level through an appeal from the tax court second decision,because each partner who does not opt out is bound by the results of the partnership proceeding.appellant br.at quoting monti united states,cir.
the district court rejected this argument.first,the court reasoned that the carrolls action is not a collateral attack on the jurisdiction of the tax court,but rather an attack on the irs interpretation of the legal effect of the june decision as restarting the clock on the time period within which the irs was required to serve its notice of deficiency upon plaintiffs.carroll iii,d at citing banque nationale de paris broadway ownership,dep t.second,the court concluded that,even if the tax court had jurisdiction to enter the second decision,that second decision did not deprive the first decision of its finality or restart the limitations period for the notice of deficiency.id.at.finally,the district court noted that the adoption of the irs position on this point would require of these plaintiffs remarkable prescience because the plaintiffs were not aggrieved by the june decision until july,the date the irs relied upon that decision to issue,in untimely fashion,a notice of deficiency,id.at,long after the carrolls right to appeal the tax court decision had expired.
we agree with the district court.the carrolls suit is not a challenge to the tax court second decision,but a challenge to the timeliness of the irs notice of deficiency.the carrolls rights were affected by the actions of the irs on july,when it issued the notice of deficiency,and not before.by the time the carrolls received the notice,the period for appealing the tax court decision had long since expired.prior to that time,there was no certainty that the irs would issue them a notice of deficiency,still less that the irs would issue them an untimely one.in general terms,
u nder the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,a final adjudication on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.said differently,upon a final judgment on the merits,parties to a suit are barred as to every matter that was offered and received to sustain or defeat a cause of action,as well as to any other matter that the parties had a full and fair opportunity to offer for that purpose.
bank of india trendi sportswear,cir citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted second emphasis added.neither the validity of the first decision nor the running of the limitations period were or could have been raised in the tax court or on appeal from it.we therefore conclude that the carrolls suit is not barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
in conway i,the court of federal claims rejected the irs argument that the taxpayer was barred by res judicata from bringing such a suit.at,but concluded that principles of comity required deference to the validity of the tax court second decision,id.at.that conclusion was based on the fact that the stevens partners,by bringing an action against the irs with respect to the timeliness of its notice of deficiency,are attacking the tax court second decision collaterally,and principles of comity dictate against such collateral attacks on decisions of the tax court.but,as the conway i court note
