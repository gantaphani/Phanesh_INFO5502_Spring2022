ratified in,the first amendment to the united states constitution provides in part that congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances.plaintiffs are citizens who petitioned various parts of the legislative and executive branches for redress of a variety of grievances that plaintiffs asserted with respect to the government tax,privacy,and war policies.alleging that they did not receive an adequate response,plaintiffs sued to compel a response from the government.
plaintiffs contend that the first amendment guarantees a citizen right to receive a government response to or official consideration of a petition for redress of grievances.plaintiffs argument fails because,as the supreme court has held,the first amendment does not encompass such a right.see.state bd.for cmty.colls.knight,d smith arkansas state highway employees,d.
plaintiffs are numerous individuals and an organization that creatively calls itself we the people.for purposes of this appeal,we take the allegations in the complaint as true.according to plaintiffs,they have engaged since in a nationwide effort to get the government to answer specific questions regarding what plaintiffs view as the government violation of the taxing clauses of the constitution and violation of the war powers,money and privacy clauses of the constitution.joint appendix.plaintiffs submitted petitions with extensive lists of inquiries to various government agencies.on march,for example,plaintiffs submitted a petition with hundreds of inquiries regarding the tax code to a member of congress and to various parts of the executive branch,including the department of justice and the department of the treasury.on november,plaintiffs presented four petitions to each member of congress.those petitions concerned the government war powers,privacy issues,the federal reserve system,and the tax code.on may,plaintiffs submitted a petition regarding similar issues to the executive branch,including the department of justice and the department of the treasury.
plaintiffs contend that the legislative and executive branches have responded to the petitions with total silence and a lack of acknowledgment.in protest,some plaintiffs have stopped paying federal income taxes.
based on their view that the government has not sufficiently responded to their petitions,plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia.they raised two claims.first,plaintiffs contend that the government violated their first amendment right to petition the government for a redress of grievances by failing to adequately respond to plaintiffs petitions.in particular,plaintiffs contend that the president,the attorney general,the secretary of the treasury,the commissioner of the internal revenue service,and congress neglected their responsibilities under the first amendment to respond to plaintiffs petitions.plaintiffs want the government to enter into good faith exchanges with plaintiffs and to provide documented and specific answers to the questions posed in the petitions.
second,plaintiffs claim that government seeking to collect unpaid retaliated against plaintiffs exercise of first amendment rights.plaintiffs therefore asked the district court to enjoin the internal revenue service,the department of justice,and other federal agencies from retaliating against plaintiffs exercise of their constitutional rights in other words,to prevent the government from collecting taxes from them.
the government has responded that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over either claim because the government has not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the causes of action asserted by plaintiffs.as to the petition clause claim,the government has contended in the alternative that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted because the petition clause does not require the government to respond to or officially consider petitions.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint.we the people united states,slip op.at,wl.the court ruled that the first amendment does not provide plaintiffs with the right to receive a government response to or official consideration of their petitions.id.at.in addition,the district court concluded that the act bars plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief with respect to the collection of taxes.see id.at citing.
plaintiffs raise two legal arguments on appeal.first,plaintiffs contend that they have a first amendment right to receive a government response to or official consideration of their petitions.second,plaintiffs argue that they have the right to withhold payment of their taxes until they receive adequate action on their petitions.
the government renews its argument that plaintiffs claims are barred by sovereign immunity.in response,plaintiffs have contended that section of the administrative procedure act waives the government sovereign immunity.that section provides a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof the united states may be named as a defendant in any such action.the government acknowledges that section waives sovereign immunity from suits for injunctive relief.see dep t of the army blue fox,d describing section as waiving the government immunity from actions seeking relief other than money damages trudeau ftc,t here is no doubt that waives the government immunity from actions seeking relief other than money damages.internal quotation omitted.the government contends,however,that plaintiffs claims fall within an exception to section that provides nothing herein affects other limitations on judicial review.the government further argues that the act presents just such a barrier to judicial relief in this case because of the act provision that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person.a.
we agree with the government that the act precludes plaintiffs second to collection of taxes see bob jones simon,d.in asserting that claim,plaintiffs seek to restrain the government collection of taxes,which is precisely what the act prohibits,notwithstanding that plaintiffs have couched their tax collection claim in constitutional terms.see alexander americans united,d.
plaintiffs also raise,however,a straight first amendment petition clause,that they have a right to receive a government response to or official consideration of their various petitions.by its terms,the act does not bar that claim,and section waives the government sovereign immunity from this suit for injunctive relief,at least with respect to plaintiffs allegations regarding actions of certain of the named defendants.see trudeau,at.we therefore will consider that claim on the merits.
the first amendment to the constitution provides congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.const.amend.plaintiffs contend that they have a right under the first amendment to receive a government response to or official consideration of a petition for a redress of grievances.we disagree.
in cases involving petitions to state agencies,the supreme court has held that the petition clause does not provide a right to a response or official consideration.in smith arkansas state highway employees,for example,state highway commission employees argued that a state agency violated the first amendment by not responding to or considering grievances that employees submitted through their union.see,d.in response,the court held that the first amendment does not impose any affirmative obligation on the government to listen,to respond or,in this context,to recognize the association and bargain with it.id.at.
likewise,in minnesota state board for community colleges knight,the supreme court evaluated a state law that required public employers to discuss certain employee matters exclusively with a union representative this prevented nonunion employees from discussing those matters with their employers,d.holding that the state statutory scheme had not unconstitutionally denied an opportunity to participate in their public employer making of policy,the court reiterated nothing in the first amendment or in this court case law interpreting it suggests that the rights to speak,associate,and petition require government policymakers to listen or respond to individuals communications on public issues.id.at.therefore,the court concluded that individuals have no constitutional right as members of the public to a government audience for their policy views.id.at.
plaintiffs contend that smith and knight do not govern their claims in this case because those cases addressed petitions to state officials regarding public policy,not claims that the federal government has violated the constitution.plaintiffs attempted distinction is at best strained.in both cases,the supreme court flatly stated that the first amendment which has been incorporated against the states by the fourteenth amendment,does not provide a right to a response to or official consideration of a petition.knight,at.smith,at.nothing in the two supreme court opinions hints at a limitation on their holdings to certain kinds of petitions or certain levels of government.in short,the supreme court precedents in smith and knight govern this case.
plaintiffs cite the work of several commentators who suggest that smith and knight overlooked important historical information regarding the right to petition.those commentators point to the government practice of considering petitions in some fashion from the century in england through american colonial practice that continued in the early years of the american republic.based on this historical practice,plaintiffs and these commentators contend that the petition clause should be interpreted to incorporate a right to a response to or official consideration of petitions.see,stephen higginson,a short history of the right to petition government for the redress of grievances,yale,james pfander,sovereign immunity and the right to petition toward a first amendment right to pursue judicial claims against the government,nw,julie spanbauer,the first amendment right to petition government for a redress of grievances cut from a different cloth,hastings const,note,a petition clause analysis of suits against the government implications for rule sanctions,harv,david frederick,john quincy adams,slavery,and the disappearance of the right of petition,law hist.
other scholars disagree,arguing based on the plain text of the first amendment that the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances really is just a right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.gary lawson guy seidman,downsizing the right to petition,nw,norman smith,shall make no law abridging an analysis of the neglected,but nearly absolute,right of petition,cin.these scholars note that the petition clause by its terms refers only to a right to petition it does not also refer to a right to response or official consideration.see bailey,an universal etymological english dictionary ed.to petition to present or put up a petition johnson,a dictionary of the english language ed.to petition to solicite to supplicate.as they suggest,moreover,the framers and ratifiers did not intend to incorporate every historical practice of british or colonial governments into the text of the constitution.see lawson seidman,nw.at williams florida,d indus.of,kelco disposal,d despite this recognition of civil exemplary damages as punitive in nature,the eighth amendment did not expressly include it within its scope.
we need not resolve this debate,however,because we must follow the binding supreme court precedent.see tenet doe,d.and under that precedent,executive and legislative responses to and consideration of petitions are entrusted to the discretion of those branches.
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
so ordered.
the text of the petition clause of the first amendment does not explicitly indicate whether the right to petition includes a right to a response.appellants ask the court to consider the text in light of historical evidence of how the right to petition was understood at the time the first amendment was adopted.essentially,they contend that the petition clause should be read in light of contemporary understanding,which they suggest indicates that the obligation to respond was part and parcel of the right to petition.
as the court points out,we have no occasion to resolve the merits of appellants historical argument,given the binding supreme court precedent in smith arkansas state highway employees,d,and minnesota state board for community colleges knight,d.op.at.that precedent,however,does not refer to the historical evidence and we know from the briefs in knight that the historical argument was not presented to the supreme court.
the supreme court interpretation of the constitution has been informed by the understanding that 
the provisions of the constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form they are organic living institutions transplanted from english soil.their significance is vital not formal it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary,but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.
konigsberg state bar of california,d quoting gompers united states.even where the plain text yields a clear interpretation,the supreme court has rejected a pure textualist approach in favor of an analysis that accords weight to the historical context and the underlying purpose of the clause at issue.for example,in lynch donnelly,d,the supreme court stated that t he history may help explain why the court consistently has declined to take a rigid,absolutist view of the establishment clause.we have refused to construe the religion clauses with a literalness that would undermine the ultimate constitutional objective as illuminated by history.id.at.quoting walz tax comm n,d see id.at.nor is the supreme court rejection of literalism limited to the first amendment 
in the context of the first amendment,the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the significance of historical evidence.a few examples suffice to illustrate the point.in globe newspaper superior court,d,the supreme court acknowledged that 
the right of access to criminal trials by the press is not explicitly mentioned in terms in the first amendment.but we have long eschewed any narrow,literal conception of the amendment terms,for the framers were concerned with broad principles,and wrote against a background of shared values and practices.the first amendment is thus broad enough to encompass those rights that,while not unambiguously enumerated in the very terms of the amendment,are nonetheless necessary to the enjoyment of other first amendment rights.
id.at.internal quotations marks omitted citations omitted.in lynch donnelly,the supreme court acknowledged that its interpretation of the establishment clause has comported with what history reveals was the contemporaneous understanding of its guarantees.at.see id.at.in marsh chambers,d,the supreme court looked to contemporary practice from the early sessions of congress and to later congressional practice in holding that paid legislative chaplains and opening prayers do not violate the first amendment.see minneapolis star tribune.comm r of revenue,d engel vitale,d everson bd.of.grosjean am.press.near minnesota.
appellants point to the long history of petitioning and the importance of the practice in england,the american colonies,and the united states until the as suggesting that the right to petition was commonly understood at the time the first amendment was proposed and ratified to include duties of consideration and response.see julie spanbauer,the first amendment right to petition government for a redress of grievances cut from a different cloth,hastings const,norman smith,shall make no law abridging an analysis of the neglected,but nearly absol
