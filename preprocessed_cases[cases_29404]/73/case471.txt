the government appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of susan harrigill on her claim for a tax refund.because we find that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for harrigill,and because the government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for the government.
factual and procedural background 
on april,susan harrigill filed a form application for an automatic extension of time for filing her income tax return.the extension application stated that her estimated tax liability for was,her payments to date were,and the balance due was.the form was accompanied by a check for to the internal revenue service the irs.at the expiration of the extension period,harrigill filed a form application for an additional extension,which the irs granted.however,harrigill did not file her tax return by the extended due date in october.
on february,more than two years after the expiration of the extension period,the irs sent harrigill a notice requesting that she file her tax return.the notice advised harrigill that she had a credit balance of and instructed her to file a return if she wanted a refund or an application of the credit to another tax year.harrigill accountant responded with a letter indicating that she would seek an application of the credit.
on september,harrigill filed her tax return.in the return,harrigill claimed that she had made payments totaling,which included the that she had sent to the irs with her form.the was listed on line of the return as an a mount paid with form extension request.harrigill claimed that she had overpaid her taxes for,and she requested that of the overpayment be applied to her estimated taxes for.the irs treated the return as a administrative request for credit of an overpayment after applying the appropriate amount of harrigill payments to her tax liability,the irs complied with harrigill request and transferred the amount overpaid as a credit to her estimated taxes for.
harrigill also missed the due date to file her tax return.on or before april,harrigill submitted a form application for a extension to file her return.she subsequently filed a request for an additional extension,which was granted,making her tax return due on october.however,she did not file her tax return until december.harrigill return showed the credit carried forward from the return,estimated an overpayment of,and requested that the overpayment amount be applied as a credit to her estimated tax for 
the irs denied harrigill request for application of credit to her taxes on the ground that b a limited the amount of the credit application to the amount of taxes that harrigill had paid within the three and a half years prior to her filing of her return on december.because harrigill had not paid any taxes within that period,the irs determined that the maximum amount of the credit was zero.
harrigill filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi,seeking a refund of.the government moved for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that harrigill recovery was capped at zero by the b a period because she had not paid any taxes within the three and a half years prior to filing her claim.harrigill responded that b a did not bar her claim because her remittance towards her estimated liability was a deposit and not a payment.she further argued that it became a payment only when she filed her tax return in september.thus,she claimed that because she paid her taxes in september,she had paid sufficient taxes within the relevant period between june,and december.
the district court agreed with harrigill and denied the government motion for summary judgment.the court found that harrigill april,remittance of accompanying her extension application was a deposit rather than a payment.specifically,the court found that harrigill intent revealed that her remittance was a deposit under the approach taken by the tax court in risman commissioner,wl.the district court noted harrigill explanation that she made the remittance because she was having difficulties with her business partner who was also her,and she feared that she might not have the funds to pay her taxes in the future.the court also construed the irs february,letter,which requested that harrigill file her return and noted that she had a credit balance,as signifying that the irs considered the remittance to be a deposit rather than a payment.
harrigill subsequently filed her own motion for summary judgment,and the government renewed its motion for summary judgment.the district court declined to consider the government renewed motion and instead granted summary judgment in favor of harrigill.the district court entered judgment for harrigill and granted her a refund for an overpayment of plus interest running from december.the government now appeals from that judgment.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.perez united states,cir per curiam.summary judgment is proper when the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c see also blow city of san antonio,cir.the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law if the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof.celotex catrett,d internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,neither party argues that there is a question of fact both parties argue that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
in the present case,harrigill challenges the irs denial of her claim for application of credit from her overpayment of her taxes to her tax liability.she filed this claim with the irs on december,when she filed her tax return claiming an overpayment of her taxes and requesting that the overpayment be applied to her tax liability.as the supreme court has stated 
internal revenue code b a imposes a ceiling on the amount of credit or refund to which a taxpayer is entitled as compensation for an overpayment of tax t he amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period,immediately preceding the filing of the claim,equal to years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return.
baral united states,d quoting b a alteration in original because harrigill received a extension and then an additional extension to file her tax return,the applicable period under b a runs three years and six months back from the date that she filed her claim.accordingly,harrigill recovery is limited to the portion of the tax that she paid during the period running from december,back to june.
the pertinent question here is whether harrigill paid any of the taxes that she seeks to recover during the applicable period.for the purposes of b a,a payment of estimated tax is deemed to have been made on the due date of the tax return for that year.see b thus,the government argues that under b,the taxes that harrigill seeks to recover were deemed paid on april,accordingly,the government contends that harrigill made no payment within the applicable period and that she is therefore barred from recovery.
harrigill argues that the district court properly granted summary judgment in her favor.specifically,she claims that the district court properly determined that under the risman test,her april,remittance of towards her estimated liability,which accompanied her form,was a deposit and not a payment.she claims that because that remittance is properly viewed as a deposit,b does not deem her payment to have been made on april,because b is applicable only to payments of estimated taxes,not to deposits.therefore,she claims that she paid her taxes on september,when she filed her tax return.accordingly,she argues that she paid sufficient taxes within the relevant period.the government responds that the district court erred in characterizing harrigill remitta
