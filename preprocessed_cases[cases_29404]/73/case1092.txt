truth needs no disguise.
we must decide whether the tax court finding of a pattern of government misconduct amounts to a fraud on the court and,if so,whether such a fraud requires a showing of prejudice to justify relief.we conclude that the misconduct,including its persistence and concealment,did indeed amount to a fraud on the court.consistent with supreme court authority and the law of this circuit,we hold that no showing of prejudice is required and,for the reasons that follow,we reverse the tax court determination that these taxpayers are not entitled to relief.
factual background procedural history 
during the and,a group of individual taxpayers participated in an investment program and tax shelter designed and administered by honolulu businessman henry kersting kersting.the investments,which came to bear kersting name,consisted of a somewhat complicated program in which participants purchased stock with loans from entities financed by two layers of promissory notes kersting marketed the product as a legitimate investment which would enable participants to claim interest deductions on their individual tax returns.when kersting participants claimed those deductions the irs issued notices of deficiency,disallowing all interest deductions taken,and reasoning that the underlying transactions were shams,the interest was not paid or properly accrued,and the notes did not constitute a bona fide indebtedness.
in a tax court action brought by kersting on their behalf,program participants sought a redetermination of the deficiencies.recognizing that the sheer number of affected taxpayers approximately made it impractical to try each case individually,the parties agreed to employ a test case approach to determine liability.to facilitate this process,the bulk of affected taxpayers signed stipulations piggyback agreements agreeing to be bound by the decision of a test case trial involving representative taxpayers.the process provided that two representatives would be chosen by the taxpayers attorneys and five by irs attorneys.approximately taxpayers,some already having settled,signed on to the piggyback agreements.
the test cases proceeded to a consolidated trial before the tax court sitting in honolulu.the tax court ultimately concluded that the taxpayers were liable for all assessed deficiencies and would be required to pay additional negligence and transaction penalties.crucial to this determination was the testimony of john thompson thompson,the only taxpayer who testified that he believed the instruments creating the claimed interest would not be enforced.
as it turns out,that which the tax court and other participants believed to be a legitimate,representative proceeding,binding on the test case petitioners and all those waiting in the wings,was anything but.some time prior to the test case trial,kenneth mcwade mcwade,the irs attorney trying the case,and william sims sims,the irs attorney with supervisory authority over it,had entered into secret settlement agreements with thompson and another test case petitioner,john cravens cravens.cravens was one of the test case representatives,chosen by taxpayer counsel because his payment of capital gains taxes upon exiting the kersting investment program made him a particularly good representative.
a condition of their settlements required thompson and cravens to remain test case petitioners.mcwade also convinced cravens,who mistakenly believed his liability was finalized by the settlement,to proceed pro se.with respect to thompson mcwade agreed to have thompson tax deficiencies reduced in proportion to his attorney fees,which exceeded.at no point did mcwade or sims reveal to the tax court or to any other taxpayer representative that two of the test case petitioners cases had been settled,much less reveal the conditions imposed on them.
the deception continued with a,which was carefully designed to prevent the tax court and other taxpayers from learning of the secret settlement agreements.at kersting deposition,which mcwade attended,kersting lawyer objected to the presence of thompson attorney because of rumors that thompson was attempting to settle.knowing that thompson had,in fact,already settled,mcwade remained silent.mcwade then misled the tax court by failing to disclose the settlement when he moved to set aside the thompson piggyback agreement,a motion necessary to ensure thompson status as a test case petitioner.deceptive silence matured into overt misconduct when,during the course of the test case trial,it became apparent that thompson was going to testify about his settlement.mcwade quickly shifted his questions to unrelated matters 
mcwade and sims also secured an agreement with taxpayer dennis alexander alexander whereby the irs would reduce alexander tax deficiencies in exchange for testimony and trial preparation assistance.in accordance with this agreement,the irs paid for alexander expenses in hawaii for the length of the trial.mcwade then filed a memorandum regarding the basis for the settlement of alexander tax liabilities which the tax court later found to be false.during the test case trial,mcwade also sat silently through testimony by alexander that he knew to be false 
the tax court test case determination left the remaining who had signed on to the piggyback to judgment on the same adverse terms.this is when the house of cards began to collapse.thompson and cravens,who had sat silent while the tax court entered judgment against them,pressured mcwade and sims to live up to the terms of their secret settlement agreements.it was now clear that the irs would have to move to set aside the thompson and cravens judgments mcwade and sims were forced to reveal the secret settlements necessitating the tax court entry of revised judgments in favor of thompson and cravens.
after being asked to approve the set aside motions,senior irs officials determined that mcwade and sims had engaged in active misconduct and informed the tax court of the secret settlements asking for an evidentiary hearing to determine the extent of the damage.the tax court refused to hold an evidentiary hearing and proceeded to enforce the terms of the thompson and cravens settlements.the taxpayers appealed the refusal to this court,which remanded with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing.dufresne comm r,cir.
on remand,the tax court conducted the mandated evidentiary hearing.incredibly,mcwade pattern of deception continued with his persistent denial that the thompson settlement was a vehicle for paying thompson attorneys fees and his testimony that the thompson settlement was attributable to a separate transaction.after making extensive findings concerning the government misconduct,the tax court surprisingly concluded that what had occurred was harmless error.while the bulk of the decision from the original test case proceeding was reinstated,the tax court did relieve the taxpayers of that portion of the original judgment which imposed increased interest penalties for negligence and tax motivated transactions and imposed costs and attorneys fees on the irs.from the tax court refusal to vacate the adverse judgments against them,the taxpayers filed this timely appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

discussion 
courts possess the inherent power to vacate or amend a judgment obtained by fraud on the court,toscano cir,cir,but that power is narrowly construed,applying only to fraud that defiles the court or is perpetrated by officers of the court.when we conclude that the integrity of the judicial process has been harmed,however,and the fraud rises to the level of an unconscionable plan or scheme which is designed to improperly influence the court in its decisions,we not only can act,we should.england,at levander prober,cir intermagnetics,china in
