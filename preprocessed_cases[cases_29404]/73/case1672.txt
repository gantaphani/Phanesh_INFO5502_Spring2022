facts and proceedings below 
appellant dan agnew is a resident of washington state.in agnew bought a thoroughbred yearling in kentucky he named desert wine.before desert wine had ever raced,agnew sold a interest in the horse to fred sahadi.they agreed agnew would manage desert wine racing career and,if desert wine was successful enough to have stallion prospects,sahadi would then manage the horse breeding career at his cardiff stud farm in california.
desert wine racing career was very successful.given the horse success and future prospects,agnew and sahadi decided to syndicate desert wine,combining elements of both racing and breeding syndications.
after syndication,ownership of desert wine was represented by fractional interests initially owned by agnew and sahadi as tenants in common,owned by agnew and owned by sahadi.of these fractional interests,were eventually sold to outside investors or shareholders.of the fractional interests sold were sold while desert wine was outside california in washington state were sold while desert wine was in california and one share was sold in.
agnew did not file a california sales or use tax return regarding the desert wine transactions.however,respondent state board of equalization board discovered the syndication in a sales tax audit of sahadi cardiff stud farm.sahadi provided the board with one copy of the syndication agreement pertaining to one of sahadi five individually owned fractional interests in desert wine.however,because the board was auditing sahadi and the agreement stated the fractional interest identified in the agreement fractional interest of belonged to sahadi,the board did not concern itself with agnew at the time,and agnew had no knowledge of the board action regarding desert wine.
the board did not contact agnew about his potential california tax liability on sales of syndication shares in desert wine until.in april,the board served agnew with a notice of determination assessing sales tax in the amount of for unreported taxable syndication shares of the race horse desert wine plus interest of amount nearly equal to the tax a total of.agnew challenged the determination through administrative proceedings.he filed a petition for redetermination,requested an appellate conference,and sought a formal hearing before the board when his earlier efforts were unsuccessful.
in,the board issued a new notice of determination concluding agnew had been properly assessed in sales tax on all fractional interests sold plus in interest which had continued to accrue.the board granted agnew relief from a penalty.
agnew paid the sales tax of under protest and filed a claim for refund.he did not pay the interest amount claimed to be due.because the board maintained he was required to pay both the tax and interest in order to pursue his refund claim,agnew filed a declaratory relief action to challenge the validity of the board policy of requiring payment of interest as well agnew appealed from the trial court dismissal of his action after it sustained the board demurrer.this court reversed,finding neither constitutional nor statutory authority for the board policy of requiring payment of both tax and accrued interest as a prerequisite to pursuing a claim for refund.the california supreme court granted review 
in the meantime,in,agnew filed an action seeking a refund of the sales tax he had paid.the trial court again dismissed agnew complaint,finding he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to prepay the accrued interest on the assessed tax deficiency on agnew appeal,this court again reversed for the reasons stated in agnew i.the california supreme court granted review in agnew ii as well 
while both cases were pending before our supreme court,the board levied on agnew account at santa anita race track and collected.because the board had obtained a number of other liens agnew paid another in satisfaction of the total interest amount because sahadi had paid which was applied to the interest liability on the desert wine transaction 
in october,agnew submitted a claim for refund of the entire amount paid.the board failed to act on this claim.in august,our supreme court affirmed our decision in agnew i.the supreme court held payment of accrued interest on a tax deficiency is not a prerequisite to either an administrative refund claim or a subsequent action for refund of taxes in light of its decision,the supreme court dismissed review of agnew ii and remanded the case to this court.we entered a remittitur and our decision became final.
on remand,the trial court awarded agnew over in attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine 
in light of the supreme court decision,agnew requested the board to refund immediately the full amount of interest he had paid.when the board refused,agnew filed an amended complaint,seeking to recover the sales tax assessment plus the entire amount of interest the board retained.
after a bench trial,the trial court entered a decision and judgment in the board favor.the trial court found agnew was liable for sales tax on the sale of all syndication shares.
agnew appealed from the judgment.we affirmed the judgment in part,reversed in part,and remanded with directions.on appeal,as he had in the trial court,agnew argued sale of syndicate shares of desert wine was not a taxable event.we disagreed.we rejected agnew argument shareholders or investors acquired only tax exempt intangible contract rights to share in racing profits and the future right to name a mare for breeding.we found under existing law as well as the syndication agreement,syndicate shareholders acquired ownership to tangible property and thus transfer of title to this tangible personal property created a taxable event.we also rejected agnew alternative arguments transfer of a syndicate share should be treated as the equivalent of a nontaxable transfer of intangible personal property comparable to an investment contract interest,a limited partnership interest or the sale of a service.we similarly rejected agnew argument sale of a single horse to a single syndicate qualified as a occasional sale.
on the other hand,we found other of agnew arguments had merit.we found agnew had been improperly taxed on sahadi receipts.we also found the board had improperly assessed a sales,rather than a use,tax on the shares purchased while desert wine was out of state in washington.in light of the board concession it had never assessed or determined a use tax to be owing we found agnew was thus entitled to a refund of the tax paid on those shares.moreover,we found the board knew or should have known its policy of requiring payment of interest as a prerequisite to pursuing a claim for refund was invalid,once the supreme court decision in agnew became final.we thus concluded agnew was entitled to be restored to the position he would have been in had the board not retained the interest portion of agnew payments after the date the supreme court decision became final.we remanded the matter for the trial court to calculate the amounts due and owing to agnew in accordance with our opinion.we also directed the trial court to decide the remaining unresolved issues whether agnew was properly taxed on the first two sales in the series,on the sold for resale,and on the share sold in and outside the tax year in question.we ordered each side to bear its own costs on appeal.
on remand,the parties reached an agreement just prior to the scheduled trial date.the parties stipulated to a judgment in favor of agnew for,or nearly percent of the over he had paid in tax and interest.on may,the parties recited the terms of their stipulated agreement on the record in open court.the court ultimately signed and entered judgment on the parties stipulation on may.
on may,agnew filed a memorandum of costs seeking in costs,including in expert witness fees on the same date agnew filed a noticed motion seeking approximately in attorney fees under the authority of revenue and taxation code section in his motion agnew argued he was the prevailing party in the action against the board because he had established the statutory criteria of having substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy and by showing the board position in the litigation was not substantially justified.in his memorandum in support of his request for fees,agnew stated he was additionally justified in claiming costs,expert witness fees and attorney fees because the board had failed to accept his code of civil procedure section offer to settle the matter pretrial for 
the board vigorously opposed agnew motion for attorney fees and costs.the board asserted,among other things agnew had improperly developed a scheme to evade payment of sales tax on the desert wine transactions agnew had failed to disclose to the trial and appellate courts he had assumed sahadi tax liability as part of the settlement of their litigation agnew remained liable for those shares sold while desert wine was out of state nothing in the supreme court opinion directed the board to return interest payments already paid the board was not required to issue a separate notice of determination for use tax agnew unreasonable behavior during the litigation did not justify an upward adjustment in the statutory hourly attorney fee rate or justify any award at all.
the board also filed a motion to strike or tax agnew costs as either unauthorized or unreasonable.the board argued the general cost statutes in the code of civil procedure were inapplicable in any event.the board asserted revenue and taxation code section exclusively governed entitlement to costs and fees in tax related litigation.
the hearing on agnew request for attorney fees and costs under revenue and taxation code section came on for hearing on june.the court found agnew was not the prevailing party within the meaning of revenue and taxation code section.the court found reasonable minds could and did differ regarding the merits of the board position during the litigation and thus agnew had not established the necessary factual predicate of proving the board actions had not been substantially justified.accordingly,the court denied agnew request for costs and fees under revenue and taxation code section 
the hearing on agnew motion for costs and the board motion to tax or strike costs under the general cost provisions of the code of civil procedure came on for hearing a month later on july.even if he was not the prevailing party under revenue and taxation code section,agnew argued he was the prevailing party with the net monetary recovery under code of civil procedure sections and and was thus entitled to costs as a matter of right as augmented by code of civil procedure section to include expert witness fees.the court took the matter under submission.
on july,and while the court ruling on the cost motions remained pending,agnew filed another motion for attorney fees and costs under code of civil procedure section.in this motion,agnew claimed he was entitled to an award of attorney fees as well,because in this case an award of attorney fees was authorized by statute,namely,revenue and taxation code section.even if he was not,agnew argued he was entitled to his costs,including expert witness fees,because the board had failed to accept his pretrial offer of settlement and had failed to achieve a more favorable result at trial.
on august,the court denied agnew request for costs,finding section of the revenue and taxation code was specific to and controlled cost awards in tax litigation.the court thus found this more specific statute precluded an award of costs under the general cost statutes of the code of civil procedure.
a few weeks later on august,the trial court denied agnew second motion for costs and fees requested under code of civil procedure section.the court found agnew second motion presented nothing new and denied it as an impermissible and untimely motion for reconsideration.
agnew appeals from the adverse rulings denying his requests for fees and costs 
discussion 
i.the court denial of costs and fees under revenue and taxation code section was not an abuse of discretion.
agnew contends the court erred in failing to award him costs and attorney fees under revenue and taxation code section.he asserts it is undisputed he substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy.he thus notes the only question was whether he established the board litigation position was not substantially justified to entitle him to an award of costs and fees under this section.because he argues the standard of review is de novo agnew brief on appeal is primarily devoted to convincing this court to reweigh the evidence and find the board position in this litigation was not substantially justified.
in the legislature enacted a series of statutes collectively entitled the california taxpayers bill of rights.one of its provisions,codified as revenue and taxation code section,specifies a party emerging as the prevailing party from civil litigation with state taxing authorities may be awarded reasonable litigation costs including reasonable attorney the trial court determines that the state position was not substantially justified.
prevailing party in revenue and taxation code section means any party to any proceeding described in subdivision a other than the state of california or any creditor of the taxpayer involved which 
i establishes that the position of the state of california in the civil proceeding was not substantially justified,and 
ii i has substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy,or 
ii has substantially prevailed with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented.
california cases have defined a substantially justified position to mean one which is justified to a degree that would satisfy a reasonable person,or has a reasonable basis both in law and fact.wertin franchise tax bd.th,d citing lennane franchise tax bd.th,at d.t he use of the word reasonable in explaining substantially justified implies an objective standard that does not depend on an analysis of the subjective motivations of the government in taking the position it did.wertin,supra,th at d.in this regard,we stress that the taxing agency position need not be the one accepted by the trier of fact.so long as the position is one that a reasonable person could think is correct,it may be substantially justified even in the face of conflicting evidence 
the trial court concluded agnew failed to establish the board litigation position was not substantially justified within the meaning of revenue and taxation code section.we review the court ruling for abuse of discretion thus,agnew can prevail on his contention the board litigation position was not substantially justified only by demonstrating the trial court decision finding otherwise exceeded the bounds of reason.
there can be no serious dispute agnew satisfied one of the statutory elements for an award of costs and fees under revenue and taxation code section by substantially prevailing with respect to the amount in controversy.agnew succeeded in securing a judgment representing a refund of almost percent of the amounts he paid in sales tax and accrued interest.the question then is whether the trial court erred in finding agnew had failed to establish the board position was not substantially justified.we conclude the record contains substantial evidence which supports the trial court finding the board had justification for taking many of the positions it took in this litigation.
our conclusions and analyses in agnew ii are sufficient to support the trial court ruling.the primary purpose of this litigation was to determine whether sales of syndicate shares in desert wine constituted taxable events.agnew argued these sales were tax exempt.during the course of the litigation he presented numerous theories under which he claimed these sales should be tax exempt.in agnew ii we found agnew sales of syndicate shares in desert wine were in fact taxable.in arriving at this conclusion we rejected each of agnew proffered theories for status.thus,the principal point of the litigation resulted in favorable rulings for the board.
it is true,as agnew argues,the board took some indefensible,if not unreasonable,positions in other matters for example,the board did not prevail on its claimed right to retain the accrued interest agnew paid under protest after the supreme court definitively,and unanimously,held the board had neither a statutory nor constitutional right to require payment of the accrued interest in the first instance.the board had claimed,and continues to claim,return of the funds would have constituted an illegal gift of public funds.the board also lost on its argument it was still entitled to collect a tax on shares sold while desert wine was out of state although the board had concededly never noticed a determination of the applicable use tax due in the final analysis each side prevailed on certain matters,demonstrating the legal merits of neither side arguments were entirely wrong nor entirely an objective matter.
that the litigation position these parties took in this case was nearly equally balanced is further demonstrated by this court disposition of agnew ii.while normally a prevailing party on appeal is entitled to costs on appeal,this court was persuaded neither side was the clear winner,and significantly,ordered each side to bear its own costs on appeal 
as the trial court summarized its decision to deny agnew an award of costs and fees under revenue and taxation code section with each party prevailing on some issues at each stage of the litigation,this court must conclude that reasonable minds could and did differ.the plaintiff has failed to show that the state position was without reasonable justification.we find the court conclusion within the bounds of reason based on all the evidence and accordingly find no abuse 
ii.agnew was entitled to an award of costs under the general cost provisions of the code of civil procedure.
to recall,agnew sought an award of costs under the general cost statutes of the code of civil procedure.he contended,even if he was not the prevailing party for purposes of an award of costs and fees under revenue and taxation code section,he was nevertheless the party with the net monetary recovery and thus the prevailing party for an award of costs and expert witness fees under code of civil procedure sections,and.the trial court denied agnew request,finding revenue and taxation code section expressly disallowed an award of costs to a party in tax related litigation who failed to establish the state litigation position was unreasonable.
the board defends the court ruling,arguing section of the revenue and taxation code covers the field and precludes an award of costs or fees in any manner not authorized by this section.the board argues agnew thus was limited to bringing a motion for costs and attorney fees under revenue and taxation code section,and claims cost statutes in the code of civil procedure have no application to suits for refund of tax.we are not persuaded.
code of civil procedure section pertains to cost awards against the state.this section provides in pertinent part notwithstanding any other provisions of law,when the state is a party,costs shall be awarded against it on the same basis as against any other party 
similarly,code of civil procedure section,subdivision b provides except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.the definition of prevailing party for purposes of this section includes the party with a net monetary recovery.the fact agnew is the party with the net monetary recovery is not in dispute.he is thus the prevailing party for purposes of code of civil procedure section.
code of civil procedure section provides in pertinent part if an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award in any action or proceeding the court or arbitrator,in its discretion,may require the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses,who are not regular employees of any party,actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either,or both,preparation for trial or arbitration,or during trial or arbitration,of the case by the plaintiff,in addition to plaintiff costs.during the pretrial stage,agnew made a formal offer to settle under this section for a sum of with each side bearing its own costs and attorney fees.the board did not accept agnew offer.accordingly,under the authority of code of civil procedure section agnew was entitled to be considered for a discretionary award of expert witness fees as well.
because code of civil procedure section grants a prevailing party the right to recover costs e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute,we must determine whether revenue and taxation code section contains an express exception.as with other disputes over statutory interpretation,we must attempt to effectuate the probable intent of the legislature,as expressed through the actual words of the statutes in question.citations.our first step in determining the legislature intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citations.
when the legislature intends to restrict the recovery of costs or fees it knows how to express such restriction.revenue and taxation code section itself provides such an example by expressly preventing either the state or a creditor of a taxpayer from qualifying as a prevailing party.however,revenue and taxation code section contains no express exception disallowing a prevailing taxpayer from recovering costs except under its provisions.the statute is silent in this regard.accordingly,based on the actual words of the statute,we conclude revenue and taxation code section contains no express exception to the general rule permitting a taxpayer as a prevailing party to recover his costs under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.
although there is some duplication in the various cost provisions,we conclude revenue and taxation code section complements,rather than supplants the more general cost statutes of the code of civil procedure.under the cost shifting provision of revenue and taxation code section a prevailing taxpaying is eligible for costs,attorney fees.on the other hand,if the taxpayer fails to satisfy the criteria of section,a prevailing taxpayer would only be entitled to an award of costs under the general rule of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,as possibly augmented by code of civil procedure section.
this principle is illustrated by the decision in murillo fleetwood enterprises,in murillo buyers of a new motor home sued the sellers alleging violations of the consumer warranty act,the lemon law as in the present case,the act included a statute entitling the prevailing buyer the right to recover costs and expenses,including attorney fees,but was silent regarding the right of prevailing sellers to recover their costs and fees the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict in favor of the sellers and awarded the sellers their costs as the prevailing parties under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.because the buyers had rejected the sellers settlement offer,the trial court exercised its discretion to award the sellers their expert witness fees under code of civil procedure section.the trial court denied the buyers request to strike or tax the sellers costs on the ground the general cost provisions conflicted with the more specific cost provision applicable to actions under the act.the court of appeal affirmed and the supreme court affirmed the court of appeal 
the supreme court found n
