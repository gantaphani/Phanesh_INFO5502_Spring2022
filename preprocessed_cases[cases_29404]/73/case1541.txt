facts and proceedings 
juan lou gonzales owned saturn of antelope valley,a general motors gm auto dealership in the palmdale auto mall.as part of gm reorganization in bankruptcy during the great recession,it stopped making saturn cars.consequently,gonzales sought a chevrolet franchise from gm.gm agreed to award a chevrolet franchise to gonzales under certain conditions,which included that he find an automobile sales lot satisfying gm criteria for chevrolet dealerships and that he be ready to open his new dealership on a short deadline.
as the trial court later found,gonzales tried in good faith to lease or buy from appellant city of palmdale a lot in the palmdale auto mall suitable for his chevrolet dealership.but the trial court found,palmdale flatly refused to lease or sell a lot to him and otherwise made it impractical for gonzales to locate his chevrolet dealership in the palmdale auto mall.palmdale apparent reason was that palmdale preferred to have another dealer,maile who had a history of having a dealership in the palmdale auto mall,run any chevrolet dealership that was to be operated in the palmdale auto mall.
while gonzales was unsuccessfully trying to strike a deal with palmdale,he entered into negotiations with respondent city of lancaster to obtain a lot in the lancaster auto mall,which was the only other location in the area that satisfied gm requirements.as negotiations with lancaster were underway,the lancaster city council in august authorized in financial assistance to gonzalez to help him move his car dealership business to lancaster 
government code section,subdivision a mandates that a city such as lancaster shall not provide any form of financial assistance to a vehicle dealer that is relocating from the territorial jurisdiction of one local agency to the territorial jurisdiction of another local agency within the same market area.health and safety code section imposes the same prohibition on redevelopment agencies such as respondent lancaster redevelopment agency the parties refer to these two statutes together as sb.the parties also agree that palmdale and lancaster are in the same market area under the two statutes.
on august,within days of lancaster authorization of financial assistance to gonzales for his proposed chevrolet dealership,palmdale filed a complaint.the complaint named respondents city of lancaster,its city council,and its redevelopment agency as defendants,and named as real parties in interest gonzales and the entities through which he operated his dealerships jays,llc saturn dealership in palmdale and antelope valley chevrolet,chevrolet dealership in lancaster.the complaint alleged causes of action for violation of government code section,subdivision a and health and safety code section,subdivision a based on lancaster offer of in financial assistance to entice gonzales to move his car dealership from palmdale to lancaster.the complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the actions of lancaster city council relating to financial assistance to gonzales were void.the complaint also sought writ relief directing lancaster to set aside its resolutions and agreements offering the financial assistance the trial court issued a preliminary injunction on september.the injunction barred lancaster from providing any financial assistance to gonzales to relocate his auto dealership during the pendency of palmdale lawsuit.
while the lawsuit was pending and the injunction in place,gonzales concluded palmdale had firmly and finally rejected his efforts to start the chevrolet dealership in palmdale.believing he had to act immediately to meet gm deadline for opening the chevrolet dealership,gonzales completed negotiations with lancaster for a lot in the lancaster auto mall without any apparent financial assistance.gonzales closed his saturn dealership in palmdale on october,and opened his chevrolet dealership in lancaster on november.

discussion 
prohibiting financial assistance for only two years 
government code section,subdivision a states that a local agency shall not provide any form of financial assistance to a vehicle dealer that is relocating from the territorial jurisdiction of one local agency to the territorial jurisdiction of another local agency within the same market area.based on that statute,the trial court permanently enjoined lancaster payment of to gonzales that lancaster had approved in august while he was negotiating with lancaster about opening his new chevrolet dealership in lancaster.the court judgment stated the court declares and finds as follows the city of lancaster and lancaster redevelopment agency violated government code section and health and safety code section respectively when they agreed to provide financial assistance in the amount of to a vehicle dealer gonzales relocating from palmdale to lancaster.neither palmdale nor lancaster challenges on appeal that part of the court judgment.palmdale contends,however,that the court erred in limiting to only two years the ban on lancaster offering financial assistance to gonzales and his chevrolet dealership.the time limit in the court judgment states the city of lancaster and the lancaster redevelopment agency are enjoined for a period of two years from the date of the vehicle dealer relocation november,from providing any financial assistance to gonzales chevrolet dealership.
palmdale contends government code section and health safety code section permit no time limit on the prohibition of financial assistance to a relocated auto dealership.for convenience we will focus on government code section,but our analysis applies to both statutes because their only pertinent difference is the government code statute applies to local agencies such as cities,while the health and safety code provision applies to redevelopment agencies.palmdale argues,the prohibition against providing any form of financial assistance to a relocating dealer is not limited by time or conditioned in any manner.there is simply no two year limitation.in support of its contentions,palmdale asserts the statute clearly states that a local agency shall not provide any form of financial assistance to a vehicle dealer.but palmdale quotation on which it builds its appeal is incomplete.quoted more fully,the statute prohibits assistance to an auto dealer that is relocating as follows a local agency shall not provide any form of financial assistance to a vehicle dealer that is relocating from the territorial jurisdiction of one local agency to the territorial jurisdiction of another local agency,subd.a,italics added.the appeal thus turns on the meaning of is relocating.
the phrase is relocating implies a contemporaneous element,suggesting a city must not offer financial assistance to an auto dealer while the dealer is relocating to the city.see in re
