on rehearing 
marrita murphy brought this suit to recover income taxes she paid on the compensatory damages for emotional distress and loss of reputation she was awarded in an administrative action she brought against her former employer.murphy contends that under a of the internal revenue code irc,a,her award should have been excluded from her gross income because it was compensation received on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.she also maintains that,in any event,her award is not part of her gross income as defined by of the irc.finally,she argues that taxing her award subjects her to an unapportioned direct tax in violation of article i,section of the constitution of the united states.
we reject murphy argument in all aspects.we hold,first,that murphy compensation was not received on account of personal physical injuries excludable from gross income under a.second,we conclude gross income as defined by includes compensatory damages for injuries.third,we hold that a tax upon such damages is within the congress power to tax.
background 
in marrita leveille now murphy filed a complaint with the department of labor alleging that her former employer,the new york air national guard nyang,in violation of various statutes,had blacklisted her and provided unfavorable references to potential employers after she had complained to state authorities of environmental hazards on a nyang airbase.the secretary of labor determined the nyang had unlawfully discriminated and retaliated against murphy,ordered that any adverse references to the taxpayer in the files of the office of personnel management be withdrawn,and remanded her case to an administrative law judge for findings on compensatory damages.
on remand murphy submitted evidence that she had suffered both mental and physical injuries as a result of the nyang blacklisting her.a psychologist testified that murphy had sustained both somatic and emotional injuries,basing his conclusion in part upon medical and dental records showing murphy had bruxism,or teeth grinding often associated with stress,which may cause permanent tooth damage.noting that murphy also suffered from other physical manifestations of stress including anxiety attacks,shortness of breath,and dizziness,and that murphy testified she could not concentrate,stopped talking to friends,and no longer enjoyed anything in life,the alj recommended compensatory damages totaling,of which was for past and future emotional distress,and was for injury to murphy vocational reputation from having been blacklisted.none of the award was for lost wages or diminished earning capacity.
in the department of labor administrative review board affirmed the alj findings and recommendations.see leveille air guard,wl,at.on her tax return for,murphy included the award in her gross income pursuant to of the irc.see a g ross income means all income from whatever source derived.as a result,she paid in taxes on the award.
murphy later filed an amended return in which she sought a refund of the based upon a of the irc,which provides that gross income does not include damages received on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.in support of her amended return,murphy submitted copies of her dental and medical records.upon deciding murphy had failed to demonstrate the compensatory damages were attributable to physical injury or physical sickness,the internal revenue service denied her request for a refund.murphy thereafter sued the irs and the united states in the district court.
in her complaint murphy sought a refund of the,plus applicable interest,pursuant to the sixteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states,along with declaratory and injunctive relief against the irs pursuant to the administrative procedure act and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.she argued her compensatory award was in fact for physical personal injuries and therefore excluded from gross income under a.in the alternative murphy asserted taxing her award was unconstitutional because the award was not income within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment.the government moved to dismiss murphy suit as to the irs,contending the service was not a proper defendant,and for summary judgment on all claims.
the district court denied the government motion to dismiss,holding that murphy had the right to bring an action for declaratory judgments or a mandatory injunction against an agency by its official title,pursuant to of the apa.murphy irs,d.the court then rejected all of murphy claims on the merits and granted summary judgment for the government and the irs.id.
murphy appealed the judgment of the district court with respect to her claims under a and the sixteenth amendment.in murphy irs,we concluded murphy award was not exempt from taxation pursuant to a,id.at,but also was not income within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment,id.at,and therefore reversed the decision of the district court.the government petitioned for rehearing en banc,arguing for the first time that,even if murphy award is not income,there is no constitutional impediment to taxing it because a tax on the award is not a direct tax and is imposed uniformly.in view of the importance of the issue thus belatedly raised,the panel sua sponte vacated its judgment and reheard the case.see consumers union of,fed.power comm n,r egarding the contents of briefs on appeal,we may also consider points not raised in the briefs or in oral argument.our willingness to do so rests on a balancing of considerations of judicial orderliness and efficiency against the need for the greatest possible accuracy in judicial decisionmaking.the latter factor is of particular weight when the decision affects the broad public interest.footnotes omitted see also eli lilly home ins,the rule in this circuit is that litigants must raise their claims on their initial appeal and not in subsequent hearings following a remand.this is a specific application of the general waiver rule,which bends only in exceptional circumstances,where injustice might otherwise result.quoting dist.of columbia air florida,citation omitted.in the present opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court based upon the newly argued ground that murphy award,even if it is not income within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment,is within the reach of the congressional power to tax under article i,section of the constitution.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,flynn tile,bearing in mind that summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,anderson liberty lobby,d.before addressing murphy claims on their merits,however,we must determine whether the district court erred in holding the irs was a proper defendant.
a.the irs as a defendant 
the government contends the courts lack jurisdiction over murphy claims against the irs because the congress has not waived that agency immunity from declaratory and injunctive actions pursuant to a courts may grant declaratory relief except with respect to federal taxes and a no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person and insofar as the congress in a has waived immunity from civil actions seeking tax refunds,that provision on its face applies to civil action s against the united states,not against the irs.in reply murphy argues only that the government forfeited the issue of sovereign immunity because it did not the district court denial of its motion to dismiss.see fed.a.notwithstanding the government failure to,however,the court must address a question concerning its jurisdiction.see occidental petroleum sec,as a preliminary matter we must address the question of our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.
murphy and the district court are correct that of the apa does create a right of action for equitable relief against a federal agency but,as the government correctly points out,the congress has preserved the immunity of the united states from declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to all tax controversies except those pertaining to the classification of organizations under c of the irc.see a a.as an agency of the government,of course,the irs shares that immunity.see settles parole comm n,agency retains the immunity it is due as an arm of the federal sovereign.insofar as the congress in a has waived sovereign immunity with respect to suits for tax refunds,that provision specifically contemplates only actions against the united states.therefore,we hold the irs,unlike the united states,may not be sued eo nomine in this case.
section a of the irc 
section a compensation for injuries or sickness provides that gross income under of the irc does not include the amount of any damages other than punitive damages received on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.a.since it has further provided that,for purposes of this exclusion,emotional distress shall not be treated as a physical injury or physical sickness.id.a.the version of a in effect prior to had excluded from gross income monies received in compensation for personal injuries or sickness,which included both physical and nonphysical injuries such as emotional distress.id.a see united states burke,d section a in fact encompasses a broad range of physical and nonphysical injuries to personal interests.in commissioner schleier,d,the supreme court held that before a taxpayer may exclude compensatory damages from gross income pursuant to a,he must first demonstrate that the underlying cause of action giving rise to the recovery was based upon tort or tort type rights.id.at.the taxpayer has the same burden under the statute as amended.see,chamberlain united states,cir.
murphy contends a,even as amended,excludes her particular award from gross income.first,she asserts her award was based upon tort type rights in the statutes the nyang position the government does not challenge.second,she claims she was compensated for physical injuries,which claim the government does dispute.
murphy points both to her psychologist testimony that she had experienced somatic and body injuries as a result of nyang blacklisting her,and to the american heritage dictionary,which defines somatic as relating to,or affecting the body,especially as distinguished from a body part,the mind,or the environment.murphy further argues the dental records she submitted to the irs proved she has suffered permanent damage to her teeth.citing walters,cir,and payne motors,murphy contends that substantial physical problems caused by emotional distress are considered physical injuries or physical sickness.
murphy further contends that neither of the irc nor the regulation issued thereunder limits the physical disability exclusion to a physical stimulus.in fact,as murphy points out,the applicable regulation,which provides that a excludes from gross income the amount of any damages received whether by suit or agreement on account of personal injuries or sickness,c,does not distinguish between physical injuries stemming from physical stimuli and those arising from emotional trauma rather,it tracks the text of a,which the irs agrees excluded from gross income compensation both for physical and for nonphysical injuries.
for its part,the government argues murphy focus upon the word physical in a is misplaced more important is the phrase on account of.in united states,d,the supreme court read that phrase to require a strong causal connection,thereby making a applicable only to those personal injury lawsuit damages that were awarded by reason of,or because of,the personal injuries.id.at.the court specifically rejected a formulation in favor of a stronger causal connection.id.at.the government therefore concludes murphy must demonstrate she was awarded damages because of her physical injuries,which the government claims she has failed to do.
indeed,as the government points out,the alj expressly recommended,and the board expressly awarded,compensatory damages because of murphy nonphysical injuries.the board analyzed the alj recommendation under the headings compensatory damage for emotional distress or mental anguish and compensatory damage award for injury to professional reputation,and noted such damages compensate not only for direct pecuniary loss,but also for such harms as impairment of reputation,personal humiliation,and mental anguish and suffering.leveille,wl at.in describing the alj proposed award as reasonable,the board stated murphy was to receive for mental pain and anguish and for injury to professional reputation.although murphy may have suffered from bruxism or other physical symptoms of stress,the board focused upon murphy testimony that she experienced severe anxiety attacks,inability to concentrate,a feeling that she no longer enjoyed anything in life,and marital conflict and upon her psychologist testimony about the substantial effect the negative references had on murphy.id.at.the board made no reference to her bruxism,and acknowledged that a ny attempt to set a monetary value on intangible damages such as mental pain and anguish involves a subjective judgment,id.at,before concluding the alj recommendation was reasonable.the government therefore argues there was no direct causal link between the damages award at issue and murphy bruxism.
murphy responds that it is undisputed she suffered both somatic and emotional injuries,and the alj and board expressly cited to the portion of her psychologist testimony establishing that fact.she contends the board therefore relied upon her physical injuries in determining her damages,making those injuries a direct cause of her award in spite of the board labeling the award as one for emotional distress.
although the version of a was at issue in,the court analysis of the phrase on account of,which phrase was unchanged by the amendments,remains controlling here.murphy no doubt suffered from certain physical manifestations of emotional distress,but the record clearly indicates the board awarded her compensation only for mental pain and anguish and for injury to professional reputation.id.at.although the board cited her psychologist,who had mentioned her physical aliments,in support of murphy description of her mental anguish,we can not say the board,notwithstanding its clear statements to the contrary,actually awarded damages because of murphy bruxism and other physical manifestations of stress.id.at.at this is best the board and the alj may have considered her physical injuries indicative of the severity of the emotional distress for which the damages were awarded,but her physical injuries themselves were not the reason for the award.the board thus having left no room for doubt about the grounds for her award,we conclude murphy damages were not awarded by reason of,or because of,physical personal injuries,at.therefore,a does not permit murphy to exclude her award from gross income.
section of the irc 
murphy and the government agree that for murphy award to be taxable,it must be part of her gross income as defined by a of the irc,which states in relevant part gross income means all income from whatever source derived.the supreme court has interpreted the section broadly to extend to all economic gains not otherwise exempted.comm r banks,d see also,james united states,d section encompasses all accessions to wealth internal quotation mark omitted comm r glenshaw glass.the court has given a liberal construction to gross income in recognition of the intention of congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted.gross income in a is at least as broad as the meaning of incomes in the sixteenth amendment.see glenshaw glass,at.quoting,at,reprinted in,helvering bruun.
murphy argues her award is not a gain or an accession to wealth and therefore not part of gross income.noting the supreme court has long recognized the principle that a restoration of capital i s not income hence it falls outside the definition of income upon which the law impose s a tax,at.see,doyle mitchell.pac.lowe,murphy contends a damage award for personal nonphysical be viewed as a return of a particular form of capital human capital,as it were.see gary becker,human capital ed gary becker,the economic way of looking at life,nobel lecture,in nobel lectures in economic sciences,at torsten persson.in her view,the supreme court in glenshaw glass acknowledged the relevance of the human capital concept for tax purposes.there,in holding that punitive damages for personal injury were gross income under the predecessor to,the court stated 
the long history of holding personal injury recoveries nontaxable on the theory that they roughly correspond to a return of capital can not support exemption of punitive damages following injury to property damages for personal injury are by definition compensatory only.punitive damages,on the other hand,can not be considered a restoration of capital for taxation purposes.
at.by implication,murphy argues,damages for personal injury are a restoration of capital.
as further support,murphy cites various administrative rulings issued shortly after passage of the sixteenth amendment that concluded recoveries from personal injuries were not income,such as this opinion of the attorney general 
without affirming that the human body is in a technical sense the capital invested in an accident policy,in a broad,natural sense the proceeds of the policy do but substitute,so far as they go,capital which is the source of future periodical income.they merely take the place of capital in human ability which was destroyed by the accident.they are therefore capital as distinguished from income receipts.
op.att y,see.int.sol,m oney received on account of defamation of personal character does not constitute income within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment and the statutes enacted thereunder.she also cites a house report on the bill that became the revenue act of,at under the present law it is doubtful whether amounts received as compensation for personal injury are required to be included in gross income see also dotson united states,cir concluding on basis of house report that the congress first enacted the personal injury compensation exclusion when such payments were considered the return of human capital,and thus not constitutionally taxable income under the amendment.
finally,murphy argues her interpretation of is reflected in the common law of tort and the provisions in various environmental statutes and title vii of the civil rights act of,all of which provide for make whole relief.see.if a recovery of damages designed to make whole the plaintiff is taxable,she reasons,then one who receives the award has not been made whole after tax.section should not be read to create a conflict between the tax code and the make whole purpose of the various statutes.
the government disputes murphy interpretation on all fronts.first,noting the definition of gross income in the irc extends broadly to all economic gains,banks,at,the government asserts murphy undeniably had economic gain because she was better off financially after receiving the damages award than she was prior to receiving it.second,the government argues that the case law murphy cites does not support the proposition that the congress lacks the power to tax as income recoveries for personal injuries.in its view,to the extent the supreme court has addressed at all the taxability of compensatory damages,see,at.glenshaw glass,at,it was merely articulating the congress rationale at the time for not taxing such damages,not the court own view whether such damages could constitutionally be taxed.
third,the government challenges the relevance of the administrative rulings murphy cites from around the time the sixteenth amendment was ratified treasury decisions dating from even closer to the time of ratification treated damages received on account of personal injury as income.see.int,reg.int.furthermore,administrative rulings from the time suggest that,even if recoveries for physical personal injuries were not considered part of income,recoveries for nonphysical personal injuries were.see sol.mem,damages for libel subject to income tax sol.mem,recovery of damages from alienation of wife affections not regarded as return of capital,hence taxable.although the treasury changed its position in,see sol,at,it did so only after the supreme court decision in eisner macomber,which the court later viewed as having established a definition of income that served a useful purpose but was not meant to provide a touchstone to all future gross income questions.glenshaw glass,at.as for murphy contention that reading to include her damages would be in tension with the common law and various statutes providing for make whole relief,the government denies there is any tension and suggests murphy is trying to turn a disagreement over tax policy into a constitutional issue.
finally,the government argues that even if the concept of human capital is built into,murphy award is nonetheless taxable because murphy has no tax basis in her human capital.under the irc,a taxpayer gain upon the disposition of property is the difference between the amount realized from the disposition and his basis in the property,defined as the cost of such property,id,adjusted for expenditures,receipts,losses,or other items,properly chargeable to a capital account,id.a.the government asserts,the code does not allow individuals to claim a basis in their human capital accordingly,murphy gain is the full value of the award.see roemer comm r,cir since there is no tax basis in a person health and other personal interests,money received as compensation for an injury to those interests might be considered a realized accession to wealth dictum.
although murphy and the government focus primarily upon whether murphy award falls within the definition of income first used in glenshaw glass,coming within that definition is not the only way in which a could be held to encompass her award.principles of statutory interpretation could show a includes murphy award in her gross income regardless whether it was an accession to wealth,as glenshaw glass requires.for example,if a were amended specifically to include in gross income in addition to all other gross income,then that additional sum would be a part of gross income under even though no actual gain was associated with it.in other words,although the congress can not make a thing income which is not so in fact,oil ass hopkins,it can label a thing income and tax it,so long as it acts within its constitutional authority,which includes not only the sixteenth amendment but also article i,sections and.see penn mut.indem.comm r,cir congress has the power to impose taxes generally,and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful,call it what you will footnote omitted.accordingly,rather than ask whether murphy award was an accession to her wealth,we go to the heart of the matter,which is whether her award is properly included within the definition of gross income in a,to wit,all income from whatever source derived.
looking at a by itself,one sees no indication that it covers murphy award unless the award is income as defined by glenshaw glass and later cases.damages received for emotional distress are not listed among the examples of income in and,as murphy points out,an ambiguity in the meaning of a statute should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.see,hassett welch.gould gould.see also united dominion,united states,d thomas,concurring id.at.stevens,dissenting norman singer,sutherland statutes statutory construction ed.a statute is to be read as a whole,however,see,alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d,and reading in combination with a of the internal revenue code presents a very different picture so clear that we have no occasion to apply the canon favoring the interpretation of ambiguous statutes in favor of the taxpayer.
as noted above,in the congress amended a to narrow the exclusion to amounts received on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness from personal injuries or sickness,and explicitly to provide that emotional distress shall not be treated as a physical injury or physical sickness,thus making clear that an award received on account of emotional distress is not excluded from gross income under a.small business job protection act of,stat.as this amendment,which narrows the exclusion,would have no effect whatsoever if such damages were not included within the ambit of,and as we must presume that w hen congress acts to amend a statute,it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect,stone ins,d,the amendment of a strongly suggests should be read to include an award for damages from nonphysical harms.although it is unclear whether covered such an award before,we need not address that question here even if the provision did not do so prior to,the presumption indicates the congress implicitly amended to cover such an award when it amended a.
we realize,of course,that amendments by implication,like repeals by implication,are disfavored.united states welden,d cheney ret.the supreme court has also noted,however,that the classic judicial task of reconciling many laws enacted over time,and getting them to make sense in combination,necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later statute.united states fausto,d see also fda brown williamson tobacco,d t he meaning of one statute may be affected by other acts,particularly where congress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand united states,d suggesting later enacted laws depend ing for their effectiveness upon clarification,or a change in the meaning of an earlier statute provide a forward looking legislative mandate,guidance,or direct suggestion about how courts should interpret the earlier provisions franklin gwinnett county pub,d amendment of title ix abrogating states eleventh amendment immunity validated court prior holding that title ix created implied right of action id.at.scalia,concurring in judgment amendment to title ix was an implicit acknowledgment that damages are available.
this classic judicial task is before us now.for the amendment of a to make sense,gross income in a must,and we therefore hold it does,include an award for nonphysical damages such as murphy received,regardless whether the award is an accession to wealth.vermont agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d determining meaning of person in false claims act,which was originally enacted in,based in part upon definition of person in program fraud civil remedies act of,which was designed to operate in tandem with the earlier act.
d.the congress power to tax 
the taxing power of the congress is established by article i,section of the constitution the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,duties,imposts and excises.there are two limitations on this power.first,as the same section goes on to provide,all duties,imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states.second,as provided in section of that same article,no capitation,or other direct,tax shall be laid,unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.see also const.art.i,cl.direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union,according to their respective numbers.we now consider whether the tax laid upon murphy award violates either of these two constraints.
a direct tax 
over the years,courts have considered numerous claims that one or another nonapportioned tax is a direct tax and therefore unconstitutional.although these cases have not definitively marked the boundary between taxes that must be apportioned and taxes that need not be,see bromley mccaughn.spreckels sugar ref.mcclain.dividing line between taxes that are direct and those which are to be regarded simply as excises is often very difficult to be expressed in words,some characteristics of each may be discerned.
only three taxes are definitely known to be direct a capitation,const.art.i,a tax upon real property,and a tax upon personal property.see fernandez wiener.congress may tax real estate or chattels if the tax is apportioned pollock farmers loan trust.pollock ii.such direct taxes are laid upon one general ownership of property,bromley,at.see also flint stone tracy,as contrasted with excise taxes laid upon a particular use or enjoyment of property or the shifting from one to another of any power or privilege incidental to the ownership or enjoyment of property.fernandez,at.see also thomas united states.excises cover duties imposed on importation,consumption,manufacture and sale of certain commodities,privileges,particular business transactions,vocations,occupations and the like.more specifically,excise taxes include,in addition to taxes upon consumable items,see patton brady,taxes upon the sale of grain on an exchange,nicol ames,the sale of corporate stock,thomas,at,doing business in corporate form,flint,at,gross receipts from the business of refining sugar,spreckels,at,the transfer of property at death,knowlton moore,gifts,bromley,at,and income from employment,see pollock farmers loan trust.pollock i citing springer united states.
murphy and the amici supporting her argue the dividing line between direct and indirect taxes is based upon the ultimate incidence of the tax if the tax can not be shifted to someone else,as a capitation can not,then it is a direct tax but if the burden can be passed along through a higher price,as a sales tax upon a consumable good can be,then the tax is indirect.this,she argues,was the distinction drawn when the constitution was ratified.see albert gallatin,a sketch of the finances of the united states,reprinted in the writings of albert gallatin henry adams,philadelphia,lippincott the most generally received opinion is,that by direct taxes those are meant which are raised on the capital or revenue of the people by indirect,such as are raised on their expense the federalist,at alexander hamilton jacob cooke,internal taxes may be subdivided into those of the direct and those of the indirect kind by which must be understood duties and excises on articles of consumption.but see gallatin,supra,at direct tax is used,by different writers,and even by the same writers,in different parts of their writings,in a variety of senses,according to that view of the subject they were taking edwin seligman,the income tax photo.reprint ed there are almost as many classifications of direct and indirect taxes are there are authors.moreover,the amici argue,this understanding of the distinction explains the different restrictions imposed respectively upon the power of the congress to tax directly apportionment and via excise uniformity.duties,imposts,and excise taxes,which were expected to constitute the bulk of the new federal government revenue,see erik jensen,the apportionment of direct taxes are consumption taxes constitutional,colum,have a safeguard against oppressively high rates higher taxes result in higher prices and therefore fewer sales and ultimately lower tax revenues.see the federalist,supra,at alexander hamilton.taxes that can not be shifted,in contrast,lack this feature,and were therefore constrained by the more stringent requirement of apportionment.see id.at in a branch of taxation where no limits to the discretion of the government are to be found in the nature of things,the establishment of a fixed rule may be attended with fewer inconveniences than to leave that discretion altogether at large see also jensen,supra,at.
finally,the amici contend their understanding of a direct tax was confirmed in pollock ii,where the supreme court noted that the words duties,imposts,and excises are put in antithesis to direct taxes,at,for which it cited the federalist hamilton.pollock ii,at.as it is clear that murphy can not shift her tax burden to anyone else,per murphy and the amici,it must be a direct tax.
the government,unsurprisingly,backs a different approach by its lights,only taxes that are capable of apportionment in the first instance,specifically,capitation taxes and taxes on land,are direct taxes.the government maintains that this is how the term was generally understood at the time.see calvin johnson,fixing the constitutional absurdity of the apportionment of direct tax,const.comm.moreover,it suggests,this understanding is more i
