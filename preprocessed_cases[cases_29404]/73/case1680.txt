jim beam brands company jim beam appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the franchise tax board ftb in a tax refund action.jim beam brought the action below after the state board of equalization sbe ruled that the gain from jim beam sale of the stock of a subsidiary constituted business income within the meaning of revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a.the trial court sustained the sbe decision and held that income from the sale was apportionable to california.in this court,jim beam argues that the income from the sale of its subsidiary does not qualify as business income under the statute.in the alternative,jim beam contends that even if the gain was business income,it is entitled to an adjustment of its tax basis in the stock to reflect certain undistributed earnings and profits.we disagree with both arguments and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
jim beam is a distiller of bourbon whiskey.it also produces,or imports,and markets a wide variety of distilled spirits,including bourbon and other whiskeys,cordials,gin,and vodka.prior to december,jim beam was part of a unitary business group that consisted of jim beam,taylor food products,taylor food,clear springs distilling corporation clear springs,regal china corporation,berkeley manufacturing company,and wood terminal company.in addition to jim beam alcoholic beverage business,through its subsidiaries,jim beam engaged in other enterprises.regal china corporation and berkeley manufacturing company produced and marketed decanter bottles,china lamp bases,and specialty ceramic items.wood terminal company was engaged in leasing trucks.in the court below,the parties stipulated that taylor food produced various cocktail mixes,tomato juice,and margarita salt.it also imported and distributed mineral water.
jim beam owned all of the stock of clear springs,and clear springs in turn owned the stock of taylor food.prior to its sale,taylor food operations were an integral part of jim beam regular trade or business operations.income from taylor food business was combined with the income from other members of jim beam unitary group and apportioned as part of the income of the unitary business group.during the time that taylor food was part of jim beam unitary business,its income was reported to california as apportionable business income and taxed by this state.significantly for the purposes of this case,the parties stipulated that jim beam acquisition,control,and use of taylor food contributed materially to jim beam production of business income prior to the sale of taylor food.
in december,through clear spring,jim beam sold all of its stock in taylor food.jim beam stated reason for selling taylor food was that the subsidiary no longer fit the strategic plans of american brands,jim beam parent company and sole shareholder clear spring realized a gain on the sale of its taylor food stock,and it distributed the entire proceeds of the sale to its parent,jim beam,which in turn distributed the proceeds to american brands.clear spring classified the gain as nonbusiness income and allocated percent of the gain to kentucky,the state of its domicile.clear spring reported a tax basis of in its taylor food stock.this figure included in undistributed taylor food earnings.for its part,jim beam reported the income from the sale of taylor food as nonbusiness income on its california franchise tax return for.
the ftb audited jim beam tax return for the tax year.based on its audit,the ftb reclassified the income from the sale of taylor food as business income.the ftb also reduced the basis in the taylor food stock without regard to the undistributed earnings,thus increasing the amount of income reported to california.the ftb then issued a notice of proposed assessment to jim beam,which jim beam timely protested.the ftb denied jim beam protest and issued a notice affirming its proposed assessment.
jim beam appealed the matter to the sbe.after the sbe issued a decision sustaining the ftb action,jim beam paid the proposed assessment and filed a claim for refund.the ftb denied jim beam claim,and jim beam sued the ftb for a refund in san francisco superior court.after stipulating to a number of facts pertinent to the legal issues presented,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the superior court granted the ftb motion for summary judgment and denied jim beam motion.jim beam filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
jim beam presents two arguments in this appeal.first,it contends that the gain from the sale of taylor food does not fall within the definition of business income in revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a.second,it argues that even if the proceeds from the sale of taylor food are business income,the amount of taxable gain should be offset by the extent to which the undistributed earnings of taylor food have already been taxed by california.we address these issues in turn.
the definition of business income.standard of review.
this case presents an issue of statutory construction,and the parties agree that we review the question de novo.see regents of university of california superior court cal th,d,appellate court exercises de novo review of ruling on summary judgment motion and underlying statutory construction issues.although the courts bear the ultimate responsibility for the construction of the statute,we will accord great weight and respect to the administrative construction.hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d,hoechst celanese relying on sbe decisions interpreting the statutory definition of business income.deference is appropriate where the administrative agency expertise indicates that it has a comparative interpretive advantage over the courts.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.as this court noted in citicorp,the sbe expertise in tax matters is not subject to dispute.citicorp,supra,th at,d.
a healthy respect for the sbe interpretation is particularly appropriate in this case.the definition of business income in revenue and taxation code section mirrors section,subdivision a of the uniform division of income for tax purposes act.pt.west laws ann.div.of income for tax purposes act,uditpa.the drafters of uditpa derived their definition of business income from an earlier line of sbe decisions.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d.thus,to the extent that they bear on the issue presented,the supreme court has suggested that sbe decisions predating california enactment of uditpa may be controlling,because the legislature presumably enacted the uditpa with the understanding that it did not alter existing california decisional law.id.at,d.
b.the statutory scheme.
california is one of a number of states that have adopted uditpa.california version of the uniform act is found in revenue and taxation code sections through.under this statute,the income of multistate corporations is divided into either business income or nonbusiness income,subds.a d.business income is apportionable to each state in which the corporation or unitary business group does business nonbusiness income is allocable only to the taxpayer commercial domicile.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d,citicorp,supra,th at,d.
the statute defines the term business income as income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition,management,and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer regular trade or business operations,subd.a.nonbusiness income means all income other than business income,subd.d.
in hoechst celanese,the supreme court held that section establishes both a transactional test and a functional test for business income.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d.under the transactional test,the controlling factor for identifying business income is the nature of the transaction.id.at,d.to generate business income under the transactional test,the transaction must occur in the regular course of the taxpayer trade or business.ibid.i ncome arising from extraordinary events,such as a complete liquidation or cessation of business,can not satisfy the transactional test.id.at,d.the functional test,in contrast,focuses on the property.id.at,d.in applying the functional test,the critical inquiry is the relationship between this property and the taxpayer business operations.ibid.
the parties agree that the income from the sale of taylor food is not business income under the transactional test.the issue before us is whether the sale of taylor food generated business income for jim beam unitary business group under the statute functional test.in hoechst celanese,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court both explained the operation of the functional test and provided a detailed interpretation of the statutory language that is at issue here.the supreme court opinion in hoechst celanese therefore guides our decision in this case.
c.the gain from the sale of taylor food is business income under revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a.
in contending that the gain realized from the sale of taylor food is not business income under the statute,jim beam renews the arguments that it made before the sbe.it contends that the plain language of revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a requires a finding of nonbusiness income because,jim beam asserts,the statute requires that the acquisition,management,and disposition of taylor food must each be integral to jim beam regular trade or business operations.furthermore,it relies on a number of cases from other uditpa states that have held that the gains that result from the partial liquidation or cessation of a business are not business income under uditpa.
the sbe rejected both of these arguments.relying on its own earlier decisions,it disagreed with jim beam technical linguistic analysis of the statute.it held that its prior decisions had essentially rejected jim beam argument that there existed an additional independent test for business income upon the disposition of assets.the sbe quoted from appeal of borden,to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch paragraph,pages to borden,in which it had held that t he underlying principle in these cases is that any income from assets which are integral parts of the unitary business is unitary income.it is appropriate that all returns from property which is developed or acquired and maintained through the resources of and in furtherance of the business should be attributed to the business as a whole,quoting appeal of voit rubber may,to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch.
the sbe also rejected jim beam partial liquidation argument.it declined to follow case law from other uditpa states that treat the gains realized from the liquidation of a line of business as nonbusiness income.the sbe concluded that acceptance of jim beam argument would conflict with the results it had reached in cases with similar facts and with the rationale underlying those cases.see appeal of triangle publications,june,to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,triangle publications rejecting argument that income from liquidation of separate corporate divisions is nonbusiness income.
we hold that the sbe construction of the statute was correct and that the gain from the sale of taylor food is business income under the statute functional test.
the requirements of the functional test.
in contrast to the transactional test,which focuses on the nature of the particular transaction that generates the income,the functional test focuses on the property.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d.according to our supreme court,the critical inquiry for purposes of the functional test is the nature of the relationship between this property and the taxpayer business operations.id.at,d.the relationship necessary to a finding of business income is defined by the conditional clause of revenue and tax code section,subdivision a.id.at,d.that is,income from tangible and intangible property is business income if the acquisition,management,and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer regular trade or business operations,subd.a.
as hoechst celanese explains,the statutory language requires essentially a inquiry.first,the phrase acquisition,management,and disposition directs us to examine the taxpayer interest in and power over the property.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d.second,if we conclude that the taxpayer has a sufficient interest in the property for the purposes of the statute,we next review whether the taxpayer control and use of the property are an integral part of the taxpayer regular trade or business operations.id.at,d,quoting,subd.a.
jim beam concedes that the first requirement of the functional test is met.in its opening brief,it states that i t is undisputed that jim beam acquired,managed,and disposed of the stock of taylor food.accordingly,the requirements of the first phrase are satisfied.jim beam disputes only the conclusion that its acquisition,management,and disposition of taylor food were integral to its regular trade or business operations.we therefore turn to that question.
jim beam control and use of taylor food were an integral part of its regular trade or business operations.
before the acquisition,management,and disposition of the property will be considered integral to the taxpayer regular trade or business operations,the taxpayer control and use of the property must contribute materially to the taxpayer production of business income so that the property becomes interwoven into and inseparable from the taxpayer business.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the statutory phrase regular trade or business operations requires that the taxpayer control and use of the property be part of the taxpayer normal or typical business activities.id.at,d.the word regular does not refer to the nature of the transaction,and thus the extraordinary nature or infrequency of the transaction is irrelevant.ibid.a taxpayer control and use of the property will be considered integral to its regular trade or business operations if there exists an organic unity between the taxpayer property and business activities whereby the property contributes materially to the taxpayer production of business income.ibid.thus,the necessary integral relationship exists when the taxpayer controls and uses the property to contribute materially to the taxpayer production of business income.id.at,d.
here again,jim beam has essentially conceded that this portion of the statutory test is satisfied.in the court below,it stipulated that its acquisition,control and use of taylor food contributed materially to taxpayer production of business income.in addition,jim beam further stipulated that p rior to the sale of taylor food,taylor food business operations were an integral part of taxpayer regular trade or business operations.as the ftb correctly argues,this falls squarely within the hoechst celanese definition of the term integral.see hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d.
the disposition of the proceeds of the sale does not affect the finding of business income.
despite its stipulation,jim beam contends that the income from its sale of taylor food can not be business income because,in jim beam view,the statute requires that the acquisition,management,and disposition of taylor food must each be integral to its regular trade or business operations.jim beam argues that its disposition of taylor food was wholly unrelated and did not contribute,materially or otherwise,in any way to jim beam unitary business.as evidence of this,jim beam cites the fact that all of the proceeds of the sale were distributed to american brands,which was not part of jim beam unitary business group.in addition,jim beam notes that taylor food was not a drag on earnings,was in fact profitable,and was sold only because it no longer fit with the strategic plans of american brands.thus,according to jim beam,the sale of taylor food did not contribute to jim beam business,and the disposition was not an integral part of jim beam regular trade or business operations.
we reject this argument for a number of reasons.first,we agree with the ftb that this line of reasoning improperly focuses the analysis on the transaction rather than on the property,as hoechst celanese requires.as discussed earlier,the supreme court has made clear that the critical inquiry is the nature of the relationship between this property and the taxpayer business operations.hoechst celanese,supra,at,d.the hoechst celanese analysis does not focus on the use of the proceeds of the disposition or on the reasons behind the sale accord,appeal of occidental petroleum corporation june,to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,fn.occidental petroleum we do not attach any particular significance to the taxpayer eventual use of the proceeds from stock sales.hoechst celanese makes clear that nothing more is required than what jim beam has already its control and use of the property contributed materially to jim beam production of business income.hoechst celanese,supra,at,d.
second,jim beam argument is based on a reading of the words acquisition,management,and disposition that can not be squared with the interpretation given them by the supreme court.in hoechst celanese,the supreme court stated that the phrase acquisition,management,and disposition of the property establishes that the taxpayer must obtain some interest in and control over the property control or direct the use of the property and transfer,or have the power to transfer,control of that property in some manner.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d.this statutory language does not establish a requirement that each,management,and be integral to the taxpayer regular trade or business operations before the proceeds from property will be held to be business income.rather,the supreme court interpreted these words to refer to the taxpayer interest in and power over the property.id.at,d.thus,this language encompasses the myriad of ways that corporations may control and use the rights and privileges commonly associated with property ownership.id.at,d.jim beam attempt to derive a test from the phrase in question is simply inconsistent with our supreme court interpretation of the statute.because the taylor food business contributed materially to jim beam production of business income prior to sale of the subsidiary,the acquisition,management,and disposition of taylor food constitute integral parts of jim beam business operations.id.at,d.
finally,on a conceptual level,jim beam does not explain why property that admittedly generated unitary business income for years prior to its disposition should not also generate business income when it is sold.such a position is at odds with the sbe rule that any income from assets which are integral parts of the unitary business is unitary income.borden,supra to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,quoting appeal of voit rubber,supra to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch.it is also inconsistent with the comments of the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws explaining section of uditpa,the source of section.as the supreme court noted in hoechst celanese,the comments contemplate the apportionment of gains realized from any sale of property used in the taxpayer trade or business.hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d,italics added,citing comrs,uditpa,com.foll,subd.a.indeed,the comment ostensibly makes all income from the disposition of property used in the taxpayer business apportionable even if the disposition does not occur in the regular course of the taxpayer trade or business.hoechst celanese,supra,at,d.
we therefore conclude that the sbe was correct in rejecting jim beam statutory construction argument.consequently,this argument furnishes no basis for reversal of the trial court grant of summary judgment to the ftb.
d.the partial liquidation exception.
jim beam argues that the treatment of gains from a liquidation of a line of business followed by a distribution of the liquidation proceeds to the taxpayer shareholders is an issue of first impression in california,and it urges that in such circumstances the gains should be treated as nonbusiness income.the sbe rejected this argument,and it refused jim beam invitation to carve out what it termed a partial liquidation exception to the functional test.in this court,jim beam contends that there is a consensus among courts in other uditpa states holding that where the sale of an asset of a unitary business results in the cessation of that line of business activity,the proceeds from that sale are treated as nonbusiness income.in support of this argument,jim beam cites cases from six other states that have adopted uditpa.all of these cases have concluded that the gains from the complete or partial liquidation of a business are nonbusiness income 
at the outset,we note that the issue jim beam raises is not truly one of first impression.at least one california case has held that a corporation sale of the stock of its subsidiary generates business income under revenue and tax code section,subdivision a.times mirror,supra,d at.holding that proceeds,which include any capital gains income received by times mirror,constitute business income,as a matter of law.in addition,the sbe has confronted similar facts on more than one occasion,and it has uniformly held that the gains from the sale of a corporate subsidiary constitute business income.triangle publications,supra to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,at income from sale of corporate divisions,which allegedly resulted in liquidation of separate businesses,held business income occidental petroleum,supra to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,at gain from sale of shares in unitary subsidiary held business income.thus to the extent that california decisions have considered the question,they have supported the view that the sale of stock in a unitary subsidiary is business income under the statute.
moreover,even in the absence of the california decisions just cited,we could not follow the cases jim beam cites because an examination of their reasoning demonstrates that it conflicts with the sbe longstanding interpretation of the term business income and with the supreme court opinion in hoechst celanese.we can not accept jim beam argument without repudiating the analysis underlying california functional test.
the earliest case upon which jim beam relies is mcvean barlow.in that case,the taxpayer had been engaged for many years in the business of laying both large and small diameter pipe.mcvean barlow,supra,at.it then liquidated its large diameter pipeline business.ibid.the new mexico court of appeals held that income from the taxpayer sale of its pipeline business was not business income under new mexico version of uditpa.id.at.in so holding,mcvean barlow relied on the kansas supreme court opinion in western natural gas company mcdonald,western natural gas.mcvean barlow,supra,at.to support its interpretation of the term business income,the mcvean barlow court quoted a passage from western natural gas that illustrates the analytical conflict between california approach to the business income definition and the approach taken in the cases jim beam cites it is not the use of the property in the business which is the determining factor under the statute.the controlling factor by which the statute identifies business income is the nature of the particular transaction giving rise to the income.to be business income the transaction and activity must have been in the regular course of the taxpayer business operations.mcvean barlow,supra,at,quoting western natural gas,supra,at,italics added by mcvean barlow court.the other cases all adopt a similar approach by focusing on whether the disposition of the property,as opposed to the property itself,constitutes an integral part of the taxpayer regular trade or business 
from our earlier discussion of hoechst celanese,it should be evident that such an approach is contrary to california decisional law,for it focuses on the nature of the transaction,rather than on the relationship between the property sold and the taxpayer regular trade or business operations.see hoechst celanese,supra,cal th at,d,focus of functional test is on relationship between property and taxpayer business operations extraordinary nature of transaction is irrelevant see also triangle publications,supra to transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch,at expressly rejecting mcvean barlow and western natural gas
