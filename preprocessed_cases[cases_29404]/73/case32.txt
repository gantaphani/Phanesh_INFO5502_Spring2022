this case presents an issue of first impression concerning the authority under federal law of the internal revenue service to discharge a portion of its tax liens on a piece of real property taken by eminent domain in exchange for payment from that taking while asserting the remaining value of its liens on any proceeds that the taxpayer obtains in a state suit for undercompensation damages.the internal revenue code,b a,gives the irs discretion to discharge property from a tax lien if the irs is paid an amount,which shall not be less than the value of its interest in that property.we conclude that the irs discharge under this provision did not surrender the government tax lien on the proceeds of the taxpayer suit.we reverse the district court determination to the contrary.hannon city of newton,d.
we quickly summarize both the issue and our conclusions.in the spring of,patrick hannon owed the united states over million for unpaid taxes,and the irs held tax liens for that sum against his property,including a parcel of land he owned at rogers street in newton,massachusetts.in march,the city of newton,seeking to take the rogers street property by eminent domain,asked the irs to assist it by discharging that parcel from tax liens,thus avoiding any question as to newton power to take the property free of those liens.on may,the irs discharged that specific parcel of land rogers street from its tax lien under b a in a certificate of discharge.that certificate expressly stated that it sav ed and reserv ed the force and effect of said tax lien against and upon all other property or rights to property to which said lien is attached,wheresoever situated.
three days later,on may,newton paid million to take hannon property at rogers street by eminent domain.the irs had authorized the tax lien discharge on rogers street upon its receipt of,which was its estimate of what would remain of the million paid by newton after the mortgagee,a senior creditor,was paid in full.
following the taking,on november,hannon exercised his statutory right under massachusetts eminent domain law to sue newton in state court,claiming that newton had not sufficiently compensated him for taking his property.see.laws ch.he was awarded as damages for undercompensation on july.both the and rita manning,a creditor who had obtained a judgment against hannon,intervened in this land damages suit and asserted priority to receive the damages award.the government removed the case to federal court,and both the government and manning moved for summary judgment on the question of whose lien had priority.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of manning,holding that the irs decision to discharge rogers street from federal tax liens in exchange for payment from the taking also meant the government had relinquished any tax lien on the later damages award.
there is no dispute that before the taking and the filing of the irs certificate,manning judgment lien was junior to the government tax lien.the question of law before us is whether the irs certificate issued under b a,read in light of b,released or abandoned any claims the irs had on the proceeds awarded to the taxpayer under.laws ch.we hold the irs lien on those proceeds is valid and so senior.as a result,we reverse and direct the district court to enter summary judgment in the government favor.
a.the discharge of the real property at rogers street from federal tax liens 
on august,hannon purchased a acre beachfront residence located at rogers street in newton,massachusetts for.that same day,merrill lynch credit recorded its purchase money mortgage in the amount of against the property.
meanwhile,hannon never paid his federal income tax and other federal taxes assessed against him for the years,and,even after the irs had issued a notice and demand for payment of those taxes.due to this outstanding tax liability,the irs recorded notices in february of federal tax liens against hannon real property in the middlesex county registry of deeds for taxes owed from years to,totaling.see.laws ch,notice of a federal tax lien on any real property or fixtures shall be filed with the register of deeds of the county in which such real property or fixtures are situated.hannon newton,massachusetts property is located in middlesex county.
the irs also recorded notices,in late january and early february,of federal tax liens against hannon personal property for the same amount in the district court for the district of massachusetts 
about two years later,on march,manning obtained a judgment against hannon in the amount of.on june,she obtained an execution for that amount against hannon goods,chattels or land,which she recorded at the middlesex registry of deeds on june.the irs liens were obviously recorded first.
in,newton sought to take hannon beachfront property on rogers street by eminent domain.newton intended to fix an unstable retaining wall on the property that abutted newton public beach area and that posed a public safety risk to swimmers.as a result,on march,newton submitted an application to the irs to discharge rogers street from the federal tax liens.newton informed the irs that it was waiting for the irs to approve the discharge before newton board of aldermen convened for a final vote on the draft order of taking.
newton application for a discharge certificate complied with the irs requirements that it a describe the property from which it sought to remove the federal tax lien b provide the address of the real property c identify the basis for the discharge under and d submit a professional appraisal of the property completed by a disinterested third party see irs form june.the appraisal that newton submitted valued the property at million.
the irs knew that hannon believed that his property was worth more than newton million estimate and that newton had a budget limit of million to acquire that property.under massachusetts law,a city is authorized to take privately owned real estate or any interest therein by eminent domain.laws ch,lichoulas city of lowell.upon recording an order of taking,the city acquires title to the property designated in that order,and a right to damages vests in the former owner of the property taken.see.laws ch.as a result,the city is required to pay a reasonable amount for the condemned property.see id.this amount can be accepted by the owner as either a settlement for all damages owed for the taking or merely as a payment pro tanto,which preserves the right to claim a larger sum by proceeding before an appropriate tribunal for an assessment of damages within three years of the taking.id.hannon took the million sum as a payment pro tanto.
to facilitate the taking as newton requested,the irs approved the discharge of rogers street from federal tax liens on may,well aware that the property might be worth more than the million that newton was able to pay for it,and that there could be a claim by hannon for a larger sum.according to the irs notes from april,the irs issued the discharge certificate because it believed its tax liens would follow any proceeds that hannon would obtain if he successfully sued newton for additional damages.
the certificate of discharge,contained in relevant part in the appendix,discharged rogers street,a certain parcel of land more fully described at the registry of deeds,from federal tax liens while saving and reserving,however,the force and effect of said tax lien s against and upon all other property or rights to property to which said lien s are attached,wheresoever situated.the discharge was issued pursuant to b a,which permits the secretary of treasury to issue a certificate of discharge with respect to a certain property if 
there is paid over to the secretary in partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the lien an amount determined by the secretary,which shall not be less than the value,as determined by the secretary,of the interest of the united states in the property to be so discharged.
b a.the sum the irs obtained from the eminent domain proceeding was only in partial satisfaction of the total tax lien.
the irs calculated that it would get only from the initial million pro tanto payment after merrill lynch,a senior secured creditor,was paid in full,and so the certificate discharged rogers street in exchange for a payment of that sum.as it turned out,on may,newton paid the irs more than the listed in the discharge certificate because merrill lynch outstanding mortgage balance was less than expected.this allocation accorded with the irs belief that it was entitled to all remaining funds by virtue of its federal tax liens after payment of the senior mortgage,regardless of the specific amount listed in the discharge certificate.
newton issued its order of taking on may,by which it acquired rogers street by eminent domain in exchange for a million damages award.the irs later recorded the discharge certificate in the middlesex county registry of deeds on july.the certificate was explicit that it applied only to real property located at rogers street,so the irs did not record the certificate of discharge in the district of massachusetts district court,where it must file tax lien notices for personal property.
procedural history 
on november,a little over a year after the taking,hannon sued newton in middlesex county superior court,asserting that the damages award was inadequate compensation for the taking of rogers street.see.laws.ch.manning intervened in this land damages suit on may,and the irs served a notice of levy to attach to any judgment against newton on may.
on july,the superior court entered judgment in favor of hannon,awarding him in damages for undercompensation and in interest.on october,newton paid into the registry of the court,and of the interpleaded funds were paid to hannon counsel with the consent of all parties,leaving to be distributed.
the government moved to intervene in this undercompensation suit on december.the superior court granted the government motion on december,based on the federal tax liens,and the government later removed the case to federal court.as of november,hannon outstanding tax liability totaled.only the government and manning timely asserted an interest in these undercompensation damages,and the government moved for summary judgment,asserting that its tax liens had priority over manning judgment lien and that the discharge certificate only applied to real property located at rogers street and not to any additional damages recovered by hannon.manning opposed the motion and for summary judgment.
in an october,memorandum and order,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of manning.the district court,in a theory it advanced sua sponte,held that by proceeding under b a,the irs had discharged the government lien on any proceeds from the taking other than,the amount listed in the discharge certificate as the value of its interest in rogers street.hannon,d at.it reasoned the government had to elect between b a and b,and by opting for the former had relinquished its right to any undercompensation damages.the government failure to comply with the b procedure,the district court reasoned,surrendered the priority of its tax liens to the additional damages paid to the taxpayer in his suit.id.at.
the district court also noted that massachusetts eminent domain law treats the right to sue for damages,and any award resulting from that suit,as a substitute for and representation of the land that was taken.manning had priority because the irs had discharged its lien on the land,whereas manning had not.id.at.as a result,the district court issued a judgment awarding manning,the amount of her judgment lien,out of the undercompensation damages with the remainder distributed to the government as an unsecured creditor.id.at.
on november,the government moved for reconsideration,arguing that its federal tax liens attached to hannon undercompensation damages regardless of its discharge of rogers street under b a and that the district court had misinterpreted b.the district court denied this motion on september.it agreed with the government that the feasibility of a discharge pursuant to b was doubtful in this case.hannon city of newton,dpw,wl,at.however,the court explained that this did not alter its conclusion that b means that use of b a implicitly discharges any lien on proceeds.id.at.it also reasoned the irs could have chosen to do nothing at all in the eminent domain proceedings to preserve its rights.id.at.
the government timely appealed.

scope of the discharge of property from federal tax liens under b a 
under federal law,if a person,such as hannon,fails to pay federal taxes despite a demand for payment,tax liens in favor of the united states automatically attach to all of that person property and rights to property,whether real or personal.u.we emphasize the lien is not only attached to property,but also to rights to property,whether real or personal.id.stronger language could hardly have been selected to reveal a purpose to assure the collection of taxes.glass city bank of jeanette,united states.as a result,federal tax liens attach to property acquired by the delinquent taxpayer at any time during the life of the lien.id.at see also t he lien imposed by shall arise at the time the assessment for taxes is made and shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.
amidst this backdrop,b grants the irs discretion to discharge specific property from federal tax liens under certain circumstances.see b b.most discharges occur to facilitate the transfer of encumbered property.the irs application process for discharges reflects this reality.
for example,the application form allows either the delinquent taxpayer or the of the taxpayer property to apply for a discharge certificate.applicants must describe how and when the taxpayer will be divested of interest in the property and attach the sales contract and proposed closing statement,if possible.irs form june.as a result,and consistent with the broad language of,the purpose of almost every discharge is to carve out of the tax lien only the specific property or part of property which a delinquent taxpayer will no longer own in exchange for payment of that interest which is discharged.
to that end,b provides in relevant part 
subject to such regulations as the secretary of treasury may prescribe,the secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if 
a there is paid over to the secretary in partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the lien an amount determined by the secretary,which shall not be less than the value,as determined by the secretary,of the interest of the united states in the part to be so discharged 
in determining the value of the interest of the united states in the part to be so discharged,the secretary shall give consideration to the value of such part and to such liens thereon as have priority over the lien of the united states.
b a emphases added.
a fundamental purpose of b a is to give clear title to the purchaser.nothing in b a purports to discharge any property other than the specific property or portion of a property that is discharged from tax liens in a discharge certificate.a properly recorded certificate of discharge issued pursuant to any subsection of b is conclusive that the property covered by such certificate is discharged from the tax lien.id.f b.this makes clear that the particular subsection of b that authorizes the discharge does not operate to define that discharge.rather,the language of the certificate controls.
here,the discharge certificate was precise and discharged only rogers street,newton,massachusetts,defined as a certain parcel of land more fully described at the registry of deeds,southern middlesex,state of massachusetts in book,page.of the bundle of sticks or collection of rights that comprised hannon ownership of rogers street,see united states craft,d,the certificate discharged only a specific piece of real property that hannon was parting with and newton was taking.it did not discharge the other sticks that made up hannon ownership interest in rogers street,such as his contingent rights to property if that parcel of land was taken by eminent domain these included the right to receive an initial damages award,which accrued after the parcel of land was taken by eminent domain,and the right to sue for more damages if hannon deemed the initial award inadequate.were there any doubt as to the limited scope of the discharge,the certificate saved and reserved the force and effect of said tax lien s against and upon all other property or rights to property to which said lien is attached,wheresoever situated.emphasis added.
nor was the scope of the discharge limited here by b a instruction that the irs receive a payment worth not less than the value of its interest in the property discharged.that instruction constitutes a precondition to the irs exercise of discretion to issue a discharge certificate.it directs the irs not to discharge property for less than what it calculates as the value of its interest in that property.it does not modify the scope of the discharge beyond what is expressly included in the certificate nor does it prevent the government liens from attaching to any surplus in the initial pro tanto payment,and the government enforced its liens on that payment when it received,an amount that exceeded the specified b a payment of.in short,b a is entirely consistent with the government actions here and fully authorized them.
manning argument is that a different subsection,b,must be read with b a and that it imposes limits on what may be discharged under b a.section b states 
subject to such regulations as the secretary may prescribe,the secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if such part of the property is sold and,pursuant to an agreement with the secretary,the proceeds of such sale are to be held,as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the united states,in the same manner and with the same priority as such liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property.b.manning argues that because b expressly articulates a way to discharge property while maintaining an interest in the proceeds from the sale of that property,whereas b a requires the government to receive a specified payment in exchange for the discharge,b a implicitly extinguishes the government lien on any proceeds that exceed that payment.this argument misconstrues the relationship between subsections b and b a.both the plain language of the statute and the legislative history of these sections make clear the argument is wrong.in fact,b addresses a different problem,not present here,and does not affect the operation of b a on these facts.rather,subsection b applies to allow the resolution of disputes where the priority of the irs liens is disputed before transfer of the property from the taxpayer.that is not this situation.
to begin,interpreting b a in light of b is a dubious undertaking because congress enacted b in,long after b a was adopted in order to address a specific situation.at that time,congress noted that a predecessor version of b a existed under which the irs could discharge property if it is paid the value of the government interest in that property.federal tax lien act of.however,no procedure then existed to facilitate the transfer of encumbered property where lienors of that property disputed the priority of their liens.so,congress enacted subsection b as a new procedure to aid in the disposition of property where a dispute exists among competing lienors,including the united states,concerning their rights to specific property.id.in this way,b enables a sale of encumbered property without the immediate distribution of the proceeds from that sale to lienholders.it also ensures that federal tax liens remain attached to sale proceeds while a priority dispute ensues even if the taxpayer loses his interest in those proceeds.section a,in turn,coordinates with b by allowing competing lienors to sue the united states to resolve priority disputes concerning property that has been sold pursuant to an agreement described in b.a.
on appeal,manning adopts the district court interpretation of b a in light of b.the district court reasoned that because b sets forth a specific mechanism for maintaining liens on proceeds from the sale of discharged property,the government failure to use that mechanism surrendered its liens on proceeds resulting from the suit for undercompensation in this case hannon,at.in other words,the district court read subsection b as implicitly limiting the government power under subsection b.this misapprehends the congressional purpose behind b.
it was an error of law to interpret subsection b as providing the exclusive means for maintaining liens on the proceeds of compensation proceedings.section b in concert with a does no more than create a useful procedure to facilitate the sale of encumbered property when there is a dispute as to the priority of federal tax liens.rather than delay the sale and risk losing it during the time it takes to resolve priority disputes,b and a give lienors the option to move their dispute to the proceeds of the sale and resolve it through litigation if need be.where,as in this case,there was no priority dispute when the irs discharged rogers street,use of b was not compulsory to accomplish the discharge.nor was it practicable 
manning does not and can not dispute that before the irs had discharged rogers street from a portion of the federal tax liens,the irs federal tax liens of over million had priority over manning judgment lien.in this case,the irs had properly filed its notices of federal tax liens against hannon real and personal property,in compliance with both federal and massachusetts law,by february manning did not file her judgment lien in the middlesex county registry of deeds until june,clearly making her interest junior to the federal tax liens.
supreme court case law establishes that in this case,where the government federal tax liens were imposed and recorded before manning had recorded her judgment lien against hannon,the government liens retain their preexisting priority to any property that hannon later acquires,including the in undercompensation damages he received in july.see united states mcdermott,d glass city bank of jeanette,at.
the unambiguous language of the certificate and the statute resolve this case.the irs could not have waived,relinquished,or surrendered its remaining tax liens on may,when the irs issued the discharge certificate in this case.newton did not take rogers street by eminent domain until three days later on may,when it issued an order of taking for that parcel of land,and the taxpayer cause of action for additional compensation arose after may.see.laws ch,truck terminal realty bos.redev.
massachusetts law of equitable conversion does not remove the government tax liens from any property that was not expressly discharged in a discharge certificate 
manning argues that the irs discharge encompassed discharge of the proceeds of a undercompensation suit under the state law doctrine of equitable conversion.she starts with the proposition that massachusetts law treats any damages awarded for a taking by eminent domain as a substitute for the land taken.see cornell andrews smelting bos,c ompensation paid for land taken by the exercise of the power of eminent domain in equity represents the land and is subject to all the rights of persons who had rights in the land.she contends this equitable conversion doctrine means the government discharge of rogers street from tax liens also gave up its interest in the later award of damages.in contrast,she argues her liens attached to all of hannon eminent domain damages precisely because she never discharged her lien on rogers street,while the irs did.this argument is wrong on several grounds.
first,federal law,not massachusetts law,controls both the scope the irs discharge in this case and the attachment of federal tax liens to hannon property and rights to property.under controlling
