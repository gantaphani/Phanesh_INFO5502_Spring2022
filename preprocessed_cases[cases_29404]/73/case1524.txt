a manufacturer sells sophisticated telecommunications equipment to nine different telephone companies,who in turn use that equipment to provide telephone and internet services to their customers.in the transactions between the manufacturer and telephone companies,the companies paid for the equipment,written instructions on how to use the equipment,a copy of the computer software that makes the equipment work,and the right to copy that software onto the equipment hard drive and thereafter to use the software to operate the equipment.in nortel networks state board of equalization th nortel,we held that an almost identical transaction satisfied the requirements of california technology transfer agreement statutes,subd.c,subd.c and,as such,the manufacturer was responsible for paying sales taxes only on the tangible portions of the transaction the equipment and instructions,but not the intangible portions the software and rights to copy and use it.notwithstanding nortel,the state board of equalization board in this case persisted in assessing a sales tax of nearly million on the intangible portions of nearly identical transactions.the manufacturer paid the taxes,and filed this action seeking a refund.
the board assessment of the sales tax was erroneous.in so concluding,we hold that the manufacturer decision to give the telephone companies copies of the software on magnetic tapes and compact discs rather than over the internet does not turn the software itself or the rights to use it into tangible personal property subject to the sales tax,a technology transfer agreement within the meaning of sections,subdivision c d and,subdivision c d,which exempts from the sales tax the intangible portions of a transaction involving both tangible and intangible property,can exist when the only intangible right transferred is the right to copy software onto tangible equipment,and a technology transfer agreement can exist as long as the grantee of copyright or patent rights under the agreement thereafter copies or incorporates a copy of the copyrighted work into its product or uses the patented process,and any of these acts is enough to render the resulting product or process subject to the copyright or patent interest.
moreover,because the board trenchant opposition to the manufacturer refund action in this case was all but foreclosed by nortel and other binding decisional and statutory law,the board position was not substantially justified and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the manufacturer its reasonable litigation costs.
we accordingly affirm.
facts and procedural background 
telephone networks generally 
the telephone and data network in the united states is both terrestrial and wireless,and is seamlessly interconnected through equipment called switches that are housed in central offices scattered around the country.a single switch is comprised of numerous computer processors,frames sometimes called cabinets,shelves,drawers,circuit packs,cables,trunks and many other pieces of hardware.a switch serves two functions it routes incoming and outgoing calls or data streams toward their ultimate destination on the nation network and it operates a panoply of features,ranging from call waiting,calling and call forwarding to caller id and voicemail.because each switch is located in a unique place along the network,and because each can offer a different mix of features,no two switches are alike.
switches perform sophisticated and complex functions,and every switch is run by a computer.each switch computer runs two types of software software designed specifically for that switch unimaginatively called software and more generic software designed for use on any switch because it runs diagnostic tests and manages the availability of lines and trunks used to route calls and data between switches.software is drawn from a master,basic code the software for any given switch uses only those portions of the basic code necessary for the switch to know where it is on the network and to offer the features that its new owner has requested.see nortel,supra,th at.
ii.underlying transactions 
prior to,at t corporation at t manufactured switches.on february,at t spun off its network services division,which was responsible for manufacturing switches,into a separate company called lucent technologies,lucent.at t and lucent collectively,at designed the software both and generic that runs the switches they sell.that software is copyrighted because it is an original work of authorship that has been fixed onto tapes the software also embodies,implements,and enables at least one of different patents held by at.
between january,and september,at entered into contracts with nine different telephone companies to sell them one or more switches,provide the instructions on how to install and run those switches,develop and produce a copy of the software necessary to operate those switches,and grant the companies the right to copy the software onto their switch hard drive and thereafter to use the software which necessarily results in the software being copied into the switch operating memory.at gave the telephone companies the software by sending them magnetic tapes or compact discs containing the software.at placement of the software onto the tapes or discs,like the addition of any data to such physical media,physically altered those media.the telephone companies paid at for the licenses to copy and use at software on their switches 
iii.tax assessment 
the board assessed the sales tax on the full amount of the licensing fees paid under the contracts between at and its telephone company customers.at the sales tax rate of percent,this came to a sales tax liability of.as required by the state constitution cal,art.xiii,at paid the sales tax and then sought a refund from the board.the board denied its application.
iv.litigation 
at sued the board for a refund of the sales tax attributable to the software and licenses to copy and use that software.at filed two lawsuits one covering the taxes paid between january,and january,before lucent broke away from at t lucent i,and a second covering the period between february,and september,lucent ii in response to each complaint,the board filed a seeking unpaid interest on the sales tax already paid namely,in the lucent i and in the lucent ii.
the parties filed for summary judgment on at tax refund claims,and the trial court issued a page ruling granting at motions.the court concluded that the contracts between at and the telephone companies were technology transfer agreements within the meaning of sections,subdivision c and,subdivision c,such that at was obligated to pay sales taxes on the tangible portion of the sale that is,for the switches,the instructions,and the blank tapes compact discs used to transmit the software,but not required to pay sales taxes on the intangible portion that is,for the software and licenses.as a result,the court ordered the board to refund the sales taxes paid on the licensing fees.with other adjustments,the court ordered a refund of.the parties subsequently stipulated that at owed in unpaid interest out of the million sought in the board lucent i,but none of the million in unpaid interest sought in the lucent ii.
at sought its court costs,and under section,its reasonable litigation costs,including attorney fees.the court awarded costs of,and after finding the board position in the litigation was not substantially justified,awarded in reasonable litigation costs.
the court entered judgment,and the board timely appeals.
discussion 
background law on california sales tax 
the state of california imposes a sales tax upon sellers f or the privilege of selling tangible personal property.navistar internat.transportation state board of equalization cal th,navistar see also loeffler target cal th,loeffler the retailer is the taxpayer,not the consumer.the tax is tied to a percentage of the seller gross receipts.see defining gross receipts.the percentage at the time pertinent to the transactions in this appeal was percent.
as relevant to this appeal,a sale the event that triggers the sales tax includes a ny transfer of title or possession,exchange,or barter,contractual or otherwise,in any manner or by any means whatsoever,of tangible personal property for a consideration as well as a ny lease of tangible personal property in any manner or by any means whatsoever unless otherwise exempted by statute,subds.a g,italics added.a lease includes a license.as the italicized text makes clear,the sales tax attaches only to transactions involving tangible personal property.tangible personal property means personal property which may be seen,weighed,measured,felt,or touched,or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses.if tangible personal property is transferred,the parties reasons for the transfer do not matter thus,the transfer of tangible personal property is subject to the sales tax even if that property is being purchased more for its intellectual content than its physical components.navistar,supra,cal th at simplicity pattern state board of equalization cal d,superseded by,subd.c,subd.c simplicity pattern.this is why the purchase of a book for its own sake and not as part of a larger transaction transferring any copyright rights along with the book is still considered a sale of tangible personal property and thus subject to the sales tax.navistar,at sale of drawings and designs for industrial turbine engines that are uncopyrighted trade secrets,without any transfer of intellectual property rights,is a taxable sale.
however,transactions not involving tangible personal property,such as the sale of services or the sale of intangible personal property,are not subject to the sales tax.see overly state board of equalization d,sales tax statutes do not impose a tax on services preston state board of equalization cal th,preston intangible personal property is not subject to sales tax.the revenue and taxation code does not define intangible personal property navistar,supra,cal th at,but courts have generally defined it as property that is a right rather than a physical object ibid.intangible property includes a license to use information under a copyright or patent.nortel,supra,th at preston,at.
whether a transaction involving both taxable and components is subject to the sales tax turns on two considerations whether the taxable and components are inextricably intertwined rather than readily separable and,if they are inextricably intertwined,whether the component is a service or is intangible personal property.see dell,superior court th,dell.where the transaction involves components that are readily separable and not inextricably intertwined,the sales tax is assessed against the component of the transaction involving tangible personal property and not assessed against the remaining,component.dell,at.
determining how to apply the sales tax to a transaction where tangible personal property is inextricably intertwined with components not subject to the sales tax is,as our supreme court has noted,more troublesome.preston,supra,cal th at.in this instance,the question of taxation hinges on the nature of the untaxable component.dell,supra,th at pp.california views sales of tangible property bundled with intangibles,rather than services,differently.when the untaxable component is a service,a court is to determine whether the true object of the transaction is the sale of tangible personal property or instead the performance of a service,tit,preston,at navistar,supra,cal th at.this determination is dispositive if the true object is the sale of tangible personal property,the whole transaction is subject to the sales tax if the true object is the performance of a service,no portion even the tangible storage media used to perform the service of the transaction is subject to the sales tax.general business state board of equalization d,no sales tax to be assessed on tangible storage media used to provide a service.indeed,section codified this rule with respect to the service of creating custom computer programs.navistar,at downstream sale of originally software is no longer an exempted sale of a service touche ross state board of equalization d,touche ross same.
where,as here,the untaxable component is intangible personal property,the default rule is to determine whether the tangible portion of the transaction is essential or physically useful to the purchaser subsequent use of the intangible personal property portion of the transaction.preston,supra,cal th at looking to whether tangible personal property component is essential navistar,supra,cal th at looking to whether the intangible property is physically useful to the buyer manufacturing process.under this rule,the true object of the transaction is irrelevant.preston,at navistar,at.thus,when a seller confers an intangible license to copy a copyrighted matter and gives the buyer a physical copy of the copyrighted matter needed to make use of that license as is the case with film negatives,master audio recordings,or artwork to be used to make rubber stamps or for integration into a printing plate for a book the entire transaction is subject to the sales tax.see preston,at illustrations to be used to make rubber stamps and book plates a m records,state board of equalization d,superseded by,subd.c,subd.c original master audio tapes capitol records state board of equalization d,superseded by,subd.c,subd.c same simplicity pattern,supra,cal d at master audio recordings.conversely,when a seller grants an intangible license to copy copyrighted material or to use a patent and transfers the material using tangible media that is not essential to the buyer use of the license or any further manufacturing process as is the case when software is transmitted via a disk that is not essential or otherwise physically useful to the buyer subsequent use of that software the entire transaction is not subject to the sales tax.microsoft franchise tax board th,microsoft so holding.this default rule is thus an affair depending on the centrality of the tangible personal property to the subsequent use of the intangible personal property,either the entire transaction is taxable or it is not.
but this is only the default rule.in,our legislature enacted the technology transfer agreement statutes and thereby set up a special rule for technology transfer agreements by excluding them from the definition of sales and gross receipts,subd.c,subd.c preston,supra,cal th at.a technology transfer agreement is any agreement under which a person who holds a patent or copyright interest assigns or licenses to another person the right to make and sell a product or to use a process that is subject to the patent or copyright interest,subd.c d,subd.c d.instead of sales tax liability attaching to all or none of the transaction,a taxpayer who enters into a contract that qualifies as a technology transfer agreement is required to sort the tangible personal property from the intangible,and to pay sales tax on the tangible personal property that is transferred but not on the amount charged for the intangible personal property transferred,subd.c a,subd.c a preston,at.the statutes provide three mechanisms in declining order of preference for calculating the value of the tangible personal property the price stated in the agreement itself,subd.c a,subd.c a the price at which the tangible personal property or like tangible personal property has been previously sold or leased,or offered for sale or lease,to third parties at a separate price,subd.c b,subd.c b or percent of the cost of materials and labor used to produce the tangible personal property,subd.c c,subd.c c.
ii.summary judgment ruling 
because at did not seek a refund of the sales tax assessed against the switches themselves and conceded the sales tax was properly assessed against the written instructions,the remaining question is whether the board correctly assessed sales taxes on the computer software sent to the telephone companies using tapes and compact discs,and the licenses to copy and use that software on the switches.
the board argues that the transfers of the software and licenses are wholly taxable,and that the trial court summary judgment ruling to the contrary is erroneous for three reasons.first,the software is tangible personal property because the act of placing the software onto magnetic tapes and compact discs physically altered those media.because those alterations can be microscopically seen and are otherwise perceptible to the senses,the board argues that the software itself became tangible personal property and that the both the software and the licenses are subject to the sales tax ostensibly because the license to copy and use the software is,in the board view,incidental to the transfer of the software itself second,even if the software and the licenses to copy and use it are not deemed to be tangible personal property,the contracts between at and the telephone companies are not technology transfer agreements because they did not transfer a sufficiently meaningful cluster of intellectual property rights to the telephone companies,and at did not prove that,without the licenses,the telephone companies use of the software would constitute copyright patent infringement.third,even if the contracts qualify as technology transfer agreements,at did not sufficiently establish the cost of developing the software,and thus the entire transaction should be taxable.
we independently review the trial court grant of summary judgment.salas sierra chemical cal th.our task is to ascertain whether any triable issue exists as to any material fact ibid,and we do so by independently reviewing the record,by viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the board as the losing party below,and by resolving any evidentiary doubts and ambiguities against summary judgment elk hills power,llc board of equalization cal th.to the extent the summary judgment ruling turns on questions of statutory interpretation,we also review such questions independently.weinstein county of los angeles th.
we will consider each of the board arguments separately.
software as tangible personal property 
the board argues that the computer software in this case is tangible personal property,and offers the following syllogism in support of its position tangible personal property is property that may be seen or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses the act of placing data in this case,at software on magnetic tapes and compact discs physically alters those tapes and discs ergo,the software can be microscopically seen and perceived by the senses,thereby rendering it tangible personal property.
we reject this syllogism for two reasons.first and foremost,it is inconsistent with precedent.as detailed above,when tangible and intangible property is inextricably intertwined,whether the property is subject to the sales tax turns on whether the tangible property is essential or physically useful to the subsequent use of the intangible personal property.preston,supra,cal th at navistar,supra,cal th at.more to the point,the california courts have on multiple occasions held that the transmission of software using a tape or disc in conjunction with the grant of a license to copy or use that software does not yield a taxable transaction because the tape or disc is merely a convenient storage medium used to transfer the copyrighted content and hence not in itself essential or physically useful to the later use of the intangible personal property.microsoft,supra,th at accord,nortel,supra,th at noting that the buyer made little use of the tangible disk containing the program,which was simply copied onto its computers.critically,this is true even when by definition the use of the tape or disc to transmit the software necessarily puts content on the tape or disc and thereby alters its physical structure.by seeking to make the physical alteration of the storage media dispositive,the board ignores this precedent.
second,the board construction of section leads to an absurd result.although we must evaluate the taxability of a transaction by what the taxpayer actually did rather than by what it could have done wallace berrie state board of equalization cal d,in construing a statute we are to avoid an interpretation that leads to absurd results riverside county sheriff stiglitz cal th.if we accepted the board construction of section,at would be liable for nearly million in sales tax because it decided to transmit its software to the telephone companies using tapes and discs,but would have been liable for no sales tax on the software if had instead transmitted the software electronically via email or through uploading it to a remote server on the internet for later download by the telephone companies,tit,subd.f d sale of canned computer program not subject to sales tax if transferred by remote telecommunications from the seller place of business.ascribing such tremendous consequences to the manner in which a software program is transmitted when that manner is wholly collateral to the subsequent use of the licenses regarding that software and when that manner is so easily manipulated by the buyer and seller is an absurd result nowhere sanctioned by the language of,or policy underlying,california sales tax law.
the board offers four further reasons in support of its position.first,it argues that two california cases navistar,supra,cal th and touche ross,supra,d are consistent with its view that the sale of computer software on physical media is a transaction subject to the sales tax.however,both of these cases involved the sale of computer software for its own sake and not in conjunction with the concurrent sale of intellectual property rights.navistar,at touche ross,at.neither case had occasion to consider the issue before us now namely,whether the transmission of software through a physical media as a means of effectuating the grant of a license to copy and use that software is subject to the sales tax.as noted above,courts assess taxability in this context using a different rule than they use to assess taxability in the context at issue in navistar and touche ross.
second,the board argues that sections and,which create exceptions to the sales tax for certain types of transactions involving computer software,necessarily imply that all other transactions involving software are taxable otherwise,the board reasons,these two sections would be superfluous.we agree that we should generally avoid interpreting a statutory scheme in a way that renders any part of it superfluous city of alhambra county of los angeles cal th,but the longstanding precedent we follow today does not render either section or section superfluous.section excepts from the sales tax the service of creating a custom computer program,and section excepts from the sales tax the sale of equipment including the software necessary to operate that equipment that is purchased by entities using that equipment to stimulate economic development as part of california enterprise zone program.see assem.bill reg.sess.neither provision arises in the context of a concurrent transfer of inextricably intertwined intangible and tangible personal property,and consequently neither is rendered a nullity by our ruling today.
third,the board argues that louisiana courts treat software as tangible property subject to louisiana sales tax.south central bell.barthelemy so d,barthelemy.as explained above,california law is different.indeed,barthelemy itself distinguishes california law on this very point.ibid.where authority is at odds with california law,it lacks even persuasive value.fairbanks superior court cal th.
lastly,the board asks us to overturn the precedent that dictates a ruling against it.we are bound to follow the decisions of our supreme court auto equity sales,superior court cal d,but do have some latitude to disregard the decisions of our sister courts of appeal and even our own prior decisions roger cleveland golf,crane smith th,overruled on other grounds by lee hanley cal th,although we only exercise that latitude when there is good reason to do so bourhis lord cal th.courts are especially hesitant to overturn prior decisions where,as here,the issue is a statutory one that our legislature has the power to alter.johnson department of justice cal th.here,nortel analysis is largely governed by california supreme court precedent that binds us.further,there is no good reason to revisit the remaining portions of nortel because the interpretation the board urges would,as noted above,lead to absurd results.
for these reasons,we conclude that the transmission of at software using physical media as part of a transaction granting a license to copy and use that software did not transform that software into tangible personal property subject to the sales tax.
applicability of the t echnology t ransfer a greement statutes 
the board alternatively contends that,even if at computer software is not itself tangible personal property,the transactions between at and the telephone companies are still subject to the sales tax in their entirety because the contracts underlying them do not amount to technology transfer agreements and thus fall under the default rule that,in the board view,subjects all of the property sold or leased under the contracts to the sales tax.the unspoken premise of the board argument is that the switches,documentation,software,and licenses are all inextricably intertwined,and thus not subject to the rule that independently assesses taxability for each readily separable component of a transaction.it is far from clear that this premise is valid.we need not decide the validity of the premise because,even if we assume these components are inextricably intertwined,the transaction is still not subject to the sales tax in its entirety because the contracts between at and the telephone companies meet the statutory definition of technology transfer agreements.
as noted above,a technology transfer agreement is an agreement that satisfies three elements a person holds a patent or copyright that person assigns or licenses to another the right to make and sell a product or to use a process and the resulting product or process is subject to the assignor or licensor patent or copyright interest,subd.c d,subd.c d.
the first element is met because the undisputed evidence indicates that at computer software was copyrighted and patented.accord,apple computers,formula international,cir,overruled on other grounds by flexible lifeline,precision lift,cir computer programs may be copyrighted.the board argues that the at evidence on this point was provided through the declarations of persons without personal knowledge,but these declarations specifically state to the contrary and the board has forfeited its challenge to the trial court decision to credit these assertions of personal knowledge by not supporting its challenge on appeal with legal authority people bryant,smith wheeler cal th.the board further argues that at never established which claim within each of its patents the software embodied and offered only conclusory declarations that the software was copyright and,yet these arguments are beside the point because there is no dispute that the software was a copyrighted work or that the software embodied some portion of at patents.nothing in sections or requires any greater granularity of proof than was established here.accord,preston,supra,cal th at the absence of the word copyright in most of the agreements is irrelevant.
the second and third elements are also met.at transferred a portion of its copyright interest in its software when it granted the telephone companies a license to reproduce its copyrighted work.mai systems peak computer,cir,overruled on other grounds by ebay,mercexchange,llc loading copyrighted software into a computer random access memory or ram creates a copy of that software in violation of the copyright act.the transfer of a single copyright right is sufficient.preston,supra,cal th at where the wording of the agreement clearly transfers one of the rights or any subdivision of the rights specified in title united states code section,a copyright transfer has occurred,italics added d allowing the rights attaching to a copyrighted work to be transferred in whole or in part.the resulting products the telephone products the telephone companies sold to their customers were subject to this copyright interest.a product is subject to a copyright interest citations,if the product is a copy of the protected expression or incorporates a copy of the protected expression.preston,at.without incorporat ing a copy of at software,the switches could not route calls or data,or offer call waiting and other features,which are the very products the telephone companies were selling.at also transferred a portion of its patent rights when it granted the telephone companies licenses to use the processes embodied in its software,and the companies resulting products which,again,required the use of that software were consequently subject to those patents.that is because t he license of a patent interest gives the licensee the right to make a product or use a process.id.at.
our prior decision in nortel is exactly on point and came to the same conclusion.there,nortel sold switches and licensed the software needed to operate them to a telephone company.the board sought to assess the sales tax on the software that was transmitted to the telephone company using physical media.nortel,supra,th at.indeed,as the trial court in this case observed,one could almost substitute the names of the plaintiff and the monetary amounts,and the facts would be essentially the same.nortel came to the conclusion that the entire transaction constituted a technology transfer agreement,and that the portion of the transaction dealing with the software and licenses to use it was not subject to the sales tax.id.at.
the board nevertheless offers two reasons why we should reach a different result in this case.we consider each in turn.
transfer of insufficient rights 
the board argues that a contract may qualify as a technology transfer agreement only if the manufacturer transfers meaningful copyright and patent rights,which the board defines as the right to or sell downstream some patented or copyrighted item.in the board view,it is not enough if the license grants merely the rights any customer would need in order to make conventional use of the associated tangible personal property.
we reject this argument for two reasons.first,it finds no support in the technology transfer agreement statutes,which refer simply to the assignment or licensing of a patent or copyright interest,subd.c d,subd.c d.the requirement that the transferred intellectual property interest be meaningful or more than conventional appears nowhere in the text of the statute,and we are generally bound by a statute plain text people gutierrez cal th,gutierrez,and are not permitted to add words to a statute to accomplish a purpose not apparent from the face of the statute.community development com.county of ventura th.second,the argument is inconsistent with federal copyright law,which provides that rights to a copyrighted work may be transferred piecemeal d,and with our supreme court pronouncement that a technology transfer agreement may be based upon the transfer of a single copyright right preston,supra,cal th at.
the board offers six arguments as to why we should nonetheless adopt its position.first,the board argues that implying a requirement that the transfer of intellectual property rights be meaningful is necessary to assure that a technology transfer agreement and the partial tax exemption that comes with it is not based on a transfer of rights that is completely lacking in substance.this argument ignores that the technology transfer agreement statutes require a bona fide transfer of intellectual property rights.that the requisite transfer need not be as sweeping as the board might prefer does not mean that any transfer is a sham.
second,the board asserts that the technology transfer agreement statutes codified the decision in petition of intel corporation june,transfer binder cal.tax rptr.cch paragraph,page intel.because intel involved a transfer of intellectual property rights in anticipation of a mass production of software,the board reasons,the statutes should be similarly limited.although the technology transfer agreement statutes surely sought to codify intel preston,supra,cal th at,the statutes the legislature enacted reflect intel central holding namely,that only the tangible portion of a concurrent transfer of tangible personal property and intangible copyright and patent rights is subject to the sales tax but the statutes are not limited to intel factual context.indeed,the statutes legislative history indicates that the board warned the legislature of how broadly the statutes could be construed,and the legislature enacted the statutes anyway.nortel,supra,th at the legislature enacted the technology transfer agreement statutes over the board objections.
third,and along the same lines,the board argues that several cases applying the technology transfer agreement statutes namely,preston,supra,cal th,microsoft,supra,th,and intel,supra,transfer binder rptr.cch p,involved the transfers of copyright patent interests in anticipation of mass production of products using that intellectual property,and that we must interpret the statutes in light of the lessons these cases teach.but we are hesitant to engraft a limitation onto statutes that appears nowhere in their text and which the legislature declined to adopt simply because a handful of cases later applying the statutes happened to arise in a particular factual setting.we are especially loathe to do so when other cases have also applied the statutes in a setting that the suggested limitation would foreclose.nortel,supra,th at.
fourth,the board cites one of its regulations to support its position.to be sure,the regulation provides that a sales tax is properly assessed against the storage media and all license fees attendant to the sale or lease of a prewritten or canned computer program unless the license fees are made for the right to reproduce or copy a copyrighted program in order for the program to be published and distributed for consideration to third parties,tit,subds.f f b.but this regulation must give way to the technology transfer agreement statutes in situations,as in this case,where they both may apply.see yamaha of america state board of equalization cal th,conc.opn.of mosk,n o regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute,quoting morris williams cal d,italics omitted.
fifth,the board urges us to follow the general interpretive maxim that tax statutes must be construed liberally in favor of the taxing authority,and strictly against a claimed exemption.dicon fiberoptics,franchise tax board cal th,quoting hospital service of california city of oakland d.an interpretive maxim is a helpful guide to use when a statute language is ambiguous and the competing arguments on how to construe that statute are in equipoise maxims can not be used to trump a statute plain text or to ignore binding precedent.see butts board of trustees of california state university th,if the plain language of a statute is clear and unambiguous,there is no need to resort to the canons of construction or extrinsic aids to interpretation.
lastly,the board asks us to overrule nortel.however,nortel is not the only decision standing between the board and the result it wants the principle that the transfer of a single right can underlie a valid technology transfer agreement comes from the federal copyright statutes and our supreme court decision in preston,supra,cal th,authority we are not at liberty to disregard.further,the board gives us no good reason to depart from this authority,even if we could.
failure to refute all possible copyright and patent defenses 
the board further contends that a product or process is subject to a copyright or patent and that a contract transferring such rights may qualify as a technology transfer agreement only if,without the license granted in the contract,the licensee would have infringed the copyright or patent.put differently,the board urges that the technology transfer agreement statutes are inapplicable unless and until the taxpayer makes a prima facie showing that it was more likely than not that,absent the licenses in the agreements,its customers would have infringed on the taxpayer patent or copyright interests when using the acquired software.any lesser showing,the board implies,would turn any contract into a technology transfer agreement merely because the taxpayer says so.
we decline to engraft such a requirement onto the technology transfer agreement statutes for several reasons.first and foremost,a requirement appears nowhere in the text of the statutes.second,and as noted above,such a requirement is flatly inconsistent with our supreme court holding that the licensee product is subject to a copyright interest when that product is a copy or incorporates a copy of the copyrighted work,and is subject to a patent when that product is made us ing the patented process.preston,supra,cal th at.the requirements set forth in preston are not a meaningless formality.
third,the board interpretation would,for all intents and purposes,foreclose any use of the technology transfer agreement statutes.the board suggests that at has not met the board proffered new standard because at did not refute the possible copyright defenses of implied license to make a single copy of computer programs a of implied oral license effects assocs.cohen cir,of equitable estoppel hadady dean witter reynolds,of exhaustion morrissey proctor gamble cir,of the uncopyrightability of ideas and processes lotus dev.borland international cir,b and of fair use and the patent defenses of exhaustion quanta computer,lg electronics,of implied license zenith electronics pdi commun,and of equitable estoppel aukerman chaides constr,overruled on other grounds by sca hygiene prods.aktiebolag first quality baby,llc.lexis.the board has not adduced any evidence that these defenses might be at issue in this case if no evidentiary showing is required,as the board argument suggests,then the defenses a taxpayer would have to refute are limited only by the board ingenuity and imagination.this is a profoundly unsound result.it would turn every taxpayer refund action involving the technology transfer agreement statutes into a copyright patent trial.further,because it would obligate the taxpayer who by statute bears the burden of establishing its entitlement to a tax exemption to refute every possible copyright and patent defense,the board interpretation would effectively nullify those statutes.this is a result we can not countenance.gutierrez,supra,cal
