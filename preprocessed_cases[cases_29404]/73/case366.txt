in colony,commissioner of internal revenue,the united states supreme court held that an overstatement of basis in assets resulting in an understatement of reported gross income does not constitute an omission from gross income for purposes of extending the general statute of limitations for tax assessments.because colony squarely applies to this case,and because we will not defer to treasury regulation e e,which was promulgated during this litigation and,by its own terms,does not apply to the tax year at issue,we reverse and hold that the tax assessments at issue here were untimely.

in april,home concrete and the taxpayers timely filed their tax returns for the tax year.home concrete elected to adjust,or,its inside basis under to equal the taxpayers outside bases.see b.home concrete then adjusted its inside basis to,including the amount of short sale proceeds earlier contributed by the taxpayers.as a result,home concrete reported a modest gain from the sale of its assets.
home concrete tax return reported the basic components of the transactions.its election form gave,for each partnership asset,an itemized accounting of the partnership inside basis,the amount of the basis adjustment,and the basis.the sum of the bases is indicated at the end of the form.on its face,home concrete return also showed a sale of treasury bonds acquired on may,at a cost of,and a sale of those bonds on may,for.the return also reported the resulting gain of.similarly,the taxpayers individual returns showed that during the year the proceeds of a short sale not closed by the taxpayer in this tax year were received.
notwithstanding these disclosures,the internal revenue service irs did not investigate the taxpayers transactions until june.the irs issued a summons to jenkins gilchrist,the law firm that assisted the taxpayers with the transactions,on june.the parties agree that substantial compliance with the irs summons did not occur until at least may.
as a result of the investigation,on september,the irs issued a final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa,decreasing to zero the taxpayers reported outside bases in home concrete and thereby substantially increasing the taxpayers taxable income.specifically,the irs reasoned that 
the purported partnership was formed and availed of solely for purposes of tax avoidance by artificially overstating basis in the partnership interests of its purported partners t he acquisition of any interest in the purported partnership by the purported partner,short sales of treasury notes,the transfer of proceeds from short sales of treasury notes or other assets to a partnership in return for a partnership interest,the purchase or disposition of assets by the partnership,and the distribution of those assets or proceeds from the disposition of those assets to the purported partners,and the subsequent sale of those assets to generate a loss,all within a period of months,had no business purpose other than tax avoidance,lacked economic substance,and,in fact and substance,constitutes an economic sham for federal income tax purposes.accordingly,the partnership and the transactions described above shall be disregarded in full and any purported losses resulting from these transactions are not allowable as deductions and increases in basis of assets are not allowed to eliminate gain for federal income tax purposes.
accordingly,home concrete deposited with the irs and sued in the district court for the eastern district of north carolina to recover that amount,alleging that the fpaa was barred by the general limitations period in a.
in response,the irs contended that the fpaa was timely under the limitations period in e a.the irs invoked the extended statute of limitations arguing that home concrete omit ted from gross income an amount properly includable therein and which exceeded of the amount of gross income stated in home concrete tax return.home concrete supply,llc united states,d.there was no dispute that if an amount had been omitted from home concrete return,that amount exceeded the threshold.likewise,there was no dispute that the fpaa would have been timely under the statute of limitations,which would have been tolled beginning six months after the date the summons issued to the date of compliance.id.at see also e.by the district court calculation,the limitations period for the tax returns was suspended from december,until may,thus,a statute,tolled,would not have run even under this most restrictive interpretation of the record until september.home concrete supply,d at.
on the other hand,the taxpayers argued that the statute of limitations was inapplicable because home concrete allegedly overstated basis did not constitute an omission from gross income.and even if it had been an omission,the taxpayers argued,their tax returns collectively made adequate disclosure of the transactions such that they were entitled to the safe harbor of the statute of limitations under e b ii hereafter safe harbor provision.id.at.
thereafter,the district court granted partial summary judgment in the irs favor,ruling that where a taxpayer overstates basis and,as a result,leaves an amount out of gross income,the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein for purposes of e a.id.at.the court ordered further briefing on,among other issues,whether the taxpayers adequately disclosed any omitted amount such that the safe harbor provision applied.after considering the supplemental briefs the district court ruled that the taxpayers failed to make adequate disclosure and therefore could not invoke the safe harbor provision.accordingly,the district court concluded that the fpaa was timely under the statute of limitations in e a.home concrete and the taxpayers appealed.
on appeal,home concrete and the taxpayers argue that colony establishes that an overstated tax basis does not constitute an omission from gross income for purposes of extending the limitations period for assessments.we review this question of law de novo.blaustein reich,buckles,cir 
in colony,the irs alleged that a taxpayer understated the gross profits on the sales of certain lots of land for residential purposes as a result of having overstated the basis of such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain unallowable items of development expense.at.the irs further contended that the amount left out of gross income because of the overstated basis exceeded of the amount of gross income stated in the relevant tax returns.the irs argued that its assessments were therefore timely under the extended statute of limitations in former c.id.at.that section stated that 
if the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includable therein which is in excess of per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return,the tax may be assessed,or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment,at any time within years after the return was filed.
the supreme court in colony acknowledged that former c was ambiguous and did not clearly answer whether congress intended an overstated basis to constitute an omission from gross income stated in the return.the court found in the legislative history persuasive evidence that congress was addressing itself to the specific situation where a taxpayer actually omitted some income receipt or accrual in his computation of gross income,and not more generally to errors in that computation arising from other causes.id.at.according to the court,in enacting former c congress manifested no broader purpose than to give the commissioner an additional two years to investigate tax returns in cases where,because of a taxpayer omission to report some taxable item,the commissioner is at a special disadvantage in detecting errors.id.at.the court therefore refused to construe omits broadly and instead restricted its applicability to situations where taxpayers actually fail to report income.
notably,in dicta,the supreme court also stated that its conclusion was in harmony with the unambiguous language of section e a the section at issue in this case.id.emphasis added.in,congress recodified former c at e a.congress extended the limitations period from five years to six,and added the following additional subsections 
i in the case of a trade or business,the term gross income means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services if such amounts are required to be shown on the return prior to diminution by the cost of such sales or services and 
ii in determining the amount omitted from gross income,there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted from gross income stated in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return,or in a statement attached to the return,in a manner adequate to apprise the secretary or his delegate of the nature and amount of such item.
section e a and former c are otherwise essentially identical.
in this case,the district court distinguished colony on the ground that its holding is limited to cases in which the taxpayer is a trade or business selling goods or services.home concrete supply,d at accord,beard comm r,slip op.at cir,holding that colony only applies in the trade or business context cc fw.operations.comm r,cir noting,in dicta,the arguable implication that the holding of colony applies only to sales of goods or services by a trade or business.in doing so,the district court relied heavily upon the court of federal claims decision in salman ranch,united states,fed.cl,which has since been reversed by the federal circuit.f d.the federal circuit expressly refused to limit colony application to sales of goods or services by a trade or business because nothing in colony suggests such a limitation.salman ranch,at see also bakersfield energy partners,comm r,cir there is no ground for suggesting that the colony court intended the same language in c to apply differently to taxpayers in a trade or business than to other taxpayers.grapevine imports,united states,fed.cl,t his court sees no basis for limiting the supreme court decision in colony to sales of goods or services by a trade or business.utam,comm r,cch,same.
like the ninth and federal circuits,we hold that the supreme court in colony straightforwardly construed the phrase omits from gross income,unhinged from any dependency on the taxpayer identity as a trade or business selling goods or services.there is,therefore,no ground to conclude that the holding in colony is limited to cases involving a trade or business selling goods or services.see salman ranch,at we are not prepared to simply upon the court reference to ambiguity in c and the lack thereof in e a that the court facially unqualified holding nevertheless carries with it a qualification.
further,the supreme court discussion of the legislative history behind former c is equally compelling with regard to current e a.the language the court construed in former c omits from gross income an amount properly includable therein is identical to the language at issue in e a.because there has been no material change between former c and current e a,and no change at all to the most pertinent language,we are not free to construe an omission from gross income as something other than a failure to report some income receipt or accrual.colony,at see also bakersfield energy partners,at concluding that colony forecloses the argument that an overstated basis can constitute an omission from gross income for purposes of extending the statute of limitations under e a salman ranch,at same.thus,we join the ninth and federal circuits and conclude that colony forecloses the argument that home concrete overstated basis in its reporting of the short sale proceeds resulted in an omission from its reported gross income.
the irs presses another path around colony.after concluding that the irs position regarding the meaning of omits was barred by colony,the ninth circuit commented that the irs may have the authority to promulgate a reasonable reinterpretation of an ambiguous provision of the tax code,even if its interpretation runs contrary to the supreme court opinion as to the best reading of the provision.bakersfield energy partners,at quoting cable telecomms.ass brand x internet.
perhaps in response to the ninth circuit cue,the irs promulgated a temporary regulation on september,which became final during the pendency of this appeal.reg.e.the irs claims that this regulation is entitled to controlling deference under chevron natural resources defense council.
the regulation states that 
iii for purposes of paragraph a i of this section,the term gross income,as it relates to any income other than from the sale of goods or services in a trade or business,has the same meaning as provided under section a,and includes the total of the amounts received or accrued,to the extent required to be shown on the return.in the case of amounts received or accrued that relate to the disposition of property,and except as provided in paragraph a ii of this section,gross income means the excess of the amount realized from the disposition of the property over the unrecovered cost or other basis of the property.consequently,except as provided in paragraph a ii of this section,an understated amount of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an omission from gross income for purposes of section e a.
e date income taxes.paragraph a of this section applies to taxable years with respect to which the period for assessing tax was open on or after september.
reg.e a iii e.the irs asks us to apply the regulation retroactively to produce the result it desires in this case.we decline to do so for several reasons.
first,the tax year at issue in this case,for which tax returns were due by april,is well beyond the reach of the regulation express period of applicability.even assuming arguendo that the statute of limitations applied,pursuant to the regulation,the period for assessing tax would have expired,according to the district court unchallenged finding,on september.thus,the period for assessing tax for the tax year expired long before september.by its own terms,the regulation does not apply here 
the irs urges a different interpretation of the regulation applicability clause in the preamble to treasury decision.the preamble suggests that the period for assessing tax in e remains open for all taxable years that are the subject of any case pending before any court of competent jurisdiction including the united states tax court and court of federal claims in which a decision had not become final
