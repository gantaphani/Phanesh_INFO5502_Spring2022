facts and proceedings 
certain areas and localities in california suffer from persistently high unemployment,poverty,and anemic economic growth and activity.hoping to remedy these problems,the legislature enacted government code section et,which is known as the enterprise zone act act.the act purpose is to reduce obstacles the legislature believes impede private investment and business in economically depressed areas in california.see,subd.a.the act permits city and county governments containing depressed regions within their jurisdictions to apply to the department of housing and community development dhcd for designation of those regions as enterprise zones,subd.a,subds.a,b.businesses operating within an enterprise zone that hire certain categories of disadvantaged as qualified employees earn tax credits for the wages they pay those workers.depending on the length of time of employment,the tax credit is between and percent of a worker wage,subd.a.

appellant dicon fiberoptics does business in an enterprise zone.dicon alleges it complied with all requirements for earning the tax credit for employing qualified employees in an enterprise zone.among those requirements,it obtained vouchers from any one of several state or local entities who certified dicon employees fit within categories of workers covered by the act,subd.c.in november,dicon submitted a claim for refund of taxes for the taxable year ending in march.submitting vouchers showing it had employed qualified workers in the tax year,dicon sought a credit of more than million.almost three years later in october,respondent franchise tax board ftb denied million of the requested refund.dicon alleges ftb denial was improper because ftb wrongfully refused to accept some of dicon vouchers.ftb demanded instead that dicon provide the documents underlying the local agencies issuance of the vouchers.
dicon appealed to the state board of equalization,which dismissed the appeal in march.dicon thereafter filed the lawsuit at issue in this appeal.seeking recovery of the million credit,dicon alleges ftb improperly rejected its vouchers.dicon alleges it did not have the documents ftb demanded because they related to the personal circumstances of dicon employees that made them qualified employees,such as a criminal record and other impediments to employment,that were private to employees and beyond dicon custody and control.
ftb demurred to the complaint.it argued that revenue and taxation code section governing the tax credit and vouchers did not vest local employment or social service agencies with exclusive authority to certify a worker as a qualified employee.thus,the statute did not obligate ftb to accept vouchers from local agencies,and did not prohibit ftb from asking dicon for the documents on which the local agencies based their decisions.because dicon had not supplied the documents ftb demanded,ftb asserted dicon failed to state a cause of action.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court entered judgment for ftb,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
dicon contends the court erred by sustaining ftb demurrer to dicon complaint for failing to state a cause of action.according to dicon,the statute plain language vests local employment and social services agencies with sole authority to issue vouchers such authority would be meaningless,dicon reasons,if ftb could the agency by auditing the voucher.consequently,dicon asserts its complaint states a cause of action for a tax refund by alleging ftb lacked authority to reject its vouchers.
dicon also contends the trial court compounded its error by sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.according to dicon,even if ftb had the authority to audit vouchers,the court erred in denying dicon leave to amend its complaint to allege ftb mishandled its audit of the vouchers and wrongfully denied the tax credit.
we agree the court erred in sustaining ftb demurrer.a complaint states a cause of action if it alleges facts that entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory.in reviewing the trial court order sustaining a demurrer,we disregard the complaint legal theories and conclusions.tracfone wireless,county of los angeles th,d.instead,we look to whether the complaint states facts that support a cause of action under any theory.blank kirwan cal d,mills bank th,d.we know of no authority that imposes a higher pleading standard for a cause of action for a tax refund than other causes of action.accord mchugh county of santa cruz d.the complaint in an action to recover taxes paid under protest must allege sufficient specific facts to support a conclusion that assessments complained of were excessive or invalid.citations.the allegations must be liberally construed with a view to substantial justice as required under a general demurrer the complaint need not establish the statute,case law,or legal rule that the taxing authority violated,but need only allege that the authority erred.jibilian franchise tax bd.th,fn,d court reviewing demurrer disregards complaint erroneous legal conclusions.it follows,therefore,that a taxpayer complaint states a cause of action for a tax refund if it alleges the plaintiff paid the tax,filed a tax return,requested the refund,and the tax authority denied the refund.here,dicon contends ftb lacked the authority to reject dicon vouchers certifying dicon workers were qualified employees.that contention is a legal conclusion that we may disregard.for reasons we will explain,we conclude ftb may in fact audit vouchers.but even when we disregard dicon mistaken legal contention,its complaint nevertheless alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action for a tax refund.accordingly,the court erred in sustaining ftb demurrer.
we hold alternatively that if a cause of action for a tax refund must identify the taxing authority particular legal error in denying the refund,the trial court erred here in denying dicon leave to amend its complaint.dicon opposition to ftb demurrer requested leave to amend,and its opening brief on appeal describes the proposed amendments those amendments allege that even if ftb had the authority to audit the vouchers,it did so incorrectly here.for example,dicon alleges ftb applied an unlawfully demanding standard of proof in auditing the vouchers.dicon also alleges ftb improperly refused to accept vouchers for workers whose eligibility to participate in certain economic assistance and jobs programs made them qualified employees warranting vouchers.
the trial court error in sustaining ftb demurrer warrants reversal of the court judgment and remand for further proceedings.for the trial court and parties guidance after remand,we address the unanswered legal question looming over these proceedings does ftb authority to examine and audit tax returns permit ftb to reject a voucher issued by a local employment or social services agency ftb answers yes.dicon,in contrast,says a local agency decision is binding on ftb and answers no.thus,according to dicon,ftb must limit its review of vouchers to confirming dicon in fact obtained the voucher from one of the local agencies identified in the statute ftb may not,dicon asserts,review the local agency underlying decision to issue the voucher.we hold voucher are prima facie proof a worker is a qualified employee,but ftb may audit such vouchers.in such an audit,ftb bears the burden of rebutting the vouchers prima facie value,typically by proving the worker did not meet the criteria to be a qualified employee.in trying to meet that burden,ftb may not rely on the employer failure to produce during the audit documents establishing a worker eligibility to the extent regulations governing the tax credit charge the enterprise zone,not the employer,with the obligation to maintain documents of worker eligibility.
ftb rests its assertion of authority on its powers to examine and audit tax returns.ftb asserts revenue and taxation code section empowerment of local employment and social agencies to issue vouchers does not override ftb authority to examine and audit those vouchers.under revenue and taxation code section,ftb has the right to examine dicon tax returns for their correctness.as soon as practicable after the return is filed,the franchise tax board shall examine it and shall determine the correct amount of the tax.and under section,ftb may demand dicon produce documents relevant to ftb examination of the return in an audit.section states 
the franchise tax board,for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return shall have the power to require by demand,that an entity of any kind provide information or make available for examination or copying at a specified time and place,or both,any book,papers,or other data which may be relevant to that purpose.
dicon,on the other hand,notes revenue and taxation code section principally mentions local entities as authorized to issue a voucher.the statute permits the following to certify a worker is a qualified employee the employment development department the local county or city job training partnership act administrative entity,the local county gain office or social services agency,or the local government administering the enterprise zone.from the statute express identification of authorized entities,and particularly its focus on local ones,dicon contends the legislature vested only those entities with the power to issue vouchers,with a particular preference toward the issuance of vouchers by local agencies.citing the principle that a statute expression of some things necessarily excludes other things de anza santa cruz mobile estates homeowners de anza santa cruz mobile estates th,fn,d expressio unius est exclusio alterius,dicon concludes that the statute failure to mention ftb means the legislature intended ftb to have no part in issuing vouchers,meaning ftb could not overrule or issuing agencies by auditing their decisions.
ftb answers that the statute does not explicitly say local agencies have exclusive authority over vouchers.noting that repeal by implication is disfavored,ftb concludes that the statute silence about ftb preserves ftb customary power to examine and audit.we conclude ftb has the better argument based on public policy,the voucher purpose,and legislative history.
dicon reasons the legislature authorized local agencies to issue vouchers because a worker status as a qualified employee sometimes depends on a particular enterprise zone local economy and job market.for example,qualified employees include unemployed workers with limited opportunities for employment or reemployment in the same or similar occupation in the area in which the individual resides,subd.b a iv iv cc,italics added.qualified employees also include formerly persons who are currently unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which he or she resides,subd.b a iv iv dd,italics added.ftb asserts,however,that dicon overstates the expertise of local agencies.ftb notes that most categories of qualified employees do not involve local conditions and are proven by evidence which ftb and local agencies are equally capable of reviewing.such documents include medical reports,information from statewide jobs programs,and media reports,tit.as to this point,we conclude ftb makes the more persuasive claim.
another reason we conclude ftb may audit vouchers is the state board of equalization so held in the matter of the appeal of deluxe corporation,cal.tax lexis the state board of equalization rested its holding on three points.first,the statutes granting ftb the powers to examine and audit tax returns contain broad language and do not carve out exceptions for decisions by other governmental bodies.second,decisions by local agencies generally do not bind state government.finally,for a few years in the,government code former section entitled taxpayers to request a refund of their voucher application fee if ftb rejected the voucher.enacted by stats,ch,and repealed by stats,ch.although this refund provision existed only from through after dicon had already claimed its tax credit,the provision existence contemplated that ftb from time to time might reject a voucher.
dicon urges us not to draw too strong an inference from a taxpayer right to seek a refund of the application fee.dicon emphasizes that the right to a refund arose after dicon had applied in for the tax credit it earned in its tax year.dicon contends that a later legislature enactments do not reveal a previous legislature intent.hence,according to dicon,a later legislature implied ratification of ftb power to reject vouchers does not mean an earlier legislature envisioned ftb having that power.in any case,dicon notes,ftb might have any number of reasons for rejecting a voucher other than reversing a local agency classification of a worker as a qualified employee.for example,ftb might reject the voucher because the employer hired the worker before the state conferred enterprise zone status to the employer geographical area.see,subd.b a iii.or the employer might not merit the voucher because the worker did not work enough hours for the employer,subd.b a i,ii.among the prerequisites for a voucher,local agencies judged only one of a worker was a qualified employee,subds.b a iv,c.we pay heed to dicon caution against placing undue emphasis on the right to seek a refund.we do not,for example,deem the right to be dispositive.nevertheless,it weighs,along with the other factors we cite,in ftb favor.
dicon asserts the matter of the appeal of deluxe corporation deserves little weight because the decision does not discuss the state board of equalization ruling of in the matter of the appeal of robert and vera cort may,wl.we find the failure of deluxe corporation to discuss cort is not fatal to deluxe corporation analysis because the decisions are distinguishable.in cort,tax law prohibited a landlord operating substandard rental property from deducting his business expenses.a property substandard designation came from state or local housing agencies,subd.b a,b cort,wl.a substandard designation was binding on ftb,which could not review the housing agency decision.cort is distinguishable because a property designation as substandard presumably followed an actual or at least the right to adjudicatory hearing in which the landlord could challenge the designation.having been tested in an adversarial proceeding,the substand
