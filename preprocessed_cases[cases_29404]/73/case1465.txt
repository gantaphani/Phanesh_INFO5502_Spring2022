kay coles james,director of the office of personnel management,seeks review of the final reconsideration decision of the arbitrator ordering reinstatement of mary rose tablerion to her position in the internal revenue service irs and awarding her back pay.in the matter of a controversy between the department of the treasury,internal revenue service,employer,and national treasury employees union,re mary rose tablerion,april.because the arbitrator incorrectly interpreted the applicable law,and because under the law as correctly interpreted the internal revenue service did not err in removing tablerion from employment,we reverse.
mary rose tablerion tablerion or tablerion was a revenue agent who worked for the irs in tempe,arizona.tablerion is divorced.according to a divorce decree,she and her are each entitled to claim a tax exemption for one of their two children.if a parent wanted to claim a child care credit in connection with a child for whom the is entitled to claim an exemption,the parent must execute a form to show that he or she is relinquishing entitlement to claim that child as an exemption.the form has two sections,one for relinquishing the entitlement for the current year and the second for relinquishing the entitlement for future years.tablerion obtained and executed two sets of form.she filled out one set to provide that she would relinquish her claim to an exemption for her son for current and future years.she filled out the other set to provide that her would relinquish his claim to an exemption for her daughter for current and future years.after receiving the forms,tablerion called tablerion and informed her that he was only going to execute the section of the form relinquishing entitlement for her daughter for the current year.tablerion asked for the forms back,and tablerion refused.the following morning tablerion called tablerion and left the following message 
uh,if you not gon na sign em i want all four of those back.i not signing anything then and you do get the child care credit then.if you do,if i do get em,all four of them back,uh,i will write the irs and,and,uh inform them to audit your returns.uh,that something was attached that,uh,we did not agree to then since you would sign mine.bye.
tablerion eventually reported the statement to the treasury inspector general for tax administration,whose office conducted an investigation.on the basis of the statement i will write the irs and,and,uh inform them to audit your returns,the agency deciding official forwarded a removal recommendation to the agency review board,which in turn sent the matter to the commissioner of internal revenue,who determined that the required penalty of removal would not be mitigated.the commissioner made the decision not to mitigate the penalty even though the review board had recommended mitigation,and therefore advised the deciding official to issue the removal decision.the irs thus removed tablerion from her position pursuant to the internal revenue service reform and restructuring act of the act,tit.i,stat,codified at note.represented by the national treasury employees union,tablerion grieved her case in arbitration.
the arbitrator was asked to determine whether the irs had erred in removing tablerion pursuant to section of the act section.section entitled termination of employment for misconduct states 
a in general.subject to subsection c,the commissioner of internal revenue shall terminate the employment of any employee of the internal revenue service if there is a final administrative or judicial determination that such employee committed any act or omission described under subsection b in the performance of the employee official duties.such termination shall be a removal for cause on charges of misconduct.
b acts or omissions.the acts or omissions referred to under subsection a are 
threatening to audit a taxpayer for the purpose of extracting personal gain or benefit.
on its face,the act requires that the employee act or omission be committed in the performance of the employee official duties and when a threat to audit is involved,that the threat be made for the purpose of extracting personal gain or benefit.id.the arbitrator held,and tablerion does not contest,that her threat was for the purpose of extracting personal gain,return of the tax forms.
reasoning that the statute was ambiguous and penal in nature,the arbitrator interpreted the in the performance of the employee official duties provision of section in favor of tablerion.the arbitrator defined in the performance of the employee official duties to mean,leveraging her status as an irs employee.in light of the above interpretation,the arbitrator reasoned that tablerion statement i will write the irs and,and,uh inform them to audit your returns did not suggest the use of influence or her position because it exhibited a lack of control she did not state that she would either audit tablerion or have him audited.in the arbitrator view,tablerion statement was no different than what might be expected of someone who is not employed by the irs.the arbitrator thus held that tablerion statement did not satisfy the requirement of in the performance of the employee official duties.
the arbitrator then considered the question of whether tablerion statement constituted a threat to audit under the statute.in so doing,the arbitrator again construed the statute in tablerion favor.in addition,the arbitrator held that congress,when enacting the statute in suit,must have been aware of settled judicial interpretations of the word threat,and for that reason the arbitrator relied on metz department of the treasury,to determine whether tablerion statement was threatening.
metz concerned the removal of a federal employee who threatened to kill his superiors.in metz,the merit systems protection board board sustained metz removal,holding that the statements made by metz met the requisite test would a reasonable person hearing metz sic statements think those statements were threats.id.at.on appeal to this court,we agreed that the test used by the board is the correct test,citing our earlier holding in meehan united states postal service.see metz,at.the board sustained metz removal based on the testimony of five witnesses two testified that they did not perceive metz statements as threats two testified that they had no expectation that metz would harm his superiors or did not consider his statements serious enough to warrant reporting and the testimony of the fifth witness was discredited by the presiding official.id.at.in those circumstances,this court stated that certain factors needed consideration to determine whether the record in the case contained substantial evidence supporting the board conclusion that metz had made a threat to kill his superiors.
the criteria mentioned by the court in metz by which to weigh the testimony of the witnesses were the listener reactions the listener apprehension of harm the speaker intent any conditional nature of the statements and the attendant circumstances.id.at.after particularly crafting these factors to test for a threat to do bodily harm to another person,this court applied the factors to the testimony of the five witnesses,concluding,ultimately,that the record lacked substantial evidence that metz had threatened to kill his superiors.
even though the metz case,as well as the meehan case to which the metz opinion referred,dealt with threats of bodily harm,the arbitrator in this case applied the criteria stated in metz.according to the arbitrator,the first four criteria favored tablerion,because she had testified that she had really not meant to provoke an audit of tablerion returns,and because tablerion must not have taken the statement seriously because he did not report it to the agency immediately.also,the arbitrator found that tablerion had felt no apprehension of harm to himself,but instead had reacted to tablerion statement with vengeance.further,the arbitrator considered tablerion statement to be conditional,a fact,under that metz criterion,favorable to tablerion.finally,the arbitrator found that the attendant circumstances cut against tablerion,because
