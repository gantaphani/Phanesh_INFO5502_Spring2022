background 
the facts of this case are not in dispute.marsh,a financial services company,overpaid its federal income taxes by overpayment and overpaid its taxes by overpayment.
marsh also overpaid the amount of federal income taxes shown on the return by,and at the time the return was filed,marsh elected to apply this overpayment to its tax liability credit elect overpayment.the internal revenue service irs permits a corporate taxpayer that has paid more than its liability in one year to claim a credit for the excess against its estimated taxes for the succeeding year.b the credit is called a credit elect overpayment.as discussed below,credit elect overpayments do not earn interest.the credit elect overpayment was transferred by the irs from marsh tax account into its tax account on march,the due date of its tax return.
marsh also overpaid the amount of taxes shown on the return by,and at the time the return was filed,marsh elected to apply this overpayment to its tax liability credit elect overpayment.a portion of the credit elect overpayment was transferred by the irs from marsh tax account into its tax account on september,to satisfy its estimated tax liability,and the remainder of the credit elect overpayment was transferred from marsh tax account into its tax account on march,to satisfy its final tax liability.
thus,marsh had made four separate overpayments if the and tax liabilities as shown in the returns were accurate the overpayment the overpayment the credit elect overpayment and the credit elect overpayment.
in,the irs determined that marsh had in fact underpaid its taxes by.this increase in tax was less than the amount of the credit elect overpayment.the irs applied marsh overpayment and a portion of its overpayment to its tax account on march,the date the credit elect overpayment was applied to marsh tax account.
similarly,in,the irs determined that marsh had in fact underpaid its taxes by.this increase in tax was less than the amount of the credit elect overpayment.the irs applied the remainder of marsh overpayment to its tax account.the actual transfers were made on september,the date the credit elect overpayment was applied to the estimated tax payment for,and march,the date the remainder of marsh credit elect overpayment was applied to marsh tax account.
there is no dispute concerning the amount of marsh and overpayments,the dates that those payments were credited to later years taxes,the amount of the and credit elect overpayments,the dates on which those credit elect overpayments were needed to satisfy later years obligations,or the amount of marsh and tax liabilities.the ultimate issue concerns the amount of interest due on the and overpayments.
an overpayment occurs when a taxpayer has paid as an installment of the tax more than the amount determined to be the correct amount of such installment.the irs has authority to either refund or credit the overpayment to any unpaid installment.id.unlike credit elect overpayments,overpayments bear interest.see id.a.for the overpayment amount and the portion of the overpayment amount credited against marsh tax liability,the irs allowed interest through april,the due date for marsh tax return plus one month for the portion of the overpayment amount credited against marsh tax liability,the irs allowed interest through april,the due date for marsh tax return plus one month.the government stopped the running of interest on those dates because it reasoned that overpayment interest runs only until the due date of a taxpayer federal income tax return for the year to which the overpayment was applied.
the governing statute,entitled interest on overpayments,provides in relevant part that s uch interest shall be allowed and paid as follows in the case of a credit,from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken.id.b.treasury regulation h provides general rule.if an overpayment of tax is credited,interest shall be allowed from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the amount against which such overpayment is credited.h.due date is defined in subsection h i in general.the term due date,as used in this section,means the last day fixed by law or regulations for the payment of the tax determined without regard to any extension of time id.h i.for taxes reported on a return,this payment date is the last unextended date fixed for filing the return.a.
the parties apparently agree that,absent the credit elect overpayments,the two due dates involved here were march,and march,the due dates for the and tax returns respectively and that interest on the and overpayments would have ceased on those dates.thus,the issue on appeal is the effect of the credit elect overpayments on the running of interest.it is well established that the taxpayer earns no interest on credit elect overpayments.if a taxpayer elects to credit against its estimated liability for one taxable year an overpayment shown on its return for the preceding year,it collects no interest even though at one point it has paid the irs more than was due.h vii martin marietta united states.the question is whether credit elect overpayments must be taken into account in calculating the interest due on other overpayments.
proceedings below 
marsh filed a complaint in the court of federal claims seeking in overpayment interest for the period between april,and march,for its overpayment and a portion of its overpayment for the period between april,and september,for a portion of its overpayment and between april,and march,for the remainder of its overpayment,the ending dates representing the dates on which the credit elect overpayments were applied to subsequent tax year liabilities.the government filed a motion for summary judgment,and marsh filed a cross motion for summary judgment.
marsh argued that,which provides for the accrual of interest on overpayments to the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken,should be construed to mean that interest runs until an account actually becomes deficient,that is,due and unpaid.marsh argued that its tax account was not actually deficient until march,when the credit elect overpayment was applied to its tax account.similarly,marsh argued that its tax account was not actually deficient until september,when a portion of its credit elect was applied to its estimated taxes,and on march,when the remainder of its credit elect was applied to its tax account.
the government argued that,under the plain meaning of section and treasury regulation h,the due date of the amount against which the credit is taken is the due date of a taxpayer federal income tax return for the year to which the overpayment is applied.marsh overpayment and a portion of its overpayment were applied to its tax account,and the remainder of the overpayment was applied to marsh tax account.marsh was required to file its tax return on march,and its tax return on march.therefore,the government argued,marsh was entitled to interest on its overpayment and a portion of its overpayment until march,and on the remainder of its overpayment until march,
the court of federal claims recognized that the case turned on the interpretation of section,and determined that,read in isolation,the statutory language,which is,at best,not a model of clarity,does not yield a satisfactory result.marsh,fed.cl.at.similarly,the court concluded that neither the use of money principle,under which overpayments and underpayments are generally netted in calculating interest,nor irs revenue rulings provided the answer.id.at.the court then assessed the relative predictability of the parties competing interpretations.id.at.the court noted that marsh interpretation would make interest accrual cease on the date an overpayment was actually credited against another tax liability,and,under marsh interpretation,the due date becomes wholly dependent on the irs accounting procedures,which have not been shown to be governed by the statutory language of b.id.at.the court rejected marsh interpretation in large part because the due date would be impossible to predict in advance in that it depended on the vagaries of the irs internal accounting procedures,and accepted the government interpretation because it harmonizes with the principle of predictability and comports with the statutory language.id.at.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government.

discussion 
this case involves the question when interest on tax overpayments ceases to run.
as noted above,the parties apparently agree that,if there had been no credit elect overpayment in or,the due date for the additional tax due for and would have been march of the year following the tax year in question,here march,and march.under either party interpretation of section,interest on the and overpayments would have ceased to run on those dates.
the parties disagreement arises from the existence of the and credit elect overpayments.marsh argues that because of the credit elect overpayments,there was no outstanding liability in its account until the overpayment and a portion of the overpayment were applied to its tax account on march,and there was no outstanding liability in its account until the remainder of the overpayment was applied to its estimated tax on september,and its final tax on march.
marsh urges that,as a result of its credit elect overpayment,it overpaid the government between the period of the credit elect overpayment and the due date of the tax return of the year to which the credit elect overpayment was applied,that is,from march,to march.similarly,marsh urges that,as a result of its credit elect overpayment,it overpaid the government from march,to september,and march.
marsh contends that there was no payment due until its tax account actually became negative on march,the date that the credit elect overpayment was applied to its tax account.similarly,marsh contends that there was no payment due until its tax account became negative on september,the date when a portion of its credit elect overpayment was applied to its tax account,and again on march,when the remainder of its credit elect overpayment was applied to its tax account.
the government urges that the due date for purposes of section is the due date of the returns,and that this date does not change as a result of the and credit elect overpayments.
we agree with the government and disagree with marsh for several reasons.
first,the language of section b,as interpreted by treasury regulation h,requires this result.
both parties argue from their view of the supposed plain language of section b.in fact,the statutory language is ambiguous.the due date could refer either to the due date of the return the government position or the date on which there is a net deficit in the amount due in the taxpayer account for the particular year the taxpayer position.under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,we look to the treasury regulations to resolve the ambiguity.see united states mead,d united states haggar apparel,d.the treasury regulations are,we think,quite clear.they provide general rule.if an overpayment of tax is credited,interest shall be allowed from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the amount against which such overpayment is credited,h,and define due date as in general.the term due date,as used in this section,means the last day fixed by law or regulations for the payment of the tax determined without regard to any extension of time,id.h i.marsh notes that because the regulations state that this definition of due date will be used i n general,they do not purport to interpret the entire phrase due date of the amount against which the credit is taken in section b.as the government points out,however,treasury regulation is actually keyed to the relevant section of the code,section,indicating that it does in fact relate to section.we agree with the government that the regulation does apply.
marsh also contends that the regulations are unreasonable.we can not agree.for reasons that we discuss below,there is nothing unreasonable in disregarding credit elect overpayments in calculating overpayment interest.and,while an irs interpretation of its regulation might be entitled to deference where there is an ambiguity,am.express united states,marsh cites no interpretation of the regulations by the irs in a context similar to this one that would contradict their plain meaning 
contrary to marsh argument,the legislative history of section does not support marsh.section as it reads today was enacted in the technical amendments act of,stat,reprinted in,and is identical in relevant part to section of the internal revenue act of marsh urges that the legislative history establishes that the due date against which the credit is taken is the date on which the overpayment is economically offset against a liability.marsh argues that the legislative history reveals that congress intended that interest accrue on a credited overpayment until the date on which an overpayment and underpayment simultaneously existed,on the date on which mutuality of indebtedness arose,citing the senate finance committee report,reprinted in.but the legislative history on which marsh relies does not address the precise issue here or suggest that a credit elect overpayment must be considered in calculating interest.in enacting and amending section and its predecessor,section,congress sought to address specific issues,such as to eliminate the distinction between the running of interest in the situation where an overpayment is credited against a deficiency and where it is credited against an underpayment of original tax to eliminate the running of interest where overpayments and underpayments offset each other to address the anomaly in the transitional situation in which a taxpayer which owed money to the government on taxes imposed by a prior revenue act paid no interest but collected interest upon money the government owed it and to eliminate the requirement of a protest as a condition precedent for a taxpayer to receive overpayment interest thus,the legislative history does not support marsh interpretation of the statute.
second,contrary to marsh argument,section a of the code does not require a different result.that section provides 
in the case of any overpayment,the secretary,within the applicable period of limitations,may credit the amount of such overpayment,including any interest allowed thereon,against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment and shall,subject to subsections c,d,and e refund any balance to such person.
a emphasis added.marsh argues that there was no liability within the meaning of section a until the credit elect overpayments were applied to subsequent years taxes.marsh points out that the irs in fact did not apply the and overpayments to the tax account until the tax account actually became negative,that is,when the credit elect overpayment was transferred to the tax account on march.similarly,the irs did not apply the overpayment to the tax account until the tax account in fact became negative,that is,when the credit elect overpayment was transferred to pay estimated taxes on september,and the final taxes on march.
section makes no reference to section,and whatever limitations section may impose on the irs authority to credit,section does not define the term due date for purpose
