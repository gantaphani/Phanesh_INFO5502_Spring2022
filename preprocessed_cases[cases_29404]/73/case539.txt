the tax court upheld the determination by the commissioner of internal revenue that the correction of a consistently repeated inventory accounting error in this case amounted to a change in method of accounting under.section permits correction of accounts for otherwise years.because the commissioner properly determined that applies,we affirm.
taxpayers are shareholders of various new and used car dealerships.for a period of ten to twenty years,the dealerships employed the same accountant to calculate the value of inventory using the,last in,first out method.during that time,the accountant consistently omitted a computational step required by the relevant tax statutes and regulations.that error generally resulted in an understatement of gross income and decreased tax liability for taxpayers,although if carried through consistently the error would create offsetting increased liability in later years.
in,the commissioner of internal revenue commenced an examination of the dealerships tax returns and identified the accountant error.the commissioner revalued the dealerships inventories and made corresponding adjustments to reported gross income for certain years.included in the commissioner adjustments were income amounts attributable to years closed by the applicable statute of limitations.under,the commissioner is authorized to adjust a taxpayer taxable income in an open year to reflect amounts attributable to years for which the applicable statute of limitations has expired,so long as a change in method of accounting has occurred.
based in part on the income adjustments with respect to the years,the commissioner issued notices of federal income tax deficiency to taxpayers with respect to open years.taxpayers filed a petition with the united states tax court seeking a redetermination of the deficiencies.taxpayers challenged the propriety of the commissioner adjustments under with respect to otherwise years,arguing that the commissioner correction of the accountant computational error is not a change in method of accounting.taxpayers argued that the commissioner inventory revaluations constitute a correction of mathematical error or computational error,and that such corrections are expressly excluded from the regulatory definition of change in method of accounting.see reg.e ii b.the tax court held that the commissioner adjustments were permissible.see.taxpayers challenge this determination.
taxpayers dow and sandra huffman,james and dorothy patterson,douglas and kimberlee wolford,and neil and ethel huffman are married couples at least one member of each couple owns stock in one or more of four s corporations in the huffman group,informally referred to as huffman nissan,huffman volkswagen,huffman dodge,and huffman chrysler.
each huffman group corporation sells new and used automobiles in the louisville area.for tax purposes,the corporations compute yearly gross income by subtracting the cost of goods sold from sales revenue.reg.a.as merchants,the corporations must compute the value of inventory to determine the cost of goods sold.reg,c i.and to compute the value of inventory,the cost of goods available during the year must be allocated between goods sold during the year and goods remaining in inventory at the end of the year,boris bittker,martin mcmahon,lawrence zelenak,federal income taxation of individuals,at ed stephen gertzman,federal tax accounting,at ed.in certain cases,a assumption is used to make this allocation.gertzman,supra,at here,the huffman group elected to use the last in,first out lifo assumption.see.the elections were effective as follows huffman nissan june,huffman volkswagen december,huffman dodge and huffman chrysler december.
the lifo assumption treats the last goods acquired as the first goods sold.gertzman,supra,at.the objective of the lifo method is to match relatively current costs against current revenues to compute a meaningful gross profit.id,at.as a general matter,lifo provides a tax advantage to firms during periods of rising prices and increasing inventories.see bittker,mcmahon zelenak,supra,at david larue,lifo recapture on conversions filling the gaps and ameliorating the deficiencies of section d,tax law.because,in rising markets,inventory is more expensive than inventory,the lifo assumption results in a lower cost of inventory.in turn,the lower inventory cost results in a higher cost of goods sold,lower reported profits,and decreased tax liability.see bittker,mcmahon zelenak,supra,at.thus,the tax advantage of lifo is derived from the taxpayer deferral of gains attributable to the sale of the,earlier acquired inventory.see larue,supra,at.the deferred gains,however,will ultimately be recognized upon liquidation of the inventory items to which the lower costs have been allocated.see gertzman,supra,at.
there is more than one method for determining the lifo value of inventory,but common among all lifo methods are the following three steps the inventory must be separated into groups or pools of similar items it must be determined whether there has been a quantitative change in the inventory of each pool during the relevant period and the value of any increase increment in the quantity of each pool must be determined.gertzman,supra,at.to carry out these steps,the huffman group utilized the,method the following two paragraphs briefly summarize this technical accounting method,only a general understanding of which is necessary to resolve the dispositive issue in this case.for those less familiar with the intricacies of inventory accounting for tax purposes,a methodical and helpful description of the,lifo method is contained in the tax court opinion.see.
the approach to lifo measures the change in the quantity of an inventory pool in terms of dollars,rather than physical units.see reg.a.under the approach,any change in the quantity of dollars invested in an inventory pool over the taxable year is determined by comparing the aggregate cost of the items in the pool at the beginning of the year to the aggregate cost of the items in the pool at the end of the year.gertzman,supra,b,at.the cost of an item in a pool is the cost of the item as of the base first day of the first year for which lifo is adopted.reg.a.
the tax regulations authorize three methods for computing the cost of an inventory pool and the value of any increment in the pool.see reg.e.implicated in this case is the method.under that method,
the cost and the preceding year cost referred to as the item cost of each item are compared.this comparison is used to compute a index,referred to as the index.each year index is multiplied or linked to all preceding years indexes to arrive at a cumulative price index that relates back to the taxpayer base year.
leslie schneider,federal income taxation of inventories b.once the cumulative price index is calculated,the cost of the inventory is divided by the cumulative price index to arrive at the cost of the inventory,priv.ltr.rul,wl,for years in which an increment is found that is,the cost of the ending inventory exceeds the cost of the beginning inventory,the tax regulations provide that the increment must be adjusted for changing unit costs or values by reference to a percentage,relative to,determined for the pool as a whole.reg.a under the method,the increment is adjusted or indexed by multiplying the increment by the cumulative price index.priv.ltr.rul,wl.the value of the indexed increment is then added to the beginning year inventory value to arrive at the lifo value of the inventory.
in periods of rising prices and increasing inventories,a failure to index the increment generally leads to an understatement of the value of inventory,a corresponding overstatement of cost of goods sold,and a resulting understatement of gross income.see bittker,mcmahon zelenak,supra,at primo pants comm r.although the income deferred as a result of the failure to index will ultimately be recognized upon liquidation of the inventory pool assuming that the improper method continues to be applied,a consistent failure to index serves to defer the reporting of income for a period of time greater than would be the case under a proper application of the,method 
in the instant case,the same certified public accountant performed the,lifo method for each huffman group corporation.however,in years where an increment existed,the accountant consistently failed to index the increment as required by the tax regulations.generally,this error led to an of income for the huffman group and its stockholders,reducing taxpayers tax liability for certain years.the accountant consistently repeated the error with respect to each corporation,beginning in the year that each corporation elected the,method.apart from any statute of limitations effects,the error only deferred the reporting of income,it did not permanently avoid the reporting of any income.
at some point after the huffman group filed their federal income tax returns,the commissioner of internal revenue commenced an examination of the corporations tax returns for that year and years prior.after identifying the accountant mistake,the commissioner revalued each corporation inventory values.because of the statute of limitations prescribed in,the earliest year or first year in issue that the commissioner could make adjustments to the corporations tax returns was for huffman nissan,huffman dodge,and huffman chrysler,and for huffman volkswagen.accordingly,the commissioner proceeded to adjust the corporations gross the basis of the inventory two steps.
first,for the first year in issue and each subsequent year,the commissioner adjusted the corporations gross incomes to reflect the recalculation of beginning and ending inventories for the year.taxpayers do not challenge the propriety of this adjustment.the changes in gross income related to the commissioner first adjustment are as follows huffman nissan and for tax years and,respectively huffman volkswagen,and for tax years,and,respectively huffman dodge and for tax years and,respectively and huffman chrysler and for tax years and,respectively.
second,for the first year in issue only,the commissioner made an additional adjustment under.that statute allows the commissioner to adjust a taxpayer taxable income in an open year to reflect amounts attributable to adjustments to closed years years for which the statute of limitations has already expired so long as a change in method of accounting has occurred.see graff chevrolet campbell,cir gertzman,supra,at.this second adjustment served to increase the taxable income for the first year in issue for each corporation by the cumulative amount of income attributable to the inventory recalculations for all years prior to the first year in issue.the changes in gross income related to this second adjustment are as follows huffman nissan for tax year huffman volkswagen for tax year huffman dodge for tax year and huffman chrysler for tax year.
based on these corporate income adjustments,the commissioner issued notices of federal income tax deficiency to each couple on december.deficiencies were assessed against taxpayers in the following amounts dow and sandra huffman and for tax years and,respectively the pattersons for tax year the wolfords and for tax years and,respectively and neil and ethel huffman,and for tax years,and,respectively.on february,each couple filed a petition with the united states tax court seeking a redetermination of the deficiencies.taxpayers challenged the propriety of the second adjustment the adjustment,arguing that the adjustment was improper because no change in method of accounting had occurred.
on may,the tax court ruled in favor of the commissioner.see.the tax court concluded that the commissioner correction of the accountant error constituted a change in method of accounting under and,accordingly,that the commissioner adjustments were permissible.the tax court rejected the contention that the inventory revaluations were corrections of mathematical error to which does not apply,reasoning that the accountant had not made an error in arithmetic,but rather had omitted a computational step.in doing so,the tax court applied a definition of mathematical error found in a separate section of the internal revenue code.
on appeal,taxpayers challenge the tax court determination that the commissioner correction of the accountant error is a change in method of accounting.taxpayers do not contest the existence of the accountant error or the accuracy of the commissioner calculations.
because the commissioner correction of the accountant error is a change in method of accounting,we affirm.this case involves the timing of income recognition.the accountant computational error improperly deferred the reporting of certain taxable income it did not permanently avoid the reporting of any income.the commissioner correction simply causes the improperly deferred income to be recognized at a time earlier than would be the case under continued use of the accountant erroneous method.the correction thus determines the timing of income recognition and properly constitutes a change in method of accounting for purposes of and reg.
at the outset,it is clear that the language and purposes of the statutory terms of,without looking at the language of implementing regulations,permit and indeed strongly support the application of to the facts of this case.taxpayers do not argue otherwise,but rather rely on the provisions of implementing treasury regulations,discussed subsequently below.section provides in relevant part 
a general computing the taxpayer taxable income for any taxable year referred to in this section as the year of the change 
if such computation is under a method of accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer taxable income for the preceding taxable year was computed,then 
there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted,except there shall not be taken into account any adjustment in respect of any taxable year to which this section does not apply unless the adjustment is attributable to a change in the method of accounting initiated by the taxpayer.
a emphasis added.it can not seriously be argued that the consistent correction in this case to the repeated identical error in calculating yearly carryover inventory values is not a change in method of accounting,in the plain english sense of the words.
it is also consistent with the core purposes of to apply that provision in this case.section is designed to address certain difficulties that arise when a taxpayer changes accounting methods,and those are the identical difficulties that arose in this case.because different tax accounting methods provide for different dates on which income or deductions are recognized,a switch in accounting methods can create a situation in which a taxpayer is able to deduct the same is required to recognize the same two separate tax years.life ins.subsidiaries comm r,cir see also bittker,mcmahon zelenak,supra,at.section addresses these difficulties by authorizing the commissioner to adjust a taxpayer income in an open year to reflect amounts attributable to years for which the applicable statute of limitations has expired.see gertzman,supra,at graff chevrolet,at s ection would be virtually useless if it did not affect closed years.the statute thus ensure s that items of income and expense are neither duplicated nor omitted in computing taxable income following a change in method of accounting.gertzman,supra,at.in so doing,prevent s either a distortion of taxable income or a windfall to the taxpayer arising from a change in accounting method when the statute of limitations bars reopening of the taxpayer earlier returns.suzy zoo comm r,cir.the application of prevents such a distortion in this case.if the the were made consistently throughout the years,then all of the income would be properly taxed,albeit at different times.only by correcting the error in midstream would some of the income escape taxation altogether by operation of the statute of limitations.this is exactly what was intended to avoid.
taxpayers accordingly do not rely directly on the language of or its purposes,but rather focus on the treasury regulation interpreting to argue that the section does not apply.that regulation,however,ultimately supports the commissioner.reg.provides both inclusive and exclusive rules for determining when a change in method of accounting has occurred.the inclusive aspect of the regulation is broad enough to encompass the corrections at issue in this case,to the primary argument of the exclusive aspect does not require a different result.
the treasury regulation in its inclusive aspect covers the corrections here because the corrections are an overall change affecting the timing of tax payment with respect to inventories.reg.provides that a change in the method of accounting includes a change in the overall plan of accounting for gross income or deductions or a change in the treatment of any material item used in such overall plan.reg.e ii a.regarding inventories,the regulation specifically provides that a change in the treatment of any material item used in the overall plan for identifying or valuing items in inventory is a change in method of accounting.e ii c.for purposes of these rules,a material item is any item that involves the proper time for the inclusion of the item in income or the taking of a deduction.e ii a.
as the eleventh circuit has observed,t he essential characteristic of a material item is that it determines the timing of income or deductions.newspapers,united states,cir.in this case,the change from the accountant erroneous method to the proper,method does just that.the accountant erred by consistently failing to index the increment every year beginning with the year of election for each corporation.this error generally led to a lower inventory value and a corresponding decrease in taxable income,but the error would have upon liquidation of the inventory pool assuming continued application.as a result,the error only served to defer the reporting of income,it did not lead to the permanent omission of income.the upshot of the commissioner correction and proper application of the,method going forward is that income that was improperly deferred under the accountant erroneous method will be recognized at a time earlier than would be the case under continued use of the accountant method.the commissioner correction thus constitutes a change in the treatment of a material item used in the overall plan of valuing inventory because the change from the accountant erroneous method to the proper,method determines the timing of income recognition.
an illustrative example provided in the regulation itself is instructive in this regard.see e iii.in example,the regulation describes a scenario where a taxpayer has for many taxable years valued inventories at cost improperly.specifically,the taxpayer improperly computed cost and thus the value of inventory by failing to include overhead costs.this improper computation was contrary to the requirements of the tax code and regulations.after laying out this scenario,the regulation provides that a change requiring the appropriate allocation of overhead costs in the value of inventory is a change in accounting method because it involves a change in the treatment of a material item used in the overall practice of identifying or valuing items in inventory.see e iii ex.the circumstances of this case are analogous and require the same conclusion.for a number of years,the accountant consistently and improperly computed the value of inventory,and this improper computation was contrary to statutory and regulatory requirements.the commissioner correction appropriately values the inventory increment,and thus involves a change in the treatment of a material item used to value inventory.
the tax court has consistently applied the regulation in this way.in primo pants commissioner,the taxpayer erroneously discounted the value of its inventory over a number of years.in response,the commissioner revalued the inventory to correct the errors and made income adjustments under to reflect those revaluations.id.at.taxpayer argued that the adjustments were improper because the commissioner correction of its erroneous valuation method did not constitute a change in accounting method.id.at.the tax court disagreed.the court stated that the relevant inquiry is whether the accounting practices permanently avoided the reporting of income over the taxpayer lifetime income or merely postponed the reporting of income.id.at.the court went on to explain 
the consistent undervaluation of ending inventory acts to defer income the cumulative income over the period of years involved will be the same total,but income will be deferred each year until the closing inventory is finally corrected thus,we conclude that petitioner erroneous writedowns of its inventory do involve timing questions the proper time for taking a deduction indirectly through cost of goods sold and for reporting income income from sales in conclusion,we hold that the commissioner revaluations of petitioner inventory constitute changes in petitioner method of accounting.
in wayne bolt nut commissioner,the tax court reaffirmed the holding of primo pants.in wayne bolt nut,the taxpayer valued its inventory using a lower of cost or market approach.id.at.to determine the amount of its ending inventory for each year prior to,taxpayer used a sampling method.id.at.in,taxpayer took a complete physical count of its inventory and discovered that it had previously written off approximately million worth of inventory that still existed in its warehouse.id.at.taxpayer flawed accounting method resulted in understated inventory values and a consistent of income,and the error would have over time.id.at.to remedy the miscalculations,the taxpayer increased its opening and ending inventory for the current year,and adjusted inventory values and filed amended returns for fiscal years ending in february,and.id.at.though most of the inventory understatements discovered in were made prior to,taxpayer took the position that adjustments to income for years prior to were barred by the statute of limitations.id.the commissioner argued that taxpayer inventory revaluations were a change in method of accounting and,accordingly,that adjustments were required.id.at.the tax court concluded that the inventory recalculations made by taxpayer constituted a change in method of accounting.id.at.
primo pants and wayne bolt nut are persuasive on the facts of this case.like the instant case,both cases involve an error in inventory accounting that led to a consistent undervaluation of inventory.as a result of those undervaluations,income was deferred for a period of time,but not permanently omitted.because the later change in accounting practice altered the timing of income recognition,the adjustments were permissible.further,the holdings of primo pants and wayne bolt nut are consistent with the purpose of.as discussed,was enacted to prevent either a distortion of taxable income or a windfall to the taxpayer arising from a change in accounting method when the statute of limitations bars reopening of the taxpayer earlier returns.suzy zoo,at.in both primo pants and wayne bolt nut,application of prevented the taxpayers from experiencing a windfall due to the permanent exclusion of certain income.see primo pants,at if the opening inventory for is revalued as petitioner requests,but without the section adjustments,petitioner will receive a windfall.wayne bolt nut,at.similarly,it is uncontested here that,absent the adjustments,taxpayers stand to avoid taxation on nearly million of income,notwithstanding the fact that that income eventually would have been reported under the accountant erroneous method and,indeed,already would have been reported had the,method been applied properly at the outset.
taxpayers rely primarily on the exclusive aspect of the treasury regulation,which defines change in method of accounting not to include 
correction of mathematical or posting errors,or errors in the computation of tax liability such as errors in computation of the foreign tax credit,net operating loss,percentage depletion,or investment credit.also,a change in method of accounting does not include adjustment of any item of income or deductio
