statement of the case 
a.the facts 
the parties stipulated to the following facts before the district court.
at all relevant times,gudmundsson was an officer of aurora,which marketed food products under brand names such as aunt jemima,duncan hines,and van de kamp.shortly after a corporate reorganization,aurora made an initial public offering of registered shares of common stock on july,the ipo.gudmundsson became entitled to unregistered shares the stock by virtue of his participation in aurora incentive compensation plan.the plan provided for the stock to be distributed to him one year from the date of the ipo,on july.gudmundsson received the stock as planned.
aurora subsequently provided gudmundsson a that calculated his income from the distribution to be a little less than million.this figure reflected the mean price of unrestricted shares of aurora stock trading on the new york stock exchange the exchange price on july.gudmundsson reported this amount as income under governs the taxation of property transferred in connection with the performance of the federal tax return he filed jointly with his,on or before april.
gudmundsson held the stock subject to several constraints.first,these were restricted securities under securities and exchange commission sec rule,a i,meaning they were acquired directly from the issuer and not in a public offering,id.under rule,the stock could not be sold on a public exchange until the expiration of a holding period that,in gudmundsson case,ended on july.see berckeley inv,colkitt,cir discussing the operation of rule.the stock could,however,be disposed of in a private placement sale or pledged as security or loan collateral.see mcdonald comm r,cir citing a.
second,the stock was subject to an agreement among aurora various corporate entities and employee members,including gudmundsson the agreement.the agreement prohibited,inter alia,the public disposition of the stock before the second anniversary of the ipo,july.until then,transfers could be made only to a group of permitted transferees,which included family members and relatives.permitted transferees were bound by the agreement and had to agree in writing to abide by its terms.aurora would treat any transfers other than to permitted transferees as null and void,and in some instances it could intervene to stop a forbidden transfer.forfeiture of the stock,however,was not one of the penalties contemplated for violations of the agreement,whether by gudmundsson or a permitted transferee.
finally,gudmundsson was subject to aurora insider trading policy the policy.among other things,the policy required compliance with certain waiting periods and consent procedures prior to trading aurora stock.violation of the policy could result in disciplinary action,including termination of employment.
conditions at aurora deteriorated in the year between gudmundsson receipt of the stock and expiration of the restrictions imposed by the agreement and rule.unrestricted shares of aurora had been worth per share on july,a quarter of their value over three days that november following the company announcement that it would not meet estimated fourth quarter earnings.by december,the exchange price had fallen to.
in february,aurora auditors discovered irregularities in the company financial statements,and the board of directors announced the formation of a committee to investigate aurora accounting practices and the possibility of fraud.several executives resigned the exchange price tumbled another fifty percent.that april,aurora announced an million downward adjustment in pretax earnings previously reported for most of and.by the time the stock was freely marketable on july,the exchange price had fallen to,a decline of almost in one year.
prior proceedings 
in,plaintiffs filed an amended tax return,claiming a refund of plus interest based on the mean exchange price of aurora stock on december,rather than the price on july,as originally reported.the internal revenue service the irs disallowed the claim in.on march,plaintiffs filed this refund action below,pursuant to a and.
in the proceedings before the district court,the parties agreed that the transaction was governed by and that the stock was transferred to gudmundsson within the meaning of that provision on july.they disagreed as to when the stock became taxable income.the government argued that the original tax return had properly reported the stock on july,and properly used the exchange price that day as the measure of value.plaintiffs contended that they had been premature to treat the stock as income on july,given the restrictions still encumbering it at the time.alternatively,they argued that if july,was the correct recognition date,then the stock should not be treated as if it could be sold at the same price as aurora unrestricted shares.
the parties for summary judgment.on october,the district court larimer,entered summary judgment in favor of the government,holding that the stock was reportable as of july,and that the day exchange price was an appropriate basis for measuring the income received.see gudmundsson united states,d.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a decision granting summary judgment de novo.beth israel med.ctr.horizon blue cross blue shield of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.allianz ins.lerner,cir citing.c.the facts of this case were stipulated and therefore only questions of law are presented.
taxation of property under 
at the heart of this case is,which governs the taxation of property transferred in connection with the performance of services section was enacted as part of the tax reform act of,stat.it was designed to curb the use of sales restrictions to defer taxes on property given in exchange for services,robinson comm r,cir,which had become a popular practice among corporations and their employees.the provision general rule,set forth in a,has both a timing element and a valuation element.as a matter of timing,property received as compensation is to be recognized as income as soon as the recipient rights therein are transferable or no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,whichever happens first.a see also reg.b.the value of the income received is the property fair market value,measured without regard to any restriction,other than a restriction which by its terms will never lapse,a also known as a nonlapse restriction,as distinguished from one that will lapse,see reg.h,i.
both the timing and valuation components are at issue in this case,which presents two questions when was it appropriate to recognize the stock as taxable income,and what was its fair market value on that date we address these issues in turn.
the recognition date 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in recognizing the stock as income on july.they contend that the restrictions still in force on that date rendered it both and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture to survive summary judgment,plaintiffs needed to show the existence of both these conditions,as a recognizes property as soon as either is lifted.the district court,however,concluded that the stock was both transferable and not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture on july.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
transferability and substantial risk of forfeiture 
section c provides that property is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture when the rights to full enjoyment of such property are conditioned upon the future performance of substantial services by any individual.c.the regulations further explain that the existence of such a risk depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.reg.c.it exists where rights are conditioned,directly or indirectly,upon the future performance or refraining from performance of substantial services by any person,or the occurrence of a condition related to a purpose of the transfer,and the possibility of forfeiture is substantial if such condition is not satisfied.id.for example,where the property is received subject to a requirement that it be returned if the total earnings of the employer do not increase,such property is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.id.c.on the other hand,circumstances that do not constitute a substantial risk of forfeiture include the risk that the property value will decline,as well as a requirement that the property be returned if the recipient is discharged for cause or for committing a crime.id.c.
substantial risks of forfeiture are also built into the definition of transferability.property is transferable under c only if the rights in such property of any transferee are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.c.the regulations explain that transferable property can be sold,assigned,or pledged to any person other than the transferor without that person also incurring a substantial risk of forfeiture.reg.d.transferability is not a demanding standard,as the ability to transfer to even one transferee free of that substantial risk is presumed to constitute transferability,even though it may not also mean full marketability.see horwith comm r.
finally,contains a s pecial rule for s ales which may give rise to suit under section b of the securities exchange act of,providing that if the sale of property given as compensation at a profit could subject a person to suit under b,that person rights in the property are deemed to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable.c 
application to the stock 
substantial risk of forfeiture 
we are not persuaded by plaintiffs arguments that the stock was subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture on july.plaintiffs first argue that under the circumstances,the risk of termination gudmundsson faced if he failed to comply with the policy constituted a substantial risk of forfeiture.section is concerned with the forfeiture of interests in property,however,not in employment,and a substantial risk of forfeiture requires that those property interests be capable of being lost.see merlo comm r,cir theophilos comm r,cir inquiring into the chances that the employee will lose his rights in property transferred by his employer to determine substantial risk of forfeiture emphasis omitted.therefore,the risk of termination of employment is relevant under only if it has a causal connection to the loss or potential loss of rights in the property given as compensation.see merlo,at termination for violating insider trading policy was not enough to cause taxpayer to forfeit the shares.no such connection exists here.the agreement did not provide that termination for violation of the termination for any reason at or could result in the forfeiture of the stock.we therefore reject plaintiffs argument.
second,plaintiffs argue that gudmundsson would be exposed to a suit under b of the securities exchange act of,b if he transferred the stock on july,and that this created facts and circumstances evidencing a substantial risk of forfeiture,reg.c,analogous to the risk of suit under b,see c.
we hold that the district court correctly rejected the argument,as we conclude that congress has already indicated that b does not create a substantial risk of forfeiture under.see merlo,at for civil suits such as b to be considered within the definition of a substantial risk of forfeiture,congress would have to amend.united states.tuff,cir.congress inserted directly into the statutory text a s pecial rule using language that refers only to suits under b,and by doing so it indicated that civil suits are not generically covered by.tuff,at see c.we therefore reject plaintiffs effort to use the regulations facts and circumstances analysis to bootstrap b liability into.
transferability 
the stock was not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture on july,and although this is enough for income recognition under,we briefly address plaintiffs arguments regarding the transferability of the stock,as well.as a preliminary matter,plaintiffs the agreement was gudmundsson could transfer the stock to permitted transferees,which included his family members and relatives,any of whom were person s other than aurora,the transferor,see reg.d.plaintiffs assert,however,that the stock was not transferable because in reality,t he various restrictions imposed by law and agreement made the stock impossible to sell.pls.br.regardless of whether this is true,the argument misunderstands what requires.transferability is not just a question of marketability.in fact,even if sales are prohibited for a period of time,property may be transferable if it can be pledged or assigned.see tanner comm r,wl,at cir,see also reg.d.
we also reject plaintiffs effort to analogize the agreement transfer restrictions to those in robinson commissioner,cir.in robinson,the first circuit concluded that the stock at issue was not transferable because it had been received subject to an agreement that contained a mandatory sell back provision prohibiting any disposal of the shares other than to the employer for one year.id.at.in short,for robinson to transfer the stock to any person other than the transferor,reg.d,he would be forced to breach the agreement,robinson,at.by contrast,here the agreement permitted at least some transfers during the restricted period.plaintiffs stipulated agreement did not provide for the stock to be forfeited if gudmundsson or a transferee violated its terms.the agreement in robinson,however,gave the employer the power to recoup the stock after an event of noncompliance.id.at see hernandez united states,d,rejecting analogy to robinson where agreement did not contain mandatory sell back provision robinson does not help plaintiffs case and is not a reasonable analogue individuals saddled by more complete transfer restrictions than was gudmundsson have been held to have transferable interests under.see tanner,wl,at deeming stock to be transferable despite moratorium on sales where taxpayer could and did give the stock to a relative.
to summarize,the district court was correct to recognize the stock as income on july,as the stock was transferable and not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture on that day.this conclusion was correct under a and in general,as income in whatever form is taxable in the year in which it is received,wolder comm r,cir see also sakol comm r,cir,and stock is usually valued on the day it is issued,united states roush,cir wolder,at.
the fair market value of the stock 
the remaining question is the value of the stock on july.section a recognizes property at its fair market value determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will never lapse over the amount if any paid for such property.a 
plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in two ways when it determined the fair market value of the stock.first,they assert that,based on an erroneous reading of a,the court impermissibly departed from the traditional method of determining fair market value set forth in united states cartwright.second,they contend that restrictions imposed by law,rather than by contract,can not be considered lapse restrictions within the meaning of a.we consider these arguments in turn.
a.the calculation of fair market value under 
in general,the term fair market value is understood to mean the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willin
