john lane,as executor of the estate of beverly powell,filed suit seeking a refund of federal gift taxes allegedly overpaid by powell for tax year.the united states brought a counterclaim seeking to recover allegedly erroneous income tax refunds issued for tax years and.the parties dispute whether in payments made between and by powell late husband,hampton powell,to his friend and former secretary,jane young,were gifts or compensation for services.the district court concluded that they were gifts and dismissed the complaint.it also held that the counterclaim was under b because the government failed to prove that lane made intentional or knowing misrepresentations in connection with the amended income tax returns he filed.
lane appeals,and the united states.because the payments in question were gifts,and because lane grossly negligent misrepresentations were sufficient to trigger the extended limitations period of b,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the united states on its counterclaim.
what follows is a story of sentiment which appellant would convert into a tale of greed.we therefore relate in some detail the district court findings following a bench trial.
hampton powell was formerly ceo of the lane company,a furniture manufacturer based in altavista,virginia.jane young was his secretary there from until he retired in.young handled powell personal and financial affairs.because powell had a lifelong distrust of attorneys and accountants,he refused to seek their advice regarding tax and estate planning.instead,he relied exclusively upon young to prepare his and his wife tax returns.young studied tax materials and passed a tax course exam.
powell was a very generous man.indeed,giving was his primary pleasure in life.before,he made annual transfers of lane stock to churches,charities,family members,and young each christmas.the powells also made substantial cash gifts to charity from through.his practice at christmas was to give shares of stock in equal amounts to young,powell,and his sister.he also gave young myriad gifts of clothing,jewelry,perfume,candy,collectibles,and housewares during the year.
powell amassed great wealth during his career,primarily in the form of lane stock,which was converted to interco stock when interco acquired lane in the.due to concerns over interco prospects,young persuaded powell to sell his stock at the last minute before a deadline,which he had been reluctant to do because of his long association with lane.when interco subsequently went into bankruptcy,he was very grateful to her.
the powells had no children,and powell viewed young almost as a daughter.he took a fatherly interest in her life,and in her son and two grandsons.young viewed powell as a father and the best friend she ever had.she promised him that she would look after powell when he died.young continued to help him with his finances after he retired in,as she did with her own aged family members.she never expected to be paid,and told him so.
after retiring from lane in march,young continued to help powell with his personal finances until his death in june.she devoted no more than two hours per week on average to his finances.they never negotiated any exchange of money for her services.during the last five years of his life,she visited him whenever he was in the hospital,and she went to the powell home every month or two to discuss their finances and socialize.
powell made gifts totaling to young from to contested payments in this case.all of the payments were made pursuant to letters of authorization,which stated that they were gifts.he called each of the six payments her annual christmas gift.
as part of the contested payments,powell gave young gifts of conrail stock and in spring.beyond his usual generosity,he was concerned about her future welfare in light of her widowhood and recent retirement,and he was grateful to her for persuading him to sell his interco stock.his gratitude was also one motivating reason for the first contested payment.
powell filed federal gift tax returns for tax years,reporting his payments to young as gifts.powell signed each of these returns.because powell viewed the payments as gifts from powell,she did not report them on her income tax returns.
powell made the contested payments solely from his assets.he always consulted powell beforehand,however,and she did not object.thanks to powell,young was financially secure and did not need to work by.she nonetheless continued to help powell out of gratitude for all he had done for her.when he asked whether he owed her anything for preparing one of his returns,she replied that he owed her nothing due to his generosity over the years.though she received no payment in,she never considered filing a claim against his estate.
the only understanding young ever had was that powell made the payments out of love and affection.she thought that he never would have paid anyone a year or more for any services,and that he plainly could distinguish a paycheck from a gift.
after powell died in june,powell engaged john lane to advise her regarding the administration of powell estate and her own financial planning.lane had an accountant examine the tax implications of recharacterizing the contested payments as compensation to young.lane advised powell to amend her gift tax returns and claim that the payments in those years were compensation.but because of her declining health,as well as her late husband view of them as gifts,she declined.
when powell died in july,lane became the executor of her estate,and began to investigate the propriety of the contested payments.he accused young of and breach of fiduciary duty.these accusations were an attempt to get young to defend the payments by showing what she had done to deserve them,thereby twisting her words into an admission that she had earned them.but young repeatedly insisted that the payments were gifts,and lane uncovered no evidence of any attempt by her to deceive powell.
in july,lane filed amended gift tax returns on behalf of the late powell for tax years.the return stated a refund claim for.the returns were premised on the recharacterization of the contested payments as compensation.when the irs denied the claim in the return,lane filed suit.
in august,lane filed amended income tax returns forms for and on behalf of the late powells.they too sought to recast the contested payments as compensation.they claimed that a significant portion of the alleged compensation paid to young was deductible from the powells taxable income.the irs thereafter paid in refunds to powell estate.
in signing the forms,lane was aware of no document establishing an employment or contractual even an informal powell and young,pursuant to which he paid her in exchange for services.lane knew of no oral statement by powell that he made the payments to compensate her.lane had no personal knowledge of her efforts.
lane made false representations of material fact on the income tax refund claims.attachment,a narrative explanation setting forth the alleged factual and legal bases for the refunds sought,fails to relate the crucial fact that powell viewed the contested payments as gifts and so characterized them on his gift tax returns.it cites authorities governing the taxation of property transfers,possibly implying that young was his employee.and it states that she concedes the nature of her services,but it reproduces only fragments of her words which conflict with her simultaneously expressed belief that the payments were gifts.
it can reasonably be inferred that lane intended for the irs to issue the requested income tax refunds in reliance upon the explanation attached to each return,and that lane wanted to convey that the value of young help from through was equal in value to the contested payments.had the returns disclosed that those payments were reported as gifts on powell original gift tax returns,or that the alleged compensation forming the basis for the refund claims far exceeded any reasonable valuation of young services,the irs would have inquired further.
in view of these facts,the district court found that powell dominant reason for making the contested payments was the affection,respect,admiration,charity or like impulses he felt toward young.that is,he was motivated by a detached and disinterested generosity.comm r duberstein,d internal quotations omitted.it held that lane had failed to prove that the payments were compensation,and thus failed to prove that a gift tax refund was due.
the court also concluded that the government counterclaim to recover allegedly erroneous income tax refunds for and was.section b statute of limitations period had passed.and the court held that its limitations period was unavailable because the united states had not proven that lane false statements on attachment were intentional or knowing misrepresentations of material fact.in the court view,lane made only legal characterizations of the payments as compensation,not patent misrepresentations.
the court thus dismissed the complaint and the counterclaim.lane appeals,and the united states.the parties primarily dispute whether the contested payments were gifts or compensation.if the contested payments were compensation,then powell paid too much in gift taxes during her lifetime,and her estate is entitled to a refund.lane amended gift tax return stated a refund claim for.also at stake is the validity of lane amended income tax returns filed on behalf of the late powells.if the contested payments were compensation,then a portion of them was deductible from the powells taxable income.the irs paid in income tax refunds to powell estate,and the service now seeks to recover that money as erroneously refunded.
we review under the clearly erroneous standard the district court factual determination that powell dominant reason for making the contested payments to young was the affection he felt toward her.see duberstein,at.poyner comm r,cir.this standard also applies to factual inferences from undisputed basic facts,as will on many occasions be presented in this area.duberstein,at.see also poyner,at.by contrast,once powell dominant motive has been determined,we review de novo the legal question of whether the payments were gifts or income,as those terms are used in the internal revenue code.poyner,at.
section a of the internal revenue code excludes from a taxpayer gross income the value of property acquired by gift.in duberstein,the supreme court observed that the term gift in is used in a colloquial sense,not in the sense,and it declined to establish a test for distinguishing gifts from compensation payments under the code.at.instead,the court stated that the determination must be based ultimately on the application of the tribunal experience with the mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the facts of each case.id.at.see also poyner,at.the court emphasized that 
t he nontechnical nature of the statutory standard,the close relationship of it to the data of practical human experience,and the multiplicity of relevant factual elements,with their various combinations,creating the necessity of ascribing the proper force to each,confirm us in our conclusion that primary weight in this area must be given to the conclusions of the trier of fact.
duberstein,at.thus,a payee having performed contemporaneous services for the payor might be significant to the determination,but it is just one of the totality of the facts that must be considered.duberstein,at.
when the payment proceeds from a detached and disinterested generosity,out of affection,respect,admiration,charity or like impulses toward the payee,it is a gift for federal tax purposes.id.at.internal quotations omitted.the court stressed that the most critical consideration is the transferor intention.id.at.quoting bogardus comm r.thus,in making the determination,the proper criterion is one that inquires what the basic reason for the payor conduct was in dominant reason that explains his action in making the transfer.id.at.
the district court properly applied duberstein in concluding that the contested payments were gifts,not compensation.it was far from clearly erroneous for the court to find that powell dominant reason for making the payments was the affection,respect,admiration,charity or like impulses he felt toward young.duberstein,at.indeed,a plethora of facts support the court determination.
first,powell was a generous person in general,and he felt fatherly affection for young in particular.indeed,he expressed and acted on the basis of sincere concerns about her future welfare.in addition,he had a longstanding practice of periodically making substantial gifts to young in addition to other members of his family.moreover,he made clear,contemporaneous expressions of oral and the contested payments were gifts.and perhaps most significant of all,he subsequently filed gift tax returns,reporting the payments as gifts.all of these facts support the district court determination that powell dominant reason for making the contested payments was the affection,respect,admiration,charity or like impulses he felt toward young.id.that,in turn,compels the legal conclusion that the contested payments were gifts.see poyner,at.
it is true,of course,that the donor characterization of his action is not determinative.duberstein,at.rather,there must be an objective inquiry as to whether what is called a gift amounts to it in reality.id.the district court in this case made just such an inquiry.and though the court in duberstein stated that the parties expectations or hopes as to the tax treatment of their conduct in themselves have nothing to do with the matter,here powell characterized the payments as gifts to his own financial detriment.under these circumstances,his view of them is one significant factor that evidences his intention in making the payments to young.indeed,lane is not able to cite a single case in which a court has held that payments in contention were compensation where the payor submitted gift tax forms.
it is also true that powell was profoundly grateful to young for her timely advice in connection with the interco stock sale,and that his gratitude to her for that advice was one motivating factor behind the first contested payment.further,the payments were contemporaneous with much of the help she gave him.but these considerations do not by themselves suffice to show that the dominant reason for the payments was compensatory in nature where,as here,the facts point overwhelmingly in the opposite direction.if something looks like a duck,walks like a duck,and talks like a duck,and the district court determines it to be a duck,it is not our place on review to call it something else.accordingly,the district court correctly held that the contested payments were not compensation,and thus that no refund was due the estate for gift taxes overpaid.
throughout these proceedings,lane has insinuated that young was motivated by how much she stood to gain from the characterization of the contested payments as gifts and not compensation.it is certainly the case that,insofar as the payments were viewed by the irs as gifts,the powells would have to pay the resultant gift taxes,and young would not have to pay any income taxes.but lane has not produced any evidence that young coerced or manipulated powell into characterizing the payments as gifts.and in view of their personal relationship,there is strong evidence that young never had any desire to manipulate powell even if she could have.nor do we see how she could have duped him even if she had wanted to do so.as a wealthy businessman,powell was far from unsophisticated concerning his financial affairs.the district court determined that powell freely characterized the payments to young as gifts because that is exactly how he thought of them.
the united states filed a counterclaim against lane under to recover allegedly erroneous income tax refunds granted to him from the tax years.section states that any suit for the recovery of an erroneous refund is subject to the limitations periods set forth in b,which provides 
recovery of an erroneous refund by suit under section shall be allowed only if such suit is begun within years after the making of such refund,except that such
