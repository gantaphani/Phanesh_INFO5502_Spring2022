opinion of the court 
roger pransky appeals the district court determination that he failed to initiate in a timely manner this adversary proceeding against the internal revenue service,as required to invoke the bankruptcy court jurisdiction pursuant to a.section sets a statute of limitations to file suit in court when the irs disallows a taxpayer request for a tax refund.because pransky did not bring suit within s window of opportunity following the irs disallowance of his refund requests for tax years and,the district court correctly held that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction over pransky adversary proceeding as it pertains to those tax years.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court in this regard and remand to permit the bankruptcy court to rule on the irs proof of claim,over which the bankruptcy court can properly exercise jurisdiction.
factual background 
for tax years through,pransky did not file tax returns by the applicable due dates because he was under a criminal investigation at that time and feared that by providing certain information on the tax returns he might waive his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself.his counsel advised him instead to remit money to the irs in an amount that would exceed any tax liability he might have.following this advice,pransky remitted sums of money for each of the taxable years in question,through,with letters directing that the money was to be applied to any income tax liability that he might have for those years.
in pransky finally filed tax returns for tax years,and,and in he filed his return.he elected on his through tax returns to apply overpayments from those years as credits to the taxes he owed for each succeeding year.the irs interpreted the elections to credit the overpayments as requests for refunds,and there is no dispute over this characterization.we will refer to the requests for credits made on pransky and tax return forms as the first requests.
in the irs disallowed the first requests as untimely under b a,which,generally speaking,permits refunds of tax payments only if they were paid within the period preceding the request.pransky had remitted in and the money expected to cover his and taxes,respectively.these remittances were therefore made more than three years before,when pransky filed the pertinent returns.
the irs did not send a notice of disallowance of pransky request to carry forward any overpayment from his taxes.as a result of the disallowances for the and tax years,however,pransky had deficiencies in his and taxes.in,after pransky received the disallowance notices for the and requested refunds,he again asked the irs to credit the and overpayments to the and tax deficiencies second requests.pransky had made the first requests only by filling in a line on his tax forms that indicated that he elected to credit to subsequent years the amount of money he claimed in overpayments.the second requests included factual background and legal argument in support of the requested credits,contending why did not preclude them.
the irs did not send notices of disallowance for the second requests.instead,it applied in overpayments from pransky through taxes to pay his and tax deficiencies as calculated without the and credits.nonetheless,according to the irs calculations pransky still owed money on his taxes.
procedural history 
in january,pransky filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.the next month,the irs brought a proof of claim for pransky taxes in the amount of.
pransky in april began an adversary proceeding against the irs,seeking a determination of his tax liability for tax years through.the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment in favor of pransky,holding that he had paid his and taxes within the period preceding his requests for refund for those years and therefore that did not bar his recovery the bankruptcy court did not address whether s statute of limitations affected its jurisdiction to consider pransky and taxes.
the district court did address this issue.it concluded that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over pransky and taxes because he had not,as required by,filed suit within two years from the date the irs sent notices of disallowance for his refund requests for those years.the district court also affirmed the bankruptcy court holding that did not preclude pransky from obtaining refunds from the payments he made toward his and taxes because he had paid those taxes within the three years preceding his requests for refunds.as the irs points out,however,there was no reason for the district court to reach this issue because,without the and credits,there were no overpayments from or to refund 
the district court remanded for the bankruptcy court to decide the irs proof of claim for pransky taxes.he timely appealed to this court.
appellate jurisdiction 
the irs argues that we do not have jurisdiction over this case because the district court remand to the bankruptcy court does not constitute a final decision or order.the irs is correct that we may review the district court decision only if it is final,d,but we conclude that it is such an order.
a district court order that affirms or reverses a final bankruptcy court decision in its entirety will generally qualify as a final order.official comm.of unsecured creditors of life serv,westmoreland county,cir.when a district court remands a case to bankruptcy court,however,the finality of the order is less clear.id.at.nonetheless,a remand that requires the bankruptcy court to perform only ministerial tasks does not detract from the finality of an otherwise appealable order.id.if the bankruptcy court actions will be purely ministerial in character,such as computing prejudgment interest according to an undisputed rate and time period,then the remanded proceedings are unlikely to engender further appeals and the order is final.quoting in re lopez,cir.
the district court here affirmed in part and reversed in part the bankruptcy court entry of summary judgment and remanded for of the debtor tax liability consistent with this opinion.because the district court held that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction over pransky and taxes and rejected pransky recoupment and setoff arguments discussed below,the redetermination of pransky tax liability is,according to the district court decision,to take place without applying any credits from those years to pransky taxes.
pransky complaint raises only the issue whether he could carry forward his and tax overpayments and he asserts in his brief to our court that the parties raised all of their arguments concerning each side potential liability in their motions for summary judgment.we therefore have no reason to believe that the redetermination on remand of pransky tax liability would involve anything other than mathematical calculations of the irs proof of claim.such mathematical calculations are precisely the type of ministerial tasks that do not interfere with the finality of the district court decision as required for appellate jurisdiction pursuant to d.see official comm.of unsecured creditors of life serv,at.
even if a remand involves more than ministerial concerns,as we suppose is possible here,the decision of a district court may be sufficiently final to confer appellate jurisdiction if it conclusively determined the question presented by th e appeal,airlease ii,simon,cir citation omitted,and consequently presents the appellate court with a discrete question to review.in re market square inn,cir finding jurisdiction to review the question whether a lease was properly terminated,when the question whether it could be assumed would have to be addressed on remand steel mccune,cir exercising appellate jurisdiction although the district court decided only the core issue whether a company is a railroad.to determine whether we should exercise jurisdiction despite the possibility of a remand for more than ministerial functions,we consider four factors the effect of the disputed issue on the assets of the bankruptcy estate the necessity for additional on remand the preclusive effect of this court decision on the merits of subsequent litigati
