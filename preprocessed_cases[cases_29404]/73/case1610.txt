factual background 
viewing the evidence most favorable to respondent barba,as we must in re paul d,the record discloses the following facts.
on may,perez was the owner of the tropical club in lodi,which included a rental housing unit above the club.at the time of the events at issue,perez was years old,blind,and confined to a wheelchair.because of his infirmities,his wife leticia perez leticia was managing perez businesses for him,as she had been since may.as part of her managerial duties,leticia collected rent for the housing unit,hired staff and musicians for the club,paid the employees,and coordinated with vendors for the club supplies.
on may,barba and his wife visited leticia at the apartment above the tropical club.juan mendoza,a musician at the club and occasional aide to perez,was also there,preparing to move into the apartment with his wife.earlier that day,leticia had asked mendoza to move an old refrigerator out of the apartment to make room for the new one.when barba and his wife arrived at the apartment to visit,she asked barba to help mendoza move the refrigerator.
the record contains conflicting testimony of the incident,however,it appears that barba and mendoza put the refrigerator on a dolly and together began moving it down the stairwell,with mendoza holding the dolly handles at the top of the stairs and barba holding the refrigerator from the bottom.after moving the refrigerator a short distance,mendoza suddenly let go of the dolly handles and the refrigerator fell towards barba.barba attempted to hold up the refrigerator by himself but it was too heavy.barba tried to move out of the way as the refrigerator fell,but it landed on his left foot.

iv.section costs 
procedural background 
along with the summons and complaint,barba served perez with an offer to settle the case pursuant to section for perez did not respond to the offer and filed an answer to the complaint almost four weeks later.
following entry of judgment in the amount of,barba filed a memorandum of costs,including prejudgment interest and expert witness fees,pursuant to section.perez filed a motion to tax costs,contending that such fees and costs were not recoverable.the trial court denied this aspect of the motion 
reasonableness of section offer 
perez contends that e ven assuming,arguendo,that service of the section offer was effected while the trial court had jurisdiction,i t is unreasonable to expect that he,when first faced with the service of summons and a complaint,would have a reasonable basis to believe an offer to compromise was fair.perez therefore argues the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion because at the time barba served him with the section offer,he had absolutely no basis to determine if the offer was reasonable.
whether a section offer was reasonable and made in good faith is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court,and will not be reversed on appeal except for a clear abuse of discretion.nelson anderson th,d,associates cal d.
one factor to be considered by the trial court as to the reasonableness of a section offer is the amount offered as compared to the judgment ultimately recovered.elrod oregon cummins diesel,d.elrod.where the offeror obtains a judgment more favorable than its offer,the judgment constitutes prima facie evidence showing the offer was reasonable.id.at.perez points to nothing in the record rebutting this presumption.indeed,the offer came remarkably close to the amount of damages ultimately awarded by the jury.
perez uses language in elrod stating,i f the offeree has no reason to know the offer is reasonable,then the offeree can not be expected to accept the offer elrod,supra,d at.to argue that he did not have a reasonable basis to believe the offer was fair.
perez reliance on elrod is misplaced.in elrod,we upheld the trial court determination that a defendant settlement offer to a plaintiff was not reasonable,where the defendant possessed crucial information limiting its exposure that was unknown to the plaintiff.elrod,supra,d at.
here,barba was not playing hide the ball.the parties had a close,relationship,and there was free flow of information between them.barba waited eight months after the accident before filing the lawsuit.he wrote a letter before the suit was filed,informing defendant agent that his medical bills were about and requesting that they be paid.the letter fell on deaf ears.finally,barba section offer was served along with a complaint listing medical expenses in excess of and seeking damages for lost wages.
the purpose of section is to encourage pretrial settlements and avoid needless litigation.cobb superior court cal d,fassberg construction housing authority of los angeles th,d.t he trial judge who heard all of the evidence and presumably was in the best position to evaluate barba offer concluded that it was reasonable.santantonio westinghouse broadcasting th,d.we can not conclude,under the present facts,that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding barba his fees and costs pursuant to section.
our dissenting colleague advocates a extension of elrod,concluding that,absent an almost fact scenario that he poses,any section offer served by a plaintiff before the answer is due is per se unreasonable,ostensibly because the defendant has not had an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery on the issue of damages.we disagree.
because the legislature has made an award of costs under section discretionary,appellate decisions have held that trial courts may properly consider whether the subject offer was made in good faith and was reasonable under the existing circumstances.burch children hospital of orange county thrift stores,th,d elrod,supra,d at.wear calderon d.pineda los angeles turf club,d.even assuming a situation unlike the one presented here where a defendant has no information about the plaintiff damages when served with an early section offer,defense counsel may request that plaintiff provide informal discovery on the damage issue allow an extension of time to respond to the demand.if plaintiff counsel refused to a
