this tax case requires interpretation of the internal revenue code puerto rico and possession tax credit provision,which permits a domestic corporation to elect a possession tax credit if it meets certain conditions,id.a.the condition on which this case turns is that or more of the gross income of the corporation for the three preceding years must be derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the united states.id.a b 
the taxpayer,medchem,contends that it meets this active conduct of a trade or business requirement the tax court and the commissioner of internal revenue disagree.this issue appears to be one of first impression at the circuit level.
the particular tax credit codified at was added by the tax reform act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of,although it has its roots in legislation from the,see revenue act of,stat.the government tells us that the tax credit is in the process of being phased out.see j.this case has,in the interim,consequences for domestic corporations involved in business activity in puerto rico and certain other possessions.unfortunately,there are no promulgated regulations under a and domestic corporations have been forced to make business arrangements in possessions without the prior guidance such regulations might provide.
based primarily on text,understood in the context of the legislative history,we conclude that has failed to meet the active conduct of a trade or business requirement and,accordingly,we affirm the tax court judgment.we do so without adopting the tax court proposed test for what constitutes the active conduct of a trade or business in a possession for purposes of a.

identity has gone through several transformations.was incorporated in delaware on december,as medchem puerto rico.a couple of weeks later,on december,medchem puerto rico,changed its name to biochem products.then,on march,biochem products,changed its state of incorporation to massachusetts and,on november,changed its name to medchem.and all of its of which we will refer to as at all times wholly owned subsidiaries of medchem products.is a massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in woburn,massachusetts.following the tax years at issue in this case succeeded through a merger of into.
the irs found a deficiency of in federal income tax paid for the tax year ending august,and a deficiency of in tax payments for the same period.in consolidated cases in the tax court,as successor by merger to,contested both of these claims of deficiency.medchem,at.it is the liability that is at issue here.
during the relevant is,during each of taxable years ending on august,of reported income was intangible property income,see h,attributable to the sale of avitene,a drug manufactured by alcon puerto rico,an unrelated company.
on december,ten days after was incorporated,along with alcon pharmaceuticals,and alcon laboratories,collectively alcon entities sold the avitene portion of their business to and.the alcon entities sold the equipment,raw materials,technology,and other assets associated with avitene manufacturing.acquired the receivables,agreements,goodwill,contract rights,records,patents and related,trademarks,and food and drug administration approvals.acquired receivables,inventory,and title to the machinery and equipment located within manufacturing facility in humacao,puerto rico.those assets did not include avitene manufacturing facility in humacao.
before the acquisition,had been the manufacturer of avitene.had nothing to do with the drug.until ten days prior to the acquisition,did not exist.as part of the sale,agreed to continue manufacturing avitene for using own facility and labor and raw materials and equipment.also used the technology acquired by.held title to the and finished avitene.shipped finished avitene from its facility to,and title passed to,the purchaser.was solely responsible for any issues that arose until the finished product was delivered to a carrier for shipment to.in return,sent its invoices for its manufacturing services directly to,which paid,from account,a price equal to the manufacturing cost plus.the primary change effected by the sale was that certain assets were held in the name of either or its parent.
the reason entered into the processing agreement with,in which manufactured avitene for using raw materials and equipment,was that needed to ensure a steady supply of avitene until it built its own manufacturing facility in puerto rico.as it turns out,later abandoned its plan to construct its own avitene facility in puerto rico.
during much of the relevant period,had no employees.its one employee,perez,was a former employee.he worked for from march to june out of a office that maintained.perez spent much of his time planning transition to its own avitene manufacturing facility.also paid three independent contractors to assist perez.treated the independent contractors as nonemployees for payroll and tax purposes.and employed the individuals,other than perez and the independent contractors,associated with the avitene manufacturing and sales business.
at the time of the processing agreement,and had hoped to establish their own manufacturing facility in puerto rico.purchased land in puerto rico,on which it planned to build its own avitene manufacturing facility.in early suffered financial reverses causing it to lay off a third of its workforce and to default on million in debt.as a result,suspended its plans to construct a manufacturing facility in puerto rico.then wrote off its capital expenditures that had been made on the new facility and closed its puerto rico office.when the office closed,perez transferred business records to and.as of july,all checks were issued by from woburn,massachusetts office.
in early decided to move the manufacturing equipment and processes from humacao facility to facility in woburn.significant elements of the equipment were moved from humacao to woburn by june and,by january,all of the manufacturing equipment necessary to perform the first phase of the manufacturing process had been moved to woburn.in october,avitene production commenced in woburn.by april,had substantially completed the construction,in woburn,of its avitene finished goods manufacturing facility.
for its tax year ending august,claimed a tax credit under.the commissioner determined that avitene income was not derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession as a b requires.accordingly,the commissioner issued a notice of deficiency in the amount of.
as successor by merger to,contested the asserted deficiency.on june,the tax court entered its final decision,finding that was deficient,in the sum of,in its federal income tax payments.the tax court concluded that did not meet a b active conduct of a trade or business within a possession requirement.medchem,at.the tax court held that 
for purposes of section a,a taxpayer actively conducts a trade or business in a possession only if it participates regularly,continually,extensively,and actively in the management and operation of its activity in that possession f or the purpose of this participation requirement,the services underlying a manufacturing contract may be imputed to a taxpayer only to the extent that the performance of those services is adequately supervised by the taxpayers own employees.

standard of review 
this court reviews the tax court decisions in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.a see also silverman comm r,cir.our standard of review is.we review de novo the tax court statutory and other legal interpretations.alexander irs,cir.we review its factual findings,including those based on inferences from stipulated facts,for clear error.manzoli comm r,cir.to the extent that is making a clear error argument with respect to the tax court factual findings,we reject the argument.
there are no treasury department regulations interpreting a nor is the term active conduct of a trade or business defined for purposes of.there are,however,some guides to statutory interpretation,which assist us.it is well established in the tax law that an irs determination that a taxpayer owes the federal government a certain amount of unpaid taxes is entitled to a legal presumption of presumption that can help the government prove its case against a taxpayer in court.united states fior,d.furthermore,income tax deductions and credits are matters of legislative grace the taxpayer bears the burden of proving entitlement to any deduction or credit claimed.indopco,comm r,d new colonial ice helvering.norfolk comm r,wl investment tax credit,supplemented by,wl,aff,cir.moreover,a deduction or credit should be allowed only where there is clear provision therefor.new colonial ice,at.see also helvering life ins.stating that d eductions are allowed only when plainly authorized 
positions of the parties 
the parties have presented the court with different interpretations of the meaning of a.the tax court has,in its ruling,left each side dissatisfied.both sides interpretations diverge from the tax court,although the government position is much closer to the tax court conclusion.
the tax court rejected statutory plain meaning argument.medchem,at.instead,it crafted a test that,in the absence of a statutory or regulatory definition of active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of a,looks to regulations defining the phrase as it is used elsewhere in the code,bearing in mind the section legislative intent,id.at.applying this test,the tax court rejected interpretations more helpful to the taxpayer,provided in other regulations,see,c.the applicable test,the tax court held,was whether the taxpayer participates regularly,continually,extensively,and actively in the management and operation of its activity in that possession.medchem,at.it held that to impute a contractor activities to the taxpayer,the taxpayer had to adequately supervise the provision of these services with its own employees.id.at.the tax court found the facts about relationship with the contract manufacturer inadequate under its newly crafted test,and thus found that is not entitled to the credit.id.at.
the commissioner rejects plain meaning reading of the statute and generally rejects the proposition that use of contract manufacturers in possessions is ever sufficient to qualify for the a tax credit,but allows for rare exceptions where the taxpayer corporation is very heavily involved in the operation and management of the contract manufacturer.the commissioner seeks affirmance of the tax court result,but at oral argument protested the tax court test,which is more beneficial to taxpayers than the irs proposed test for what constitutes the active conduct of a trade of business.the irs proposes that outsourced manufacturing may never well,hardly ever qualify for the tax credit.only in rare instances,when the taxpayer is heavily involved in the management and control of operations of a contract manufacturer,says the irs,might it qualify.
the taxpayer,on the other hand,argues that the statute plain meaning does not preclude tax credits to taxpayers who use contract manufacturers located in the possessions and that,if more were required,it has,on the facts,provided the requisite more.says the tax court is wrong in its statutory interpretation and in its choice of test.asserts that the tax court test is inconsistent with regulations applicable to other parts of.
we affirm the denial of the credit and the finding of deficiency.in doing so,we assess and reject the taxpayer plain meaning arguments,look to the act legislative history for further guidance regarding congressional intent in enacting,and compare the section at issue with the western hemisphere trade corporation provisions of the internal revenue code of.we conclude that,on the facts presented,does not fall within the language of the statute or congress intent.we do so without adopting the tax court proposed test.
c.the statute and plain meaning 
before analyzing the statute,we think it helpful to understand the context in which the statutory interpretation question arises.possessions corporations are companies that are effectively exempt under section of the internal revenue code from federal tax on business income and qualified passive investment income from puerto rico and certain other possessions.dep t of the treasury,the operation and effect of the possessions corporation system of taxation,sixth report footnotes omitted.
the treasury department has described the general operation of the possessions corporation tax system 
the possessions corporation system of taxation is a set of rules under which a corporation deriving qualifying income from possessions and puerto rico pays no income tax to the united states.as a corporation,a possessions corporation is subject to federal tax on its worldwide income.however,a special credit available under section fully offsets the federal tax on income from a trade or business in puerto rico and from qualified possession source investment income qpsii.a parent corporation can,in turn,offset dividends received from a wholly owned subsidiary with a percent deduction,which frees the dividend income from federal tax.
with this context,we turn to the statutory language.the code section at issue provides,in relevant part 
puerto rico and possession tax credit 
a allowance of credit 
in general 
except as otherwise provided in this section,if a domestic corporation elects the application of this section and if the conditions of both subparagraph a and subparagraph b of paragraph are satisfied,there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter an amount equal to the portion of the tax which is attributable to the sum of 
a the taxable income,from sources without the united states,from 
i the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the united states,or 
ii the sale or exchange of substantially all of the assets used by the taxpayer in the active conduct of such trade or business,and 
b the qualified possession source investment income.
conditions which must be satisfied 
the conditions referred to in paragraph are 
if percent or more of the gross income of such domestic corporation for the period immediately preceding the close of the taxable year or for such part of such period immediately preceding the close of such taxable year as may be applicable was derived from sources within a possession of the united states determined without regard to section f and 
b trade or business 
if percent or more of the gross income of such domestic corporation for such period or such part thereof was derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the united states.
a.a separate subsection of governs the tax treatment of possessions corporations intangible property income.h.the treasury department has issued regulations under h,see to,although not under a.it is the a derived from the active conduct of a trade or business language that is at issue here.a b.
argues that a requires only that the taxpayer derive its income from an active business rather than a passive investment.its argument is really first,that active conduct means all conduct second,that the taxpayer corporation need only derive its income from some source,meaning that the taxpayer can qualify by deriving its income from the active conduct of a third party rather than from the taxpayer own active conduct.this interpretation,if accepted,would mean that a domestic corporation that gets its income from the sale of a pharmaceutical product manufactured by a contract manufacturer in puerto rico,as here,would qualify for the tax credit.we deal with each argument in turn,rejecting both parts as contrary to the text of the statute.
first,interpretation,construing income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business to mean income derived from an active,rather than passive,business,renders the statutory term active surplusage.the phrase active conduct of a trade or business does not mean that all income derived from anything that is not a passive investment qualifies for the credit we accept the commissioner view that the phrase conduct of a trade or business alone,without the term active,distinguishes section a income from passive investment income.construction renders the term active redundant.that is not a permissible form of interpretation,new england power marine,town of tyngsborough in re middlesex power equip.marine,cir stating that w e assume each term was meant to have separate content in order to avoid redundancy.
given that the statutory term active is not surplusage,we must determine what independent meaning it adds to the statutory phrase active conduct.because active modifies conduct,we conclude that active conduct means something more than simply a minimal level of involvement in the process of conducting a trade or business.not all conduct of a trade or business qualifies under a b only active conduct qualifies.because the conduct of a trade or business itself requires some level of activity,the adjective active must,in context,signify something more than a level of activity.
the oxford english dictionary first definition of the noun conduct is t he action of conducting or leading,and,as the term relates to a business,it is defined as t he action or manner of conducting,directing,managing,or carrying on any business.oxford english dictionary ed.similarly,webster defines the noun conduct as the act,manner,or process of carrying out or carrying forward as a business,government,or war.webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged gove et eds.active,in turn,is generally defined as c haracterized by action and is defined in terms such as o riginating or communicating action,practical,working,effective,having practical operation or results.oxford english dictionary,supra see also webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged,supra,at defining active as characterized by action rather than by contemplation or speculation.
the mere act,without more,of purchasing products that another unrelated entity has taken the action to manufacture,and reselling the products to others outside the possession,does not fit within the meaning of active conduct of a trade or business.in such a case,it is the unrelated entity controlling and directing the manufacturing that is actively conducting the trade or business.
here,the tax court was not even able to find that had any meaningful business activity in puerto rico.medchem,at.it found that involvement in puerto rico during the period failed even to qualify as a trade or business in puerto rico,id.at,never mind as an actively conducted trade or business.it concluded that and,but not,directed and controlled a ll of the business activities connected to avitene,and that performed every task required in the manufacturing process,without the ability of to manage,direct,or control any part of the manufacturing process,id.at.these findings were not clearly erroneous.on these facts,we are confident in the conclusion that did not itself actively conduct a trade or business.
the remaining question is whether manufacturing activities may be attributed to for the purposes of a.the answer to this question hinges on second claim,that the statutory phrase requires only that the income derived by the taxpayer be from some third party engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business.we reject this claim as well.both the tax court and the commissioner interpret a as requiring that the taxpayer,not someone else,be the entity engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business.we agree.
first,this reading is the most natural reading of the statutory requirement that at least of the taxpayer gross income during the relevant period be derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within a possession of the united states.a b.correctly notes that congress could have more explicitly said,the active conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business and it did not.but congress might have concluded that the addition of the phrase would be redundant,given the preceding discussion and especially given that the taxpayer corporation is the only actor referenced in a.congress could also have said the active conduct by the taxpayer or any contract manufacturer of a trade or business,which is reading,and it did not.viewed myopically,the statutory phrase is silent on whose active conduct of a trade or business it refers to,but,viewed in context,the best reading is that it means the taxpayer own active conduct.ambiguity in this instance does not assist because a deduction or credit should be allowed only where there is clear provision therefor.new colonial ice,at.has simply not met its burden of proving entitlement to the credit claimed.
to read the statute as requiring only that the income be derived from a third party active conduct would eliminate the distinction between active conduct income and all other income,including passive investment income.virtually all passive investment income,for example,is derived,somewhere down the chain,by some entity active conduct of a trade or business.
finally,as discussed below,the legislative history confirms congress intent to require the taxpayer claiming the credit to itself be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business.if interpretation were correct,then upon the enactment of,see tax reform act of,stat,current version at,all domestic corporations that had contract manufacturers in puerto rico and otherwise met the numerical requirements would automatically have become eligible for the tax credit.this is,in our view,highly improbable on its face.it is particularly improbable given the legislative history discussed below.
legislative history and western hemisphere trading corporations 
legislative history.
as stated above,at issue in this case is the proper interpretation of active conduct of a trade or business language.section in general,and the active conduct of a trade or business language in particular,have their roots in much older legislation.before analyzing the legislative history as it pertains to the meaning of the relevant statutory phrase,we describe predecessors.
both and the basic structure of today possessions corporation tax system have their genesis in a provision of the revenue act of.see revenue act of,stat.the phrase we interpret derived from the active conduct of a trade or business first appeared in the revenue act of,though in a slightly different context.compare id.with a b.the act exempted a domestic corporation from federal taxes on income if,for the three years preceding the close of the taxable year,it derived at least of its gross income from sources within a possession and or more of its gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business within the possessions,stat.at.congress enacted this section of the act to eliminate the competitive disadvantage that corporations were suffering as a result of double taxation of income earned outside the and to encourage business investments in possessions.see,reprinted in pt,see generally comm r,wl describing the act and its progeny kaufman,comment,puerto rico possessions corporations do the tefra amendments go too far,same.
congress carried forward,without material change,the act possessions corporation exemption into section of the internal revenue code of.see internal revenue code of,stat.section used the same language as the act section,requiring,among other things,that or more of the corporation gross income be derived from the active conduct of a trade or business.a,stat.at section remained in effect without material change until the,when congress enacted legislation approximating the current version of.see searle comm r,wl describing the genesis of.
section of the tax reform act added a new section.see tax reform act of,stat,current version at.section partially replaced section,as it relates to puerto rico see id.the legislation effected a number of revisions in prior law.to focus on the revision central to this case,the new transformed the old section exemption mechanism into a tax credit.the credit permits domestic corporations to offset taxes on income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in puerto rico,if certain prerequisites are met.b,stat.at we rely on the treasury department report,which described the transition from the act to the act 
the possessions corporation exemption remained unchanged until the tax reform act of.many firms established plants in puerto rico after,when puerto rico enacted a program of tax exemption for manufacturing firms.before the act was implemented,proponents of continued tax exemption argued that the possessions corporation system of taxation was needed to offset the minimum wage requirement,the requirement to use flag vessels in transporting goods to the united states,and other federally imposed requirements that tended to reduce puerto rico ability to compete with neighboring countries for investment.
by enacting the tax reform act of,congress wanted to leave undisturbed the tax exemption of earnings from a trade or business in puerto rico or from investments made with those earnings for puerto rican use.at the same time,congress wished to end the exemption for passive income from funds invested in foreign capital markets and to hasten their repatriation if not used in the possession 
to continue promoting puerto rico industrial development,the tax reform act of therefore left intact the exemption for income derived by corporations from operations in a possession.it also exempted from tax the dividends remitted by a possessions corporation to its parent.to prevent the avoidance of tax on income invested in foreign countries by possessions corporations,however,the tax reform act eliminated the exemption for income derived outside the possessions.the changes in the tax treatment of possessions corporations were effected by removing possessions corporations from section of the internal revenue code and placing them into a newly created code section.
the operation and effect of the possessions corporation system of taxation,supra,at.
as to the problem before us,the treasury report described the effect of the change 
change in the scope of and method of effecting the tax exemption.before,a possessions corporation was exempt from tax on all income derived from sources outside the united states.under the tax reform act of,the exemption was limited to two kinds of income 
income from the active conduct of a trade or business in a possession,or from the sale or exchange of substantially all of the assets used by the corporation in the active conduct of such trade or business and 
qpsii,which is income derived from the possession in which the corporation has its trade or business and which is attributable to the investment of funds derived from such trade or business for use within the possession.
rather than exempting the income from taxation,section provides a credit equal to and,therefore,fully offsetting the tax on the income.the section credit is not available for other income earned by a possessions corporation.however,a regular foreign tax credit may be claimed for foreign including possession taxes paid or accrued with respect to income that does not qualify for the credit.
id.at footnote omitted.
the house and senate reports are virtually identical on the pertinent provision.see,at,reprinted in,at,reprinted in.the reports discuss the tax treatment of corporations conducting trade or business in possessions of the as well as issues arising under the western hemisphere trade corporation provisions of the internal revenue code of,stat.at repealed in for taxable years after.see.at.at.
describing the law as it existed prior to the enactment of the tax reform act of,the house and senate reports recite that 
u nder present law,corporations operating a trade or business in a possession of the united states are entitled to exclude from gross income all income from sources without the united states,including foreign source income earned outside of the possession in which they conduct business operations,if they meet two conditions.
at reprinted in at emphasis added see also.at,reprinted in at.with this in mind,a new provision,was added for the tax treatment of corporations operating in puerto rico.at,reprinted in at emphasis added see also.at,reprinted in at.we think this language supports the commissioner view that the taxpayer must be the one actively conducting the trade or business.
as to the changes in the possessions tax credit legislation,congress stated that it sought to assist the possessions in obtaining investments by corporations,while at the same time encouraging those corporations to bring back to the united states the earnings from these investments to the extent they can not be reinvested productively in the possession.at,reprinted in at see also.at,reprinted in at using the same language.the congressional history reflects a dual intention to stimulate investment,both active and passive,in puerto rico and to encourage the growth of new jobs in puerto rico.at.at same.those are related but not identical objectives.congress emphasis on the creation of new jobs by operating companies is also reflected by the fact that congress mandated that the department of the treasury report to it periodically on the progress in meeting that goal.see.at,reprinted in at stating that the department of the treasury reports are to include,among other things,an analysis of the provision effects on investment and employment in the possessions.at,reprinted in at same.
although the department of the treasury has not promulgated regulations under a,its reports provide data both on how treasury has interpreted that section and on the context of the legislation.we look,in particular,to treasury report.see the operation and effect of the possessions corporation system of taxation,supra.the report provides insight into treasury interpretation of.for example,the report says b y enacting section,congress sought to assist puerto rico in obtaining investments.id.at see also id.at same.accordingly,treasury matched possessions corporations income tax returns with payroll and employment data from the companies federal unemployment insurance tax returns to determine whether this objective has been attained.id.at.in particular,treasury sought to measure the direct employment associated with section companies.id.
for example,as of,puerto rican business expansion had been concentrated in four industries chemicals including pharmaceuticals,scientific instruments,electrical and electronic equipment,and machinery.id.at.from to,the chemical industry earned income grew from to of total income originating in puerto rican manufacturing.id.nearly all of the investments in those industries were made by possessions corporations.id.at.indeed,in,about of the employees in the puerto rican manufacturing sector were employed by possessions corporations this represents about of puerto rico total employment.id.at.as the treasury department report makes clear,most of the corporations that qualified to receive the possessions tax credit were manufacturing corporations.id.at.
on the whole,the views on eligibility for the tax credit expressed both in the legislative history and in the treasury department report are more consistent with those of the commissioner and the tax court than those of.those views are not binding on us,but they have some weight.both sources tend to support the commissioner view that a requires that the taxpayer itself actively conduct a trade or business,with the expectation being that this active conduct by the taxpayer would increase employment and investment in puerto rico.both sources contemplate that the taxpayer be the party employing workers in the puerto rican economy.
here,the tax court conclusion,which was not clearly erroneous,was that investment in puerto rico economy was virtually nonexistent.medchem,at.activities in puerto rico failed even to qualify as a trade or business in puerto rico,id.at,much less as an actively conducted one.and directed and controlled a ll of the business activities connected to avitene.id.furthermore,during the relevant period,placed only one employee in puerto rico.that employee,perez,worked for out of a office for less than one year of the requisite period.
western hemisphere trade corporations 
urges that we follow the construction that some courts have given to the phrase active conduct of a trade or business under the western hemisphere trade corporation whtc provisions of the internal revenue code of,stat.at,that were repealed in.section defined western hemisphere trade corporation to mean a domestic corporation all of whose business is done in any countries in north,central,or south america,or in the west indies,and which satisfies two requirements.id.one requirement was that at least of the corporation gross income for the three preceding years be derived from sources outside of the united states.id.the other was that at least of the corporation gross income for the three preceding years be derived from the active conduct of a trade or business.id.
although at first cut the whtc provision appears to be an apt point of comparison,ultimately this analogy does not assist.this is primarily because of the important differences between the purposes of the whtc provision and.
congress may,particularly in the internal revenue code,use the same phrase,such as active conduct of a trade or business,in attempts to reach different ends.the supreme court made this point in commissioner groetzinger,d.after noting that the phrase trade or business appeared in over fifty sections of the code,the court stated i n this opinion our interpretation of the phrase trade or business is confined to the specific sections of the code at issue here.we do not purport to construe the phrase where it appears in other places.id.at.other circuits construing the phrase trade or business have also concluded that the phrase has different meanings in different sections of the internal revenue code.in hughes commissioner,cir,for example,the tenth circuit,construing the statutory phrase trade or business in section a of the revenue act of,a,stat,stated that w e are here concerned only with the meaning of this phrase as used in this section.the same phrase,in other statutes,or in other sections,in a different context,and for a different purpose,may or may not be helpful.hughes,at.this is not to say that the whtc provision is necessarily inapposite,but rather simply to emphasize,as we have emphasized in other contexts,that the same words may play different roles in different contexts.walker exeter,cir.the relevance of the whtc provision,then,turns on its similarity to the provision at issue here.
the tax court has described the legislative history of the whtc provision as disclosing a congressional desire to offset through a tax preference the competitive disadvantage suffered by certain american corporations abroad on account of the less onerous taxes to which their competitors were subject.kewanee oil comm r,wl.accordingly,
i t follows that when the active conduct requirement is read in the context from which it arose,namely the threat of foreign competition,one might well conclude that in passing the western hemisphere provisions congress intended to grant relief to united states business activity in the americas only to the extent that the beneficiary corporation conducted active business operations abroad vulnerable to the competitive threat posed by the corporations of other countries.
like the whtc provision,the possessions tax credit was meant to offset the competitive disadvantage suffered by american companies.the possessions tax credit,however,was meant not only to offset certain impediments for corporations investing in puerto rico,but also to increase investment and opportunities in puerto rico.this is a difference that makes a difference.to the extent that the whtc provision was meant to increase the foreign competitiveness of domestic corporations,the geographic location of those corporations operations was relevant only to a limited is,it was important only to ensure that the domestic corporation actually engaged in some foreign commerce.in contrast,the possessions tax credit was meant,in addition to advancing the competitiveness of domestic corporations,to stimulate investment in particular places,including puerto rico.on this account,unlike the whtc provision,the location of the corporation trade or business was critical to advancing this goal.after all,the goal is promoting investment in the goal the attainment of which is intrinsically tied to the location of the investments made.
relies on frank international canadian,cir,a ninth circuit decision applying the whtc provision of section of the internal revenue code of.it is far from clear that this court would have viewed frank facts the same way and reached the same outcome as did the ninth circuit,even under the whtc.
in frank,the pennsylvania salt manufacturing corporation of washington,a domestic corporation that regularly conducted business activities in british columbia,decided to assume new shipping responsibilities.id.at.for legitimate business reasons having to do with the most favored nation clauses in its contracts and the act prohibitions,washington decided to form a new corporation,named international canadian corporation,as a whtc,in order to perform the shipping.id.international,in turn,had one employee and assumed the parent sales functions.id.international did utilize services of washington employees and paid for those services.id.at.the ninth circuit held,on review of a district court decision,that international,which came into existence for legitimate business reasons unrelated to the whtc provision,was not disqualified from the whtc credit although it had assumed former business of washington,utilized and paid for help from washington employees,and did not have a source of supply or customers independent of washington.id.at.the court found that international clearly was active,earning its income by performing a variety of services relating to the sale of chemical products.id.at.
the ninth circuit opinion is of limited utility because of the factual distinctions between it and the case here.for example,frank found that international existence was justified by a legitimate business purpose.id.at.at least from early,when had decided not to build a manufacturing plant in puerto rico,it is difficult to view as anything other than a corporate shell with little business reason to exist other than to attempt to secure the credit.furthermore,as already discussed,the divergent policy goals of the possessions tax credit and the whtc provision mean that the analogy is strained from the start.nothing in the history of the whtc leads us to the taxpayer interpretation.
analogy to other regulatory definitions 
the tax court found uses of the phrase active conduct of a trade or business in the internal revenue code.medchem,at.argues that the tax court erred in looking by analogy to regulations interpreting active conduct of a trade or business as used in,and,for purposes of interpreting the phrase as used in the argument is that the purposes of those sections are so different from the purpose o
