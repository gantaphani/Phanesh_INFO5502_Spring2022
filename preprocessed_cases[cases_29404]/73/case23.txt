william cavallaro and his wife patricia cavallaro together,the cavallaros appeal from a tax court decision affirming a determination by the internal revenue service irs commissioner that they owed gift taxes on a gift to their sons.after careful consideration,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand to the tax court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in,the cavallaros started knight tool knight,a contract manufacturing company that made custom tools and machine parts.william cavallaro whose principal work was making and selling the business products owned of knight stock,while patricia cavallaro who acted as an administrator and bookkeeper owned.the cavallaros three sons ken,paul,and james eventually joined the family business.
in,knight deviated from its traditional business and developed a system for adhesives called.although knight invested substantial resources in development,the product had significant flaws,and profits failed to outpace production costs.as a result,the cavallaros decided to refocus on their core business.
ken,however,continued to believe in the technology and asked his parents if he and his brothers could organize a new corporation,camelot systems,camelot,to further develop it.the cavallaros assented.after camelot incorporation,ken worked with william cavallaro and other knight personnel to change design in order to meet customers needs.knight manufactured the systems,while camelot sold and distributed them to third parties.
everyone who worked on systems after camelot incorporation,including ken,remained on the knight payroll and received all their wages from knight.knight and camelot financial affairs overlapped in other ways as well.for instance,camelot did not have its own bank accounts with minor exceptions,camelot bills were paid using knight funds.and,as a result of how knight billed camelot,knight effectively immunized camelot from risk of for systems.
in,the cavallaros hired both accountants and lawyers to review their estate plan.there was significant friction between these two groups of advisers.essentially,the lawyers wanted the cavallaros to claim that the value of the technology inhered in camelot and so was already owned by ken,paul,and james whereas the accountants objected to this proposal because it was at odds with the overwhelming evidence that knight owned the technology and always had.attorney louis hamel argued in a letter to accountant kevin mcgillivray history does not formulate itself,the historian has to give it form without being discouraged by having to squeeze a few embarrassing facts into the suitcase by force.as a result of hamel persuasive efforts,the lawyers view prevailed.both the lawyers and accountants came to endorse hamel suggestion that a transfer of the technology be memorialized in affidavits and a confirmatory bill of sale.members of the cavallaro family signed these documents in may 
knight and camelot subsequently prepared to merge.as part of their preparations,the cavallaros hired accountant timothy maio to determine the respective values of the two companies.using a approach,maio valued the proposed combined entity at million and valued knight portion at just million or.notably,maio assumed that camelot owned the technology and that knight was a contractor for camelot.
on december,knight and camelot merged in a merger that left camelot as the surviving corporation.william cavallaro received shares of stock in the merged company patricia cavallaro received shares ken,paul,and james received shares each.the relative value of each company,as determined by maio,informed the distribution of shares.seven months later,cookson america,purchased camelot for million in cash.on the basis of stock ownership,the cavallaros received a total of,and each son received.
in,the irs opened an examination of knight and camelot and income tax returns.during the income tax examination,the irs identified a possible gift tax issue in connection with the merger and opened a gift tax examination as well.that examination resulted in litigation before this court.see cavallaro united states cavallaro i,cir.affirming denial of taxpayers motion to quash a recordkeeper summons.
ultimately,the irs issued notices of deficiency to the cavallaros for tax year.the irs determined without first having obtained an appraisal that camelot had a value of.thus,when knight merged with camelot,william and patricia cavallaro each made a taxable gift of to their sons as a result,each of the cavallaros incurred an increase in tax liability in the amount of.the notices of deficiency also imposed additions to tax for failure to file and fraud,pursuant to internal revenue code a and a,respectively.
ii.the tax court proceedings 
the cavallaros filed a petition for review with the tax court.during discovery,the commissioner disclosed that after the notices of deficiency were issued he directed accountant marc bello to appraise the value of both knight and camelot at the time of the merger.working under the assumption that knight rather than camelot owned the technology,bello valued the combined entities at approximately million.bello concluded that camelot was worth million.the deficiencies would,therefore,be lower than those set forth in the original notices,which assumed that camelot had no value.
the cavallaros interpreted the bello report to mean that the commissioner had changed his theory of liability.more specifically,they surmised that the commissioner was no longer pursuing his original theory that camelot was a shell corporation formed to disguise a gift transfer from the cavallaros to their sons in favor of a new theory that knight was merely undervalued.prior to trial,the cavallaros used the bello report as the basis for their argument that the original notices of deficiency were arbitrary and excessive,or,in the alternative,that the commissioner new theory of liability was a new matter within the meaning of tax court rule.they moved unsuccessfully to shift the burden of proof to the commissioner.
during the bench trial,the commissioner introduced the bello valuation into evidence to support his revised deficiency.the cavallaros introduced both the maio valuation and a valuation by john murphy of atlantic management company,which was consistent with the maio valuation.like maio,murphy assumed that camelot owned the technology.ownership of the technology was a central focus of the trial.the tax court ultimately concluded that knight owned all of it.
the tax court denied the cavallaros renewed motion to shift the burden of proof to the commissioner.while noting that it was evidently true that the commissioner did not obtain an appraisal before issuing the notices of deficiency,the tax court found that there was a sufficient basis for issuing the notices and,thus,that they were not arbitrary.further,the court found unpersuasive the cavallaros argument that the commissioner litigating position was a new matter and stated that the commissioner partial concessions as to camelot value did not require a new theory or change the issues for trial.
the tax court ultimately concluded that the cavallaros were deficient in paying the gift tax due for calendar year william cavallaro owed and patricia cavallaro owed.the court also determined favorably to the cavallaros that no penalties for underpayment were due under a,h,or a,and there were no additions to tax due under a for failure to file a gift tax return.
this appeal timely followed.
iii.standard of review 
we review decisions of the t ax c ourt in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.interex,comm r,cir.quoting a.thus,we review the tax court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.we have the authority to affirm or,if the decision of the tax court is not in accordance with law,to modify or to reverse the decision of the tax court,with or without remanding the case for a rehearing,as justice may require.c.
iv.claims on appeal 
on appeal,the cavallaros renew their claim that the tax court erred by failing to shift the burden of proof to the commissioner for two independent reasons because the original notices of deficiency were arbitrary and excessive,and the commissioner relied on a new theory of liability.they make two additional arguments.first,they claim that the tax court improperly concluded that knight owned all of the technology.second,they contend that the tax court erred by misstating their burden of proof and subsequently failing to consider alleged flaws in bello valuation of the two companies.
we consider these claims in turn.
burden shifting 
a rebuttable presumption of correctness cloaks an irs notice of deficiency see,bull united states,delaney comm r,cir.tax.a see also united states rexach,cir.explaining rationales for this presumption.thus,the taxpayer typically bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the commissioner tax assessment is erroneous.helvering taylor,delaney,at.in some limited circumstances,however,the commissioner bears the burden of proving a tax deficiency.see,tax.a outlining circumstances that require burden shifting.
the cavallaros argue that the tax court erred by refusing to shift the burden of proof to the commissioner.we review their claim de novo.see estate of abraham comm r,cir.
for an excessive and arbitrary deficiency notice 
for an deficiency notice is a fairly narrow doctrine.see united states janis.it involves a challenge to the deficiency assessment itself on the basis that it bears no factual relationship to the taxpayer liability,not a challenge to any proof offered by the commissioner at trial before the tax court.zuhone comm r,cir.where an assessment is shown to be naked or utterly without foundation,we remand the case for further action to determine the amount that might lawfully be taxed.see janis,at citing rexach,at.in this limited circumstance,the presumption of correctness is overcome,and the burden shifts to the commissioner.see id.
the threshold question,then,is whether the cavallaros have carried their burden of producing evidence from which it can be concluded that their deficiency assessments utterly lacked rational foundation.the cavallaros challenge falls short of the mark.pittman comm r,cir.c ourts commonly find this showing that a deficiency assessment lacks a rational foundation to be made when the commissioner makes no evidentiary showing at all.
the original deficiency notices assumed that,camelot had no value.according to the cavallaros,the commissioner later realignment with the bello valuation conclusively established that the commissioner used no formula at all and lacked any support at all for that initial valuation.thus,they allege,the commissioner assessment was without rational foundation and excessive.taylor,at.
without more,however,the fact that the commissioner later conceded a portion of the original deficiency does not compel a conclusion that the initial assessments lacked a rational foundation mcmurty comm r,cir.declining to shift burden where commissioner reduced the amount of the claimed deficiency silverman comm r,cir.the taxpayer does not carry his burden of showing the determination invalid simply by pointing to the fact that the commissioner has reduced his original deficiency claim prior to trial.
here,the commissioner had discovered prior to issuing the original notices of deficiency that the cavallaros had followed the advice of an lawyer,hamel,who advocated squeez ing a few embarrassing facts into the suitcase by force in order to memorialize technology transfers financially advantageous to the cavallaro family.see cavallaro comm r cavallaro ii,memo,at.this,together with associated documents,was a sufficient basis for concluding that camelot value was de minimis.silverman,at valuation is necessarily an approximation.alteration in original citation omitted.for us to require more would violate the general rule that courts will not look behind a deficiency notice to question the commissioner motives and procedures.clapp comm r,cir.we need go no further 
the original deficiency notices were not arbitrary and excessive,and thus,no burden shifting was warranted.
for a new matter 
rule a of the tax court rules of practice and procedure states the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except that,in respect of any new matter,it shall be upon the respondent.under the new matter exception,if the commissioner seeks to establish the deficiency on a basis not described in the notice,the burden shifts to the commissioner on that new basis.estate of abraham,at citing shea comm r.a new theory presented to support a deficiency is treated as a new matter when it either alters the original deficiency or requires the presentation of different evidence.id.quoting wayne bolt nut comm r.if,however,the theory merely clarifies or develops the original determination,it is not a new matter.id.
the cavallaros argue that the commissioner relied on a new theory of liability at trial.their claim is that the commissioner abandoned his initial theory that camelot was a worthless sham and then adopted a wholly new theory based on bello valuation that camelot was overvalued by the cavallaros.therefore,the cavallaros argue,the burden of proof with respect to this new matter should have been placed on the commissioner.
the original deficiency notices do not allege that camelot was a sham company rather,they explain 
u nder irc section,donor merger of knight tool into camelot systems,in return for of the stock of camelot systems,resulted in a gift of to the other shareholders of camelot systems.accordingly,taxable gifts are increased 
the clear implication was that,because knight was undervalued,the merger allowed for a disguised gift transfer from the cavallaros to their three sons.
the commissioner subsequent adoption of the bello report was simply a refinement of that original theory,a clarification of the extent to which knight was undervalued.we have previously said that if a deficiency notice is broadly worded and the commissioner later advances a theory not inconsistent with that language,the theory does not constitute new matter,and the burden of proof remains with the taxpayer.estate of abraham,at citing abatti comm r,cir.the original deficiency notices were more than adequate to put the cavallaros on notice that the commissioner was challenging the value of knight as transferred within the merger.kikalos comm r,cir.holding that the commissioner change in the method of calculation for the income shortage was not a new matter and that the deficiency notice clearly put the taxpayers on notice of the liability theory underlying the new calculation.indeed,the cavallaros petition for makes it clear that they were aware all along that the value of knight,to the extent that it exceeded the value of the stock they received at the time of the merger,would be integral to determining their tax liability 
as neither of the cavallaros two theories succeed,we affirm the tax court determination that the cavallaros had the burden of proof.
technology 
the cavallaros also challenge the tax court finding that knight owned all of the technology.specifically,they complain that the tax court treatment of the different types of technology as a single,undivided whole was overly simplistic.the record,however,amply supports the tax court determinations.see mcmurray comm r,cir.the tax court ruling is a factual finding that we must affirm unless it is clearly erroneous.
as detailed above,knight created the first system,and,even after camelot incorporation,the companies financial affairs overlapped significantly.further,t he few public registrations of intellectual property were all owned by knight.cavallaro ii,memo,at.the trademark was registered to knight until december,and four patent applications,each filed by william cavallaro,identified knight not camelot as his assignee.id.in,before the instant controversy arose,the cavallaros accountants determined that a portion of the work done in prior years by knight engineers could be characterized as research and development costs eligible for a section tax credit.id.at.in light of that study,the accountants prepared amended tax returns for knight
