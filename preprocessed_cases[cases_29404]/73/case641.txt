ernst young spun off its consulting group in.cap gemini,a french corporation,bought this business and became cap gemini ernst young,a multinational firm.today it is known as capgemini,and we use that name for the firm after the acquisition.
consulting partners of ernst young received shares in capgemini in exchange for their partnership interests in ernst young.this was not a exchange,so it was a taxable event for the partners.because ernst young and its partners expected shares in the new business to appreciate,they wanted all of the income to be recognized in.that way any appreciation would be taxed as a capital gain.but cap gemini wanted to ensure the partners loyalty to the new business a consulting group depends on its staff,and if they left after taking the stock the business might be crippled.transferring the shares in installments might address these subjects but also would make the transfers look like ordinary,if the shares appreciated in the meantime,the partners would receive fewer.ernst young and cap gemini decided that a transfer of all of the shares in,subject to what amounted to an escrow,would preserve the tax benefits while serving business objectives.so the shares received in the transaction were restricted for almost five years if a partner quit,was fired for cause,or went into competition with the new business,some or all of the shares could be forfeited.
ernst young,cap gemini,and the partners agreed by contract that they would report the transaction as a swap in,fully taxable in that year.the characterization allowed capgemini to take depreciation deductions,see,starting in,and ensured consistent tax treatment of all parties.the commissioner of internal revenue might have challenged the parties characterization,see,but decided to accept it.approximately of the shares were sold in to generate cash that the partners used to pay their taxes the remainder of the shares were held by merrill lynch subject to instructions from capgemini until restrictions lapsed.each had a separate account for this purpose.
cynthia fletcher,one of ernst young consulting partners,voted for the transaction,signed the contract,moved to capgemini,and received shares in that business as payment for her partnership interest.the market value of these shares on the day the sale closed was about million.only shares were deposited in the restricted account the rest were sold for,which was distributed to fletcher to cover taxes.in february capgemini sent fletcher a form reflecting that she had received in stock,taxable at rates save for some attributable to property,from the sale of her partnership interest.she and her husband michael they filed a joint return reported this income as received in,just as her contract with capgemini required.the couple gross income for was reported as,on which they paid in income tax.
had the market price of stock in capgemini risen,as the parties anticipated,that would have been a good outcome for fletcher and the other.but although capgemini traded above a share early in,by it was below,where it has remained.so far in it has traded for about.this made the deal look bad in retrospect the partners would have been better off had distribution of the stock been deferred.fletcher quit in.although she left before the five years required by the contract,capgemini waived its rights and directed merrill lynch to lift all restrictions on the stock in her account.fletcher then filed an amended tax return for.she now took the position that only the distributed from the account was income in.on her new view of matters,the rest of the income was not received until,and the amount was much reduced in light of the lower market price of capgemini shares in.apparently without checking how other taxpayers affected by the transaction had been treated,the internal revenue service paid fletcher a refund of about plus interest.contending that this refund had been mistaken,the united states filed this suit to get the money back.similar litigation is pending in many other district suits by the united states,some by who want refunds.
the irs principal argument is that fletcher and the other are bound by their own characterization of the transaction as one in which all shares were received in.having adopted this characterization with the goal of minimizing taxes,they must adhere to it even though market movements have made it disadvantageous,the united states insists.it relies principally on cir danielson,cir,which held just this,and on a remark in comdisco,united states,cir a taxpayer generally may not disavow the form of a deal.some courts have allowed taxpayers to disregard their own forms when strong proof shows that the economic reality was something else.see,leslie ray insurance agency,united states,cir ullman cir,cir.we used the strong proof formulation in kreider cir,cir,though without mentioning either comdisco or danielson.the district court concluded that it was unnecessary to choose between these approaches or their variants,because on any standard the parties set out to ensure that all income was recognized in although the commissioner has some power to recharacterize transactions so that they match economic substance,taxpayers ca look through the forms they chose themselves in order to improve their tax treatment with the benefit of hindsight.see gregory helvering.see also joseph bankman,the economic substance doctrine,cal.saul levmore,recharacterizations and the nature of theory in corporate tax law.david weisbach,formalism in the tax law,chi.so the district court entered summary judgment for the united states and ordered fletcher to repay the refund.wl,dist.lexis.
fletcher argues that she did really agree to the structure that ernst young and cap gemini and most of her partners wanted in.if she had voted no and refused to sign,she maintains,she would have been excluded from the economic benefits and might have been fired.if this is so,then she had a difficult choice to make it does not relieve her of the choice consequences.hard choices may be,but they are choices nonetheless.even na√Øve people baffled by the fine print in contracts are held to their terms a sophisticated business consultant who agrees to a transaction is not entitled to demand the deal benefits while avoiding its detriments.the argument that fletcher can avoid the terms as a matter of contract law is frivolous.all that matters now are the tax consequences of the contracts she signed.
that a transaction form determines taxation is or at least should be common ground among the parties.if private parties structure their transaction as a sale of assets,they ca later treat it for tax purposes as if it had been a merger.cir national alfalfa dehydrating milling,d.landreth timber landreth,d same principle in securities law.parties who structure their transaction as a sale and leaseback ca treat it as a mortgage loan for tax the commissioner may be able to recharacterize it so that the tax treatment matches its economic substance.see frank lyon united states,d.if cap gemini transfers stock in,taxpayers such as fletcher ca treat the income as received in or,even though it would have been child play to do the deal so that the income was received in those years.
the united states treats fletcher as if she were trying to report an asset sale as a merger,or income received in as if it had been received in.this is not,however,the sort of argument that fletcher advances.she does not want to proceed as if the deal had different terms.she argues instead that the deal actual terms have tax consequences different from those that her contracts with ernst young and cap gemini required her to report in.an example makes this clear.suppose that cap gemini had deposited stock in the merrill lynch accounts in annual installments from through,and that the parties had agreed to report that all income from the sale had been received in because the closing occurred that year.that agreement would not affect taxation.private parties can contract about when income is received,to be sure,but the tax rules about realization and recognition are extrinsic.people determine what transactions to engage in federal law then specifies how much tax is due.because fletcher does not try to recharacterize the transaction,doctrines that limit or foreclose taxpayers ability to take such a step are beside the point.
what,then,are the tax consequences of the parties chosen form cap gemini deposited all of the shares into individual accounts in from its perspective,the consideration had been paid in full.but the accounts were restricted.received in cash that year,while the rest of the stock could be reached only as time passed.from the moment of the deposit in,however,the bore the economic risk if the stock rose in the market,the stood to reap the whole gain,and if the stock fell the would bear the whole loss.this makes them the beneficial owners as of,the irs contends.for her part,fletcher stresses the restrictions and maintains that until she could do with the stock as she other words sell it,not just watch nervously as it rose or did not count as income.
the commissioner has the better of this argument,as can be seen by considering the tax consequences of depositing cash into a blocked account.suppose that an inventor sells his patent in for million,all paid by contract the inventor agrees that million will be put into a trust that will not be distributed until.from the buyer perspective,the full consideration is paid in.and from the inventor,the full consideration is received in.the inventor agrees to defer consumption for five years,perhaps as a spendthrift precaution,but a taxpayer willingness to defer consumption does not defer the tax falls on income rather than consumption.see a any item of gross income is taxed in the year received.income is received not only when paid in hand but also when the economic value is within the taxpayer control this is known as constructive receipt.it is why a person who earns income ca avoid tax by telling his employer to send a paycheck to his college,or his son,rather than to his bank.authority to direct the disposition of income is constructive receipt.in our example,the inventor could have chosen to receive the million in cash.agreement with the buyer that million would be sent to a trustee and held for five years does not avoid the fact that the inventor had the power to direct what became of the money that what the contract was about.and much the same can be said for fletcher she agreed by contract that of the consideration would be held in a restricted account for up to five years,but her willingness to accept restrictions and defer consumption does not eliminate constructive receipt in.
imagine that,instead of providing for payment in stock,the contract among ernst young,cap gemini,and the partners had called for some cash in plus a bond,handed over to the in and maturing in.that bond is income in,even to a taxpayer,because it is property that can be sold in the market.suppose that the partners also made side agreements with capgemini not to sell their bonds for five years.equivalently,the might have accepted unregistered securities,with a side agreement that capgemini would register them and thus facilitate sale in if the were still employed.an agreement not to sell would not change the nature of the bonds as property,and thus income,received in.see racine cir,cir a transaction involving stock options,but that not a material difference.but deferral of the right to sell would reduce the value of the bonds,and hence the amount of income,because an illiquid asset is worth less than a liquid one.whether the security is handed over to the with a legend reflecting the limits on sale,or instead is handed to an intermediary such as merrill lynch with instructions to enforce contractual restrictions on the sale of an security,should not matter for tax purposes.the actual structure of the transaction is much like our hypothetical bond,though because the restrictions on sale were lifted year by year it is more like one bond maturing in one year,another bond maturing in two years,and so on through five years.
three aspects of the contracts that fletcher signed are important to this understanding.first,it matters that fletcher and the other stood to receive the entire market gain,and to bear all loss,from the moment the transaction closed in.that feature of the deal shows that the stock was in her constructive possession in.second,it matters that fletcher agreed to postpone her unrestricted access to the stock.this is why the deal looks like our inventor hypothetical.third,it matters that fletcher agreed to the amount of the discount.the contracts among ernst young,cap gemini,and the partners specified that the restrictions would be treated as reducing the value of the stock to of its market price on the closing date.this reflects not only illiquidity but also the risk that capgemini would use its power over the account in an unauthorized way,or that merrill lynch might fail in its duty as a custodian.an would be hard pressed in light of this agreement to argue that the discount should be or fletcher does not try.she insists instead that nothing counts as income in other than what was actually put in her hands in cash.and that position is incompatible with the examples we have given.
one more complication.the consulting partners agreed to give back some of the stock if they quit early and went into competition with capgemini.if the parties goal of encouraging the to remain with capgemini had been accomplished by giving the partners immediate access to the stock but requiring them to grant capgemini a security interest in their homes,so that repayment would be assured,then all of the income would be treated as received in.if instead capgemini had doled out the stock in installments say,in and if the remained on its payroll in,then only would be taxable in.the actual transaction was somewhere in between of the stock was transferred to merrill lynch in and the custodian was to hold it until conditions such as not competing had been satisfied.for reasons we have the fact that the received the entire economic gain and loss from changes in the price of the securities from transaction looks more like income in than like a stream of payments over time.several courts have held that,where stock is transferred under a sales agreement and held in escrow to guarantee a party performance under the agreement,the party receives the stock when it is placed in escrow rather than when it is released.see chaplin cir,cir bonham cir,cir see also whitney cir,cir.that principle applies here.
the more likely it is that the conditions will be satisfied,and all restrictions lifted,the more sensible it is to treat all of the stock as constructively received when deposited in the account.to see this,suppose that the parties had wanted to defer the recognition of income and had put million in each partner account,with the condition that the whole amount would be forfeited if the temperature in barrow,alaska,exceeded f on january.would the remote possibility of an arctic heat wave enable the partners to defer paying taxes surely not.see cemco investors,llc united states,cir.if,on the other hand,the parties agreed that the would receive million only if the temperature in barrow on january,exceeded f,then none of the partners would constructively receive income in everything would depend on events in.
the sort of contingencies that could lead to forfeitures were within the control.that implies taxability in,for control is a form of constructive possession.and the agreement to discount the stock by only tells us that the parties deemed forfeitures unlikely.fletcher acknowledgment that the risk of forfeiture was small shows that the conditions of constructive receipt in have been satisfied.
thus although we agree with fletcher that the are entitled to contest the tax treatment called for by the contracts,we hold that the shares are taxable in at their value on the date of deposit to the accounts at merrill lynch.income was constructively received in that year not because the contract said that everyone would report it so to the irs,but because the parties were right to think that this transaction actual provisions made the income attributable
