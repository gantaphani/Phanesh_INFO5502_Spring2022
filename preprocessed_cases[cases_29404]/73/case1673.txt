the novel and very narrow issue presented is this may a municipality lawfully require the owner of a private residence who proposes to modify a portion of the interior of his residence,in an area not visible to the general public,to undergo the burden and expense of a review of his proposed project pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa the answer is no.as we explain,although a municipality has very broad statutory discretion to grant or deny a required building permit,that authority does not extend to imposing ceqa review upon such an interior home project,even where the residence is listed as a city landmark and is located within an area registered as a state and a national historic district.what an owner plans to do to the private interior of his or her home does not implicate a significant adverse effect on the environment,which is the predicate for requiring ceqa review by a municipality.
a secondary issue is whether,apart from ceqa,a court will preempt administrative review under section of the san francisco business and tax regulations code of an application for a building permit.the answer again is no.the exercise of section administrative discretion must precede judicial intervention.
background 
the salient facts are without dispute francis martin martin owns a house located on broadway in san francisco.that house,also known as the atkinson house,was originally erected in,making it one of the oldest structures in san francisco.the noted century architect willis polk designed the remodeling of its interior in,the results of that and similar work by polk becoming famous in architectural circles.in or about,the atkinson house was designated as a city landmark.since,the russian hill neighborhood in which martin house is located has been listed on the national register of historic places and the california register of historical resources.the documentation leading up to the national register listing noted generally that willis polk frequently utilized natural redwood interiors as a design feature however,a large number of enumerated factors contributed to the listing of the neighborhood,the redwood interiors being only one.for example,the listing documentation emphasized the exteriors of the buildings within the neighborhood and their relationships to their gardens and natural settings.
in,martin submitted plans to the city and county of san francisco city for alterations to the interior and exterior of his house.the proposed changes contemplated the destruction of portions of the redwood interior.see fn,post.in response to the submission of the plans,the city planning department advised martin that b ased upon the information that has been presented,we believe that the interior space proposed for renovation is a feature that contributes to the russian street crest national register historic district that,a s such,that space is considered to be a part of the historic resource and that consequently an environmental review officer of the planning department determined that the interior renovations proposed by the martin family are not categorically exempt from further environmental review under ceqa pub.resources code,et.therefore,the city asked martin to submit an environmental evaluation application so that the planning department could proceed to analyze the potential environmental impacts of the project and complete the appropriate environmental review document.although the city expressed no objection to martin proposed changes to the exterior of his home,it refused to process any part of his permit application absent ceqa review.
the parties stipulated at trial that n o portion of the interior of the atkinson house is visible from any public street or sidewalk that martin proposed interior alterations of the atkinson house would not be visible from any public street or sidewalk that t he city has refused to process any building permit application for martin interior alterations unless the proposed project is first submitted to further environmental review under ceqa and that the city has never in the past subjected proposed alterations to the interiors of private residences to environmental review under ceqa,other than the issuance of categorical exemptions.nevertheless,the city took the position that because the interior of the atkinson house is a historical resource and the proposed interior alterations would cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource,the city would require ceqa review of martin application as part of the city discretionary powers to grant or deny approval of the desired building permit.
instead of providing further information,martin filed a complaint for declaratory relief,naming as defendants the city and its planning department.he prayed for a judicial determination that ceqa does not apply to an application for a building permit authorizing plaintiff proposed renovations and improvements to the interior of his house.the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which it accepted stipulations offered by the parties,and heard the testimony of three witnesses mainly concerning operations and procedures of the planning department.the common theme of the testimony mirrored one of the was the first time the planning department had taken the position that ceqa applied to alterations to the interior of a private residence.the point of disagreement is about the proposed interior alterations,not those to the exterior.
even though the only specific prayer for relief in martin complaint was for a declaration that ceqa does not apply to his proposed interior modifications,he injected into the case at trial a request for a further declaration.thus,he also sought a pronouncement that the city has no discretion under section to deny a permit to renovate the interior of a private residence when the plans comply with the city applicable building codes and zoning ordinances,and will not affect surrounding properties or residents.
following receipt of submissions,the court issued a statement of decision concluding that martin was not entitled to any relief.after judgment was entered,martin perfected this timely appeal.
the ceqa issue 
on the ceqa issue,the city tried and won this case below,and briefed it on this appeal,along the lines of the following reasoning a city ordinance,section of the san francisco business and tax regulations code hereinafter section,gives the planning the board of permit appeals as the reviewing plenary discretion in deciding whether to issue a building permit ceqa specifies that decisions which involve the exercise of discretion by local authorities are left to local authorities.pub.resources code,subds.a b,tit,k,c,a,a d.armed with the discretion granted by section,the planning department must review martin project under ceqa,particularly because ceqa applies to projects that impact a historical resource such as martin house.pub.resources code.moreover,courts will defer to local authorities until a final decision is made at the administrative level,lindell board of permit appeals cal d,maxwell civil service commission cal.therefore,until the city completes administrative proceedings,martin request for declaratory relief as respects ceqa was,and remains,premature.
there is considerable force to the city the abstract.section does vest administrative authorities with very broad discretion to decide whether and on what conditions an applicant will be granted a permit.and if the application is for a building permit,the fact that the applicant project complies with zoning ordinances and building codes does not restrict the scope of that discretion.lindell board of permit appeals,supra,cal d,guinnane san francisco planning com.d.in addition,it is undisputed that once the neighborhood that includes martin house was placed on the national register of historic places as authorized by the national historic preservation act et,it was automatically put on the california register of historical resources pub.resources code,tit,a and thus became a historical resource for purposes of ceqa.pub.resources code.the crux of the disagreement is whether the changes martin proposes to make to the interior of his home will have a substantial impact on the environment.
a prudential basis for deferring a decision on the ultimate issue until after the completion of administrative proceedings dissolved at oral argument when counsel for the city advised us that the planning department has already firmly determined that ceqa does apply.counsel statement can and will be treated as factually authoritative,browne superior court cal d,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.accordingly,the city will be deemed to have admitted that it has already been decided that the martin interior modifications must undergo ceqa review overseen by the planning department.if ceqa does not authorize that review,martin should be spared the unnecessary expense and delay it would entail.see bowman city of berkeley th,d myers board of supervisors d.we therefore address the merits of the ceqa issue as framed at the outset of this opinion 
the major purposes of ceqa are to protect,rehabilitate,and enhance the environmental quality of the state,subd.a.the major procedure for achieving these goals is requiring preparation of an environmental impact report whenever a state or local agency proposes to approve or implement a project that may have a significant effect on the environment.ceqa has statutory definitions for these terms.environment means the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project,including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,noise,objects of historic or aesthetic significance.pub.resources code.project is defined a number of ways,one of which is a n activity that involves the issuance of a permit by one or more public agencies that may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment pub.resources code,subd.c.significant effect on the environment means a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in the environment pub.resources code,and includes substantial adverse effects on human beings,either directly or indirectly.pub.resources code,subd.c.
ceqa authorizes the promulgation of guidelines for the implementation of its provisions by public agencies.pub.resources code.in the words of the statute,t he guidelines shall specifically include criteria for public agencies to follow in determining whether or not a proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment.pub.resources code.two of those guidelines further clarify the statutory definitions.according to one,environment means the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,ambient noise,and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.the area involved shall be the area in which significant effects would occur either directly or indirectly as a result of the project.the environment includes both natural and conditions,tit.just what constitutes a significant effect on the environment is a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,ambient noise,and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.an economic or social change by itself shall not be considered a significant effect on the environment.a social or economic change related to a physical change may be considered in determining whether the physical change is significant,tit.
ceqa,like section,has an expansive scope of operation.nevertheless,there are areas that even ceqa can not reach.thus,the following rules and authorities operate to restrict ceqa potential application.
first,ceqa is not to be stretched beyond the reasonable scope of the statutory language,tit,subd.f citizens of goleta valley board of supervisors cal d,communities for a better environment california resources agency th,d.ceqa is not to be interpreted in a manner which imposes procedural or substantive requirements beyond those explicitly stated in this division or in the state guidelines.pub.resources code.
second,as this court recently held,while ceqa is to be liberally construed for the protection of the environment,like other statutes,it is to receive a practical,common sense construction.bowman city of berkeley,supra,th,d.other courts likewise have so held.see fall river wild trout foundation county of shasta th,d city of south gate los angeles unified school dist.d.billings california coastal com.d.
third,in its first opportunity to examine ceqa,the california supreme court stated,common sense tells us that the majority of private projects for which a government permit or similar entitlement is necessary are minor in,relating only to the construction,improvement,or operation of an individual dwelling or small hence,in the absence of unusual circumstances,have little or no effect on the public environment.such projects,accordingly,may be approved exactly as before the enactment of the eqa.friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,disapproved on other ground in kowis howard cal th,d.
fourth,while statutory exemptions ordinarily become relevant only where the statute would otherwise apply,it is noteworthy that one of the ceqa guidelines,known as the common sense exemption,excludes activities covered by the general rule that ceqa applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment.where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment,the activity is not subject to ceqa,tit,subd.b.this exemption applies even where a local agency has discretion to approve or deny a project.see mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d,citing no oil,city of los angeles cal d,disapproved on other grounds in western states petroleum superior court cal th,d.
fifth,one of ceqa provisions directs the promulgation of regulatory guidelines establishing classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall be exempt from ceqa.pub.resources code,subd.a.among the exempted classes are the construction of a new residence,tit,conversions of an existing structure where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure id.and i nterior or exterior alterations to an existing private structure which entail negligible or no expansion of an existing use,tit.allowances are made for unusual circumstances,tit,but the general principle construction of one residence,or the ensuing modifications commonly undertaken,are not covered by ceqa,salmon protection watershed network county of marin th,d association for protection.values city of ukiah th,d gabric city of rancho palos verdes d.a local agency discretionary authority can not negate this exemption.association for protection.values city of ukiah,supra,at,d,citing,tit.
an examination of the ceqa definitions quoted above yields a common general,they deal with tangible physical manifestations that are perceptible by the senses.environment is a very broad concept encompassing both tangible and intangible factors.but the intangible has ceqa consequence only if there is a nexus to a physically perceivable reality.the major statutory emphasis is on matters that can be seen,felt,heard,or smelled,consequences resulting from physical impacts on the environment.see pub.resources code,subd.e,subd.c,tit,subd.e absent a physical change,e conomic and social changes resulting from a project shall not be treated as significant effects on the environment,tit,subd.a cathay mortuary,san francisco planning com.d.ceqa will come into play only with a disruption of the physical environment,tit,subd.d the significance of the environmental effect to be measured by direct physical changes to the environment,s ignificant effect on the environment defined to include adverse change in any of the physical conditions,subd.a project defined to include,among other things,a direct physical change in the environment.
having in mind the context of this homeowner enjoyment of his private living is pertinent to observe that u nder ceqa,the question is whether a project will affect the environment of persons in general,not whether a project will affect particular persons.citation.mira mar mobile community city of oceanside th,d.that sine qua non of ceqa is missing here no one not actually inside martin house will have any percipient awareness that interior modifications have been made.a purely intellectual understanding that work by willis polk may no longer be within an unobservable part of another person private living quarters will not suffice to establish a significant effect on the environment.that what martin proposes may strike some as cultural vandalism will not bring it within the ambit of ceqa unless there is a physical impact on the environment.see pub.resources code,subd.b association for protection.values city of ukiah,supra,th,d.destruction of an irreplaceable antiquity not being perceived by the public does not qualify as a significant effect,tit,subd.e absent physical change,social changes resulting from a project shall not be treated as significant effects on the environment.
martin proposed modifications,being to the interior of an existing residence and not perceptible to others,lack the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment and are beyond the reach of ceqa.for all intents and purposes,what was visible before will be no different than what will be visible if the modifications are completed both theoretically and practically,the concept of an environment must mean something more than what is perceivable only by the one person who wishes to change his or her own décor and those who may visit him at his home.the modifications here in issue would constitute a substantial adverse change neither to the environment pub.resources code,tit,nor to a historical resource pub.resources code.in fact,environmentally speaking,it is no change at all.
this is the plain import of the language of ceqa and the implementing guidelines.the parties have pointed to nothing in terms of legislative history,nor has our own research found anything,providing the least hint the legislature intended a small scale alteration of the interior of a private one with historical be subject to a ceqa review.
this conclusion finds additional support in considerations of practicality and common sense.if the martin project were subject to ceqa,an environmental impact report,characterized in the guidelines as the heart of ceqa,tit,a,might well be required pub.resources code,which would in turn be available for public comment pub.resources code,tit.we can scarcely believe the legislature envisaged turning local agencies into censors of homeowners plans for interior decoration.moreover,the application of ceqa here would introduce a slippery slope,resulting in profound concerns for personal privacy.what if it were a bedroom or a bathroom that martin wanted to alter as stated in a different context,we are dealing with the home,which has traditionally been subject to the highest protection against intrusions.tom city and county of san francisco,th,d.
without question,the preservation of san francisco architectural history is an important policy goal,and it has already received the city attention article of the san francisco planning code is devoted to preservation of historical architectural and aesthetic landmarks.planning code.but it can not be without significance that the city itself has confined its solicitude to the exterior of private homes that are landmark buildings.the code excludes from the requirement of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness for proposed changes to a landmark building interior alterations on a privately owned structure.
attempts to preserve what are deemed culturally or historically significant buildings have generated passionate debate,friends of sierra madre city of sierra madre cal th,d,league for protection of oakland.historic resources city of oakland th,d citizens for responsible development city of west hollywood,supra,th,d orinda board of supervisors d.foundation for san francisco architectural heritage city and county of san francisco d.however,ceqa is implicated only if such controversies relate to any environmental issue.cathay mortuary,san francisco planning,supra,d.that is clearly,as a matter of law,not the case here.
the section issue 
the issue sought to be raised under section the city has discretion under that section and apart from ceqa to deny martin a permit to renovate his home on a different footing than that raised under ceqa,the reason being that,unlike the ceqa situation,the city has not made any determinations under section as respects martin plans.in other words,as to martin,the city has not purported to exercise its section discretion in any direction or at all.
as previously noted,it is well established that section administrative discretion is not cabined by specific criteria that may be set forth in city codes or ordinances instead,that discretion is informed by the public interest,encompassing anything impacting the public health,safety or general welfare.lindell board of permit appeals,supra,cal d,guinnane san francisco planning,supra,d.quoting from united states supreme court cases,the guinnane court observed that the concept of public welfare is broad and inclusive,and that t he values it represents are spiritual physical,and aesthetic as well as monetary.id.at.clearly,it can not be said that section administrative discretion properly includes consideration only of matters within the scope of ceqa.
it would do violence to the language and history of section for a court to usurp the city discretion by concluding in advance of administrative review that,as a matter of law,a particular permit application will not have an adverse effect on the public health,safety or general welfare.absent the exercise of section administrative discretion,the issue of the limits of the city section powers over martin project is not ripe for judicial resolution.
wholly apart from what has been said,there are substantial practical reasons against judicial intervention in the city section review of martin permit application.by way of example,the city may well decide to issue the requested permit.or a permit may be issued subject to conditions acceptable to martin.in any event,while circumventing the planning authorities in the exercise of their section discretion might be viewed as a concession to the shortness of life,it is not one countenanced by the law.
conclusion 
the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to a grant martin request for a judicial declaration that ceqa does not apply to his application for a permit to make interior modifications to his house,and b deny martin request for a declaration of rights under section.
the historical resource that is listed on the national register is not any interior design within martin home,nor even his house as a whole,but the neighborhood in which he resides.the registration was made in,before martin became the owner of the atkinson house.
the ordinance cited provides in pertinent part in the granting or denying of any permit,or the revoking or the refusing to revoke any permit the granting or revoking power may take into consideration the effect of the proposed business or calling upon surrounding property and upon its residents,and inhabitants thereof and in granting or denying said permit,or revoking or refusing to revoke a permit,may exercise its sound discretion as to whether said permit should be granted,transferred,denied or revoked.bus.tax.
ceqa defines an historical resource as a resource listed in,or determined to be eligible for listing in,the california register of historical resources.historical resources included in a local register of historical resources are presumed to be historically or culturally significant for purposes of this section.pub.resources code.
