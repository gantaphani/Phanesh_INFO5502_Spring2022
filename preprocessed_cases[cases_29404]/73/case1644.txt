the city and county of san francisco the city appeals a judgment that awarded macy department stores,and four related corporations macy a tax refund.the city argues that macy and refund claims were untimely,the trial court erred by refunding all local business taxes paid by macy during the contested period instead of the amount sufficient to negate the discriminatory effect of the tax,and the rate of prejudgment interest should have been derived from a local ordinance rather than state law.we conclude macy tax refund must be limited to an amount sufficient to cure the discriminatory effect of the tax.so,we reverse 
factual and procedural background 
pursuant to city ordinances in effect between and,a business that operated in san francisco was required to calculate its tax liability separately under payroll expense and gross receipts taxes,and to pay the greater of the two amounts.mun.code,pt.iii,former.in april,the city repealed the gross receipts tax,effective january,ord.
on january,macy filed claims with the city for refunds of all taxes paid since.later macy filed refund claims for all taxes paid through the year the claims were denied.in september,macy filed the first of three complaints seeking tax refunds,on the basis that the city business tax scheme failed the internal consistency test used to determine whether a state or local tax violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution.macy also alleged the city tax scheme violated the corresponding provisions of the california constitution.the cases were consolidated in march.
three experts testified in the court trial.direct testimony was provided by their written reports,and each expert was subject to.the experts agreed the city tandem tax could hypothetically discriminate against intercity taxpayers,who might be subject to tax under a payroll expense measure in one jurisdiction and under a gross receipts measure in another,unlike a local taxpayer,who would pay tax only to san francisco under only one measure 
economist steven sheffrin,was retained by the city and described a method for quantifying the extra amount an intercity taxpayer would hypothetically be burdened under the tandem tax.this amount was argued to represent the appropriate measure of refund.macy expert economist,charles mclure,criticized sheffrin approach as bad public policy because liability for a partial refund would not serve to sufficiently deter local governments from enacting invalid tax measures,but did not challenge its efficacy in this case,and conceded that the fact situation was relatively simple.certified public accountant everett harry used financial information produced by macy during discovery and applied sheffrin method to calculate the maximum excess taxes the city scheme could have imposed on macy macy declined to harry,and did not challenge his computations.
the trial court found the city tandem tax scheme violated the federal and state constitutions because it failed the internal consistency test.the court also concluded that general motors city and county of san francisco th,d compelled a full refund of all taxes paid by macy from through,that macy refund claims for tax years and were timely,and that prejudgment interest should be set at percent,accruing from the date of each tax payment the city timely appealed 
discussion 
measure of refund 
in container franchise tax bd,d,the united states supreme court first articulated what has become known as the internal consistency test that measures the validity of a state or local tax argued to have a negative impact upon interstate commerce and thereby violate the dormant commerce clause.internal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other state would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear.this test asks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax,but simply looks to the structure of the tax at issue to see whether its identical application by every state in the union would place interstate commerce at a disadvantage as compared with commerce intrastate.a failure of internal consistency shows as a matter of law that a state is attempting to take more than its fair share of taxes from the interstate transaction,since allowing such a tax in one state would place interstate commerce at the mercy of those remaining states that might impose an identical tax.oklahoma tax comm jefferson lines,d.
the internal consistency test has since been applied by california courts to determine the validity of local tax measures challenged as discriminatory in violation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution and the equivalent proscriptions derived from provisions of the california constitution.general motors city of los angeles th,d see also union oil city of los angeles th,d.
when a tax fails because it is not internally consistent,the united states supreme court has generally left it up to the states to determine the exact remedy they must provide to aggrieved taxpayers.see,tyler pipe industries of revenue,d.the parameters of relief were made clear in mckesson florida alcohol tobacco div,d mckesson,where the supreme court held to satisfy the requirements of the due process clause,the state must provide taxpayers with,not only a fair opportunity to challenge the accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation,but also a clear and certain remedy,citation,for any erroneous or unlawful tax collection to ensure that the opportunity to contest the tax is a meaningful one.id.at,fn.omitted.the court concluded that when a tax scheme is found unconstitutional only insofar as it operated in a manner that discriminated against interstate commerce,the taxing authority retains flexibility in responding to this determination,and may reformulate and enforce the tax during the contested tax period in any way that treats the taxpayer and its competitors in a manner consistent with the dictates of the commerce clause.having done so,the taxing authority may retain the tax appropriately levied upon the taxpayer pursuant to this reformulated scheme because this retention would deprive the taxpayer of its property pursuant to a tax scheme that is valid under the commerce clause.id.at.more specifically,the taxing authority may cure the invalidity of the tax by refunding to the taxpayer the difference between the tax it paid and the tax it would have been assessed were it extended the same preferential treatment that its competitors actually received.id.at.accord,fulton faulkner,d.
here,the city does not appeal the trial court determination that the tandem payroll and gross receipts tax scheme fails the internal consistency test,and is therefore unconstitutional.instead,the city appeals the award to macy of a full refund of all business taxes paid from through,rather than a partial refund in an amount sufficient to remedy any hypothetical discrimination.the trial court found that the measure of refund was definitively stated in general motors city and county of san francisco,to be a full refund of all taxes paid.we disagree.
before the internal consistency test was applied to determine whether a state or local tax was legal,the rule was that a taxpayer was required to show more than the possibility of erratic or unconstitutional application.one who attacks a formula of apportionment carries a distinct burden of showing by clear and cogent evidence that it results in extraterritorial values being taxed.citations.city of los angeles shell oil,supra,cal d at.the taxpayer thus had the burden of showing the taxing authority actually taxed business activity outside its jurisdiction.ibid.but the taxpayer no longer has to show more than the possibility of erratic or unconstitutional application to prove a tax is illegal.as the internal consistency test asks nothing about the degree of economic reality reflected by the tax,oklahoma tax comm jefferson lines,supra,at,mckesson makes clear that due process does not compel a full refund in all cases.
neither does general motors city and county of san francisco,relied upon by the trial court.in general motors,the court reviewed a facially invalid tax enacted by a taxing authority that placed the burden upon the taxpayer to demonstrate double taxation in order to secure a refund.th at,d.this case is very different.it is only the tandem interaction of the city payroll and gross receipts taxes that violates the commerce clause under the internal consistency test.in isolation,each of the taxes is valid neither did the city place the burden on macy to demonstrate double taxation and the proper measure of refund.the city experts calculated the amount of possible overpayments macy could have made under the tandem tax,and macy does not dispute it 
unlike general motors city and county of san francisco,there is no claim here that the city proposed remedy is deficient because it is uncertain or would not eliminate the discriminatory effect of the tandem tax scheme.instead,macy relies on its expert testimony criticizing a partial refund as bad public policy.macy argues that hypothetical future cases might require complex factual analysis in order to quantify the appropriate refund,and that the partial refund proposed here by the city would not serve to discourage taxing authorities from enacting unconstitutional taxes in the future.we consider here only the claim before us,however,and express no general opinion regarding the appropriate remedy in other cases.ceridian franchise tax bd.th,fn,d.
this is also not a case where a full tax refund is required because the tax was beyond the state power to impose,as was the unapportioned tax in atchison ry,or because the taxpayers were absolutely immune from the tax,as were the indian tribes in ward love county.and carpenter shaw.mckesson,supra,at.macy relies on those earlier cases to argue that a full refund is required here,but does not acknowledge their limiting treatment by the supreme court of the united states in mckesson.the more recent federal cases cited by macy do not address this issue,but merely reaffirm a taxpayer general right to a postdeprivation refund of taxes,a proposition not under dispute in this case.newsweek,florida of revenue,d reich collins,d.
this court has followed mckesson to determine the options available to a taxing authority to remedy a discriminatory tax.ceridian franchise tax,supra,th at,d.under mckesson guidelines,we concluded the state franchise tax board could refund to the taxpayer the difference between the tax it paid and the tax it would have been assessed were it allowed the same deductions its competitors actually received,and affirmed the award of a stipulated refund.ibid.while the parties here have not stipulated to the amount of the refund,macy does not challenge the city calculation of the amount necessary to remedy any hypothetical excess it could have paid under the tandem tax.see also haman county of humboldt cal d,court may eliminate effects of discriminatory tax by granting a refund based on the difference between the rates in question city of modesto national med,th,d when discriminatory taxes have been assessed,the taxing authority may issue a partial refund to the disfavored parties to equalize the tax rate.
while the states are free to provide broader relief as a matter of state law than is required by the federal constitution mckesson,supra,at,fn,general motors city and county of san francisco does not hold that broader relief is required under california law,nor does it even consider the question.the court there relied on mckesson,but concluded the remedy proposed by the taxing authority would not eliminate the discrimination suffered by the taxpayer,nor would it provide a clear and certain remedy under the circumstances of that case.general motors city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.neither does macy argue that it is entitled to broader relief under the due process requirements of the california constitution than under the federal constitution,nor has it cited any authority to support such a claim.
instead,macy says a full refund is compelled by article xiii,section of the california constitution,which provides no legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this state or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax.after payment of a tax claimed to be illegal,an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid,with interest,in such manner as may be provided by the legislature.article xiii,section recognizes the taxpayer right to refund of an illegal tax,as a corollary to the prohibition against enjoining the collection of any tax,but it does not address the proper measure of refund.nor do the cases cited by macy discuss the issue.todd shipyards city of los angeles d.taxpayer entitled to recover prejudgment interest on taxes voluntarily refunded by municipality flying dutchman park,city and county of san francisco th,d rejecting taxpayer claim for prepayment injunctive relief from city parking tax because city ordinance authorizing refund of taxes illegally collected provided adequate remedy at law.
macy also says a full refund is required by the city ordinance in effect from through that governed payroll tax refunds.former of the payroll expense tax ordinance,mun.code,pt.iii.but that ordinance provides only that the amount of any tax illegally collected may be refunded,and a plain reading does not support macy argument 
macy cites several cases for the general proposition that an unconstitutional statute may be held void and without force or effect.but none of them address the remedy due a taxpayer subjected to a tax that violates the commerce clause or the california constitution.reclamation district superior court cal,prohibition against enjoining the execution of statutes applies only to valid statutes brandenstein hoke cal,doctrine protecting corporation from collateral questions as to the regularity of the proceedings taken in its organization does not apply when corporation was organized under unconstitutional law hardie eu cal d,state officials directed to refrain from enforcing statute that infringed on first amendment rights and was not supported by compelling state interest brabant city of south gate d.enjoining enforcement of unapportioned local business license fee imposed on real estate brokers whose only office was in another city.
macy is entitled to be placed in a position equivalent to that occupied by local taxpaying businesses so it will have paid a valid measure of taxes.see mckesson,supra,at.in this way,the city may limit macy tax refund to the amount necessary to remedy any discrimination from the city former tandem tax.id.at.macy is not entitled to a full refund of all business taxes paid between and.such a refund would place macy in a more favorable position than a local taxpayer during the same period.see haman county of humboldt,supra,cal d at,in determining the proper remedy,we must adopt the one which will best further the legislative intent without increasing discrimination among other taxpayers.
timeliness of macy and claims 
the city argues that macy and claims were not timely filed,because a local ordinance effective january,shortened the limitations period for filing tax refund claims from three years to days ord.macy and refund claims were filed on january,more than one year,but less than three years,after the taxes were paid.
the trial court concluded the claims were timely because their filing was governed by the limitations period provided in section of the city payroll expense tax ordinance the city argues the shortened limitations period began to run on the effective date of the ordinance,and the and claims were therefore barred the city claims that a legislative body may shorten the period of limitations applicable to preexisting claims,as long as claimants are left a reasonable time in which to assert their rights.see coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d.
but the language of the city ordinance does not support the city.it expressly provides this ordinance shall take effect on january,and shall apply to tax obligations and penalties that accrue after that date.all provisions of part iii of the municipal code the city business and tax regulations code not expressly or necessarily changed by this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect ord.ordinance,which includes the repeal of section and other procedural provisions of the payroll expense tax ordinance,and was enacted at the same time as ordinance,similarly states the changes made in this ordinance shall take effect on january,and shall apply to tax obligations and penalties that accrue after that date.all provisions of this article not expressly or necessarily changed by this ordinance shall remain in full force and effect ord.
the city argues that it is the statute of limitations amendment and the other provisions of the ordinance that are governed by the effective date language,not the refund claims themselves.but the claims here arose out of tax obligations that accrued before january,when the ordinance became effective.by their own terms,the limitations periods in the ordinances do not apply.the trial court properly concluded that macy and claims were governed by the prior limitation imposed by section of the payroll expense tax ordinance,and were therefore timely 
prejudgment interest rate 
the city and amicus curiae argue that the rate of prejudgment interest payable on macy tax refund should be determined according to a local ordinance that provides for interest at a variable rate,computed from the date the claim for refund is made the trial court correctly concluded that prejudgment interest was payable at percent,pursuant to state law,from the time the taxes were paid.
article xiii,section of the california constitution states no legal or equitable process shall issue in any proceeding in any court against this state or any officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax.after payment of a tax claimed to be illegal,an action may be maintained to recover the tax paid,with interest,in such manner as may be provided by the legislature.civil code section,subdivision a provides every person who is entitled to recover damages certain,or capable of being made certain by calculation,and the right to recover which is vested in him upon a particular day,is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day,except during such time as the debtor is prevented by law,or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt.this section is applicable to recovery of damages and interest from any such debtor,including the state or any county,city,city and county,municipal corporation,public district,public agency,or any political subdivision of the state.
while civil code section does not specify the rate of interest to be paid,article xv,section of the california constitution provides the rate of interest upon a judgment rendered in any court of this state shall be set by the legislature at not more than percent per annum.such rate may be variable and based upon interest rates charged by federal agencies or economic indicators,or both.in the absence of the setting of such rate by the legislature,the rate of interest on any judgment rendered in any court of the state shall be percent per annum.thus the courts have applied an interest rate of percent to obligations governed by section.see,sanders city of los angeles cal d,walker occidental life ins.cal d,humphrey equitable life assur.soc.cal d,bonelli state of california d.daum development yuba plaza,d.
the courts have also rejected the argument that a charter city is exempt from the operation of civil code section under the home rule doctrine,and have awarded interest on local tax refunds pursuant to that statute,accruing from the date the taxes were paid.see todd shipyards city of los angeles,supra,d at.itt gilfillan,city of los angeles d.see also may stores city of los angeles d.the city claims those cases are distinguishable,because the los angeles ordinance there in question did not provide for the payment of any interest the city also argues that certain language in may dept stores supports application of the interest rate specified in the city ordinance here 
the city maintains that there are no cases that apply civil code section when a local ordinance provides for interest on local tax refunds,and that a local ordinance governing municipal affairs should prevail unless it conflicts with state law.but here section and applicable provisions of the california constitution operate together to require the payment of interest on tax refunds at a rate of percent,from the time the right to recover is vested in the taxpayer.the provisions of the city ordinance purporting to apply a different rate of interest,which begins to accrue at a different time,thus conflict with state law that occupies the field on a matter of statewide concern.see todd shipyards city of los angeles,supra,d at.
the city also claims its ordinance provides for the calculation of interest in a manner similar to revenue and taxation code section,which governs refunds of state property taxes but here we are concerned with the rate of interest payable on the refund of a different,local tax to which the legislature has not extended section.in the absence of another provision by the legislature,state law provides for an interest rate of percent.
finally,the city argues that even under civil code section,interest should run from the date of the claim for refund,not from the date of payment,because the taxpayer right to recover does not vest until the refund claim is filed.but the case on which the city relies,state of california superior court cal th,d,addressed a different issue.there the court held that a prison inmate who sued the state for failure to provide adequate medical care was required to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate or excuse compliance with the claim presentation requirement of the tort claims act in order to survive a demurrer,and reiterated the principle that compliance with the claim presentation requirement was an element of a cause of action against a public entity.id.at,d.the court did not consider the issue presented here,namely when the right to recover damages vests for purposes of section.in todd shipyards city of los angeles,by contrast,the court concluded that debt was due,in each instance,on the day the respective payments were wrongfully collected,and in each instance the right to recover vested on the same day on which the money was paid.d at.accord,itt gilfillan city of los angeles,supra,d at.this comports with the purpose of prejudgment interest,to compensate plaintiffs for loss of use of their property.see lewis nelson sons,clovis unified school dist.th,d.
disposition 
the judgment awarding a refund of all taxes paid by macy is reversed,and the case is remanded with directions to enter judgment in an amount sufficient to remedy any potential discriminatory burden imposed by the city prior tandem tax from through.the case is also remanded for reconsideration of the award of costs in the trial court.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
we also remand for reconsideration of the award of costs in the trial court,in light of the disposition of this appeal.
the repealing ordinance also provided a refund to any taxpayer who paid a gross receipts tax in,in an amount equal to the difference between the amount actually paid under the gross receipts ordinance for the tax year and the lesser amount payable under the payroll expense ordinance for such year.ord.
all the taxes paid by macy were calculated under the payroll expense provisions.
macy did not claim that it paid any actual excess taxes under the city tandem tax scheme.
harry concluded that assuming macy was liable for the business tax at each of its stores separately and each store was located in a different jurisdiction,macy would have paid percent more in taxes than a hypothetical local taxpayer with the same consolidated payroll and gross receipts.
the court awarded macy over million in tax refunds and interest for the tax years.the court denied macy claim for refund of its taxes,based on the city retroactive repeal of the gross receipts tax for that year.macy has not appealed from that ruling.
the city also appealed from the denial
