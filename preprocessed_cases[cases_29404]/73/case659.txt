michael segal and near north insurance brokerage nnib were charged in counts of a fourth superseding indictment segal with racketeering,mail and wire fraud,false statements,embezzlement,and conspiring to impede the internal revenue service nnib with mail and wire fraud,false statements,and embezzlement.a jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts except one which the government dismissed,but the district court judge ruben castillo granted a judgment of acquittal on,leaving a grand total of standing at the end of the day.nnib was ordered to pay a million fine and pay restitution totaling.segal was sentenced to months imprisonment,ordered to pay in restitution,and forfeit million and his interest in the racketeering enterprise.
segal was a licensed attorney,a cpa,and an insurance broker who began working for nnib in when it was owned by george dunne,a prominent politician and president,for years,of the cook county board.by the early segal was the owner and sole shareholder of the company.he then formed nnnb,a holding company,to be the corporate parent of nnib and many of his other financial interests.during the nnib was earning close to million annually.
during the period covered by the law,as set out in.admin.code a,required insurance brokers to maintain a premium fund trust account pfta into which all premiums were to be deposited and held in a fiduciary capacity until the carriers demanded the premium payments.the time between a broker receipt of premium payments and the carrier the float varied with the carrier.commissions,interest,credit,and other nonpremium money could be withdrawn,but brokers were required to maintain pftas in trust with sufficient funds to pay premiums.the accounts could not be used as operating accounts.failure to properly maintain a pfta was grounds for suspension or revocation of a broker license.conversion of more than was a felony.
nnib maintained both a pfta and an operating account,but everything was deposited in the pfta,and the operating account was maintained with a zero balance.funds were transferred to the operating account from the pfta to pay expenses,but after those payments were made everything was transferred back to the pfta.the chief financial officer of nnib from to,norman pater,considered this practice to be a violation of the regulations,as did his successor,donald kendeigh,and,in turn,his successor,thomas mcnichols.
nevertheless,segal expanded his business,purchasing brokerages in new york,california,texas,and florida.in addition,he purchased several other companies,ranging from a fire suppression device manufacturer to a software maker.the acquisition of these entities was funded by nnib pfta.most of the companies were losing money,so there were regular wire transfers from the pfta to keep them solvent.by the end of the pfta was over million out of trust.at the end of it was million short,and by august the deficit had grown to million.evidence shows that segal knew he was converting pfta money to fund expansion and for other unauthorized purposes.auditors regularly told him so.segal contended it was no big deal.he told mcnichols that every insurance company operates the way he did.in the face of this sort of operation,the auditing firm mcgladrey pullen resigned,as had an earlier firm,deloitte touche.
the cash shortfall in the pfta was so bad in january that segal had the head of the nnib branch in los angeles wire million to cover payments which were due to carriers.reluctantly he wired the money on january on the,million was wired back to los angeles.
in april,mcnichols drafted a letter to segal outlining an nnib management operations plan.its purpose was to bring nnib into compliance with the law.the plan proposed putting control of nnib into an executive committee that would report to segal but be free to act without his approval.the plan called for selling off affiliates,segregating pfta from operating funds,and obtaining an outside audit.the letter noted that the pfta was million in deficit but that for years segal had shown no interest in balancing it,that outside auditors had quit because of the deficit,that segal wife said segal ties to the governor would protect him,and that segal was intentionally committing a felony.segal rejected the plan.but he retained hales company,financial consultants,to evaluate nnib prospects of raising capital by attracting new investors.soon after hales was retained,its chief executive officer received a phone call from segal saying that an anonymous letter had been sent to the illinois department of insurance idoi reporting the pfta deficit.the hales in charge of the account concluded that the pfta was out of trust by after segal put million from a mortgage on his home into the account.hales secured loans for nnib,and the situation was finally corrected when firemen fund and aig each loaned nnib million.the loans,however,came with restrictions on segal ability to dispose of assets,effectively taking control of nnib out of his hands.
a less dramatic aspect of the situation involved petty cash.dan watkins,an employee in nnib accounting department,maintained a petty cash account of.a ledger was kept with strict accounting of even small withdrawals for nnib expenses.in contrast,every week,thousands were put in an envelope for segal.watkins eventually pled guilty to embezzlement for his part in the transactions.
nnib often paid segal personal credit card the tune of for the years.employees of nnib also performed personal services for him and his family.evidence showed that between and segal had in unreported income for the value of services rendered.
in addition,segal had employees make political contributions with personal checks.nnib then reimbursed them.segal also provided discounts on insurance premiums for political figures.
one influential person helpful to segal was nathaniel shapo.shapo first job out of college was interning for illinois governor,george ryan.shapo next worked for ryan when ryan was the illinois secretary of state.after shapo graduated from law school he worked on ryan gubernatorial campaign.ryan was elected and appointed shapo,who was then six months out of law school with no insurance background,as director of the illinois department of insurance.homer ryan,the governor son,introduced segal to shapo.when the previously mentioned anonymous tipster informed the idoi of nnib pfta deficit,idoi began an investigation.fortuitously for segal,at that time he had a meeting scheduled with shapo.before the meeting,governor ryan called shapo to say he hoped things would go well for nnib,and after,called to ask how the meeting had gone.shapo told ryan that idoi would not do an official examination of nnib because it would kill a million deal segal had in the works.
segal was also involved in providing insurance for the chicago transit authority reconstruction project on its blue line,a contract which nnib was awarded.the contract was no commissions were to be paid to the broker.however,before the contract was signed,segal arranged to have one of nnib subsidiaries broker some of the earn a commission of,an arrangement not revealed to the cta.
finally,in what the context of this be almost a minor infraction,nnib had a policy of writing off customer credits.after a credit owed to a customer had been carried on the books for a while without a payment demand,the credit was simply written off.account executives were trained not to notify customers that they were owed credits.segal personally approved of these,and in the judgment against him he was ordered to pay in restitution to the victims.
segal and nnib have raised a number of issues on appeal.we begin with their claim that they were the targets of vindictive prosecution.they contend that additional charges were leveled against segal and charges were brought against nnib in retaliation for their pursuit of civil remedies against former nnib executives who were cooperating with the government.
before the present criminal case began,segal and nnib filed suit in state court against former nnib executives matt walsh and dana berry,alleging that they violated noncompete clauses in their contracts with nnib.after not because of government charged segal with one count of fraud at that time no charges were filed against nnib.then segal and nnib prepared a draft amended complaint in their civil case and showed it to the prosecutors in the criminal case.the amendment alleged that walsh and berry illegally acquired proprietary information from a former nnib information technologist,who had hacked into the company computer system.when shown the amended complaint,the prosecutor protested that the allegations were not made in good faith and were intended to harass and intimidate walsh and berry,who were expected to be government witnesses.the prosecutor said that if the amended complaint was filed,the government would take it into account in deciding whether to bring charges against nnib and to charge segal under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,et rico.the amended complaint was filed and the grand jury returned superseding indictments doing just that.claiming that the additional charges were the result of vindictive prosecution,segal and nnib moved to dismiss the indictment.the district judge denied the motion without a hearing.
on a claim of vindictive prosecution,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.united states falcon,cir united states jarrett,cir.
the constitution prohibits initiating a prosecution based solely on vindictiveness.f or an agent of the united states to pursue a course of action whose objective is to penalize a person reliance on his legal rights is a due process violation of the most basic sort bordenkircher hayes,d jarrett,at.after a trial,in very limited circumstances,courts have applied a presumption of vindictiveness where prosecutors have pursued enhanced charges after a defendant successfully challenged a conviction and was awarded a new trial.but we stated in jarrett that our precedents do not provide for the application of such a presumption before trial.it remains a fact that a pretrial claim of vindictive prosecution is extraordinarily difficult to prove.to prevail on this sort of claim,jarrett holds that a defendant must affirmatively show that the prosecutor was motivated by animus,such as a personal stake in the outcome of the case or an attempt to seek.id.and it must be recognized,in reviewing a claim of vindictiveness before trial,that prosecutors have wide discretion over whether,how,and when to bring a case.id.as the supreme court has said,a prosecutor should remain free before trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to him to determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution.an initial decision should not freeze future conduct.as we made clear in bordenkircher,the initial charges filed by a prosecutor may not reflect the extent to which an individual is legitimately subject to prosecution.united states goodwin,d.
that the initial charges may not reflect the extent of a defendant wrongdoing is clearly illustrated by the evidence in this case.it is hard to imagine that any prosecutor would fail to find nnib a proper defendant or fail to conclude that segal wrongdoing extended far beyond one fraud count.the evidence supports the indictment,and segal and nnib have not made a showing of vindictiveness.what they point to in an attempt to support the claim is a statement by a prosecutor that if the defendants filed the amended complaint,that would be taken into account in deciding on rico charges and charges against nnib.the prosecutor statement was based,however,on the belief that the allegations in the amended civil complaint were not made in good faith but,to the contrary,were intended to harass and intimidate government witnesses.a prosecutor can not be said to act vindictively by taking into account a defendant perceived efforts to intimidate witnesses.in short,defendants have not made out a claim for vindictive prosecution,nor have they shown sufficient evidence to warrant a hearing on the claim.
next,the defendants claim that there was a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof at trial.this claim fares no better.specifically,they argue that the evidence showed multiple schemes to defraud rather than the single scheme charged in the indictment.we treat such a claim as an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence,and we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states olson,cir.
much summarized,the fourth superseding indictment charged the defendants with a single scheme to defraud and to obtain money and things of value from the pfta an account they were required to maintain for the benefit of customers and insurance carriers by creating the false appearance that payments to nnib would be held in trust for payment of premiums,that credits due customers would be refunded to them,and that the customers would receive honest services.rather than a single scheme,defendants contend that evidence at trial revealed three separate schemes failure to maintain sufficient funds in the pfta writing off of customer credits and collection of a commission from the cta contract for blue line renovation.the district court found that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the fraudulent acts were all part of a single scheme.we agree.
as part of their argument on this point,the defendants characterize the misuse of the pfta account as improper borrowing which did not actually harm anyone or benefit them,certainly a benign interpretation of the facts.and the law is otherwise.the unauthorized use of money from an insurance premium trust account is mail fraud even if the defendant did not gain and the victim did not lose.see united states vincent,cir.the claim that the carriers were at little risk ignores the facts which show that nnib was often late in paying carriers and had to hold checks to carriers until it came up with sufficient funds to send them out.by,nnib had to obtain cash from affiliates to pay premiums and by the end of that year had to borrow million to meet its obligations.in addition,it is hard to see how the defendants can contend that the credit were unrelated to the larger scheme.withholding of credits directly deprived customers of money they were owed and of the honest services of their broker.in addition,it reduced the pfta deficit,at least to some degree.proceeds from other acts,such as the cta fraud,were commingled in the pfta and used for a variety of unauthorized purposes.political contributions and premium discounts to influential people provided segal with cover to prevent discovery of his financial shenanigans.in short,the evidence supports a finding of an overarching scheme involving the misuse of the pfta account,as alleged in the superseding indictment.
we turn next to the claim that the jury instructions regarding mail and wire fraud were improper.the defendants were convicted of fraud for depriving another of the intangible right to honest services pursuant to.they contend that the jury instructions misstated the law and that there is a likelihood that the instructions confused the jury into thinking the defendants could be convicted for violations of illinois insurance law.the defendants further contend that state law is always irrelevant under the statute.alternatively,they say that if state law is relevant,it was overemphasized in the instructions.we review the instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly treat the issues.united states murphy,cir.
the argument that state law is always irrelevant in determining the scope of a fiduciary duty,the breach of which may give rise to a deprivation of honest services,is foreclosed by united states bloom,cir.bloom makes clear that state laws are useful for defining the scope of fiduciary duties,and that what distinguishes a mere violation of fiduciary duty from a federal fraud case is the misuse of one position for private gain.
our conclusion is not altered by our decision in united states thompson,cir.defendants argue that in thompson we rejected the notion that simple violations of administrative rules provide the basis for a mail fraud conviction.in fact,what we said is that there is a potential to turn violations of state rules into federal crimes,at which point we explained that our decision in bloom specifically protects against that danger and remains the governing legal standard.the case against thompson simply did not measure up.
georgia thompson was a state procurement officer who steered a travel contract to the low bidder who made legal campaign contributions to an incumbent governor even though other people involved in the selection process rated a rival company more highly.the theory of the prosecution was that she deprived the state of her honest is,her duty to implement state law the way the administrative code laid it down the private bloom a tiny salary increase of per year and an alleged improvement in her job security for pleasing her superiors who allegedly favored the company she backed.we soundly rejected the government theory.first,we found that thompson already had job security as a civil servant.we then analyzed the case based on the assumption that she received the raise for steering the contract.even using that assumption,we concluded that a raise approved through normal means is not the sort of private gain to which bloom refers.thompson does not change the bloom rules,but merely reinforces them.
furthermore,this case differs from thompson in both degree and in kind.the difference in degree hardly bears million fraud versus a per year civil service raise.but,more importantly,it differs in kind.we concluded that thompson did not act out of private gain,whereas segal knowingly and intentionally misused the pfta for his own very significant private gain.bloom remains the law in this circuit and thompson does nothing to change the result in our case today.
as to the instructions,the jury was told that the defendants were charged with violations of various federal laws,including the mail fraud,wire fraud,and racketeering laws.the instructions specifically state that the defendants are not charged in this case with any state crimes or any violations of state regulations.the jury was told that it should consider the following provisions of illinois law in determining the existence,the scope and the nature of defendants legal and fiduciary duties in this case.the instructions also state 
to find defendants guilty of the charged federal offenses,it is not enough to find that one or both of the defendants violated illinois law or the illinois insurance regulations.your job is to decide whether the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt every element of each federal offense charged in the indictment based on the instructions i give you.even if you believe that the defendants violated illinois law or illinois insurance regulations,you should return a verdict of not guilty if you also believe that the government has not proven every element of the particular charged federal offense you are considering beyond a reasonable doubt.
the defendants proposed an instruction,which was rejected,that the intent necessary to convict was the intent to defraud,not the intent to violate state law.even though the defendants specific proposed instruction was rejected,the jury was instructed that it had to find that the defendants acted knowingly and with intent to defraud.scheme to defraud and intent to defraud were defined without any reference to state law.viewed as a whole,we find the instructions fairly informed the jury that state law was to be used only to determine the nature of the defendants legal and fiduciary duties.
segal also contends that the jury was not properly instructed on the pattern element of the rico charge.he does not claim that the instructions which were given were erroneous or that the evidence was insufficient to prove a pattern.but he wanted an instruction that a multiplicity of mailings or interstate communications may be no indication of the requisite pattern or racketeering activity because each mailing or wire communication was a separate offense and the number of offenses does not necessarily translate into a pattern of racketeering activity.we reject his argument.in this case there are years of false representations in various mail and wire communications.we have upheld convictions in similar circumstances.in united states genova,cir,we said that a jury could conclude that the false mailings in that case were integral to the scheme and that because the scheme extended over several years,a jury also sensibly could find a pattern of racketeering.
in the final challenge to the convictions,defendants claim that their conviction of insurance fraud under b can not stand because nnib was not engaged in the business of insurance as required by the statute.nnib,defendants say,is an insurance broker,not an insurance provider.
the statute defined the business of insurance as the writing of insurance or reinsuring of risks by an insurer,including all acts necessary or incidental to such writing or reinsuring and the activities of persons who act as,or are,officers,directors,agents,or employees of insurers or who are other persons authorized to act on behalf of such persons.f.insurer means any entity the business activity of which is the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risks f.we have previously said that under illinois law,an insurance broker,or agent of the insured is 
o ne who procures insurance and acts as middleman between the insured and the insurer,and solicits insurance business from the public under no employment from any special company,but,having secured an order,places the insurance with the company selected by the insured,or,in the absence of any selection by him,with the company selected by such broker.
american ins.sederes,cir,quoting galiher spates,d.whether the broker is an agent of the insured or the insurer is a question of fact and a lthough an insurance broker typically represents the insured,the broker may also become the agent of the insurer or both parties.capitol indemnity stewart smith intermediaries,d.whether an entity is an agent of the company or the insured is determined by its actions.the evidence in this case is sufficient to support a finding that the defendants were engaged in the business of insurance as that term is broadly defined in the statute to include all acts necessary or incidental to such writing or reinsuring.f.
we now turn to issues involving the forfeiture and restitution orders.restitution was ordered against both segal and nnib in the amount of.they contend the evidence did not support of that amount.the latter amount was attributable to to were written off.of that amount,was alleged to be owed but not paid to waste management.segal presented an affidavit from waste management risk management director saying that the sum was not owed to his company.but given other evidence,it was certainly possible that waste management did know it had credits coming.
we review the district court calculation of restitution for abuse of discretion.united states swanson,cir united states danford,cir.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.olson,cir.the government is required to prove the entitlement to restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.in this case,the credits occurred in,and the findings regarding the victims and the amounts they were owed were based on a report prepared by a government auditor and attached to the government objections to the presentence report.nnib cfo mcnichols testified about a meeting with segal in the fall of that year in which old,unclaimed credits were reviewed.segal gave instructions to write them off.another witness testified that if a client did not ask for the credit for a period of time,it was written off.including these unpaid credits in the restitution order can not be said to have been erroneous.
on the forfeiture issues,an initial matter involves segal claim that he was prejudiced by his absence from the hearing at which a preliminary forfeiture order was entered.we review the issue de novo,united states smith,cir,to determine whether segal due process rights were violated.a defendant has a due process right to be present whenever his presence has a relation,reasonabl
