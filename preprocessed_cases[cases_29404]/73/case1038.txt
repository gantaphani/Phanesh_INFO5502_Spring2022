between november and april,the government filed five tax liens against donna relating to her business for tax years.in,kenney and donna began divorce proceedings.on november,they entered into a property settlement agreement.the agreement was incorporated into the judgment of marriage dissolution,filed on march.under the agreement,donna was required to execute a quitclaim deed to the residence in favor of kenney.she executed this deed on october.
kenney subsequently decided to sell the house.to allow this in light of the government liens against donna share,the government and kenney entered into a agreement.under this agreement,kenney agreed that the liens would attach to the sale proceeds to the same extent as to the house itself.
on july,the house was sold for.the net proceeds were,after payment of the balances due on the notes secured by the deeds of trust and expenses of sale.the government asserted its liens against of those proceeds,or,which was held in escrow by ticor title company of california.
ii.procedural history 
on august,kenney filed a complaint against the government to quiet title in the sale proceeds under.he named ticor as a,but ticor was dismissed from the suit after the sale proceeds and interest earned on the proceeds were taken from escrow and deposited with the clerk of the court.
on june,kenney and the government filed cross motions for summary judgment.kenney contended in his motion for summary judgment that,as a result of his payments on the notes secured by the deeds of trust and the oral agreements with donna,donna interest in the house and proceeds had diminished to zero.as an alternate theory,kenney contended that he was entitled to equitable subrogation against donna interest for the payments he had made on donna share of the notes secured by the deeds of trust.kenney also contended that he was entitled to interest on the payments he made on behalf of donna.
in reply,the government denied kenney entitlement to recovery under his diminishing interest theory,but agreed that he was entitled to equitable subrogation,although this theory had neither been mentioned in the complaint nor had facts consistent with this theory been alleged in the complaint.the government denied that he was entitled to interest on the payments he paid for donna share.the government also arrived at a different calculation of the manner in which the equitable subrogation was to be applied and sought summary judgment for a different amount.

iii.analysis 
kenney diminishing interest theory 
we review de novo a district court partial grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states.united states in currency,cir.
kenney opening brief argues that as a result of the oral agreements to assume donna loan obligations,donna impliedly agreed to proportionately transfer to kenney her equity interest in the house.therefore,kenney would have gained all of donna interest before the tax liens attached.however,in his brief,kenney concedes that this argument has been foreclosed by in re marriage of benson,cal th,d,which held that such agreements are required to be in writing.kenney then raises the new argument that the precedent established by benson suggests that remand is necessary to address the question of what additional rights against the property,if any,kenney may have that are superior to the tax liens.but benson established no new rights,and kenney already had a full opportunity to present legal and equitable theories to the district court.
calculating kenney equitable subrogation award 
the parties do not dispute that kenney is entitled to equitable subrogation for some of the house sale proceeds.to whatever extent kenney is subrogated to the rights of the lenders,he has priority over the government in the disputed proceeds,since the lenders interests are senior to the government liens the method of calculating kenney equitable subrogation award is a question of law.we review de novo the district court conclusions of law.tritchler county of lake,cir.
under the district court method,the net proceeds were divided into equal shares of for kenney and donna,whereupon equitable subrogation was applied to credit kenney from donna share.the represents half of the in mortgage payments that kenney made between and on the two notes after deducting the award from donna share of,there remained in donna share available to satisfy the government liens.
on appeal,the government argues that kenney should be taken from the total net proceeds of,leaving a balance of to divide between kenney and donna,of which donna half would be available to satisfy the government liens.the government approach would increase its portion by.the government argues that because equitable subrogation only allows kenney to stand in the shoes of the lenders,he should be paid from the net proceeds as a lender,before his and donna shares are divided 
as the district court noted,the government method would force kenney to take his subrogation award from proceeds in which he has a half interest,effectively forcing him to pay for half of the amount to which he is entitled.see kenney,d at.
