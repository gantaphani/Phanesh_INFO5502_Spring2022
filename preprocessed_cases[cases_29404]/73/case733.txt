kenneth utecht claims the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment or suppress evidence because the internal revenue service irs used its civil summons power after it decided to recommend that criminal charges be brought against him.he also contends that he should have been permitted to conduct discovery on this issue.in addition,utecht challenges the calculation of his sentence,arguing that certain enhancements should not have been applied and the amount of tax loss was improperly calculated.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
background 
utecht is the owner of a corporation that supplies entertainment equipment,such as pinball machines and pool tables,to bars in central wisconsin.in,utecht added video poker games to his stock and began offering these devices to his customers.video gambling is illegal in wisconsin,so utecht took a number of steps to hide the existence of the video gambling machines and the monies these produced.most relevant to this case,utecht did not report the revenues from the poker devices on his corporate or personal federal income tax returns.
the irs began a civil audit of utecht and his company in.the audit revealed that utecht was spending large amounts of cash over his reported income.the irs investigated and used the cash method of proof to determine what the irs claims are conservative calculations of utecht unreported income.the irs minimum estimates of utecht unreported corporate income are for the year ending june,and for the year ending june.his individual unreported income is for,for,and for.
at some point,the irs civil audit became a criminal investigation for tax fraud.on october,utecht was indicted on five counts of violating by making false statements in his personal and business tax returns and two counts of violating by assisting others in filing materially false returns.utecht filed a not guilty plea on october,and then filed a lasalle motion named after united states lasalle bank,d on december,seeking to dismiss the indictment or suppress evidence because the irs allegedly misused its civil summons power.this motion claims that all of the administrative summonses of the irs seeking records from utecht were issued after the irs had made an institutional commitment to criminal prosecution.utecht did not provide any specific facts to support this assertion in either the motion itself or a supporting brief,but he also filed a discovery motion seeking to require the government to produce all evidence relevant to this defense.on february,the district court,without conducting a hearing,denied utecht lasalle motion because he had not made a prima facie showing of entitlement to relief.the court also denied the discovery motion because the government acknowledged that it was under a duty to provide the kind of material utecht was seeking due to its exculpatory nature,but that the government was unaware of any such evidence.
on february,utecht entered a plea agreement,under which he pled guilty to the five counts of making false statements in his income tax returns and the government dismissed the remaining two counts.this plea preserved the denial of the lasalle motion for appeal.utecht claims that he was unable to consult with his counsel before the plea colloquy on that date,which led him to appear confused when the judge first began questioning him.after a recess where utecht consulted with his attorney,he was able to satisfactorily answer all of the questions posed by the court.in particular,utecht answered that no one had forced him to plead guilty and that he was pleading of his own free will because he was in fact guilty of the offenses.the district court scheduled sentencing for april.
on march,utecht appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw.this motion stated that utecht claimed that his counsel had threatened him into agreeing to file a guilty plea and was not acting in utecht best interests.on april,the court conducted a hearing regarding this motion,where utecht agreed that his counsel should withdraw.the court read various portions of the transcript from the february hearing back to utecht and reminded utecht that he had been under oath when he stated at the previous hearing that he had not been forced to plead guilty,that he was in fact guilty of the charged offenses,and that he was satisfied with his current attorney.utecht then claimed that he had lied at the plea colloquy because he was scared and did not know what to do.the court granted the motion to withdraw,and utecht retained new counsel.
a sentencing hearing was held on april.the government,using the presumptive rates stated in note a to c,argued that the tax loss from utecht failure to report his video gambling income was.utecht presented the testimony of his accountant in contending that this amount should be decreased by the unclaimed depreciation that would have been taken on the poker machines if the accountant had known about these games.the district court rejected utecht argument because of a lack of credible evidence that the depreciations would in fact have been taken.the court also imposed a two level increase for sophisticated concealment,listing a number of ways in which utecht hid his offenses.because the court found that utecht lied at the april hearing,it denied a two level decrease for acceptance of responsibility recommended by the government in the plea agreement.after applying certain other provisions,the court calculated the offense level at and the criminal history category as i,yielding a range of to months.because the amount of tax loss was near the minimum of the range for the base offense level,the court originally stated that it would sentence utecht to months,the lowest amount permitted by the guidelines.the court noted that if it had accepted utecht depreciation argument,it would have sentenced him to the top of the range for an offense level of,which was months and thus longer than the sentence calculated without taking the deductions into account.because the statutory maximum for a single count of violating is three years,the court actually sentenced utecht to months,rejecting the government suggestion that it remain within the guidelines by using concurrent sentences.
ii.discussion 
lasalle motion 
utecht argues that the indictment should have been dismissed or evidence suppressed because the irs abused its civil summons power.in the alternative,he claims that he should have been permitted to conduct discovery into this issue.utecht principally relies on two cases,lasalle,at,which held that under the internal revenue code then in effect the irs lacked the statutory power to issue civil subpoenas for the sole purpose of investigating criminal activity,and united states peters,cir,which involves when evidence obtained through a consensual search should be suppressed.however,utecht precise claim,while closely related to these two lines of authority,appears not to be covered by either of these two cases.utecht apparently argues that the irs circumvented his constitutional rights by using civil summonses,and thus the evidence should be suppressed under the exclusionary rule.
in theory,utecht might have a valid argument for suppression.subject to certain exceptions and qualifications,materials involuntarily seized from a defendant without probable cause and a warrant unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies will be excluded from the defendant trial.see,soldal cook county,d united states place,d.however,the irs need not show probable cause in order to enforce a subpoena demanding that the defendant produce documents for a civil investigation.see united states powell,d united states kis,cir.thus,the government use of civil subpoenas or other kinds of administrative measures that do not require probable cause principally to further a criminal investigation could undermine the fourth amendment probable cause requirement.these constitutional concerns were recognized in abel united states,d,the most relevant precedent for utecht argument.abel explicitly contemplates applying the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained through the bad faith use of administrative
