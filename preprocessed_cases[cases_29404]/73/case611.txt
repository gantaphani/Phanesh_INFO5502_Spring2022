plaintiffs,united dairy farmers,et.udf,appeal from the district court order dismissing udf claims brought pursuant to e,for readjustment of the internal revenue service irs determination disallowing several corporate income tax deductions taken by udf in under and a of the internal revenue code the code.we affirm.
background 
procedural history 
on july,udf filed a federal income tax return for its taxable year,claiming several deductions for ordinary business expenses pursuant to,and abandonment losses pursuant to,of the code.on june,the irs issued a notice of final s corporation administrative adjustment disallowing some of these deductions from udf ordinary income.on november,udf paid to the irs,the amount by which the adjustments increased udf tax liability,and filed a petition for readjustment pursuant to e to refund the payment.on may,following a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the government.see united dairy farmers united states,d.udf now appeals.
on may,this court granted the government motion to take judicial notice of certain discovery responses made by udf during the district court proceedings,namely,that udf admitted that no part of its of environmental cleanup costs was allowable as a bad debt deduction in.
udf is an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in cincinnati.udf manufactures and distributes milk and ice cream products to its own convenience stores,and also sells its products to over wholesale accounts in a region.at issue in this case are three categories of expenses incurred by udf soil remediation,corporate reorganization,and engineering studies.
soil remediation 
in,udf purchased two stores,numbered and,located respectively on properties in columbus and cincinnati,ohio,that contained underground gasoline storage tanks left by prior occupants.on both properties,the tanks had leaked,causing soil contamination.udf purchased the store property for,and the store property for the properties for store and store were each worth less in a contaminated state than the prices paid for them by udf.although udf may not have been aware of the underground tanks prior to the closing date for two purchases,udf was aware,by that time,of soil contamination on both properties 
in,udf spent on soil remediation for the store property.in,udf spent on soil remediation for the store property.in,udf took a deduction under for the cleanup costs.on audit,the irs determined that these costs could not be deducted,which the district court affirmed.
corporate reorganization 
in,udf consisted of the parent company,united dairy farmers,and ten subsidiaries.the lindner family owned udf.robert lindner,owned approximately sixty percent of the company,and his four sons owned,directly or indirectly,the remaining forty percent.udf was a c corporation,the earnings of which are subject to corporate income tax.a corporation that has elected s corporation status is not subject to an income tax,but rather is considered,for tax purposes,to be a entity.
in,udf decided to change its corporate form from a c corporation to an s corporation.during this time,udf made additional changes to its organizational structure.in june of,robert lindner,sold of the outstanding shares in udf to his four sons and to trusts set up for his grandchildren.in october of,udf created a new s corporation,called uncle bud fried dough.
on december,udf and its ten subsidiaries were merged into uncle bud,which then changed its name to united dairy farmers.the udf had the same stock ownership,officers and directors as the udf.the udf,along with its ten subsidiaries,ceased to exist as part of the merger.
in a sworn statement describing the merger,a udf official provided that t he purpose of the merger was to simplify the corporate structure of united dairy farmers,and affiliated companies.the merger was also consummated in order to permit the making of an s election under section a.at.
in january of,robert lindner,sold his remaining interest in udf to his sons.at the conclusion of the june and january sales,each of the four sons controlled of the outstanding shares of udf,either directly or as trustees.
the code imposes a lifo recapture tax on c corporations that make an s corporation election.d.when a c corporation makes an s corporation election,the c corporation files a final tax return.the lifo recapture tax seeks to ensure that a c corporation does not underestimate the actual value of its inventory when filing its final return,by calculating the difference between the value of a c corporation inventory under a method and a method.
the accounting firm of ernst young advised udf that it was subject to a significant lifo recapture tax if it made an s corporation election,which could be avoided by way of a merger.to avoid the tax,udf created a shell corporation,uncle bud fried dough,which had no operations or inventory.udf and its subsidiaries then merged into uncle bud,emerging as a single s corporation and changing its name to united dairy farmers.udf believed that it had avoided triggering the recapture tax because uncle bud,rather than the udf,made the s corporation election.
on its tax return,udf claimed that payments made to ernst young in and totaling were deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses.on audit,the irs found that the payments were part of a corporate reorganization and must be capitalized,which the district court affirmed.
engineering studies 
erlanger,kentucky distribution site studies 
udf main office is in norwood,ohio.in the early,udf began looking for a site on which to build a distribution facility that would house its own cold storage warehouses.between and,udf paid hixson,an engineering and design firm,to assist in locating an appropriate site.hixson examined several potential sites.udf intended to build only one distribution facility.of the spent by udf to examine competing sites,only related to the erlanger,kentucky site that was ultimately chosen.
on its tax return,udf claimed that it could deduct those studies that related to all of the properties other than the erlanger site,which had been abandoned upon deciding to go ahead with the erlanger site.the government contended that udf had engaged in one single project,which was to study available sites and build one distribution facility.because the hixson fees were incurred pursuant to one single plan,the government contended that all of the fees must be capitalized.the district court agreed with the government,finding that the fees were part of an integrated plan to build one distribution center and must be capitalized.
norwood,ohio manufacturing plant studies 
in the,the ice cream room at udf norwood facility was operating at capacity.from late to late,hixson created plans to develop vacant space adjacent to the ice cream room so that production of a microwavable milk shake product,which had become popular,could be expanded.for a variety of reasons,udf decided not to expand the ice cream room.instead,in,udf converted the vacant space into a computer room,and never implemented the development plans.udf paid hixson for its work in and on developing the vacant space.
in,udf retained sieberling to design a cip system that would help separate the raw and pasteurized compartments of a milk manufacturing facility.the cip system is an automated process for cleaning the lines in udf plant.at the same time,sieberling also looked at automating a portion of the ice cream manufacturing process.udf paid sieberling for its work between and.after,udf commissioned a new study from a different consultant to automate the portion of the ice cream manufacturing process that sieberling had been researching.
in,udf commissioned a study from bonar engineering to increase the freezing capacity at the norwood plant,for which it paid.the project was not implemented.
udf also commissioned,for,an advanced handling systems study in,relating to movement of udf products from the factory to retail stores.udf could still implement the study in norwood,but has not done so because its current method of moving products is less expensive.
udf deducted each of the norwood studies in on the theory that it had abandoned the projects in that year and that a loss deduction could be taken under of the code.although several of the expenditures were made several years prior to,udf argued that the event that caused the abandonment,the opening of the erlanger distribution center,occurred in.the government responded that udf had failed to prove that any of the projects were abandoned in.the district court agreed that no losses in connection with these projects could be taken in.the court found that the projects relating to the norwood plant were unrelated to the decision to build a distribution center in erlanger,and thus the erlanger decision did not cause the abandonment of the projects.
discussion 
whether a business expense is capital in nature is a factual determination that this court reviews under a clearly erroneous standard.walters comm r of internal revenue,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous only when the reviewing court,in light of the entire evidence,is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.kennedy comm r of internal revenue,cir.this court reviews a district court conclusions of law de novo.see wooldridge marlene indus,cir.
at the trial court level,udf had the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the irs assessments were arbitrary and erroneous and the amount of deduction to which it was entitled.united states janis,d.a n income tax deduction is a matter of legislative grace and the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer.indopco,comm r of internal revenue,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
section a of the code allows deduction of all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.see a.however,an expense can not be deducted if it is capital in nature,meaning an expense paid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate.a.if an expense were to fall under the language of section a,that section would trump the deductibility provision of section a and the expense would have to be capitalized.thus,in order to be deductible,the expense must both be ordinary and necessary within the meaning of section a and fall outside the group of capital expenditures envisioned by section a.pnc bancorp,comm r of internal revenue,cir emphasis omitted.because the code describes what should be capitalized generally,but enumerates allowable deductions specifically,deductions are strictly construed and allowed only as there is a clear provision therefor.indopco,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
soil remediation 
udf contends that its soil remediation costs were deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under.the government responds that the expenditures resulted in permanent improvements to udf property and thus must be capitalized under.
the fourth circuit has recently addressed the issue of deductibility of environmental cleanup costs under.in dominion resources,united states,cir,the court considered whether environmental cleanup costs were mere repairs,and thus deductible under,or permanent improvements,which must be capitalized under.the court analysis relied on the put versus keep test articulated in estate of walling comm r of internal revenue,cir and focused on the nature of the improvement,rather than on the value added by the improvement.under dominion resources,costs that merely restore value to property that existed prior to deterioration or to a discrete event that damaged the property are deductible as repairs under,while costs that allow the property to be used in a different way must be capitalized under.dominion,at.
the key issue in this case,for purposes of determining whether udf environmental cleanup costs allowed the property to be used in a different way and thus must be capitalized under,is whether udf property conditions are to be evaluated,as udf contends,as of the time prior to contamination of the soil.the government responds that the property should be evaluated as of the time udf acquired it,that is,after contamination,but before remediation,of the soil.
udf contends that under water comm r of internal revenue,wl,and revenue ruling,wl,property conditions should be evaluated as of the time prior to the condition necessitating the expenditure,at.revenue ruling,citing,found that property value should be measured against the property as of the time prior to the condition necessitating the expenditure.whether the standard for measuring property value should apply to this case is a question of law to be reviewed de novo.see wooldridge,at.
the district court addressed revenue ruling,but not,because udf failed to include in its argument below the district court distinguished revenue ruling as a restoration case,in which the taxpayer acquires property in a clean condition,contaminates the property in the course of its ordinary business operations,and then incurs costs in restoring that property to its originally clean condition.thus,the district court reasoned,because udf bought contaminated,rather than clean,property,udf could not rely on revenue ruling.as in revenue ruling,the impaired property condition in,specifically the reduced carrying capacity of a water main caused by the flow of acidic water,arose during the ordinary course of the taxpayer business,at.
basically,udf invites this court to extend and revenue ruling to a situation where a taxpayer,rather than experiencing contamination or impairment of its property in the ordinary course of the taxpayer business,purchases property in an already contaminated or impaired state.we find,for several reasons,that the district court did not err when declining to extend and revenue ruling to this case.
first,to extend and revenue ruling to these facts would be inconsistent with the persuasive reasoning of dominion resources and the two cases on which its new use test primarily relied.see jones comm r of internal revenue,cir jones united states.
dominion resources relied on the two jones cases for the position that improvements which allowed a property to once again be,or allowed property to be put on the market for sale,enabled the taxpayer to do something new with the property,and thus must be capitalized under.dominion,at citing jones,at jones.at.
in jones commissioner,the property at issue had been deemed unfit for habitation,and thus unprofitable,prior to the taxpayer acquisition of the property.jones,at.the taxpayer then undertook to put the building into such condition as would permit it again to be used and be productive of income.id.at.by describing the property as again being usable and profitable,the court implied that the property had,at some prior time,been usable and profitable.significantly,however,the fifth circuit in jones did not evaluate the property as of the time of its earlier useful and profitable condition rather,the court evaluated the property as of the time the taxpayer acquired it,when the property was unfit for habitation.
similarly,the district court in jones united states considered property which had been inherited by the taxpayer in,subject to the life interest of the taxpayer father,who died in.jones.at.the property had fallen into a state of disrepair between and.id.after the father death,the taxpayer incurred significant expenses to improve the property.
under udf theory,the district court in jones should have evaluated property value or use from the time prior to the period of disrepair.however,the court in jones,when finding that the improvements were essential to put the property in rentable condition,rather than merely keep the property in such condition,considered property condition as of the time prior to the improvements,not as of the time prior to the event giving rise to the improvements,namely,the prolonged period of disrepair.see id.at.simply,the state of the improved property prior to the condition necessitating the expenditure,at,was not considered in either of the jones decisions.
in addition,the court in dominion resources noted that the environmental cleanup in that case lifted the property out of what was essentially a condition of uselessness.dominion,at.the property at issue,however,had not always been useless it had previously been used as a power plant.id.at.further,the court in dominion resources noted that part of the taxpayer environmental cleanup was of contamination that had been present since the original construction of the asset.dominion,at a t least some of the asbestos containing materials removed from the power plant were used in the original construction of the power plant on the property.
we find one core distinction between,on the one hand,the restoration cases of and revenue ruling,and on the other,dominion resources and the jones cases.in the restoration cases,there was no relationship between the improvements and any defect that existed at the time the taxpayer acquired the property.in dominion resources and the jones cases,there was such a relationship.because the question of whether an expense is capital in nature turns on the special facts of each case,indopco,at,we are hesitant to fashion a blanket rule as to the particular time at which property must be evaluated for determining whether that property has been put to a new use.however,we are able to derive one clear principle from dominion resources and the jones cases when a taxpayer improves property defects that were present when the taxpayer acquired the property,the remediation of those defects are capital in nature.thus,under dominion resources and the jones cases,when a taxpayer has improved defects that were present when the taxpayer acquired the property,does not apply.
because udf has relied exclusively on the restoration cases,udf offers no comparison of its use of the two ohio properties before and after the soil remediation thus,udf offers no argument that its use of the property was unchanged before and after the improvements.accordingly,udf has not met its burden of clearly showing its right to the claimed deduction.indopco,at.
moreover,as noted in dominion resources,large environmental cleanup costs,relative to property value,cast doubt on a taxpayer claim of merely making incidental repairs that only keep the property in an ordinarily efficient operating condition.dominion,at quoting.in this case,udf claimed cleanup costs of nearly for two properties that it purchased for,collectively.in contrast,the public utility in deducted costs to clean and line less than one percent of its water mains,which the court characterized as a very minor part of the taxpayer operation,at.
for the above reasons,we find that the district court decision not to extend and revenue ruling to cover a taxpayer seeking a deduction for environmental cleanup costs as repairs under,when that taxpayer did not contaminate the property in the ordinary course of its business,was not in error.
as noted by the government in its brief on appeal,when taken together,dominion resources,and revenue ruling can be harmonized in a coherent framework.that is,three elements must be satisfied for a valid deduction under for environmental cleanup costs first,the taxpayer contaminated the property in its ordinary course of business second,the taxpayer cleaned up the contamination to restore the property to its state third,the cleanup did not allow the taxpayer to put the property to a new use.in dominion resources,the taxpayer did not satisfy the third element,because the cleanup allowed the taxpayer to put the property to new use as a real estate development.dominion,at.in this case,failure to satisfy the first element is sufficient for rejecting udf soil remediation claim.
udf argues alternatively that it was entitled to deduct the remediation expenses as bad debt expenses,because the prior owners had a legal obligation to reimburse udf for the expenses.udf did not raise this argument below.the fact that the issue newly raised on appeal requires or necessitates a determination of facts is generally deemed good reason to refuse consideration of the issue for the first time in the appellate court.taft broad.united states,cir.moreover,this court has taken judicial notice of udf concession of the bad debt issue during discovery.
udf waiver and concession of the issue aside,the bad debt argument would be unavailing for udf even on the merits,simply because udf has offered almost no argument,even assuming that udf is owed a legally enforceable debt,as to how that debt became worthless in.a taxpayer may deduct any debt which becomes worthless within the taxable year.a.to establish a bad debt reduction in,udf must show that a legally enforceable debt was owed to it by a third party and during that debt become worthless,uncollectible.roth steel tube commissioner of internal revenue,cir.a taxpayer may not of its own act render a collectible debt uncollectible,charge off the debt as worthless,and then deduct it from income for purposes of taxation.id.at.
udf only argument regarding how a debt owed to it became worthless in,made in its reply brief,references the testimony of robert lindner,who claimed that udf could not determine,or could not afford the cost of determining,which of the owners had actually caused the soil damage.lindner testified that counsel advised udf that without engaging in costly investigation,the opportunity to successfully win the case against the owners would be difficult.at.this testimony does not establish that the debt at issue,assuming udf is owed a debt,became worthless in.the requisite evidentiary showing for worthlessness is that a legal action to enforce payment would in all probability not result in the satisfaction of execution on a judgment.the above testimony only describes the prospects for obtaining a judgment as difficult,and that assessment is given only in the context of an investigation that would not be costly.udf offers no assessment,outside of that limited context,of the prospects for obtaining a judgment.we find udf bad debt claim waived,conceded,and meritless.
corporate restructuring 
udf argues that its accounting expenses should have been deducted,rather than capitalized,because the expenses only related to the making of an s election,achieved by means that obtained an additional,tax benefit,being the avoidance of the lifo recapture tax.
the district court found that under indopco,the accounting fees related to a corporate reorganization,and thus must be capitalized.udf attempts to distinguish indopco by arguing that indopco applies only to reorganization expenses that produce significant benefits beyond the year in question,indopco,at,rather than reorganization expenses that merely produce a benefit.moreover,udf argues that under wells fargo commissioner of internal revenue,cir,indopco only addressed costs that were directly related to the transaction which produced a long term benefit,and that costs only indirectly related to such a transaction need not be capitalized.wells fargo,at.udf contends that because its accounting fees were only indirectly related to its corporate reorganization,under wells fargo those fees are deductible.alternatively,udf contends that because the accounting fees were only attributable to the investigatory stage of its corporate reorganization,the fees were deductible investigatory costs.id.at.
first,udf investigatory stage argument is unavailing.the eighth circuit in wells fargo agreed with the irs position that any investigatory expenses which the final decision to engage in a capital transaction must be capitalized.id.at.a final decision on a capital transaction is made when the question of whether to go ahead with the transaction is made id.the udf merger occurred on december.udf offers no analysis of when the final decision for that merger occurred.nearly all of the ernst young invoices for the fees at issue were dated in.even if these invoices reflected services rendered prior to the final decision to reorganize,it is udf burden to provide such analysis,which udf has not done.
second,as to the indirectly related work itself,even if this court were to adopt the eighth circuit reading of indopco,the relationship between the employer and its salaried employees in wells
