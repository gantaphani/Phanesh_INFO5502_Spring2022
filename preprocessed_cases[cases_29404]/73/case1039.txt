kpmg llp and sidley austin llp sidley appeal the district court remand of this case,which had been removed from the superior court of the state of california for the county of orange orange county superior court pursuant to removal of actions relating to arbitration agreements under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.they argue that the district court erred when it remanded after it determined that an arbitration agreement had become unenforceable because the arbitrator the national association of securities dealers,had declined jurisdiction over the parties.
we have jurisdiction and we reverse.
background 
paul reddam,paul reddam trust,clarence ventures,llc,and zed corporation collectively reddam assert that kpmg,presidio advisors llc,sidley and deutsche bank ag formed a joint venture in which they agreed to develop,implement and market certain complex programs the programs,which were designed to reduce the taxes of those who adopted the programs.the detailed nature of the programs is not relevant to this action.suffice it to say that,as relevant here,reddam was to purchase shares of deutsche bank stock and that required the use of a securities broker.reddam was referred to deutsche bank securities investments dbsi,a subsidiary of deutsche bank,for that purpose.
reddam became involved because upon selling a company,ditech funding,for a substantial sum reddam desired to minimize income tax liabilities.reddam,on the advice of kpmg and sidley,did adopt the programs.as contemplated by the design of the programs,reddam did use dbsi as a broker and entered into customer agreements for that purpose.each of those customer agreements contained an identical arbitration clause which provided that 
all controversies which may arise between us concerning any transaction of construction,performance,or breach of this or any other agreement between us shall be determined by arbitration.any arbitration under this agreement shall be determined pursuant to the rules then in effect of the national association of securities dealers,as the undersigned you may elect.if the undersigned fails to make such election,then you may make such election.
alas,the programs did not have the desired tax avoidance effects,and reddam incurred substantial tax liabilities as a result reddam then filed this action against kpmg,sidley,deutsche bank and others in the orange county superior court.reddam did not bring an action against dbsi,although dbsi was mentioned in the complaint.deutsche bank removed on the ground that the action related to the arbitration agreement with dbsi.see.deutsche bank,along with kpmg and sidley,then moved to compel arbitration.reddam responded with a motion to remand on the basis that the district court lacked removal jurisdiction as to deutsche bank and that,at any rate,the claims against kpmg and sidley should be remanded.the district court determined that it did have removal jurisdiction and that deutsche bank,kpmg and sidley could all enforce the arbitration agreements 
before the nasd,reddam deleted all reference to dbsi from its complaint,asserted that dbsi was not a party,and suggested that the nasd did not have jurisdiction.the nasd agreed with reddam and refused to take jurisdiction over the arbitration because,as it said,no named party was a member or associated person of the nasd.
the parties then returned to the district court where reddam moved for remand because the nasd was no longer available.kpmg and sidley argued that the district court should exercise its authority under to appoint a substitute arbitrator rather than remanding.however,the district court agreed with reddam and declared that the claims are no longer subject to arbitration because the nasd had declined to proceed.thus,the district court remanded the case to the orange county superior court and refused to stay its order pending appeal.
this appeal by kmpg and sidley followed 
standards of review 
we review de novo the district court determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action.kelly fleetwood,cir.
we also review de novo the district court determinations about the scope and validity of the contractual dbsi arbitration clauses.see mediterranean,ssangyong,cir.similarly,we review de novo the district court determination about whether the issues remain arbitrable.see simula,autoliv,cir.
jurisdiction 
reddam argues that we do not have jurisdiction to review the remand to the orange county superior court because a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.d.we disagree.
it is a commonplace that an order that is actually issued pursuant to c,which provides for remand when there is a defect in the removal or when there is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,can not be reviewed by us.see,kircher putnam funds trust,d abada charles schwab,cir pelleport investors,budco quality theatres,cir.but despite its apparently comprehensive language,d does not mean quite what it says.where the remand order is not based on defective removal or lack of subject matter jurisdiction at the time of removal c does not apply and the d restriction does not apply either.as the supreme court has put it,only remand orders issued under c and invoking the grounds specified therein are immune from review under d.thermtron,hermansdorfer,d.moreover,we are not bound by the district court characterization of the basis for its remand order.see abada,at kunzi pan am.world airways,cir district court did not specify basis,but it was apparent that the basis was c.
in the case at hand,the district court expressly declared that it had jurisdiction in the first place.it never deviated from that declaration.this case is unlike cases where a district court later determines that there was no jurisdiction ab initio in this case,the district court determined that a later nasd refusal to made the arbitration provision unenforceable as to the parties then before it.
we recognize that the district court referred to c when it decided the removal issue,but that is not dispositive.on the face of its order,the district court explained that it would remand because h ere,based on the decision by the nasd to decline jurisdiction,the claims are no longer subject to arbitration.it follows,therefore,that the sole basis for federal jurisdiction is no longer present.thus,the court has no basis for jurisdiction,and must remand the case to state court.emphasis added.that plainly indicates that the later occurring events were the basis for the decision.that can not be a basis for a c remand order.see davis uaw,cir,petition for cert.filed,poore,at sparta surgical,at.
therefore,we have jurisdiction to review the propriety of the remand order 
discussion 
at root,the district court remanded because the nasd refused to act as the arbitrator.that,argued reddam,meant that the issues could not be arbitrable at all.the argument,accepted by the district court,raises two questions.first,did the agreement amount to a choice of forum clause second,if it did,did the refusal of that forum to conduct the arbitration mean that no arbitration at all could go is,was the choice of forum clause integral the district court answered both questions in the affirmative.we do not.
was there a choice of forum clause 
as we have already pointed out,the arbitration clause used in the customer agreement does state that a ny arbitration under this agreement shall be determined pursuant to the rules then in effect of the national association of securities dealers,as the undersigned you may elect.but what does that mean in deciding,we must,no doubt,apply the usual principles of contract interpretation.see wolsey,foodmaker,cir.
we have noted that state law generally applies to the construction of arbitration agreements.see id.if so,the agreement in question chooses the law of the state of new york.but we need not resolve the question of whether state law,or federal law should apply to a construction of the forum selection provision before us.whichever body of law is applied,it is our task to determine and effectuate the intent of the
