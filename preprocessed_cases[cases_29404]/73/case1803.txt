for over a century,texas has taxed the premiums collected on title insurance policies sold here for almost as long,texas has imposed an additional retaliatory tax when necessary to equalize the tax burdens borne by texas and title insurance companies this system has operated with minimal change until a few years ago when the comptroller reinterpreted the retaliatory tax statute in a way that sharply increased the tax liability of certain title insurers.
two of those foreign insurers challenge the comptroller revised interpretation arguing that it contravenes the plain meaning of the controlling statutes and violates the insurers equal protection rights under the united states and texas constitutions.we disagree and,accordingly,affirm the court of appeals judgment.
background 
first american title insurance company first american and old republic national title insurance company old republic are title insurance companies doing business in texas.first american is and issues texas policies directly and also through independent agents old republic is and issues policies in texas only through independent agents.title agents are distinct business entities,usually corporations or limited liability companies,that engage in title insurance work independent of title insurance companies.
the texas department of insurance tdi prescribes the premium that insurers may charge policyholders for title insurance when a title insurer issues policies through an independent agent,tdi also prescribes how the insurance company and the agent should divide the premium during the period relevant to this case,tdi allowed agents to keep of premiums collected from policyholders and remit the remaining to the insurer texas insurance law subjects the full amount of the premium to a premium tax for logistical simplicity,the title insurers remit the full amount of tax on these premiums to the state all title insurance companies operating within the state,or not,are subject to the premium tax 
besides this premium tax,texas also imposes a retaliatory tax on foreign title insurers like first american and old republic if their home states impose more burdensome taxes,fees,and other obligations on texas title insurers selling insurance there than texas imposes on foreign title insurers selling insurance here the principal purpose behind retaliatory taxes,as the united states supreme court explained when it upheld their constitutionality,is to promote the interstate business of domestic insurers by deterring other states from enacting discriminatory or excessive taxes against foreign insurance companies retaliatory taxes are ubiquitous,having been a common feature of insurance taxation for over a century,and they exist in every state except hawaii 
first american and old republic remitted premium and retaliatory taxes to the comptroller,calculating the retaliatory tax owed based on the full amount of premium taxes they remitted to the state.thus,they included not only the premium tax paid on the of the premium they earned but also the premium tax paid on the of the premium earned by independent agents.however,in the comptroller adopted a new rule that recognized the agent responsibility for taxes due on the agent portion of the premium.this change resulted in a new method of calculating the retaliatory tax.the comptroller reasoned that because title insurers keep only of premiums collected on policies and pay only of the premium remitting the entire to the title insurers could count only that when figuring the amount of retaliatory tax owed.the result of this new math the foreign insurers premium tax liability dropped compared with what other states imposed on texas insurers,thus substantially increasing the foreign insurers retaliatory tax liability.
the comptroller interpretive change required first american to pay an extra in retaliatory taxes and interest for tax years and,which first american paid under protest.old republic paid a total of in retaliatory taxes for tax year based on the new method,also under protest.the insurers then filed separate lawsuits in district court to recover the excess tax payments incurred as a result of the comptroller new interpretation of the retaliatory tax statute.in each case,the insurer and the comptroller filed for summary judgment in each case,the trial judge awarded summary judgment to the comptroller without elaboration.both insurers appealed their appeals were consolidated and the court of appeals affirmed,holding that the comptroller revised interpretation of the statutes was reasonable and constitutional 
ii.standard of review 
the insurers argue the comptroller interpretive change offends the plain meaning of the relevant insurance code provisions and also violates the equal protection clauses of the united states and texas constitutions.since cases should be decided on narrow,grounds whenever possible,we begin with the statutory claim,examining the statutes as they existed in tax years,the time of this dispute.
the construction of a statute is a question of law we review de novo when interpreting a statute,we look first and foremost to the plain meaning of the words used if the statute is clear and unambiguous,we must apply its words according to their common meaning in a way that gives effect to every word,clause,and sentence and ordinarily,when divining legislative intent,the truest manifestation of what lawmakers intended is what they enacted,the literal text they voted on.
the insurers argue that,because the retaliatory tax provision is penal in nature,we should strictly interpret its language and resolve any ambiguities against the comptroller.the supreme court has cast doubt on whether retaliatory taxes are penal in nature the principal purpose of retaliatory tax laws is to promote the interstate business of domestic insurers their ultimate object is not to punish foreign corporations doing business in the state.furthermore,although we have applied a stricter construction to tax statutes in the past,we have done so only when doubt about the statute application still remains after dominant rules of construction have been applied.one of those dominant rules of construction requires us to give serious consideration to the c onstruction of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement.the retaliatory tax statute states that the comptroller shall impose the retaliatory tax the premium tax statute provides that the commissioner or comptroller,as appropriate,may adopt rules,regulations,minimum standards,and limitations that are fair and reasonable as may be appropriate for the augmentation and implementation of this article.because the legislature charged the comptroller with enforcement of these statutes,we will uphold her interpretation so long as the construction is reasonable and does not contradict the plain language of the statute.
iii.discussion 
first american and old republic contend that the comptroller interpretation of the retaliatory tax scheme improperly excludes a portion of the premium tax that they are obligated to pay under the premium tax provision,ultimately resulting in artificially high retaliatory taxes.article of the insurance retaliatory tax provision operative at the time this dispute the comptroller to impose a retaliatory tax on an insurance company when the financial burden imposed on texas insurers by a foreign state exceeds the aggregate of taxes and other obligations directly imposed on foreign insurers by texas the parties agree that the principal obligation directly imposed on title insurers in texas is the premium tax.
a.the premium tax provision 
article of the insurance code requires that e ach title insurance company receiving premiums from the business of title insurance shall pay to the comptroller a tax on those premiums as provided in this article.this tax applies to all amounts defined to be premium in this chapter,whether paid to the title insurance company or retained by the title insurance agent.the chapter defines a premium as the total amount of premiums received for the taxable year on title insurance written on property located in this state.title insurers doing business in texas are required to file an annual tax return and remit the total amount of tax due directly to the comptroller title insurance agents do not file returns or pay premium taxes directly 
the state of texas facilitates the collection of the premium tax on the premium retained by the agent by setting the division of the premium between insurer and agent so that the insurer receives the premium tax due on the agent portion of the premium and remits it to the state 
the parties agree that article taxes all premiums earned from the provision of title insurance,whether earned by an insurance company or an insurance agent,but the parties disagree on whom the tax is imposed.the insurers argue that they are the only parties obligated by article to pay the premium tax,so the full amount of their payment should be included in the retaliatory tax calculation.the comptroller responds that although the insurance company remits the entire premium tax,the insurer merely acts as a conduit for of the premium tax,which is actually paid by the insurance agent.according to the comptroller,because the insurance company remits of the premium tax to the state as an administrative mechanism and in economic reality bears only of the tax burden,the insurer can only include of the tax in its calculation of taxes directly imposed.thus,the dispute hinges on whether the full premium tax is directly imposed on title insurance companies under the retaliatory tax provision.
the comptroller application of the premium tax to insurance agents is reasonable and in harmony with the statute plain meaning.as the insurers point out,article requires the insurance company,not the insurance agent,to report and pay the premium tax on all premiums earned from the provision of title insurance but the statute also recognizes that agents receive premiums,and it explicitly taxes those premiums the premium tax is levied on all amounts defined to be premium in this chapter,whether paid to the title insurance company or retained by the title insurance agent.
nevertheless,the insurers contend that the premium tax,while applied to all premiums earned,is not imposed on the agent because t he premium tax is levied on all amounts defined to be premium such tax being in lieu of the tax on the premium retained by the agent.taken in isolation,this phrase arguably exempts insurance agents from paying the premium tax.but the full context of subsection b yields a different understanding.the very next sentence provides that the state facilitates the collection of the premium tax on the premium retained by the agent by dividing the premium between insurer and agent so that the insurer receives the premium tax due on the agent portion of the premium.the state would have no need to ensure that insurance companies receive the agent portion of the premium tax if the tax were not imposed on the agents.rather,in lieu of creating a separate tax collection system for insurance agents,the legislature implemented an integrated system of taxation with the insurance company acting as the central collection point the premium tax applies to the premium earned by the agent,and article requires the agent to bear the burden for the agent portion of the taxes the insurer receives the premium tax due on the agent portion of the premium and remits it to the state.
article describes the insurer role as a entity relied on by the state to facilitate the collection of the premium tax from the insurance agent.at most,the only compulsion or obligation required of the insurer with regard to of the premium tax is to write a check drawn on money remitted by the the end of the day,the insurer bank account is not negatively impacted.this administrative burden of acting as a conduit for the agents tax payments does not rise to the level of a direct imposition and therefore can not be counted as a burden meriting inclusion in the retaliatory tax calculation.
penalties for noncompliance with the premium tax statute 
however,the insurers point out that article requires more of title insurance companies than writing a check the statute further states that a title insurance company failing to pay all taxes imposed by this article is also subject to article of this code.article requires insurance companies to pay their taxes prior to receiving a certificate of authority to do business in the state the statute also authorizes the comptroller to institute a collection action against insurers that underreport gross premium receipts thus,the insurers argue that even if insurance agents are taxed on their portion of premiums,insurers alone run the risk of article sanctions for failing to pay the full amount of the premium tax.
the comptroller alleviated this risk by implementing new policies along with her new interpretation of the tax statutes.these policies allocate responsibility for nonpayment of premium taxes according to the respective tax burdens borne by insurance agents and insurance companies.in,the comptroller published a new policy making agents directly liable to the comptroller if they fail to remit their portion of the premium tax to insurers.this understanding was further solidified in,when the comptroller added the following provision to insurance tax rule 
title insurers and title agents are both subject to the premium and maintenance tax on their proportional share of the premiums and are separately liable for the tax if the insurer fails to remit the tax due on the agent portion 
under this new rule,title insurers can not be held liable for nonpayment of the agent portion of the premium will face statutory consequences only if they fail to remit their own portion of the premium tax.
the insurers argue that rule contradicts section of article,which requires insurance companies to pay the premium tax,and section of article,which clarifies that the premium tax applies to all premiums earned.contrary to the insurers claims,rule does not alter the payment mechanism set up by article under the plain terms of the rule,separate liability applies if the insurer fails to remit the tax due on the agent portion.thus,rule comports with article insurer remits the premium tax for both the insurer and the clarifying that each party will be held liable only for the portion of premium tax that it owes.
c.the retaliatory tax provision 
nevertheless,the insurers contend that even if the full amount of the premium tax is not directly imposed on them,the comptroller interpretation must still fail because it conflicts with various portions of the retaliatory tax provision.
the retaliatory tax provision operative at the time this dispute arose,article of the insurance code,allows the comptroller to impose a retaliatory tax on an insurer 
w henever by the laws of any other state or territory of the united states any taxes,licenses,fees,fines,penalties,deposit requirements or other obligations,prohibitions or restrictions are imposed upon any insurance company that is organized in this state and licensed and is doing business or that may do business in such other state or territory which,in the aggregate are in excess of the aggregate of the taxes,licenses,fees,fines,penalties,deposit requirements or other obligations,prohibitions or restrictions directly imposed upon a similar insurance company of such other state or territory doing business in this state 
the insurers argue that the retaliatory tax provision does not just require insurance companies to compare the taxes imposed by texas and their home states,the provision also requires them to compare other obligations directly imposed by this state according to the insurers,the comptroller does not give them credit for all of the burdens they bear namely,the comptroller excludes from consideration the obligation to report and remit the full amount of the premium tax to the state.
the last clause of subsection a provides a clearer context for the meaning of other obligations the aggregate of taxes,licenses,fees,fines,penalties or other obligations imposed by this state pursuant to this article shall not exceed the aggregate of such charges imposed by such other state.here,the legislature replaced the laundry list of taxes,fees,and other obligations with the words such charges,indicating that the other obligations meant to be included in the retaliatory tax calculations are financial charges directly imposed on title insurers.thus,the administrative responsibilities of filling out forms and remitting the full premium tax do not qualify as other obligations under article 
d.a response to the dissent 
the insurers arguments center on one underlying theme the comptroller interpretation improperly credits foreign title insurers with a lower premium tax payment than what they actually pay,which results in an improperly high retaliatory tax burden.the dissent frames the issue differently the comptroller interpretation compare s other states taxes on total premiums with texas tax on only the insurer share,resulting in an unfair comparison as equal as is to.the dissent argument is premised on an understanding that the retaliatory tax scheme was originally based on a comparison of the taxes on total premiums imposed by texas and other states,and that the retaliatory tax is only fair if it takes into consideration the burdens placed on the insurance industry both the insurer and associated agents comparing the tax burden imposed on the entire title insurance industry in texas and a hypothetical other state,the dissent concludes that the comptroller has artificially lowered the effective premium tax rate in a way that ensures that all foreign insurers will pay retaliatory taxes,thus generating additional revenue for the state 
we can not agree with the dissent portrayal of the retaliatory tax scheme because it fails to comport with the express language of the retaliatory tax statute.the dissent accuses us of employing a myopic view of the statute that gives credence to an artificial allocation of the premium tax burden based on payor but article is clear the payor matters.the dissent assertion that t his tax was based on the burden imposed on the insurance industry ignores the statute plain language the relatively unchanged language of the retaliatory tax statute instructs the comptroller to compare the tax burdens imposed upon any insurance company from texas operating elsewhere with the tax burdens directly imposed upon a similar insurance company from elsewhere operating in texas if a texas insurer operating outside the state bears a heavier tax burden under this comparison,then the comptroller shall impose a retaliatory tax upon any similar company so long as the taxes imposed by texas on an insurance company from do not exceed the taxes imposed by another state on a similar insurance company from texas thus,the retaliatory tax is imposed only on insurers based only on the other tax burdens borne by insurers.the comptroller does not,and can not,compare the taxes on total premiums,take into consideration the taxes paid by agents,or look to the burden borne by the industry as a whole because the legislature set the focus of the retaliatory tax scheme on a single insurance company.
once we employ the same focus dictated by the the burdens borne only by title insurance dissent numbers balance out.under the dissent hypothetical,a texas insurer operating pays in premium taxes the insurer also pays of premium tax and of retaliatory tax.thus,the retaliatory tax fulfills its role as an equalizer between similarly situated title insurers.furthermore,when we focus on the proper tax foreign insurer effective premium tax rate remains the statutorily designated rate as for the tax burden borne by the foreign agent,a texas agent operating in texas would pay the same amount of premium tax,and the foreign operations of either texas or foreign agents are not at issue because article neither aggregates an agent tax burdens nor imposes the retaliatory tax on agents.the dissent expresses concern that the comptroller interpretation of the tax scheme would impose retaliatory tax on an insurer from a state with a lower premium tax rate than texas,but this concern is misplaced.article does not impose a tax based on comparative tax rates it does so based on comparative tax burdens.if,as in the dissent example,another state applies a lower tax rate to a larger tax base in a way that requires a texas insurer to pay more total taxes,then the retaliatory tax would properly apply to equalize the total taxes paid.
the dissent also argues that the comptroller interpretation fails to comply with the directive of article to impose the retaliatory tax in the same manner and for the same purpose as the taxes imposed on texas insurers by foreign states.specifically,the dissent asserts that the comptroller scheme compares the insurer premium tax burden in texas with the full premium tax burden imposed in other states.the record flatly contradicts this assertion the retaliatory tax worksheet filled out by first american provides for gross premiums earned,and that california,first american home state,splits the premiums between insurers and a reduction for p remiums retained by underwritten title companies,what texas would call title agents.thus,the t otal premiums subject to tax are only those premiums retained by the title insurance the comparison the dissent calls for.not all states split the tax burden between insurers and agents like texas and california,but as we have already noted,article charges the comptroller with assessing the retaliatory tax based on the burdens imposed on the insurer alone.if other states choose to impose the full premium tax on the insurer,then the comptroller is not she is only following the statutory comparing that tax to the tax imposed on the insurer premium in texas.the comptroller current interpretation may represent a change from past practice,but it is squarely in line with the legislative amendments that first established the premium tax collection system,which is all we require 
in sum,first american and old republic have failed to show that the full amount of the title insurance premium tax is directly imposed upon them for purposes of article.the comptroller interpretation of the retaliatory tax scheme comports with the plain language of the premium and retaliatory tax provisions of the insurance code therefore,we reject the insurers statutory claim.
iv.equal protection rights 
first american and old republic further argue that the comptroller interpretation of the retaliatory tax scheme violates their equal protection rights under the united states and texas constitutions.t he federal analytical approach applies to equal protection challenges under the texas constitution,so resolution of the federal equal protection claim will also resolve the state equal protection claim.we conclude that the comptroller interpretation of the relevant statutes does not violate the insurers equal protection rights.
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment forbids a state from deny ing to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.however,the supreme court has recognized that most laws differentiate in some fashion between classes of persons therefore,unless a classification jeopardizes exercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic,the law will be upheld as long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest this review requires us to answer two questions does the challenged legislation have a legitimate purpose and was it reasonable for the lawmakers to believe that use of the challenged classification would promote that purpose 
as we already noted,the supreme court previously upheld a retaliatory tax provision similar to article,holding that the tax provision had a legitimate purpose of promoting domestic industry by deterring barriers to interstate business.the insurers argue that,unlike the california statute upheld by the supreme court,the comptroller application of the texas retaliatory tax scheme neither promotes domestic title insurers nor deters foreign taxation rather,the texas law has the purpose and effect of raising revenue at the expense of foreign title insurers.to support their argument,the insurers point out that the comptroller new interpretation raises nearly three times more retaliatory tax revenue than the prior interpretation and taxes the premium portion twice once at the stage and once at the stage.according to the insurers,these changes raise revenue but do not deter other states from taxing insurers because foreign states would have to reduce premium tax rates by as much as to match the premium tax burden imposed on insurers by texas law as currently interpreted by the comptroller.the insurers contend that other states will likely respond not by lowering premium tax rates but by against texas insurers.
we disagree that these effects necessarily demonstrate an impermissible purpose underlying the comptroller construction of the retaliatory tax scheme.the comptroller did not develop this scheme independently as a plan as we have already discussed,the comptroller interpretation is consistent with the statutory scheme developed by the legislature.furthermore,the comptroller construction of the retaliatory tax system does not impermissibly discriminate against foreign title insurers.all title insurers operating in texas,whether domestic or foreign,are subject to the premium tax division.moreover,foreign title insurers are not taxed merely because they are foreign they are taxed only if their home states impose higher financial obligations on texas insurers than texas imposes on foreign insurers.the comptroller application of the retaliatory tax scheme may result in an increase in retaliatory taxes collected,but the increase depends just as much on premium tax rates charged by other states as it does on the comptroller crediting title insurers with only of the total premium tax payment.therefore,the comptroller interpretation exerts some downward pressure on foreign tax rates,regardless of how other states choose to respond.the comptroller implementation of the retaliatory tax scheme may have unforeseen or unintended results,but the courts are not empowered to the wisdom of state policies.our review is confined to the legitimacy of the purpose.the comptroller interpretation demonstrates a legitimate state purpose of protecting texas title insurers by pressuring other states to keep their premium taxes low.
as for the second prong of equal protection analysis,the challenged interpretation will survive if we conclude that the comptroller rationally could have believed that the retaliatory tax would promote its objective.the insurers do not challenge this point,and we have no trouble concluding that the comptroller rationally could have believed that reducing the premium tax burdens texas imposes on title insurers operating here would encourage other states to impose lower financial obligations on texas title insurers operating elsewhere.the dissent disagrees,stating that there is no rational basis for comparing of another state premium taxes with of texas premium taxes,but again,the correct comparison is between the taxes imposed on insurance companies,not insurance premiums or insurance industries.the equal protection clause guarantees that similarly situated similarly situated tax schemes or similarly situated treated similarly.the comptroller interpretation of the retaliatory tax scheme equalizes the tax burdens borne by title insurers in a way that is rationally related to a legitimate state purpose therefore,we reject the insurers federal and state equal protection claims.
conclusion 
the comptroller implemented the premium and retaliatory tax provisions in a way that comports with the plain meaning of those statutes without offending the united states or texas constitutions.we therefore affirm the court of appeals judgment.
texas,like most other states taxes gross premiums for insurance of risks and property in the state and like every other state but hawaii texas imposes an additional retaliatory tax on insurers doing business in texas whose home states tax more heavily than texas does,all other things being equal such retaliatory taxes have been a common feature of insurance taxation for over a century and though they obviously impinge on interstate commerce,they do not implicate the implied limitation on the power of the states to interfere with or impose burdens on interstate commerce contained in the commerce clause of the united states constitution because congress removed all commerce clause limitations on the authority of the states to regulate and tax the business of insurance when it passed the act.but the fourteenth amendment equal protection guaranty does not permit states to impose more onerous taxes or other burdens on foreign corporations than those imposed on domestic corporations,unless the discrimination between foreign and domestic corporations bears a rational relation to a legitimate state purpose.t he principal purpose of retaliatory tax laws is to promote the interstate business of domestic insurers by deterring other states from enacting discriminatory or excessive taxes.the united states supreme court has held that this purpose is legitimate and that a retaliatory tax rationally related to it does not violate equal protection 
texas retaliatory tax,first enacted in and consistently applied until this case,falls squarely within the supreme court holding.but in this case,the comptroller has reinterpreted the statute as it applies to title insurers,multiplying the tax due and transforming it into a penalty on nonresident insurers doing business in texas.this sudden departure from the settled application of the retaliatory tax was not prompted by any legislative revision of the statute or any change in retaliatory taxation in other states.the only apparent purpose for the comptroller new position is to generate revenue from nonresident title insurers simply because they are nonresident.in my view,the comptroller has misconstrued the tax statute so that it now violates equal protection.because the court disagrees,i respectfully dissent.
when insurance is sold through an agent,the insurer and the agent share the premium revenue.for title insurance in texas,the revenue division is set by the commissioner of insurance during the times material to this case,that division has been to the insurer and to the agent for decades,the retaliatory tax in texas and other states has been determined by comparing 
ordinarily,everything is bigger in texas,and though total is now smaller here,taxes have increased.the comptroller new math,as the court refers to it,multiplies the retaliatory tax and discriminates against insurers doing business in texas.for example,suppose an insurer from a state with a premium tax rate does business in texas,where the rate is.on a premium,the total tax would be in the other state and in texas.requiring the insurer to pay a retaliatory tax on its texas business equalizes the tax burden on the two insurers business in each other state.each insurer and its respective agents would,together,pay in taxes and collect in revenue.but in the comptroller view,the retaliatory tax is determined by the difference between the other state premium tax and the insurer share of texas premium tax difference of.hence,the insurer together with its respective agents pays in taxes and collects in revenue.the comptroller new math increases the title insurer tax burden merely because the insurer is.
by artificially reducing the size of texas premium tax,the comptroller new position dictates that texas impose retaliatory taxes even when insurers hail from states imposing lower premium taxes than texas.suppose an insurer from a state with a premium tax does business in texas.on a premium,the comptroller would compare the insurer share of the texas tax to the premium tax in the other state and assess a surcharge.in essence,for purposes of applying the retaliatory tax,the comptroller has reduced texas gross premiums tax rate by,from to.virtually every other state taxes gross premiums,but none has so low a rate.the tax now applies to all insurers doing business in texas merely because they are not domestic companies.the retaliatory tax,thus construed,no longer operates to discourage excessive taxation in other states it now operates to discourage foreign insurers from doing business in texas.
the comptroller change in position transforms the retaliatory tax,long a means of equalizing tax burdens on domestic and foreign insurers doing business in texas,into a penalty against insurers.the comptroller new position is not based on any change in the law.the relevant statutory provisions have been materially the same for decades.the retaliatory tax statute imposes a tax on a foreign insurer if the foreign insurer state of organization imposes a tax on a similar domestic insurer that is more than the tax this state directly imposes on the foreign insurer.the retaliatory tax must be impose d and collect ed in the same manner and for the same purpose as the tax on the insurer in the other state these provisions,recodified in were enacted in and derived from the first retaliatory tax statute enacted in the premium tax statute imposes a tax on all premiums from the business of title insurance regardless of whether paid to a title insurance company or retained by a title insurance agent to be paid by the insurer these provisions,also recodified in and amended in were enacted in and derived from prior premium tax statutes,the first one dating to 
the comptroller argues that the premium tax on the agent share of premiums is not directly impose d on the insurer within the meaning of the retaliatory tax statute,even though the insurer must remit the tax.in furtherance of its view,the comptroller in adopted a rule limiting an insurer liability for the premium tax to the amount due on its share the comptroller acknowledges that no one took this position in the forty years after the phrase directly imposes was adopted in the statute,or in the ten years after the premium tax imposition and collection provisions were detailed in.the comptroller position not only discards a settled,application of statutory provisions frequently revisited and left substantively unchanged by the legislature,it contradicts the purpose of a tax in place since at least.this tax was based on the burden imposed by other states on the insurance industry and not on an artificial allocation of the tax burden between insurers and their agents.
the court concludes that the comptroller reinterpretation of the statute is due deference under tarrant appraisal district moore while an agency initial interpretation of a statute is not carved in stone an agency decision to depart from a longstanding interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference unless the agency provides some reasonable explanation for the change this is particularly so where the agency earlier interpretation is accompanied by legislative acquiescence 
but even if the comptroller interpretation of directly imposed were entitled to more serious consideration,the plain language of the rest of the statute makes clear that the new interpretation is unreasonable the statute clearly requires the comptroller to make comparisons.section instructs the comptroller to impose and collect the retaliatory tax in the same manner and for the same purpose as the foreign insurer state tax.the court insists that the retaliatory tax focuses on the insurance company to the exclusion of agents,but it is myopic to view a tax on gross revenue as affecting only some of the participants in the business who must share that revenue.one can not assume that insurers and agents in other states do not share premium revenues merely because texas has a statute specifying how they must do so.indeed,one must assume that insurers and agents expect to be paid and to share in premium revenue.if only the insurer share of the texas premium tax is to be considered,then that share must be compared to the insurer share of the premium tax in the other state.but by comparing only the insurer share of the texas premium tax to another state undivided premium tax,the comptroller imposes and collects the retaliatory tax in a different manner and for a different purpose than the other state in imposing and collecting its tax.
there is another equally important reason to reject the comptroller new interpretation it makes no sense.in western southern,the supreme court acknowledged that a state has a legitimate interest in promoting interstate commerce by deterring other states from enacting discriminatory or excessive taxes.but there is no rational basis for comparing of another state premium taxes with of texas premium taxes to determine whether the other state taxes are excessive.texas legitimate interests in deterring excessive taxation by other states are not served by retaliating whenever another state tax would exceed texas tax on some of the participants,or whenever another state employs a different accounting method for calculating and assessing premium taxes.nor is it served by retaliating against states whose total premium taxes are lower than texas.under the comptroller new construction,the retaliatory tax provisions have been transformed into a means for blatant and unapologetic discrimination against insurers and parochial protectionism.
the court asserts that the comptroller interpretation is consistent with the statutory scheme developed by the legislature but the fact is that the comptroller and others who administered the retaliatory tax for decades thought a contrary interpretation was required by the statute.the court adds that t he comptroller did not develop this scheme independently as a plan but no other basis for the scheme has been advanced,and none is apparent.the comptroller sudden multiplication of the retaliatory tax can not serve the legitimate state purpose of discouraging excessive taxation in other states because even when a state tax rate is a fraction of the rate in texas,insurers from that state must,in the comptroller view,pay a retaliatory tax.
i agree with the court that whether other states may react in a way that is ultimately unfavorable to texas insurers,or whether the comptroller position may have other unforeseen or unintended results,is none of our business.but it is certainly our business to ensure that persons similarly situated are afforded the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.the court concludes that the retaliatory tax remains an equalizer between similarly situated title insurers.the comptroller treatment of texas title insurers doing business in other states and title insurers doing business in texas is as equal as is to.
i would hold that the comptroller position is not permitted by the text of the retaliatory tax statute or by the fourteenth amendment.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
