on june,a grand jury returned an indictment against defendant charging him with one count of conspiring to defraud the irs and to structure currency transactions to evade irs reporting requirements,in violation of five counts of submitting false federal income tax returns,in violation of and three counts of structuring a currency transaction to evade irs reporting requirements,in violation of a and d.on june,a jury found defendant guilty on the first seven counts,but did not find him guilty on two of the three structuring counts.on october,the district court sentenced defendant using the sentencing guidelines to calculate the applicable sentencing range.the district court calculated the amount of defendant tax loss by a preponderance of the evidence.kosinski.at.the district court found that the offense level corresponding to defendant tax loss amount was nineteen and that the applicable sentencing guideline range was an imprisonment term of thirty to months.the district court awarded defendant a downward departure resulting in an offense level of eighteen and an imprisonment range of to months.defendant was sentenced to two concurrent thirty month imprisonment terms and was also ordered to pay a assessment,a fine,and incarceration costs.
defendant appealed his conviction to this court on numerous grounds.see kosinski.at.on march,this court affirmed defendant conviction,but vacated the sentence because the district court used the sentencing guidelines as mandatory and erroneously sentenced him based on facts not found by the jury,in contravention of united states booker,d.kosinski.at.the court held that defendant sentence violated booker because defendant was sentenced based on the amount of tax loss determined by the district court,rather than an amount found by the jury.id.at.the court found that w ithout the district court factual determinations of tax loss,the offense level would be,corresponding to a sentence of to months.id.this court remanded the case to the district court for resentencing.
on september,the district court held a resentencing hearing.at the resentencing hearing,the government argued that defendant offense level should be eighteen.the district court asked the government what the offense level would be if the court was limited to what was charged and the jury found.in its response,the government conceded that the offense level would be ten,but argued that after booker the sentencing court can still go ahead and calculate a guideline range and guideline sentence,but its only advisory.with respect to the tax loss amount,the district court stated 
i have read the sixth circuit opinion the court certainly did say that the district court method of computation of the tax loss was not clear error,clearly erroneous,plain error.it was okay,but then the sixth circuit noted that under booker the district court could consider that tax loss amount because the jurors were asked to find that specific amount.
emphasis added.the district court declined to calculate or consider defendant tax loss amount.the district court concluded that it did not have authority to depart from the sentencing guidelines and took offense level ten,as a starting point and found that anything within the sentencing guideline range of six to months would be reasonable.the district court sentenced defendant to three years of probation supervision,with the condition that the first six months be served in a halfway house and that the second six months be served under home confinement.the government objected at the resentencing hearing arguing that the sentence was unreasonable.
on november,defendant counsel filed a motion to correct defendant sentence.at a hearing held on december,the district court acknowledged that it went over the guidelines,which provide for a fine,by sentencing defendant to a fine.the district court also clarified its sentence 
defendant counsel i want to say that the court actually decided that if the offense level were an or it were a,that you were using the factors in.
the court that absolutely true.and have not reread the entire transcript.but i would hope that i had said that i give great weight to the guidelines and that a starting point,and then i use the factors,and then i come to a result.
defendant counsel the result is,however,within the guidelines,and 
the court i understand that.but as far as i understand booker,obviously if it within the guidelines,as i understand booker,it per se reasonable.but it does mean that a sentence outside of the guidelines is per se unreasonable.
emphasis added.the district court entered its judgment on october.the government filed a timely notice of appeal on november.
on appeal,the government argues that defendant sentence is unreasonable.more specifically,it contends that the district court improperly concluded that it could not consider a tax loss amount that was not found by the jury in calculating defendant sentencing guideline range.the government maintains that the district court was required to determine the amount of tax loss and to use it in sentencing,and asserts that the district court improperly followed the instructions of the sixth circuit remand in calculating defendant offense level and sentencing range.
