factual and procedural background 
maginnis,his wife and three sons won a total prize of million in the oregon state lottery in july.they divided the prize among themselves,with maginnis and his wife each receiving million and their sons dividing the remainder.maginnis million share was payable in equal installments of,paid to maginnis via an annuity policy purchased by the state of oregon.
when maginnis won his prize,oregon law did not permit a lottery winner to assign his right to future lottery payments to a third party.in,oregon amended its lottery statute to allow a lottery winner to petition a state court for the right to assign future payments.a b.under the current statute,a lottery winner may sell his right to future winnings if he petitions the state court for an order approving the assignment and ensures that the assignment complies with a number of statutory precautions.
in january,maginnis assigned his right to receive the remaining installments of his lottery prize to the woodbridge financial corporation for a lump sum payment of.maginnis successfully petitioned the oregon court to approve his assignment to woodbridge.maginnis reported the payment on his joint tax return for as ordinary income and paid the full amount of tax liability shown on that return.he also reported the lump sum payment as taxable income for the purposes of state income tax.
maginnis and his wife filed an amended federal return in for the tax year,seeking a refund of.they claimed that they had realized capital gain,not ordinary income,on the lump sum payment from woodbridge.the irs paid this amount back in full,including interest.
on march,the united states filed a complaint in the district of oregon,asserting that the irs had erroneously granted maginnis and his wife a refund for the tax year.the government claimed that the sale of the lottery right produced only ordinary income,and that maginnis was judicially estopped from claiming otherwise because of prior arguments in a separate oregon state case involving the oregon income tax,in which he characterized the lump sum payment from woodbridge as ordinary income both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the government motion,noting that capital gains treatment is not appropriate here because no asset appreciated.emphasis removed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm the district court.

discussion 
whether the sale of a lottery right by a lottery winner is a capital gain under the internal revenue code is a novel question of statutory interpretation.fundamental principles of tax law lead us to conclude that maginnis assignment of his lottery right produced ordinary income.
a capital gain or loss is generated when there is a sale or exchange of a capital asset.a capital asset,in turn,is property held by the taxpayer whether or not connected to his trade or business,subject to several statutory exceptions not relevant here.
the definition of capital asset has,however,never been read as broadly as the statutory language might seem to permit,because such a reading would encompass some things congress did not intend to be taxed as capital gains.for example,an employee right to be paid for work to be performed in the future is for some purposes property not subject to any of the enumerated exceptions in,but it is doubtful that congress would intend the sale of a right to future employment income to be taxed as a capital gain.see bittker lokken,federal taxation of income,estates and gifts.ed hereinafter bittker lokken.if the statutory term capital asset is defined too broadly,taxpayers might use simple accounting devices to convert all ordinary income into capital gains.see furrer comm r,cir.
to avoid this problem,in a series of cases that have established what is commonly known as the substitute for ordinary income doctrine,the supreme court has narrowly construed the term capital asset when taxpayers have made transparent attempts to transform ordinary income into capital gain in ways that undermine congress reasons for differentially taxing capital gains.n ot everything which can be called property in the ordinary sense and which is outside the statutory exclusions qualifies as a capital asset because 
the term capital asset is to be construed narrowly in accordance with the purpose of congress to afford treatment only in situations typically involving the realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time,and thus to ameliorate the hardship of taxation of the entire gain in one year.

the court has instructed that lump sum consideration that seems essentially a substitute for what would otherwise be received at a future time as ordinary income may not be taxed as a capital gain.comm r lake,d see also holt comm r,cir the nature of the right to receive future income as ordinary income does not change into capital gain by the mere receipt of a lump sum in lieu of such future payments.
however,there are limits to the substitute for ordinary income doctrine,as well.see united states dresser,cir.many assets,including common stock,are typically valued on the basis of the present value of their future income stream,so an approach that took the substitute for ordinary income doctrine too far,and defined the term capital asset too narrowly,would hold that no sale of an asset that produces revenue,even common stock,could be taxed as a capital gain.see id.at the only commercial value of any property is the present worth of future earnings.because we must eschew both an approach that could potentially convert all capital gains into ordinary income and one that could convert all ordinary income into capital gains,we must make judgments as to whether the conversion of income rights into payments reflects the sale of a capital asset that produces a capital gain,or whether it produces ordinary income.unless and until congress establishes an arbitrary line on the otherwise seamless spectrum between substitute for ordinary income transactions and conventional capital gain transactions,the courts must locate the boundary case by case,a process that can yield few generalizations because there are so many relevant but imponderable criteria.bittker lokken at.
maginnis lottery right was his right to future payments from the state of oregon in return for his lottery win.we hold that this right is not a capital asset within the meaning of and,and that maginnis therefore received ordinary income from its assignment two factors are crucial to our conclusion,although we do not hold that they will be dispositive in all cases maginnis did not make any underlying investment of capital in return for the receipt of his lottery right,and the sale of his right did not reflect an accretion in value over cost to any underlying asset maginnis held.we have previously described the importance of these two factors,noting that t he essence of a capital transaction within the tax statutes and decided cases is that the sale or exchange of an asset results in a return of a capital investment coupled with realized gain or loss as the case might be which accrues to the investment over a certain period of time.holt,at 
concerning the first factor,the supreme court has indicated that the substitute for ordinary income doctrine will apply when there is no evidence of a sale of an underlying capital investment.gillette,at.holding that the right to determine the use to which certain facilities were put was not something in which the taxpayer had any investment and thus was not a capital asset giving rise to a capital gain.lake,at.we do not see here any conversion of a capital investment.hort comm r.holding that a substitute for ordinary income occurred when t he consideration received was not a return of capital.similarly,the court has stressed the importance of the second factor,instructing that the substitute for ordinary income doctrine should apply to a transaction manifestly not of the type which gives rise to the hardship of the realization in one year of an advance in value over cost built up in several years,which is what congress sought to ameliorate by the provisions.gillette,at.emphasis added.
underlying investment of capital 
maginnis made no underlying investment in exchange for a right to future payments.first,maginnis does that the purchase of a lottery ticket is a capital investment,the return from which should be treated as a capital gain.holt,at treating such capital investment coupled with realized gain or loss as the essence of a capital transaction within the tax statutes.lottery prizes are treated by the tax code as gambling winnings,which are taxed as ordinary income see d comm r groetzinger,d characterizing a state lottery as public gambling,in a case treating gambling earnings as ordinary income.the lottery prize would have been taxed at ordinary income rates,reflecting the revenue code general position that gambling winnings are not treated as capital gains.therefore,the purchase of a lottery ticket is no more an underlying investment of capital than is a dollar bet on the spin of a roulette wheel.
that maginnis sold his right to accrued lottery winnings to woodbridge for a lump sum payment did not somehow create a capital investment.under oregon law a person already entitled to lottery winnings could petition for a judicial order to convert his lottery winnings into an alienable property interest.see.a b.absent such a judicial is,without already having won the could not sell his right to receive future accrued income from his lottery prize.because maginnis had no right to an alienable lottery interest until he had already won the lottery,and because he made no capital investment before winning the lottery,no investment of capital was involved in creating the lottery right.therefore,the assignment of the lottery right is better understood as the pure assignment of a gambling winning,rather than as the assignment of a capital asset,the sale of which could create a capital gain.
change in value over cost 
because maginnis did not make any capital investment in exchange for his lottery there was no cost in the relevant sense to maginnis for the right to receive accrued future payments from the oregon money he received for the sale of his right can not plausibly be seen as reflecting an increase of value above the cost of any underlying capital asset.although the amount a purchaser such as woodbridge might pay for the right might be subject to some uncertainty,there was no sense in which the purchase price for the lottery right compensated maginnis for an increase in value over cost.therefore,the sale of maginnis lottery winning to woodbridge lacks the requisite realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time that is typically necessary for capital gains treatment.gillette,d.
c.other considerations 
there is no other reason to believe that maginnis lottery right assumed the characteristics of a capital asset such that he could recover capital gain from its assignment.indeed,maginnis sale of his lottery right is almost indistinguishable from the paradigmatic situation in which the substitute for ordinary income doctrine removes a right to future income from the definition of a capital asset,which occurs when a taxpayer assigns his right to future income from employment to a third party for a lump sum.see furrer,at holding that a lump sum payment for the termination of an agency relationship is ordinary income.as explained above,the revenue code treats gambling winnings essentially as ordinary income,see groetzinger,at,and maginnis has done no more than sell his gambling winnings to a third party.
moreover,treating the sale of maginnis lottery right as a capital gain would reward lottery winners who elect to receive periodic payments in lieu of a direct lump sum payment from the state,and then sell that payment right to a third party.those who would do so would receive a tax advantage as compared to those taxpayers who would simply choose originally to accept their lottery winning in the form of a lump sum payment.nothing in the revenue code compels the creation of such a dichotomous system for the taxation of lottery winnings.the purpose of narrowly construing the term capital asset under the substitute for ordinary income doctrine is to protect the revenue against artful devices that undermine the revenue code standard treatment of ordinary income and capital gains.lake,at.that is precisely what maginnis has attempted here.
maginnis argues that whatever our analysis of the nature of his transaction,the substitute for ordinary income doctrine should not apply,and that the sale of his lottery right should be treated as the sale of a capital asset.he claims that the substitute for ordinary income doctrine has been limited to specific fact situations,none of which is present here,and that we must therefore read broadly and construe the sale of his lottery right as the sale of a capital asset.
maginnis claims that arkansas best comm r,d,mandates this approach.he reads arkansas best as having largely invalidated the substitute for ordinary income doctrine,and having limited its application to two circumstances only first,carve out transactions in which the taxpayer retains some underlying interest in the property sold which we discuss below and second,rights to future income from personal services,to not covered by the substitute for ordinary income doctrine at all but fall within exclusion of inventory from the definition of a capital asset.other sales of property,he suggests,must be treated as sales of a capital asset and therefore treated as capital gains for the purposes of.
despite maginnis argument,it is certain that arkansas best did not affect the substitute for ordinary income doctrine constraints on the construction of the term capital asset.arkansas best dealt with a different subject entirely it rejected the motive test,under which lower federal courts had excluded some property acquired or held for a business purpose from the definition of capital asset under.at.the court expressly held that its decision did not affect the way in which the substitute for ordinary income doctrine modifies the term capital asset.as the court explained 
petitioner mistakenly relies on cases such as united states,d,gillette,lake,and hort in which this court,in narrowly applying the general definition of capital asset,has construed capital asset to exclude property representing income items or accretions to the value of a capital asset themselves properly attributable to income,even though these items are property in the broad sense of the word this line of cases,based on the premise that property does not include claims or rights to ordinary income,has no application in the present context.

regardless of arkansas best,we shall address the underlying merits of maginnis argument about carve out transactions.maginnis claims that because he sold his entire right to the lottery payments or a vertical slice,instead of merely a carve out right to an income stream or a horizontal slice,in which he would have retained som
