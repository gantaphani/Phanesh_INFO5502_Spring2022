factual background 
in the fall of,the internal revenue service began a civil audit of,a texas corporation that operated a topless dance club under the name caligula xxi.jerry payne,an attorney,became the owner of,in as compensation for legal services for the,gerhard helmle.the irs agent conducting the audit,colin levy,suspected fraud and referred the case to the irs criminal investigation division.the investigation of payne was assigned to special agent batista.
in october,batista and levy arrived unannounced at payne law offices to inform payne of the initiation of the investigation.at that time,batista produced a summons for business and financial records associated with.in response,payne declared his willingness to cooperate fully and to provide the requested information in a timely manner.batista was satisfied with the sincerity of payne stated intent to cooperate.
in december,batista began to contact seeking information regarding payments to payne.for example,on december,batista contacted the texas lawyers insurance exchange to inquire about a payment it had made to payne.batista conceded that he could have obtained this information from payne and that doing so would not have prejudiced his investigation.at trial,batista admitted to making other contacts as early as december,and that he began to inquire into allegations of payne involvement with illegal drugs.although payne voiced concern over these contacts,he and batista agreed on january,to a timetable for the voluntary production of,records.a week later,batista and levy came to payne office to review and microfilm documents.batista testified that,as of this date,he was happy with payne performance,cooperation,and his efforts to produce needed information.
from october of to july of,payne sent numerous letters to batista requesting him to clarify the issues under investigation.the gist of these letters was that payne wanted to know the scope of the inquiry so that he could provide batista with relevant information in a manner that would preserve the confidentiality of the investigation.in his correspondence,payne repeatedly conditioned his continued cooperation on batista agreeing to more specifically define the scope of his inquiry.batista never responded to payne requests for a listing of specific areas of concern.on march,batista and his supervisor swayzine fields met with payne at payne office.during this meeting,batista requested any work papers for payne and personal tax returns.payne agreed to provide them.this was the first and only documented request for information relating to payne personal tax returns,although batista testified that he made a previous oral request for the papers.payne later informed batista that he did not have any work papers for those returns.
by march of,batista apparently decided that payne did not sincerely intend to cooperate with the investigation.at trial,batista initially could not recall any specific incident that led him to this conclusion,but he eventually testified that the tone of payne letters gave him the sense that payne would not fully disclose information without the imposition of untenable conditions.the district court concluded that batista had no rational explanation for this conclusion.payne,d at.in any event,batista accelerated the pace of his investigation during and after march.in that month,batista sent out ten summonses to various corporations and banks seeking bank statements,canceled checks,deposit slips and deposited items,loan and related records.during and after that month,batista interviewed employees and officers of,in person,introducing himself as a criminal investigator with the irs who was investigating payne possible violation of criminal revenue laws.batista asked some of the employees and some of payne relatives if they knew whether payne used or sold illegal drugs.batista contacted payne clients and former clients mostly by mail,issuing summonses for copies of any retainer agreements,expense reimbursement statements,or cancelled checks of payment.batista also spoke with some of these clients over the telephone and interviewed some in person.during the course of the investigation,batista issued a large number of summonses and letters to that disclosed on their face that payne was under criminal investigation,and he revealed that fact during his interviews.
in march of,batista terminated his investigation of payne and recommended the case to the justice department for criminal prosecution.for the first time,an attorney for the justice department informed payne of particular issues of concern,and in response payne provided information that led the united states to conclude that criminal prosecution was not warranted for all the matters recommended by batista.in payne was indicted on two counts of violating relating to tax fraud and three counts of violating relating to failure to file tax returns.the trial court dismissed the charges,and a jury acquitted payne of the charges.
following the criminal trial,the irs completed its civil examination and issued payne a notice of deficiency for and individual income taxes and civil fraud penalties.the united states tax court entered a decision determining payne individual income tax for those years,and sustaining the fraud penalties.payne commissioner,cch.this court reversed.payne comm r of internal revenue,cir.the panel found that the tax court erred in ruling that the united states had proven fraud by clear and convincing evidence and thus erroneously relied on the statutory fraud exception to prevail over the applicable statute of limitations.id.
payne then filed this suit in the district court,seeking damages from the united states and several irs agents for their actions in conducting the investigation.the district court dismissed all defendants other than the united states,and all claims other than the wrongful disclosure of tax information claim.this claim was tried to the court,and at the conclusion of the trial,the court held as follows batista made a large number of contacts in the course of his investigation of payne without first determining whether the information sought was otherwise reasonably available batista did not consider himself under any obligation to seek necessary information from payne batista disclosed numerous items of return information to these third parties,including the fact that payne was subject to a criminal investigation there was no evidence that any of the disclosures of return information were necessary to obtain the information batista sought batista disclosures did not result from a good faith but erroneous interpretation of the applicable statutory provision batista improper disclosures damaged payne law practice batista grossly abused his discretion in making the numerous contacts without first affording payne the opportunity to provide the needed information,and in particular by inquiring about payne involvement with illegal drugs and the united states litigation position was unreasonable given that batista made no determination as to whether the information he sought was otherwise reasonably available.

iii.statutory framework 
a creates a right of action against the united states if a federal employee or official knowingly or negligently violates the confidentiality provisions of.section states in relevant part 
returns and return information shall be confidential,and except as authorized by the internal revenue code,no officer or employee of the united states shall disclose any return or return information obtained by him in any manner in connection with his service as such an officer or an employee or otherwise under the provisions of this section.
a.return information is defined broadly,to include in relevant part,a taxpayer identity and whether the taxpayer return was,is being,or will be examined or subject to investigation b a.the united states concedes that batista disclosed return information.the united states does not incur liability for a violation of,however,if the violation results from a good faith,but erroneous,interpretation of section.b.in the case of a finding of liability,c provides for the award of statutory or actual damages,punitive damages,and attorneys fees.
k creates a safe harbor for irs agents carrying out certain investigative duties,and allows for disclosures as follows 
an internal revenue officer or employee may,in connection with his official duties relating to any criminal tax investigation disclose return information to the extent that such disclosure is necessary in obtaining information,which is not otherwise reasonably available,with respect to the correct determination of tax,liability for tax,or the amount to be collected or with respect to the enforcement of any other provision of this title.such disclosures shall be made only in such situations and under such conditions as the secretary may prescribe by regulation.
the secretary has promulgated regulations pursuant to its authority.see k a b.
as k has been construed by case law,an irs agent may disclose return information during an investigation in order to obtain information,provided three requirements are met the information sought is with respect to the correct determination of tax,liability for tax,or the amount to be collected or with respect to the enforcement of any other provision of the internal revenue code.the information sought is not otherwise reasonably available and it is necessary to make disclosures of return information in order to obtain the additional information sought.diandre united states,cir see also barrett united states,cir barrett i.
iv.points of error 
the united states raises five points of error.it argues that 
the district court erred as a matter of law by concluding that batista was obliged to consider payne as a source from whom necessary information might be otherwise reasonably available.according to the united states,the taxpayer under investigation is an inherently unreliable source of information,and thus is never a reasonably available source of information.
even if the taxpayer might be a source from whom information is otherwise reasonably available,the district court erred in finding that payne was such a source here.further,the district court erred in finding that the disclosures were not necessary to obtain the information sought.
if batista did violate,the district court erred in finding that batista violation was not the result of a good faith,but erroneous,interpretation of that section.
the district court erred in awarding punitive damages.
the district court erred in awarding and calculating attorneys fees.
payne the district court damage award,contending that he had provided sufficient evidence to sustain an award of million in actual damages and million in punitive damages.
v.the taxpayer as reasonably available source of necessary information 
the united states argues that irs special agents need never consider the taxpayer under investigation as a source from whom information is reasonably available.reviewing the statute and regulations promulgated under its authority,as well as the court decisions construing k,we find no convincing authority for this rigid proposition.
according to the regulations,disclosures are authorized only when the necessary information can not be reasonably obtained in accurate and sufficiently probative form or in a timely manner,and without impairing the proper performance of official duties.k a b.whether a disclosure is authorized depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.id.rather than foreclosing the possibility that the taxpayer could ever be a source from whom necessary information may reasonably be obtained,the regulations reflect the nature of the inquiry.
while we find no previous case that addresses the precise argument made by the united states here,this court decision in barrett i implicitly considers the taxpayer a reasonably available source of necessary information.there,the court reversed a summary judgment in favor of the irs,finding a fact issue as to whether certain contacts were necessary.noting evidence that the irs had free access to the taxpayer bank records,the court concluded that some disclosures,perhaps all,might have been avoided by reviewing and analyzing those bank records.barrett i.at.
in kemlon products development united states,cir,modified on pet.for rehearing,cir,this court reversed the granting of a permanent injunction prohibiting the irs from disclosing the taxpayer return information to its customers.the injunction was held to have violated the act,a,because the taxpayer had not proved irreparable harm from the contacts.id.at.the court then suggested that even if irreparable harm had been established,in all likelihood the united states could defend a lawsuit on the basis of k.the underlying issue involved the value of certain patents,and the court noted the affidavit of the investigating agent that direct contact with the taxpayer customers would be necessary to ensure candid responses.id.at.the tenor of this dicta indicated that the panel was evaluating the facts in that particular case and not endorsing an inflexible rule 
the united states argues that it has the duty to corroborate a taxpayer admissions and to investigate all reasonable leads to eliminate deposits.see smith united states.united states hiett,cir united states boulet,cir.both of these tasks,the united states asserts,may only be accomplished through contacts.to the extent that necessary evidence,corroborating or otherwise,is not reasonably available from sources provided by the taxpayer,k obviously authorizes contacts.however,even corroborating evidence might be available from bank or other records to which a taxpayer voluntarily grants access,thus negating the necessity of contacting.at any rate,in this case batista was not merely corroborating information previously provided by payne.further,we find no contradiction between the need to eliminate nontaxable sources of income while still considering the taxpayer an available source of information,because i n the typical case,the taxpayer gives the irs leads to possible nontaxable sources.hiett,at see also boulet,at.
we do not hold that the taxpayer is always such a fruitful and reliable source of information that irs agents may never approach for necessary information.we hold only that such a determination must be made in light of the facts and circumstances of the case,and that the taxpayer cooperation legitimately forms part of the inquiry.
vi.necessity for contacts 
the united states attacks the district court finding that,on the facts and circumstances of this case,payne was a reasonably available source of information and that the disclosures were unnecessary in order to obtain the information sought.the district court found that payne efforts to cooperate were sincere and made in good faith,and that batista in contrast made little or no effort to use this cooperation to advance his investigation.the court then made a blanket finding of no evidence that any disclosure of payne return information was necessary.we must evaluate this finding,however,only to the extent that it led to any damages to payne.in barrett united states,cir barrett iii,this court explained that the type of damages which must be proved by the taxpayer depends on the nature of the violation by the irs.thus,if the violation is simply an unnecessary contact,an such as payne would have to prove that he lost business because of his clients concerns over privacy issues.on the other hand,a violation occasioned by disclosure of the criminal nature of the investigation requires proof that payne lost business because his clients thought him to be a tax cheat.id.at.it is clear from the district court opinion and the record that payne proof of damages was of the latter type.accordingly,we focus on the finding that batista regularly revealed the criminal nature of his investigation of payne when making contacts,since payne damages can only be sustained on the basis of these disclosures.
this court has previously held that it was unnecessary for an irs agent to disclose the criminal nature of an investigation when sending circular letters to the public requesting information regarding the taxpayer.see barrett united states,barrett ii.applying this standard,the district court here found that batista disclosure of the criminal nature of his investigation was not necessary to obtain the information sought.the district court specifically found that batista issued a large number of administrative summonses and letters to which disclosed on their face that payne was under criminal investigation.d at.while the partial dissent considers this finding to be clearly erroneous,it is not directly challenged by the united states in this appeal.instead,the united states argues that the circular letter cases do not apply to live,interviews.as discussed infra,ultimate resolution of this issue will require further factual findings.
vii.good faith erroneous interpretation of law 
the united states argues that even if batista made unauthorized disclosures,he did so pursuant to a good faith,but erroneous,interpretation of.in connection with a violation,this circuit evaluates good faith under an objective standard.see huckaby united states of treasury,cir barrett ii,at.a reasonable irs agent can be expected to know statutory provisions governing disclosure,as interpreted and reflected in irs regulations and manuals.an agent contrary interpretation is not in good faith.id.applying this test,the district court found that a reasonable irs agent would not have violated the express provisions contained in sections and and in the irs manuals and regulations.payne,d at.the district court further explained that batista initially claimed that although he was familiar with the statutes and the irs regulations he was not required to try and obtain the needed information from the taxpayer first before with.batista eventually admitted that he had violated express provisions regarding disclosure.id.accordingly,the court found that batista disclosures were not made in good faith.
following the district court decision,we had occasion to examine the application of the huckaby standard.in gandy united states,cir,we held that two irs agents who had disclosed return information the taxpayer identity and the fact of criminal investigation to customers of a nursery had acted in good faith.the disclosures at issue were oral,made to customers the agents interviewed following distribution of a circular letter.we noted that section of the irs handbook,at least prior to changes,regulated the format and content of circular letters but did not apply across the board to all disclosures,including oral disclosures.id.at.we then noted treasury regulations allowing an irs agent to disclose the nature of his official duties when investigating a taxpayer,as well as a handbook provision authorizing display of credentials and badges identifying criminal investigation division agents.we thus concluded that the irs agents had a good faith belief that they could disclose the criminal nature of their investigation.id.at.
the district court did not have the benefit of gandy when it concluded that batista did not have a good faith belief that he could disclose the fact of a criminal investigation.also,as noted in gandy,the section of the handbook pertinent to that decision was amended in.furthermore,the district court finding of bad faith appears to be based on the premise that all contacts by batista were not authorized.however,as we previously indicated,payne evidence of damages was based primarily on the disclosures of the criminal nature of the investigation.the number of contacted and disclosures made in this case is voluminous.batista discussed the investigation with via interviews,telephone calls,letters,and summonses.the holding that batista lacked good faith is not tied to particularized findings as to precisely what information about a criminal investigation was disclosed to which parties and under which circumstances.determining which of these disclosures were necessary and reconciliation with gandy will therefore entail further factfinding by the district court 
viii.conclusion 
this case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.payne for increased actual and punitive damages is dismissed as premature.
reversed and remanded 
i concur generally in parts and of the majority opinion,but respectfully dissent from part vi.i would hold a that payne was not a reasonably available source for at least some of the information sought by the irs in this case,and b that it is always necessary for irs special agents to identify themselves as members of the criminal investigative division when conducting interviews.
i agree with the majority that the taxpayer under investigation might sometimes be an otherwise reasonably available source for at least some information sought by the irs.the taxpayer might be able to provide exculpatory documents with independent indicia of reliability,such as bank records,cancelled checks,notarized copies of contracts,deeds,or credit card receipts that can help show that he has not committed a crime.these documents might alleviate the need for the irs to contact at least some third parties in determining that a taxpayer has not cheated on his taxes 
but i do not agree that payne was a reasonably available source of information for all of the information sought by the irs here.the majority overlooks this issue it devotes much attention to the general question of whether taxpayers can ever be reasonably available sources of information,but little to the facts of this case.the majority only analysis of this issue consists in a citation to a supposed factual finding by the district court that payne was a reasonably available source for the information sought.in fact,the district court made no such finding.although the tenor of the district court opinion might in places imply that payne was a reasonably available source of information,the court made no explicit finding to that effect 
as the majority itself describes the requirements of suits based on k,three inquiries are involved whether the information sought is related to enforcing the tax code,whether the information was not otherwise reasonably available,and whether the disclosure of return information was necessary in order to obtain the information sought.no one disputes that the first criterion is satisfied here.the district court and the majority both seem to skip over the second step,and proceed directly to a determination of necessity.
the questions of whether the information was otherwise reasonably available and whether the disclosures were necessary are interdependent.barrett united states,hereinafter barrett i.we are concerned in this case with the necessity of three types of disclosures by the irs the disclosure of the identity of the taxpayer,the disclosure that the taxpayer is under some kind of investigation,and the disclosure that the investigation into the taxpayer is criminal in nature.it is not possible to identify which of these three types of disclosures by batista were necessary without determining what information was reasonably available from payne.if payne was not a reasonably available source of some information,then it was okay for batista to try to get that information from other sources.if it was lawful for batista to contact third parties,it was also by that fact necessary for him to disclose two kinds of return information the identity of the taxpayer payne and the fact that the taxpayer was under investigation.batista could not solicit information about payne without identifying him.and the very fact that the irs is asking questions about someone will tip off the third party that the taxpayer is under some kind of investigation.therefore,if payne was not a reasonably available source of information,then the only unnecessary disclosure by batista would be in the majority view the disclosure that the investigation was criminal in nature.
but if payne was a reasonably available source of information,then all of the disclosures were unnecessary the identity of the taxpayer,the fact of an investigation,and the fact that the investigation was criminal.if payne was a reasonably available source of information,then batista could have avoided all of the disclosures to third parties by securing the information from payne himself.
in barrett united states,barrett iii,we explained that the irs is liable only for the damages occasioned by unlawful some disclosures were permitted,and others not,then the irs has to pay damages only for the disclosures that were not permitted.id.at.in barrett iii,the irs had mailed a number of circular letters to patients seeking information about a plastic surgeon.we explained that,because the information sought was not reasonably available from the doctor,there was nothing wrong with the mere fact that the irs sent the circular letters.that is,because the information was not reasonably available from the taxpayer,it was not unlawful for the irs to disclose the identity of the taxpayer and the fact that he was under some kind of investigation.the only unlawful disclosure was the statement in the body of the letter that the taxpayer was under criminal investigation.id.at.the doctor was thus required to show that his damages were by the lawful disclosure of his identity and the fact of the by the unlawful disclosure of the criminal nature of the investigation.id.at.if the doctor medical practice was damaged because patients were worried about their privacy,about the fact of their having had plastic surgery becoming public during an investigation,then the damage would have been done just as effectively by the permitted disclosure that the doctor was under some kind of investigation as the impermissible one that the investigation was criminal.we therefore required the doctor to show that the patients were worried about the criminality of his behavior,not just their loss of privacy.
the same analysis applies here it matters whether payne was a reasonably available source of information so that we can correctly determine for which disclosures the irs is liable.under barrett iii,if payne was a reasonably available source of the information sought,the irs is liable for all of the damages payne suffered as a result of the third party contacts.if payne was not a reasonably available source of information,the irs is liable only for so much of payne damages as can be attributed to the disclosure that the investigation was criminal in nature.if the irs disclosure that payne was under criminal investigation resulted in no more damages than the lawful disclosure that payne was under some kind of investigation,the irs is not liable for any of payne damages.it is therefore necessary to evaluate whether payne was a reasonably available source of the information sought by batista.
the majority opinion may be internally contradictory on this point.it seems to leave undisturbed a supposed finding by the district court that payne was a reasonably available source of the information sought.but it then cites the analysis from barrett iii explained in the preceding paragraphs,and proceeds as if the only issue is the damages caused by revealing the criminal nature of the investigation we focus on the finding that batista regularly revealed the criminal nature of his investigation of payne when making contacts emphasis in original.if none of the contacts were permissible at all,it does not matter whether the damages were caused by the clients concerns over privacy or over whether payne was a tax cheat any damage from the contact is redressable.
even assuming for the sake of argument that the district court opinion can be read as finding that payne was a reasonably available source for all of the information sought,then this conclusion would be clearly erroneous with respect to at least some of the information.admittedly,for some of the information,payne might have been an otherwise reasonably available source.for example,batista contacted the texas lawyers insurance exchange to find out about in interest income reported by payne.batista apparently admitted on the stand that he could have gotten this information presumably in a sufficiently probative form from payne himself.batista also contacted one of payne clients named neal talmadge.the sole information sought from this contact was apparently to confirm that talmadge was a client of payne,even though batista had already confirmed that fact from court records.in these situations,the information sought by batista might very well have been otherwise available without contacting third parties and without disclosing any return information.
but for other types of information sought by batista,payne clearly was not an available source of the information.for example,batista asked a number of people about payne involvement with drug sales payne obviously could not have provided sufficiently probative information about his own involvement in illegal drug transactions.so i would find that payne was not a reasonably available source for all of the information sought by batista,and any district court finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous.
the district court did not make specific findings as to what information sought from third parties was reasonably available from payne.these findings are necessary to a correct determination of the case,and i would remand to the district court for it to make these determinations in the first instance.
assuming that payne was not a reasonably available source for at least some of the information sought by batista,the next issue is whether it was necessary for batista to disclose during interviews that he was a criminal investigator.batista identification badge states,in large type,criminal investigative division batista identified himself as a criminal investigator when talking to some potential witnesses and batista sometimes told third parties that he was conducting a criminal investigation of payne.in barrett united states,barrett ii,we held that the irs needed to produce trial evidence of the necessity of disclosing the criminal nature of an investigation in the body of a circular letter.in the absence of evidence to the contrary,the district court was obligated to find that the disclosure was not necessary.barrett iii concerned written disclosures in a circular letter,not oral disclosures in the course of an interview,as are at issue here.the majority nevertheless feels that barrett ii controls and that the irs was obliged to present trial evidence of the necessity of batista disclosures.i disagree.
we interpret statutes according to the plain meaning of the words used.united states ron pair,d.there are two senses in which the word necessary is commonly used.necessary sometimes means strictly essential,or an indispensable precondition for the happening of an event.necessary also sometimes means appropriate or helpful,mcculloch maryland,wheat.interpreting necessary in the constitution necessary and proper clause to mean the latter of these two definitions,appropriate or helpful.
the first of these definitions has a strictly empirical character if there is empirically any possible way that an event can happen without the occurrence of the co
