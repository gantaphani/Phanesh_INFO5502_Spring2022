this is the second appeal in an action by john greene greene,receiver in liquidation for great global assurance company great global,to recover in tax and interest paid by great global in for the tax year.on march,greene filed for a refund in the united states court of federal claims cfc,arguing that the tax was improperly assessed,and in the alternative that great global policyholder and guaranty fund claimants were entitled to priority of distribution over the internal revenue service irs.greene intended to distribute the refund to these entities on behalf of the insolvent insurer.
the cfc dismissed greene complaint as not having been timely filed.see greene united states.green i.greene appealed,and we reversed,holding that the lower court had misconstrued the statute of limitations.see greene united states,greene ii.on remand,the cfc entered summary judgment on october,in favor of greene.the government filed a timely notice of appeal.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.for the reasons discussed below,we reverse the judgment of the cfc.
background 
the life insurance company tax act of tax act introduced a taxation scheme for life insurance companies.see,stat.codified as amended at.of relevance here is great global phase ii and phase iii income.phase ii income represented of an insurer underwriting gains for that year,and it was tax exempt if it was deposited in a policyholder surplus account psa.the policy behind the tax act was to incentivize insurers to create psa cash reserves that would augment their capacity to satisfy future claims.when funds in the psa were withdrawn,reallocated,or no longer used to further compliance with the insurer obligations to policyholders,the psa funds were then taxed as phase iii income.see greene united states,greene iii.
to qualify as a life insurance company for tax purposes a company must meet the requirements set forth in a.one condition that would trigger tax liability on an insurer psa income was its having ceased to operate as a life insurance company for any two consecutive years.see d a ii providing that if for any two successive taxable years the taxpayer is not a life insurance company,then the amount taken into account under section b for the last preceding taxable year for which it was a life insurance company shall be increased by the amount remaining in its policyholders surplus account at the close of such last preceding taxable year.
in,great global filed a federal life insurance company income tax return,on which it claimed zero tax liability.greene iii.at.however,in and,it failed to qualify as an insurance company,triggering a retroactive tax liability on its psa funds for the tax year.id.at.on february,the superior court of the state of arizona declared great global to be insolvent,placed it in receivership,and on june,ordered that it be liquidated.id.the receivership is still in existence today.on july,the receiver filed an amended return on behalf of great global and paid in back taxes for,consisting of in revised tax liability and in interest.on september,the irs assessed the additional tax and interest on great global pursuant to c.see greene iii.at permitting assessment within three years after the return was filed whether or not such return was filed on or after the date prescribed for the taxable year for which the taxpayer ceases to be an insurance company,the second taxable year for which the taxpayer is not a life insurance company,or the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made as the case may be quoting c.
on july,greene filed for a second amended tax return and requested a refund of,stating two alternative bases for recovery.first,greene argued that notwithstanding the plain language of the statute,the irs could not properly assess a phase iii tax against an insurer in receivership,where shareholders receive nothing,because the purpose of the tax was to give assurance that underwriting gains made available to shareholders will be subject to the full payment of tax.second,greene argued that the tax was incorrectly collected over the competing claims of policyholders,or more precisely,the claims of the arizona guaranty corporation to recover what it had paid to policyholders on great global behalf.the irs denied greene refund claim,which led greene to file a complaint in the cfc.see greene i.as explained above,the cfc dismissed greene claim for untimeliness greene appealed,and we reversed that decision and remanded to the cfc.
cfc decision on remand 
in remand proceedings before the cfc in greene iii,greene and the government for summary judgment.see.at.greene advanced two principal arguments.first,he argued that the tax was not properly due and payable,because the sole purpose of the tax was to assure that underwriting gains made available to shareholders would be subject to the full payment of tax,and in light of great global insolvency,shareholders had received nothing.refusing to delve into legislative intent,the cfc rejected greene policy argument,noting that the statutory language was clear on its,that d a ii require d that an insurance company failure to qualify as a life insurance company for two years renders its entire psa balance taxable as income for the last year in which the company qualified as a life insurance company.
greene second argument was based on the act b,b.greene recognized that the federal superpriority statute provided that a claim of the united states government shall be paid first when a person indebted to the government is insolvent and an act of bankruptcy is committed.a a iii.however,he argued that the section of the act limited the superpriority statute because it stated that n o act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance.greene pointed to the revision of arizona insurance liquidation statutes,which he argued were regulatory in nature,see greene iii.at,and which made clear that policyholders claims and claims by guaranty funds were both senior in priority to irs claims.see.ann.a providing in relevant part for the following claim distribution order from the assets of a delinquent insurer costs related to administration of the delinquency proceedings guaranty fund claims policyholders insurance claims federal government claims employee compensation claims state and local government claims claims of other general creditors and three additional classes of claims.
greene argued for the applicability of the version of the arizona statute over the revisions in effect at any of the following relevant times,the taxable year december,the end of the second year that great global failed to qualify as a life insurance company under d a ii february,when the arizona supreme court declared great global insolvent june,when the court entered a liquidation order july,when great global receiver filed an amended tax return and paid the tax july,when greene filed a second amended tax return and march,when greene filed for a refund in the cfc.greene preference for the revision was understandable as unlike earlier revisions,it made crystal clear the priority of policyholder and guaranty fund claims over those of the federal government.however,greene argued that even under the revision,which was in effect in when the tax was assessed and collected,policyholders held preferred claims that were entitled to priority over what he alleged to be the mere general creditor claims of the federal government.see.ann.a,e.he urged that the revision was protected from preemption because of the act.
the cfc did not decide which statutory revision,or,applied.sidestepping the issue,it appeared to assume that policyholders would have priority under either statute.the court then focused on whether the arizona guaranty fund and the arizona priority statute had the purpose of regulating the business of insurance and of protecting policyholders.following the first circuit opinion in ruthardt united states,the cfc held that the arizona state priority statute was exempt from preemption under the act cir.it therefore held in favor of greene,whom it deemed to be entitled to a refund of taxes paid to the government,reasoning that the money should have gone to the guaranty fund to reimburse it for payments made to policyholders of the insolvent insurer.
this case presents us with four issues first,whether the federal tax was due and payable second,which version of the arizona insurance liquidation statutes should be applied in this case third,whether the applicable state statute granted policyholders claims priority over those of the federal government and fourth,if so,did it do it in a manner that escaped to the provisions of the the federal superpriority statute.
this is an appeal from the cfc grant of summary judgment,which we review de novo.promac,west.as explained below,we hold that the tax was due and payable,and that the arizona priority statute is applicable.furthermore,because the statute does not elevate the priority of policyholders above that of government claimants,there is no conflict between the federal superpriority statute and state law.consequently,provisions are not triggered.because the statute does not mention guaranty funds,we do not need to decide whether the act would allow the claims of guaranty funds to have a priority over those of the federal government,such as is provided for by the revision of the arizona priority statute.see.ann.a.
ii.analysis 
a.the tax was due and payable 
pursuant to d a ii,phase iii tax liability is imposed upon insurers after a lapse in their insurance operations.greene argues that this provision was designed to prevent shareholders from taking advantage of the deferred taxation scheme even while discontinuing obligations to policyholders.according to greene,because this concern is not present when an insurance company involuntarily ceases operations,such as by reason of insolvency,this court should decline to give effect to the plain language of the statute.we reject greene invitation to ignore the unambiguous terms of this statute.accordingly,we hold the phase iii tax to have been due and payable.
we now turn to the issue of priority,namely,whether the federal government claim against great global is entitled to preference over the claims of great global policyholders,or more precisely,preference over the claims of guaranty funds that have paid the policyholders claims and seek reimbursement from the assets of the insolvent insurer.is there a dialectic tension among the various statutes the answer to this question depends on the interaction between,and the applicability of,several state and federal statutes.
as we explain below,the first such statute is the federal superpriority statute,which provides that the federal government is entitled to first satisfaction of its claims against an insolvent entity.see a a iii.the supreme court of the united states has held that this federal priority right attaches upon insolvency and is indefeasible.see massachusetts united states.
other relevant statutes are the multiple revisions of arizona scheme for distributing the assets of an insolvent insurer.see.ann.as amended by acts of.the more recent revisions of the priority statute clearly direct that policyholders and guaranty funds are to be paid ahead of the federal government,and these recent revisions thereby conflict with the mandate of the federal superpriority statute.in addition,the revision explicitly provides for its retroactive application in all pending insolvency proceedings.giving effect to this retroactivity provision,however,would require stripping the federal government of its indefeasible right to first priority,as granted by the federal superpriority statute.the one that was in effect at the time that great global was declared not directly address the relative priorities of the government and policyholders.see.ann.
this case would be federal law simply preempting state law in each it not for the act,a federal law that can save state laws from preemption,but only if the purpose of the state law is to regulate the business of insurance.however,as we set forth in more detail below,the act does not restrain the federal superpriority statute from preempting the retroactive application of arizona newer priority statutes.the only revision of the priority statute not thereby preempted was the one in effect in when the great global insolvency was,the revision.after additional analysis,however,we conclude that the act does not save even the revision from preemption by the federal superpriority statute.thus,the government is entitled to priority of payment of the tax due.
federal superpriority statute 
the federal superpriority statute provides that a claim of the united states government,for taxes shall be paid first when a person indebted to the government is insolvent and an act of bankruptcy is committed.a a iii.section is the direct descendent of of the revised statutes,which had been codified in.united states estate of romani,d.
not only does the federal superpriority statute provide that the federal government be paid first,but it has been construed to provide that once the right to first payment has attached,that right is vested and indefeasible.see massachusetts united states,at.holding that pursuant to of the revised statutes,the predecessor of the current superpriority statute,the priority given is in terms absolute,not conditional and o nce attaching,it is final and conclusive id.at.congress created a conclusive priority attaching as of the time of insolvency.
the act provides that n o act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance act,b,ch,stat,codified as amended at b.before examining the meaning of the act,we briefly describe its history.
before,the united states supreme court had consistently held that the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution did not invalidate state laws relating to insurance.see,united states underwriters ass n.for years this court has held that the commerce clause of the constitution does not deprive the individual states of power to regulate and tax specific activities of foreign insurance companies which sell policies within their territories notwithstanding that negotiation and execution of the companies policy contracts involved communications of information and movements of persons,moneys,and papers across state lines.indeed,in the court had declared,in the context of a dormant commerce clause case that issuing a policy of insurance is not a transaction of commerce.paul virginia,wall.
in,the united states supreme court was first confronted with a challenge to the power of congress to affirmatively regulate interstate insurance pursuant to its commerce clause powers.in underwriters,a number of insurance companies had been indicted for violating sections of the sherman act that prohibited the monopolization of commerce and the district court had sustained a demurrer on the grounds that insurance was not commerce.at.in reversing the district court dismissal of the indictment,the supreme court made clear that the regulation of interstate insurance was within congress power pursuant to the commerce clause.see id.at.no commercial enterprise of any kind which conducts its activities across state lines has been held to be wholly beyond the regulatory power of congress under the commerce clause.we can not make an exception of the business of insurance.
congress reacted to the holding in underwriters by passing the act.see united states dep t of treasury fabe,d discussing the history of the act.the act provides that statutes enacted pursuant to congress commerce clause powers could not preempt state insurance laws unless the federal statute has explicitly provided for such preemption.in other words,the act impos es what is,in effect,a rule.id.at.
in fabe,the united states supreme court made clear that t he act did not simply overrule underwriters and restore the status quo,but that t o the contrary,it transformed the legal landscape by overturning the normal rules of.at.as explained by the supreme court in humana forsyth,the act is triggered only by a clear conflict between state insurance law and a federal statute of general applicability,d when federal law does not directly conflict with state regulation,and when application of the federal law would not frustrate any declared state policy or interfere with a state administrative regime,the act does not preclude its application.mccarran does not create reverse field preemption.see id.
the arizona priority statutes 
until,arizona did not provide any special treatment for policyholders claims.then,the legislature revised its statutes to provide that u npaid claims,including claims for unearned premiums or cash values,which arise out of and are within the coverage of insurance policies issued by the insolvent insurer shall have preference over and shall be paid prior to payments of claims of general creditors.ann.e replaced by a.read in combination with the definition of a preferred claim,see,the arizona statutes in effect from to afforded policyholders the status of preferred claimants.of course,in light of the federal superpriority statute,would also seem to make the federal government a preferred claimant,and the arizona statute that was in effect through provided no explicit resolution on the issue of whether the state statute ranked policyholder claims higher than those of the federal government.
this version of the statute remained in effect through march,during which time the irs assessed and collected the tax on great global.this provision was replaced by a far more specific distribution statute,which provided in relevant part for the following distribution order administrative costs certain employee wage claims guaranty fund claims policyholder claims claims of the federal,state and local governments and other general creditor claims.see act of march,ch.legis.serv.west codified at.ann.a.
on june,less than three months after arizona enacted the new distribution statute,the united states supreme court declared portions of a similar ohio statute not to be for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,within the meaning of the act fabe,at.the ohio statute had ranked government claims behind administrative expenses,wage claims,policyholders claims and claims of general creditors.see id.at.citing ohio ann.the court held that the ohio priority statute escapes to the extent that it protects policyholders.id.at.thus,it held that the act provisions extended to the preferential payment of administrative costs,as these were indirectly necessary to protect policyholders.see id.at.without payment of administrative costs,liquidation could not even commence.however,it held that wage claims and other general creditor claims,did not escape preemption.see id.at.explaining that t he preferences conferred upon employees and other general creditors do not escape because their connection to the ultimate aim of insurance is too tenuous.
on remand,the district court applied ohio law to conclude that the preempted provisions of the state distribution statute were not severable from the section as a whole,and accordingly found the section to be invalid in its entirety.see duryee dep t of the treasury,d.while duryee was pending,arizona made minor revisions to the statute in,choosing to retain its scheme.see act of march,ch.legis.serv.west codified at.ann.a the district court filed its decision in duryee less than five months later,on august.
after duryee,the severability of arizona preempted wage claim priority from the remainder of the statute and consequently,the validity of the statute remained undecided under arizona state law,as fabe did not invalidate the entire section of the ohio statute,but only the wage claim preference.however,arizona legislators did appear to respond to fabe and duryee in when they provided amended priority rankings in which only administrative costs and policyholder and guaranty fund claims were superior to federal government claims.the new legislation provided for the following priority administrative costs guaranty fund claims policyholders claims federal government claims state and local government claims claims of other general creditors and claims by three additional groups see act of april,ch.legis.serv.west codified at.ann.a.
section of this act also included a severability provision to guard against any possibility of total invalidation,as had occurred with ohio priority statute in duryee.id.section made explicit that the revision was to apply retroactively to all delinquency proceedings begun after the effective date of this act and to all delinquency proceedings pending on the effective date of this act in which a final distribution in payment of claims has not been made id.emphasis added.in this case,it is not disputed that the proceedings were pending in,and that no final distribution has been made.
in,the arizona legislature made only minor changes to the distribution statute,which remains in effect today.see act of may,ch.legis.serv.west codified as amended at.ann.e.unlike the act,however,the act did not contain an explicit retroactivity statement.id.
choice of state priority statute 
here,we must first decide which version of the arizona statute to apply.although on appellate review courts do not generally apply statutes retroactively to events,there are exceptions to that rule.see landgraf usi film,d recognizing a presumption against statutory retroactivity,but explaining that in many situations,a court should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,even though that law was enacted after the events that gave rise to the suit and that a presumption against retroactivity will not apply when the legislature has unambiguously provided for the retroactive application of a new law united states schooner peggy,cranch.reversing a decree in response to a treaty that issued while the appeal was pending and that provided for the retroactive reassignment of rights to a french vessel as between its french owners and the government.indeed,outside of the context of criminal statutes,legislatures are generally free to impart retroactivity upon statutes through the use of express provisions.see,trust new jersey,d the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment generally does not prohibit retrospective civil legislation,unless the consequences are particularly harsh and oppressive.quoting welch henry.
when the legislature has not included an express retroactivity provision,however,the determination of whether or not a statute should be applied retroactively becomes more intricate.for example,under arizona law,the general rule is that a law can be accorded retroactive effect only if the law explicitly provides for retroactive application.see.ann.no statute is retroactive unless expressly declared therein.however,there is a exception to that rule even if the law does not explicitly provide for retroactive application,it may be applied retroactively only if it is merely procedural,rather than substantive.see aranda indus.comm n,this court has created an exception to the general rule requiring express language of retroactivity.enactments that are procedural only,and do not alter or affect earlier established substantive rights may be applied retroactively.citing in re shane.
at first blush,this court appears to be confronted with the necessity of deciding a question of arizona whether the current version of the priority statute,a,which lacks an express retroactivity provision,nonetheless has retroactive application.this,in turn,would require us to predict whether the arizona courts would consider priority rights to be substantive or procedural pursuant to the aranda test.however,we do not need to reach this issue,because we conclude that a state can not retroactively deprive the federal government of its priority even where it does so explicitly,as it has done in its revisions.the relative order of relevant priorities is identical under both the and revisions.
the fundamental problem with the retroactive a
