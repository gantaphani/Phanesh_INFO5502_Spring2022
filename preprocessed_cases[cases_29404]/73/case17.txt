justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
in,the united kingdom imposed a windfall tax on companies privatized between and.this case addresses whether that tax is creditable for tax purposes.internal revenue code b states that any income,war profits,and excess profits taxes paid overseas are creditable against income taxes.b.treasury regulations interpret this section to mean that a foreign tax is creditable if its predominant character is that of an income tax in the sense.reg.a ii,cfr a.consistent with precedent and the tax court analysis below,we apply the predominant character test using a commonsense approach that considers the substantive effect of the tax.under this approach,we hold that the tax is under and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for the third circuit.
during the and,the conservative party controlled parliament and privatized a number of companies.these companies were sold to private parties through an initial sale of shares,known as a flotation.as part of privatization,many were required to continue providing services at the same rates they had offered under government control for a fixed period,typically their first four years of private operation.as a result,the companies could only increase profits during this period by operating more efficiently.responding to market incentives,many of the companies became dramatically more efficient and earned substantial profits in the process.
the labour party,which had unsuccessfully opposed privatization,used the companies profitability as a campaign issue against the conservative party.in part because of campaign promises to tax what it characterized as undue profits,the labour party defeated the conservative party at the polls in.prior to coming to power,labour party leaders hired accounting firm arthur andersen to structure a tax that would capture excess,or windfall,profits earned during the initial years in which the companies were prohibited from increasing rates.eventually adopted the tax,which applied only to the regulated companies that were prohibited from raising their rates.see finance act,ch,pt.i,cls.and eng.windfall tax act.it imposed a percent tax on any windfall earned by such companies,cl.a separate schedule se t out how to quantify the windfall from which a company was benefitting.cl.see,sched.
in the proceedings below,the parties stipulated that the following formula summarizes the tax imposed by the labour party 
d equals the number of days a company was subject to rate regulation also known as the initial period p equals the total profits earned during the initial period,and fv equals the flotation value,or market capitalization value after sale.for of the companies subject to the tax,the number of days in the initial period was days or four years.of the remaining five companies,one had no tax liability because it did not earn any windfall profits.three had initial periods close to four years,and days.the last was privatized shortly before the labour party took power and had an initial period of only days.
the number in the formula was characterized as a ratio and was selected because it represented the lowest average ratio of the companies subject to the tax during the relevant period see,sched,cl.brief for respondent.the statute expressly set its value,and that value was the same for all companies.windfall tax act,sched,cl.the only variables that changed in the windfall tax formula for all the companies were profits p and flotation value fv the initial period d varied for only a few of the companies subject to the tax.the labour government asserted that the term p tlrdivsl d represented what the flotation value should have been given the assumed ratio of.thus,it claimed and the commissioner here reiterates that the tax was simply a percent tax on the difference between what the companies flotation values should have been and what they actually were.
petitioner ppl corporation ppl was an owner,through a number of subsidiaries,of percent of south western electricity plc,of companies that were privatized in and that were subject to the tax.see,app.diagram of ppl corporate structure in.south western electricity total windfall tax burden was.in its federal return,ppl claimed a credit under for its share of the bill.the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner rejected the claim,but the tax court held that the windfall tax was creditable for tax purposes under.see,at.the third circuit reversed.we granted certiorari,to resolve a circuit split concerning the windfall tax creditability under.compare,at,with entergy affiliated subsidiaries commissioner.
internal revenue code b provides that i n the case of a domestic corporation,the amount of any income,war profits,and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to any foreign country or to any possession of the united states shall be creditable under relevant treasury regulations,a foreign levy is an income tax if and only if t he predominant character of that tax is that of an income tax in the sense.cfr a.the parties agree that treasury regulation applies to this case.that regulation codifies longstanding doctrine dating back to biddle commissioner,and provides the relevant legal standard.
the regulation establishes several principles relevant to our inquiry.first,the predominant character of a tax,or the normal manner in which a tax applies,is controlling.see,at we are here concerned only with the standard or normal tax under this principle,a tax that operates as an income,war profits,or excess profits tax in most instances is creditable,even if it may affect a handful of taxpayers differently.creditability is an all or nothing proposition.as the treasury regulations confirm,a tax either is or is not an income tax,in its entirety,for all persons subject to the tax.cfr a.
second,the way a foreign government characterizes its tax is not dispositive with respect to the creditability analysis.see a ii foreign tax creditable if predominantly an income tax in the sense in biddle,the court considered the creditability of certain taxes on stock dividends under the substantively identical predecessor to.the court recognized that there is nothing in the statute language to suggest that in allowing the credit for foreign tax payments,a shifting standard was adopted by reference to foreign characterizations and classifications of tax legislation.at.see also united states goodyear tire rubber,noting in interpreting that biddle is particularly applicable where a contrary interpretation would leave tax interpretation to the varying tax policies of foreign tax authorities heiner mellon,and definitions generally not controlling in federal tax context.instead of the foreign government characterization of the tax,the crucial inquiry is the tax economic effect.see biddle,supra,at inquiry is whether a tax is the substantial equivalent of payment of the tax as those terms are used in our own statute in other words,foreign tax creditability depends on whether the tax,if enacted in the,would be an income,war profits,or excess profits tax.
giving further form to these principles,treasury regulation a i explains that a foreign tax predominant character is that of a income tax i f the foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies.the regulation then sets forth three tests for assessing whether a foreign tax reaches net gain.a tax does so if,judged on the basis of its predominant character,it satisfies each of the realization,gross receipts,and net income requirements set forth in paragraphs b,b and b,respectively,of this section.b the tests indicate that net gain also referred to as net income consists of realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses to such gross receipts.a foreign tax that reaches net income,or profits,is creditable.
it is undisputed that net income is a component of the windfall tax formula.see brief for respondent the windfall tax takes into account a company during its initial period indeed,annual profit is a variable in the tax formula.windfall tax act,sched,cls.and.it is also undisputed that there is no meaningful difference for our purposes in the accounting principles by which the and the calculate profits.see brief for petitioners.the instead centers on how to characterize the tax formula the labour party adopted.
the third circuit,following the commissioner lead,believed it could look no further than the tax formula that the parliament enacted and the way in which the labour government characterized it.under that view,the windfall tax must be considered a tax on the difference between a company flotation value the total amount investors paid for the company when the government sold it and an imputed value,defined as a company average annual profit during its initial period times,the assumed ratio.at.so characterized,the tax captures a portion of the difference between the price at which each company was sold and the price at which the labour government believed each company should have been sold given the actual profits earned during the initial period.relying on this characterization,the third circuit believed the windfall tax failed at least the treasury regulation realization and gross receipts tests because it reached some artificial form of valuation instead of profits.see,at,and.
in contrast,ppl position is that the substance of the windfall tax is that of an income tax in the sense.while recognizing that the tax ostensibly is based on the difference between two values,it argues that every in the windfall tax formula except for profits and flotation value is fixed at least with regard to of the companies.ppl emphasizes that the only way the labour government was able to calculate the imputed value at which it claimed companies should have been privatized was by looking after the fact at the actual profits earned by each company.in ppl view,it matters not how the chose to arrange the formula or what it claimed to be taxing,because a tax based on profits above some threshold is an excess profits tax,regardless of how it is mathematically arranged or what labels foreign law places on it.ppl,thus,contends that the windfall taxes it paid meet the treasury regulation tests and are under.
we agree with ppl and conclude that the predominant character of the windfall tax is that of an excess profits tax,a category of income tax in the sense.it is important to note that the labour government conception of value as a analysis of historic profits is not a recognized valuation method instead,it is a fictitious value calculated using an imputed ratio.at trial,one of ppl expert witnesses explained that is not an accurate multiple,and it is not applied to current or expected future earnings.at,quoting testimony.instead,the windfall tax is a tax on realized net income disguised as a tax on the difference between two values,one of which is completely fictitious.see app,report t he value in profit making terms described in the wording of the act is not a real value it is rather a construct based on realised profits that would not have been known at the date of privatisation 
the substance of the windfall tax confirms the accuracy of this observation.as already noted,the parties stipulated that the windfall tax could be calculated as follows 
this formula can be rearranged algebraically to the following formula,which is mathematically and substantively identical 
the next step is to substitute the actual number of days for for of the companies subject to the windfall tax,the number of days was identical,or four years.inserting that amount for d in the formula yields the following 
simplifying the formula by multiplying and dividing numbers reduces the formula to 
as noted,fv represents the value at which each company was privatized.fv is then divided by,the arbitrary ratio applied to every company.the economic effect is to convert flotation value into the profits a company should have earned given the assumed ratio.see,at in effect,the way the tax works is to say that the amount of profits you allowed in any year before you subject to tax is equal to of the flotation price.after that,profits are deemed excess,and there is a tax quoting testimony from the treasurer of south western electricity plc.the annual profits are then multiplied by,giving the total acceptable profits as opposed to windfall profit that each company flotation value entitled it to earn during the initial period given the artificial ratio of.this fictitious amount is finally subtracted from actual profits,yielding the excess profits,which were taxed at an effective rate of percent.
the rearranged tax formula demonstrates that the windfall tax is economically equivalent to the difference between the profits each company actually earned and the amount the labour government believed it should have earned given its flotation value.for the companies that had initial periods,the tax formula substantive effect was to impose a percent tax on all profits earned above a threshold.that is a classic excess profits tax.see,act of,ch,tit.ii,stat.percent tax imposed on excess profits exceeding the sum of plus percent of invested capital.
of course,other algebraic reformulations of the windfall tax equation are possible.see,at brief for anne alstott et as amici curiae alstott brief.the point of the reformulation is not that it yields a particular percentage percent for most of the companies.rather,the algebraic reformulations illustrate the economic substance of the tax and its interrelationship with net income.
the commissioner argues that any algebraic rearrangement is improper,asserting that courts must take the foreign tax rate as written and accept whatever tax base the foreign tax purports to adopt.brief for respondent.as a result,the commissioner claims that the analysis begins and ends with the labour government choice to characterize its tax base as the difference between value and flotation value.such a rigid construction is unwarranted.it can not be squared with the principle that tax law deals in economic realities,not legal abstractions.commissioner southwest exploration.given the artificiality of the method of calculating purported value,we follow substance over form and recognize that the windfall tax is nothing more than a tax on actual profits above a threshold.
we find the commissioner other arguments unpersuasive as well.first,the commissioner attempts to buttress the argument that the windfall tax is a tax on value by noting that some gift and estate taxes use actual,past profits to estimate value.brief for respondent citing cfr and.this argument misses the point.in the case of valuation for gift and estate taxes,past income may be used to estimate future income streams.but,it is future potential,reduced to market value,that is subject to taxation.the windfall profits tax,by contrast,undisputedly taxed past,realized net income alone.
the commissioner contends that the was not trying to establish valuation as of the date on which the windfall tax was enacted but instead was attempting to derive a proper flotation valuation as of each company flotation date.brief for respondent.the commissioner asserts that there was no need to estimate future income as in the case of the gift or estate recipient because actual revenue numbers for the privatized companies were available.ibid.that argument also misses the mark.it is true,of course,that the companies might have been privatized at higher flotation values had the government recognized how efficient and thus how profitable the companies would become.but,the windfall tax requires an underlying concept of value based on actual ex post earnings that would be alien to any valuer.taxing,realized net income in hindsight is not the same as considering past income for purposes of estimating future earning potential.
the commissioner reliance on example to the treasury regulation gross receipts test is also misplaced,at cfr b ii,ex.that example posits a petroleum tax in which gross receipts from extraction income are deemed to equal percent of the fair market value of petroleum extracted.this computation is designed to produce an amount that is greater than the fair market value of actual gross receipts.ibid.under the example,a tax based on inflated gross receipts is not creditable.
the third circuit believed that the same type of algebraic rearrangement used above could also be used to rearrange a tax imposed on example.it hypothesized 
say that the tax rate on the hypothetical extraction tax is.it is true that a tax on of receipts is mathematically equivalent to a tax on of receipts,the latter of which would satisfy the gross receipts requirement.ppl proposes that we make the same move here,increasing the tax rate from to so that there is no multiple of receipts in the tax base.but if the regulation allowed us to do that,the example would be a nullity.any tax on a multiple of receipts or profits could satisfy the gross receipts requirement,because we could reduce the starting point of its tax base to of gross receipts by imagining a higher tax rate.at.
the commissioner reiterates the third circuit argument.brief for respondent.
there are three basic problems with this approach.as the fifth circuit correctly recognized,there is a difference between imputed and actual receipts.example hypothesizes a tax on the extraction of petroleum where the income value of the petroleum is deemed to be deliberately greater than actual gross receipts.entergy,at.in contrast,the windfall tax depends on actual figures.ibid.there was no need to calculate imputed gross receipts gross receipts were actually known example simply addresses a different foreign taxation issue.
the argument also incorrectly equates imputed gross receipts under example with net income.see,at a ny tax on a multiple of receipts or profits as noted,a tax is creditable only if it applies to realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attributable to such gross receipts.cfr b i.a tax based solely on gross receipts like the third circuit analysis would be noncreditable because it would fail the treasury regulation net income requirement.
finally,even if expenses were subtracted from imputed gross receipts before a tax was imposed,the effect of inflating only gross receipts would be to inflate revenue while holding expenses the other component of net income constant.a tax imposed on inflated income minus actual expenses is not the same as a tax on net income 
for these reasons,a tax based on imputed gross receipts is not creditable.but,as the fifth circuit explained in rejecting the third circuit analysis,example is irrelevant to the analysis of the windfall tax,which is based on true net income.entergy,supra,at 
the economic substance of the windfall tax is that of a income tax.the tax is based on net income,and the fact that the labour government chose to characterize it as a tax on the difference between two values is not dispositive under treasury regulation.therefore,the tax is creditable under.
the judgment of the third circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.

the court conclusion that the windfall tax is a creditable excess profits tax under b depends on two interrelated analytic moves first,restricting the predominant character analysis to those companies that shared an initial period of rate regulation of days and second,treating the tax initial period variable as fixed.see ante,at.but there is a different way of looking at this case.if the predominant character inquiry is expanded to include the five companies that had different initial periods,especially those with much shorter initial periods,it becomes impossible to rewrite the windfall tax as an excess profits tax.instead,it becomes clear that the windfall tax is functionally a tax on value.but because the governm
