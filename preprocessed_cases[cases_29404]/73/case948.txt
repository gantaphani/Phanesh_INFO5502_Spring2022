john stahl,a member and president of the stahl hutterian brethren shb,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the united states on his complaint for a refund of personal income taxes.he asserts that because shb is a d corporation and because the medical and meal expenses of its employees are deductible at the corporate level,he has overpaid his personal income taxes.the district court declared that he was not an employee of shb we reverse and remand.
background 
shb was organized to enable its members to live in accordance with the tenets of the hutterite tradition.the hutterite tradition is rooted in sixteenth century germany.in accordance with their religious beliefs,shb members live in a colony,and currently the shb colony includes about members.they are all part of the extended stahl family,which includes eight brothers,two sisters,their spouses,and their children.
shb is a d nonprofit apostolic corporation.apostolic corporations maintain a common treasury and do not pay income tax.instead,the members of a d corporation pay personal income tax on their pro rata shares of the corporation income.as a result,a member tax liability is reduced when deductions are allowed at the corporate level.
shb is engaged in the business of farming.it farms acres of land and it produces dairy products and a variety of crops shb earns substantial income selling most of its produce and dairy products to other businesses and at farmers markets.it achieves this with the help of its members and a few part time employees,whom it hires on an as needed basis.
hutterites disavow individual property ownership,so shb does not pay a salary to any of its members.moreover,the members do not contribute to or collect social security benefits.all of shb property is maintained by it and is used for the benefit of its members.shb provides for the members personal needs,such as food,shelter,clothing,and medical care.
according to the bylaws of shb,any member may be expelled.expulsion may occur for a variety of reasons,including the member refusing to obey shb rules the member failing to give and devote all his or her time,labor,services,earnings and energies to shb and the member failing to do and perform the work,labor,acts,and things required of him or her.if a member is expelled,he forfeits all interest in shb property and leaves with nothing but the clothes on his back.
stahl brought this action for the purpose of obtaining an income tax refund because,he asserts,corporate level income should have been reduced for tax purposes before it was passed through to him.he insists that the cost of meals and medical expenses of shb employees was an ordinary and necessary business expense.the government argued to the district court that none of the hutterite members,including stahl,are employees for tax purposes and that should end the inquiry.the district court agreed with the government,and this appeal followed.

discussion 
clearly enough,shb is not an ordinary commercial enterprise because it is operated,ultimately controlled by,and largely populated by hutterian brethren.that puts it in a unique category it is a religious or apostolic corporation,which means that its members must include in their gross income their entire pro rata shares,whether distributed or not,of the taxable income of the corporation.d.we have explained the purpose of that provision by quoting the pertinent part of the legislative history as follows 
it has been brought to the attention of the committee that certain religious and apostolic associations and corporations,such as the house of david and the shakers,have been taxed as corporations,and that since their rules prevent their members from being holders of property in an individual capacity the corporations would be subject to the tax.these organizations have a small agricultural or other business.the effect of the proposed amendment is to exempt these corporations from the normal corporation tax and the tax,if their members take up their shares of the corporations income on their own individual returns.it is believed that this provision will give them relief,and their members will be subject to a fair tax.
kleinsasser united states,cir.
stahl claims that he was an employee of shb,and that,therefore,his medical and meal expenses are deductible at the corporate level when shb taxable income is determined.the district court decided that he was not an employee.it did not go on to determine whether deductions would be proper if he were one.
as we see it,our determination must be driven by the supreme court explication of the meaning of employee for federal purposes.absent some explicit congressional determination to the contrary,the court has told us to use the following approach 
in determining whether a hired party is an employee under the general common law of agency,we consider the hiring party right to control the manner and means by which the product is accomplished.among the other factors relevant to this inquiry are the skill required the source of the instrumentalities and tools the location of the work the duration of the relationship between the parties whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired party the extent of the hired party discretion over when and how long to work the method of payment the hired party role in hiring and paying assistants whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party whether the hiring party is in business the provision of employee benefits and the tax treatment of the hired party.
nationwide mut.ins.darden,d.while darden was not a tax case,it did rely in part on a revenue ruling,which does,of course,apply in the tax area and we also have applied the darden factors to a tax case we see little reason to eschew using that formulation in our consideration of whether stahl was an employee of the business enterprise shb operated.as we see it,the fact that the individual hutterites also play,worship,eat and live together as a matter of their personal beliefs does not detract from the fact that shb is,among other things,a very successful business 
control in general 
although no factor is decisive the right of shb to control the activities of those who work for it is fundamental the right to control is,essentially,the right to direct what the alleged employee shall do and the details of how he shall do it it does not require that the alleged employer actually exercise that right in any particular circumstance while the government suggests that shb does not really exercise control over its workforce,on its face that contention is highly unlikely could it be that an operation which farms acres and generates substantial income is run in a manner where workers simply do what they wish and come and go at will one would intuit not,and the record does not belie the intuition.
shb has a management hierarchy and benefits from the division of labor at the management level.the shb members govern themselves by deciding matters by a majority vote of the voting members and at the head of shb is the president the president oversees the finances of the corporation and decides what crops should be planted and where.below the president are managers,who oversee shb farmi
