background 
because this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial,the following facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the light most favorable to the government.united states bahel,cir.
mail fraud 
a superseding indictment the indictment charged litwok with mail fraud in connection with a false insurance claim relating to her house on duke drive in east hampton,new york.at trial,however,the government presented evidence relating to both litwok house on duke drive,where litwok,a stockbroker,lived and operated her businesses,and a nearby house she owned on aborigine way.litwok eventually transferred nominal ownership of both houses to her close friend,dalia eilat,under whose name the homes were insured by a subsidiary of chubb insurance company chubb.
in,in relatively quick succession,chubb received two noticeably similar insurance claims,purporting to be signed by eilat,for each of the east hampton homes.first,in october,chubb received a claim for repairs after the house on aborigine way supposedly sustained heavy storm damage,including destroyed patio furniture the aborigine way claim.chubb eventually settled this claim for about.second,in november,chubb received an insurance claim for water damage from a broken bathroom pipe in the duke drive home the duke drive claim.chubb initially paid approximately to settle the duke drive claim.
in march,as part of the duke drive claim,chubb received a receipt for lodging expenses for several nights that litwok and eilat purportedly spent at a guesthouse while the duke drive house was being repaired.the guesthouse receipt was issued to litwok and eilat,signed by ruth vered,and faxed by janet lehr in april,chubb mailed another check for for the lodging expenses the lodging check.although the lodging check,which is the subject of the mail fraud count,was made payable to eilat,it was deposited in an account jointly held by litwok and adrienne moore,an unlicensed public adjuster who had assisted with filing the insurance claims and had endorsed the check.there was evidence to suggest that litwok was aware of the deposit into the joint account.for example,litwok former assistant,elizabeth kratochvil,testified that litwok meticulously supervised all the financial transactions from her personal and corporate bank accounts and personally reviewed the bank statements for her joint account with moore.
there was also evidence that both insurance claims were fraudulent.both claims included inflated estimates of damage from litwok home contractor,who testified that he did not prepare these estimates,and declared water damage requiring repair or replacement of hardwood floors that,chubb later discovered,were largely intact.the property loss notice forms accompanying both claims listed litwok,not eilat,as the contact person.furthermore,in mid eilat notified chubb that litwok and moore had forged eilat signature on the property loss notice forms for both insurance claims and deposited the settlement checks into their joint account after forging her signature on the back of the checks.eilat allegations prompted a united states postal inspector to investigate the claims.the inspector visited the duke drive home and encountered litwok with the allegedly damaged patio furniture from aborigine way intact.during the encounter,litwok told the inspector,d o take my furniture back.the inspector also determined that there was no guesthouse at the address that appeared on the guesthouse receipt and concluded that the receipt was false.
as part of his investigation,the inspector enlisted the help of janet lehr,whose name appeared on the fax line of the false receipt,to record a telephone call with litwok discussing the receipt and the fact that lehr had been visited by a federal agent.the recorded call was played to the jurors,and a transcript was provided to them.during the call with lehr,litwok did not dispute the fraudulent nature of the duke drive claim.to the contrary,her statements suggested that she was aware of both the details of the false receipt and its incriminating nature.for example,after lehr expressed remorse over her involvement in the scheme,litwok offered to the problem for lehr by blaming moore.
tax evasion 
in addition to the evidence of mail fraud,the government presented the following evidence relating to the tax evasion counts.from to,litwok operated a number of private equity companies from her duke drive house,including kohn investment i lp,which she managed through kohn investment management.litwok routinely commingled her corporate and personal funds and used funds she received from her corporate investors to pay for personal expenses and gifts.although she owed nearly million in taxes from through based on her personal income,litwok failed to file a single personal tax return for those years.
three of litwok former accountants testified at trial.but only one accountant,peter testaverde,testified about work related to any of the years relevant to the tax evasion charges,namely,the year referenced in count two of the indictment.testaverde explained that litwok had retained his accounting firm from september to september to calculate the losses and income for kohn investment i lp and to prepare k tax forms,which provide investors with information necessary to file their own tax returns,including their portion of the partnership income.testaverde confronted litwok after discovering over million in excess personal compensation based on a review of various brokerage account statements,among other documents.in response,litwok attacked the accuracy of the account statements from her company brokerage firm that testaverde had relied on to calculate her compensation.she then blocked testaverde from contacting the brokerage firm to verify the information,as would have been the normal practice.when testaverde tried to notify her company partners that he could not prepare their k forms because litwok had prohibited him from contacting the brokerage firm,litwok attempted to prevent him from doing so.one of litwok two other accountants testified that his firm prepared litwok tax returns for and,prior to the period charged in the indictment,but she never filed them.one of these accountants,lawrence goldstein,also confronted litwok,to no effect,about what appeared to be million in excess personal compensation,and refused her repeated demands to adjust his accounting for her partnership tax return.
in march litwok was charged in the indictment with mail fraud relating to the duke drive lodging reimbursement claim and tax evasion for the years through.the case was tried before a jury in february.at trial,the district court admitted evidence of litwok failure to file taxes prior to under federal rule of evidence b and instructed the jury that it could consider that evidence solely to determine litwok intent.in may,after the jury convicted litwok on all counts,the district court sentenced her principally to two years imprisonment and ordered her to pay in restitution.she began serving her sentence in september.by order dated september,we released litwok on bail pending the disposition of this appeal,after noting that the parties had agreed that the appeal presents a close question or one that very well could be decided the other way.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
a defendant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence after a conviction bears a heavy burden,united states desnoyers,cir quotation marks omitted,and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,united states heras,cir quoting jackson virginia,d.using this exceedingly deferential standard,united states hassan,cir,we will affirm the conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,heras,at emphasis in the original quotation mark omitted.
a.the mail fraud conviction 
on appeal,litwok contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a guilty verdict of aiding and abetting mail fraud because she neither consciously assisted nor directly facilitated or encouraged the fraud related to the duke drive lodging reimbursement claim,which was the only fraud charged in the indictment.see united states medina,cir.we disagree.the aiding and abetting statute requires only that the underlying crime was committed by someone other than the defendant and that the defendant her self either acted or failed to act with the specific intent of advancing the commission of the underlying crime.united states smith,cir quoting united states pipola,cir see.with respect to the underlying mail fraud,the government had to prove three elements a scheme to defraud,money or property as the object of the scheme,and use of the mails to further the scheme.united states shellef,cir quotation mark omitted.the government carried this burden.
at trial,there was no dispute that the lodging reimbursement claim submitted to chubb as part of the duke drive claim was fraudulent.the only real issue was whether litwok intentionally assisted that fraud the law is well established that the government may secure conviction based solely on circumstantial evidence,provided it is sufficient to prove the elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states abu jihaad,cir,cert.denied,d.the primary evidence of litwok intent was the false receipt submitted for additional living expenses at the guesthouse.although the evidence was hardly overwhelming,we conclude that a rational trier of fact could find that litwok helped to obtain the false receipt based on the following the duke drive claim form listed litwok as the contact person,and litwok contacted chubb to discuss the claim litwok name appeared on the false receipt the fraud proceeds were deposited into an account that litwok jointly controlled there was no evidence that eilat,whose name also appeared on the receipt,procured the receipt or benefited from the insurance claim and eilat alleged that litwok had forged her signature on the duke drive and aborigine way claims and the settlement checks.
in addition,the transcript of the recorded conversation between litwok and lehr suggests that litwok was aware of the receipt at the time it was procured and submitted.the transcript also indicates that litwok was aware of certain details of the false insurance claim relating to the stay at the guesthouse,and knew where the fraud proceeds were deposited.the jury was entitled to infer from this evidence that litwok knowledge of these facts was due to her involvement in the scheme to defraud chubb.
the transcript also documents litwok attempts to explain the suspicious circumstances surrounding the fraudulent receipt and cover up the fraud.litwok efforts to cover up the fraud against chubb constitute only evidence of consciousness of guilt and,without more,such evidence is insufficient proof on which to convict where other evidence of guilt is weak and the evidence before the court is as hospitable to an interpretation consistent with the defendant innocence as it is to the government theory of guilt.united states ogando,cir quoting united states johnson,cir.
taken together,however,all of the evidence marshaled at trial,including the other portions of the transcript unrelated to litwok attempt to cover up the fraud,sufficed to show that litwok alone was in a position both to help procure the false receipt and benefit from the proceeds of the fraud,that she intended to assist in the fraud,and that she was aware that her conduct was unlawful.
pointing to the lack of evidence that she signed any of the chubb settlement checks,litwok asserts that there was no evidence that she shared in the proceeds of the fraud.but the postal inspector testified that funds from her joint account were used to purchase artwork sent to litwok from a gallery owned by ruth vered the name that appeared on the guesthouse receipt.moreover,in litwok taped conversation with lehr,litwok herself implicitly attests both to the connection between the artwork and the money in her joint account and to her knowledge that the account contained fraudulently obtained funds by assuring lehr that litwok was not going to testify to art work or a check,or anything.the inspector testimony and that of litwok former assistant,kratochvil,reinforced the government argument that litwok controlled the joint account and was thus aware of,and benefited from,the fraudulent transaction related to the lodging reimbursement.
at trial,litwok also argued that eilat had defrauded chubb and had framed litwok.but the jury was entitled to weigh the evidence and reject that contention.see united states torres,cir w e defer to a jury assessments with respect to credibility and conflicting testimony,and to its choice between the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.the jury was presented with evidence relating to the aborigine way claim,which was admitted without objection from litwok and from which the jury could have inferred that litwok was personally involved in a larger fraudulent scheme that included the false lodging reimbursement claim.for example,the postal inspector testified that,when he visited the duke drive home and found the patio furniture that had been purportedly damaged at the aborigine way house,litwok asked him not to confiscate her furniture.similarly,both the duke drive and the aborigine way claims included false estimates of damages from litwok home contractor.both claims also reported the same type of damage requiring the same type of repairs specifically,water damage requiring repair or replacement of hardwood floors.
from all of this evidence the jury could infer that litwok was involved in a fraudulent scheme that included the submission of the aborigine way claim,the duke drive claim,and,in particular,the duke drive lodging reimbursement claim charged in the indictment.evaluating the evidence not in isolation but in conjunction,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the mail fraud conviction.id.
b.the tax evasion convictions 
with respect to the tax evasion counts of conviction under,the government was required to prove three elements at trial the existence of a substantial tax debt,willfulness of the nonpayment,and an affirmative act by the defendant,performed with intent to evade or defeat the calculation or payment of the tax.united states josephberg,cir.litwok contends that,at most,the evidence indicated that she failed to file her returns,which does not satisfy the third element requiring some affirmative act.while we agree that failing to file a tax return does not by itself constitute an affirmative act,united states romano,cir,we conclude that there was sufficient proof that litwok engaged in an affirmative act to evade taxes in.by contrast,we conclude that there was insufficient evidence of any such act relating to the calendar years and.
i tax count 
we have previously described as examples of affirmative acts conduct such as making false statements to the irs for the purpose of evading taxes,united states klausner,cir,establishing accounts in the names of other entities to conceal income,josephberg,at,and handling of one affairs to avoid making the records usual in transactions of the kind,id.quoting spies united states.more broadly,we have held that a n affirmative act includes any conduct,the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.klausner,at quoting spies,at.
with these principles in mind,we review the evidence relating to the tax evasion count for count two.the most significant testimony relating to that co
