joe oronoz,larry pitts,craig kaufman,and cheryl kaufman filed two separate class action complaints against the county of los angeles.the plaintiffs allege that the county imposed new utility user taxes without prior approval by the voters as required by law.they also allege that the collection of utility user taxes from persons residing or operating businesses in unincorporated areas of the county,but not from those residing or operating businesses in incorporated areas,violates equal protection.the superior court consolidated the two actions and certified the consolidated action as a class action.the county petitioned this court for a writ of mandate,challenging the class certification.
the county contends the order granting class certification was error because the county claims ordinance did not authorize class claims,and the plaintiffs claim did not strictly comply with the claims ordinance requirements.the county contends woosley state of california cal th,d,woosley requires strict compliance with claims presentation requirements and the rule from city of san jose superior court cal d,san jose,that class claims are permissible under government code section is inapplicable.we conclude that the rule from san jose,rather than woosley,governs tax refund claims under government code section absent a specific tax refund statute,that class claims are permissible under section,and that the county claims ordinance is inapplicable.we decline to follow overbroad language in other court of appeal opinions stating that class action claims are not allowed in any tax refund litigation.we conclude that the county has not shown error and deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
joe oronoz,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,presented a claim to the county in february seeking damages for purportedly illegal utility user taxes collected since from persons residing in unincorporated areas of the county.the county did not act on the claim.
oronoz and larry pitts filed a class action complaint in may,no.alleging that utility user taxes are imposed through telephone bills,electricity bills,and gas bills of utility companies and remitted to the county.the plaintiffs alleged that the county established the utility user taxes in january by enacting the utility user tax ordinance county code,et.they alleged that the taxes are imposed only on persons who reside or operate businesses in unincorporated areas of the county,and that the funds go to the county general fund and are not segregated for particular uses.the plaintiffs alleged that voter approval of the taxes was required by propositions and and that the county never sought or obtained voter approval.they alleged that the plaintiff class had presented a claim to the county and that the county had not accepted the claim.the plaintiffs alleged counts for violation of proposition,violation of proposition,violation of equal protection under the california and federal constitutions,and declaratory relief.
craig kaufman and cheryl kaufman filed a similar complaint in may,no.alleging the same four counts.they also alleged that the county had not accepted a claim presented on behalf of the plaintiff class.the court later consolidated the two actions.
the county demurred to the complaint by oronoz and pitts,arguing,among other things,that the plaintiffs had failed to allege that each member of the class had presented a claim to the county prior to filing suit.the county argued that the claim presented by oronoz purportedly on behalf of the other class members was unauthorized the court overruled the demurrer to the first,second,and fourth counts and sustained the demurrer to the third count,on another basis,with leave to amend.the plaintiffs then filed a consolidated first amended complaint in december alleging the same four counts.
the plaintiffs moved for class certification in august.the county opposed the motion,arguing,among other things,that the purported class members other than oronoz were not entitled to relief because they failed to present an individual claim for a tax refund for each class member.the court granted the motion for class certification and certified the action as a class action in an order filed on january.
the county filed a motion to decertify the class in february,renewing its argument that each member of the plaintiff class was required to present a claim before filing suit and that the class claim presented by oronoz on behalf of others similarly situated was invalid as to persons other than oronoz.the court denied the motion and stayed the proceedings to allow the county to petition this court for an extraordinary writ.
the county filed a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the class certification order.we issued an order to show cause and stayed all trial court proceedings in order to decide the important legal questions presented.
contentions 
the county contends class members who failed to present individual claims against the county can not maintain this action because they failed to comply with the county claims presentation requirements.the county contends a class claim for a tax refund is permissible only if the legislature expressly authorized class claims,and the claim must strictly comply with the prescribed requirements the county claims ordinance does not expressly authorize a class claim for a tax refund and the plaintiffs claim did not strictly comply with the claims ordinance requirements.we discuss the parties contentions in more detail in section of the discussion,post.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review an order granting class certification for abuse of discretion.a trial court is accorded great discretion in ruling on class certification.a ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless it is based on either an improper criterion or an erroneous legal assumption.linder thrifty oil cal th,d.the county challenges the order here based on what the county contends were erroneous legal assumptions with respect to the validity of the plaintiffs class claim.we review those questions of law de novo.

the public entity must act on the claim within days after the claim was presented,unless the parties agree to extend the period,subds.a,b.if the public entity fails to act within the time provided,the claim is deemed rejected,subd.c.the public entity must provide written notice of its action on the claim or of the claim rejection by operation of law.
the purpose of requiring a claim is to provide the public entity sufficient information to enable it to adequately investigate claims and to settle them,if appropriate,without the expense of litigation.citations.citation.phillips desert hospital dist.cal d.accordingly,a claim under government code section is sufficient if there is some compliance with all of the statutory requirements and the claim discloses sufficient information to enable the public entity adequately to investigate the merits of the claim so as to settle the claim,if appropriate.san jose,supra,cal d at.the latter inquiry is known as the substantial compliance test.ibid.
government code section,subdivision a states that the claims presentation requirement concerning claims for money or damages against local public entities does not apply to c laims under the revenue and taxation code or other statute prescribing procedures for the refund,rebate,exemption,cancellation,amendment,modification or adjustment of any tax,assessment,fee or charge or any portion thereof,or of any penalties,costs or charges related thereto.italics added.section,subdivision a does not except the plaintiffs claim from the government claims act claims presentation requirement because no statute other than the government claims act statutes prescribes procedures to claim a refund or other adjustment of the county utility user taxes section of the county code,which governs certain claims against the county,is not a statute within the meaning of government code section,subdivision a and therefore does not invoke section,subdivision a,defines statute for purposes of tit,div.of the,which includes,as an act adopted by the legislature of this state or by the congress of the united states,or a statewide initiative act volkswagen pacific,city of los angeles cal d,held that tax refund claims procedures prescribed by a city ordinance and charter provision did not establish an exception under,subd.a because the local enactments were not statutes.
los angeles county code chapter 
los angeles county code chapter et establishes a claims presentation requirement for certain claims against the county and prescribes procedures for those claims.county code section states pursuant to section of the government code,all claims against the county of los angeles for money or damages which are excepted by section of the government code from the provisions of division of the government code section et,and which are not governed by any other statutes or regulations expressly relating thereto,shall be governed by the procedure prescribed in this chapter.section prescribes certain procedural requirements for such a claim and states that the claim must comply with the requirements of government code section.
the plaintiffs argued in the trial court,and the trial court concluded,that section of the county code governs the claim here.the county also argues that section applies.we construe the plain language of section to mean that chapter of the county code applies to a claim only if the claim is excepted from the government claims act claims presentation requirement by government code section,and is not governed by any other statute or regulation expressly relating to the claim.our conclusion that government code section does not except the plaintiffs claim from the government claims act claims presentation requirement compels the conclusion that chapter of the county code,including county code section,does not apply

san jose stated further to satisfy the claims statutes,the class claim must provide the name,address,and other specified information concerning the representative plaintiff and then sufficient information to identify and make ascertainable the class itself.because such information would meet the statutory requirements of name and address,any effort to identify the class would satisfy the some compliance test.beyond this,the sufficiency of the identifying information must be measured by the substantial compliance test.san jose,supra,cal d at.

woosley stated that article xiii,section of the california constitution expressly provides that actions for tax refunds must be brought in the manner prescribed by the legislature,and that t his constitutional limitation rests on the premise that strict legislative control over the manner in which tax refunds may be sought is necessary so that governmental entities may engage in fiscal planning based on expected tax revenues.citation.woosley,supra,cal th at,d.woosley stated further that article xiii,section precludes this court from expanding the methods for seeking tax refunds expressly provided by the legislature.woosley,supra,at,d.
