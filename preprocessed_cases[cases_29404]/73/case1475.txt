section of the internal revenue code,requires producers and importers of diesel fuel to pay a tax on any sale of that fuel.producers pass these taxes on to the consumer in the price of the fuel.some uses of diesel fuel,such as for farming,are exempt from taxation.these tax exempt uses qualify the purchaser of diesel fuel to recover those fuel taxes in the form of a refund under l or in the form of a tax credit under a.
for the taxable years and,western claimed credits for diesel fuel taxes under and for and for.later,western discovered additional diesel fuel purchases that qualified under as nontaxable uses and filed amendments to its original tax returns.these first amendments claimed an additional credit of for and for.the irs allowed these amendments and paid the refund.the government now argues that it allowed these claims by mistake,but concedes the statute of limitations bars their recovery.
later western discovered still more tax exempt purchases and sought to amend its returns a second time.thus,in september,western sought an additional for tax year and an additional for tax year.in february,the irs denied these last two amended claims.the irs based its denial of western claims on a purported violation of the rule in i

general as provided in paragraphs,and,not more than one claim may be filed under subsection a,b,c,d,g,h,l,or q by any person with respect to fuel used during his taxable year,and no claim shall be allowed under this paragraph with respect to fuel used during any taxable year unless filed by the purchaser not later than the time prescribed by law for filing a claim for credit or refund of overpayment of income tax for such taxable year.
in its second amended tax return for,western also reported a change in taxable income on its form in the amount of.during the processing of this amended return,the irs miscoded this amount as a return ftf penalty under f.consequently,on january,western received a final notice of intent to levy on its assets to recover unpaid taxes.this notice did not explain the basis for the levy.moreover,western had not received any prior notice of assessment for the alleged unpaid tax.shortly thereafter,mark cox contacted the irs for western and requested an explanation of the basis for the levy amount.the irs told cox that the amount was a fraud penalty.the irs record of this inquiry further noted that western requests more info on fraud penalty.the irs promised to send the requested explanation of the mistaken fraud allegation.
thereafter,the irs sent western a record of accounts,which included two pages containing four numbers that,when added together,totaled the amount sought by the irs as a fraud penalty.that total amount,including interest accrued,was.meanwhile,the irs owed western as a highway use tax refund.in a letter dated april,the irs notified western that it would withhold that refund to offset western alleged tax liabilities.that letter did not refer to the fraud penalty,but only to the amount of offset.in september,cox and other western representatives met with the irs william cappleman to discuss the disallowed claims for diesel fuel taxes.according to cox affidavit,he informed cappleman about the alleged fraud penalty,and cappleman stated he would look into the matter.cappleman,on the other hand,has no recollection of any discussion of a fraud penalty in that meeting.
cox continued to request information from the irs about the fraud penalty and the irs withholding of western tax refund as an offset.finally,the irs responded that western would receive a copy of the original notice of assessment by april.western still has not received that notice or any other documented information to this date.western first learned that the alleged penalty was an ftf penalty resulting from the mistaken coding of western amended tax return at a status conference in this case in the trial court.the irs,as a result of its own research,acknowledged it had made an error and that the ftf penalty was erroneous.however,the irs refused to refund the withheld to offset the erroneous penalty because the limitations period for western to file a formal administrative claim for a refund had already expired.
western brought this action to recover the diesel fuel tax credits it claimed in its second amended tax returns for the tax years and,totaling and.western also seeks refund of the withheld in satisfaction of the admittedly erroneous ftf penalty.the government filed a motion to dismiss western first claim under.fed.cl.b,because the rule found in i barred western claims for diesel fuel tax credits.the government also sought to dismiss western second claim for recovery of the erroneous ftf penalty under.fed.cl.b as barred by the substantial variance doctrine of a.
the court of federal claims,departing from its previous holding in schlumberger technology subsidiaries united states,fed.cl,held that the rule in i applies to claims for credit filed under a.accordingly,the court below granted the government motion to dismiss those claims.the court below also found that a,which requires the filing of an administrative claim with the irs before a party may seek to recover wrongful penalties in court,was a jurisdictional bar to recovery of the ftf penalty in this action.western timely appealed both decisions.this court has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the court of federal claims under a.

in schlumberger,the court of federal claims held that the limitation found in i did not apply to claims for tax credits under a,because the substantive grant of authority to issue tax credits for the overpayment of diesel fuel taxes is not found in,but rather in.schlumberger,fed.cl.at.the in that case alternatively argued that,even if the rule applied,it would not bar an amendment to a timely filed claim.however,because the court agree d with the plaintiff primary the rule contained in i does not act as a bar to a claim for credit under,it did not decide the alternative argument raised at that time.
in this case,the court of federal claims came to the opposite conclusion.in essence,the court found that the substantive grant of authority to issue tax credits for overpaid diesel fuel taxes is found in l,which,as in effect in,states 
l nontaxable uses of diesel fuel and aviation fuel taxed under section.
in as provided in subsection k and in paragraphs and of this subsection,if any fuel on which tax has been imposed by section is used by any person in a nontaxable use,the secretary shall pay without interest to the ultimate purchaser of such fuel an amount equal to the aggregate amount of tax imposed on such fuel under section.
l supp.v.that section refers to k 
k income tax credit in lieu of payment.
persons not subject to income shall be made under this section only to 
a the united states or an agency or instrumentality thereof,a state,a political subdivision of a state,or any agency or instrumentality of one or more states or political subdivisions,or 
b an organization exempt from tax under section a other than an organization required to make a return of the tax imposed under subtitle a for its taxable year.
shall not apply to a payment of a claim filed under paragraph,or of subsection i.
allowance of credit against income allowances of credit against the income tax imposed by subtitle a for fuel used or resold by the purchaser,see section.
k.finally,referred to in k above,provides 
a general shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle for the taxable year an amount equal to the sum of the amounts payable to the taxpayer 
under section 
a with respect to fuels used for nontaxable purposes 
during the taxable year determined without regard to section k.
b shall not be allowed under subsection a for any amount payable under section or,if a claim for such amount is timely filed and,under section j or k,is payable under such section.
based on the language of these statutes,the court of federal claims in this case correctly concluded that the limitation in i applies to credits under.subsection i clearly applies to l,which refers to k,which refers to dealing with credits.section,in turn,incorporates to determine the amount payable to the taxpayer under that section.section expressly excludes subsection k of from that analysis.significantly,subsection k is the only portion of excluded by.thus,incorporates i with its one claim limitation.section could have excluded i as it does k if it meant to exclude the one claim rule from tax refunds under.as noted,does not exclude the one claim rule,but incorporates it into application of its tax credit rules.thus,to restate,states that the credit must equal an amount payable to the taxpayer under,including all relevant provisions except subsection k.when the one claim rule of i operates,then the amount payable under is zero.consequently,any credit sought under a in such a case would also be zero.
with respect to incorporation of the limitation into,the trial court analysis is persuasive and.therefore,this court affirms the holding of the court of federal claims that the rule in i applies to credits claimed under a.see generally western,fed.cl.at.
however,that holding does not dispose of western claim for a credit in this case.the court of federal claims opinion obviously assumed that western amended tax returns are barred as new claims,because its opinion contains no further analysis or finding regarding the operation of the rule.this court finds that assumption to be in error.the trial court correctly stated that the legislative history in this area is unhelpful and inconclusive in discerning whether congress intended to apply the rule to tax credits under.id.at.likewise,the trial court regarded a general counsel memorandum and revenue rulings as providing little or no value in determining whether the rule applied to credits under.id.at.while this may be true,the legislative history,general counsel memorandum,and revenue rulings provide insight on the purpose of the rule and,specifically,whether timely amendments to annual claims are barred as new claims.
western argues that the one claim limitation in i does not bar timely amendments to a properly filed annual claim.nothing in the statutory language or history suggests that i changes the standard procedure allowing a taxpayer to amend a properly filed claim.in other words,i does not expressly limit the taxpayer to the filing of a single claim each year.to the contrary,a reasonable analysis of the history of the rule reveals its purpose as preventing a party from filing multiple claims for refunds of relatively small amounts,thus multiplying the administrative burdens of supplying credits.stated differently,the purpose of the limitation is to require a claim for refund to encompass all transactions for an entire year,rather than claims for short time periods and small amounts.the rule found in i first appeared in in,dealing with gasoline used on farms,and,dealing with gasoline used for or local transit systems.see act of april,stat.highway revenue act of,stat.in,the revenue code introduced quarterly claims as an exception to the rule for refunds due under.see,s,stat.the senate report addressing this exception states 
where the tax ultimately does not have to be paid because of the use for purposes or in local transit systems it seems unfair to permit a credit or refund only on an annual basis.although this may be justified on administrative grounds where the amount of the claim is relatively small,it is believed that this is not the case where the amount involved in a quarter is or more.
cong,reprinted in at.thus,quarterly claims of or more justified the administrative cost of processing those claims.nothing in the language or history of that section prevents amendments to those quarterly claims.the code indicates that the amount of refund due after one quarter,rather than one year,justifies the processing expense of the claim.in other words,the claim need only cover three months of eligible fuel purchases.
in a general counsel memorandum,the irs chief counsel expressly stated the prevailing opinion regarding the operation of the rule found in,which deals with gasoline used on farms 
section b provides that not more than one claim may be filed for the period ending june.the most obvious result of such provision,and probably the prime reason for it,is the predisposition of what might have become quite an administrative problem.absent the prohibition against filing more than one claim,a farmer would legally have a valid refund claim for overpayment of excise taxes each time he makes a purchase within the meaning of section.this would mean that the farmer would be able to flood the district director with many refund claims involving relatively small amounts.congress eliminated such possibility by requiring a lump sum refund at the end of the year.
it is not believed that the prohibition against filing more than one refund claim necessarily precludes the filing of an amended claim,if the original refund claim was timely filed.this is because an amended claim,if timely filed,merely perfects the original claim and thus falls without the reason for the prohibition against filing more than one claim per year.
couns.mem.april.this position was affirmed to the public in revenue ruling,and revenue ruling.
these general counsel memoranda and revenue rulings merely represent the position of the united states and do not bind this court.vons companies,united states,fed.cl.nonetheless,such memoranda may be relevant in a refund suit as indicating the irs interpretation of its own regulations and procedures.id.revenue rulings may also provide some guidance as to the correct interpretation of the internal revenue code.see int l bus.mach.united states,fed.cl,ridenour united states.in other words,this court may refer to general counsel memoranda and revenue rulings for guidance and accept that reasoning in whole or in part to assist its understanding of the language of the revenue code.with that guidance in mind,this court finds that the position set forth in general counsel memorandum reflects well the purpose and operation of the limitation.although a claim must encompass all transactions for the full year,the taxpayer may amend that claim during the period allotted for such amendments.
finally,and most importantly,absent express statutory language or legislative history to the contrary,this court will interpret the internal revenue code to operate fairly and reasonably.a private letter ruling relating to refunds for gasoline tax under indicates the irs also seeks fairness and equity in the application of the tax code
