opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered on march,on a plea of guilty in the district court.the government initiated the case on april,when it filed an information against appellant neal hall hall and his wife,blonde,charging them each with three counts of willful failure to file income tax returns in violation of.on may,hall and his wife,pursuant to plea agreements,entered pleas of guilty to each of the three counts of the information.on march,the district court sentenced each defendant to a custodial term to be followed by terms of supervised release.moreover,the court imposed a fine on each defendant.hall now challenges the procedure the district court followed when he entered his plea and also challenges the sentence the court imposed.in particular,hall contends that when he entered his plea of guilty the court failed to exercise the special care required during colloquies in cases involving tied plea agreements usually called package deal agreements,the government breached its promise in the plea agreement to m ake no recommendation as to the sentence,and the court imposed an unreasonably long custodial sentence on him.has not appealed.
ii.facts and procedural history 
hall,an ophthalmologist,and,an attorney,are residents of philadelphia,pennsylvania.during the times germane to these proceedings hall operated ophthalmic associates,flourtown eye associates and milan designer eyewear in flourtown,pennsylvania,and wilmington eye associates in delaware,and practiced law through hall associates,llc,a law firm in philadelphia.in,hall incorporated ophthalmic research associates ora,a organization in west chester,pennsylvania,with hall as its chairperson and as its secretary and treasurer.
the government information charged that defendants willfully failed to file income tax returns for,and.after negotiations through separate attorneys,defendants entered into tied plea agreements with the government,each agreement being conditioned on the entry of a guilty plea by the other defendant.among other terms the government plea agreement with hall included the following provision 
at the time of sentencing,the government will 
make no recommendation as to the sentence.
comment on the evidence and circumstances of the case bring to the court attention all facts relevant to sentencing including evidence relating to dismissed counts,if any,and to the character and any criminal conduct of the defendant address the court regarding the nature and seriousness of the offense respond factually to questions raised by the court correct factual inaccuracies in the presentence report or sentencing record and rebut any statement of facts made by or on behalf of the defendant at sentencing.
nothing in this agreement shall limit the government in its comments in,and responses to,any matters.
app.at.plea agreement,however,did not prohibit the government from making a recommendation as to her sentence.as will be seen this distinction is at the core of one of the issues hall raises on this appeal.
on may,the district court conducted a joint plea hearing for defendants,who were present and represented by separate attorneys throughout the hearing,pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.that rule requires that before accepting a plea of guilty the court must determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force,threats or promises other than promises in a plea agreement.b.during the hearing,the court engaged in a colloquy with hall to determine whether his plea was voluntary that included the following exchanges 
the court do you also understand that i will ask you questions to satisfy myself that you are competent and able to enter a plea,and to satisfy myself that you are knowingly and voluntarily giving up your rights in entering this plea 
the defendant yes.
the court if at any time you do understand what i saying,you want to repeat anything,please let me know,okay 
the defendant yes.
the court and if at any time you want to speak to your lawyer,miller,you let me know,we take a continuance,and we recess this matter for as long as you need to speak with your counsel,all right 
the defendant yes,thank you.
the court you have an attorney 
the defendant yes.
the court miller 
the defendant yes.
the court and have you had ample opportunity to discuss your case with miller 
the defendant yes.
the court and are you satisfied with miller representation of you 
the defendant yes.
the court has anyone made any threats or promises or assurances to you of any kind,other than what is set forth in the plea agreement to convince or induce you to plead guilty in this case 
the defendant no.
the court now,you have heard me discuss with your wife the government condition of this case,that it would not negotiate a plea agreement with only one of you,that either both of you pled guilty or you both went to trial.you heard me discuss that with her 
the defendant yes.
the court and you have discussed that with your counsel 
the defendant yes.
the court and are you voluntarily and freely electing to plead guilty,because you think,after consulting with your lawyer,it is in your best interest to do so 
the defendant yes.
app.at.following the district court colloquies with defendants it accepted their pleas of guilty to the three counts of willful failure to file income tax returns.
on march,the district court conducted a sentencing hearing for both hall and his wife.after the court denied each defendant motion for a downward departure from the applicable base offense level,it concluded that both had base offense levels of which,when combined with their criminal history categories of i,yielded a sentencing range of to months.
the district court then considered defendants motions for variances pursuant to attorney began the arguments on the motions by contending that a variance would be appropriate because defendants had paid,or were expected to pay,the amounts that they owed in taxes,and they would not in the future fail to file tax returns because they had implemented a payroll service in their respective businesses that would withhold taxes.attorney also referred to defendants lifestyles,stating that the halls do not live a lavish life style,and that t hey are by no measure wealthy.supp.app.at.after attorney finished his remarks,made a personal allocution.
following allocution,hall attorney made his arguments in support of hall motion for a variance.he began by referring to his earlier arguments referencing hall charitable work and poor health.hall attorney then argued that a variance would be appropriate because the nature and circumstances of the offense warranted one.supp.app.at.according to hall attorney 
this is not a case and i think this is important,because what i about to say really takes hall and for the sic matter,takes hall outside the heartland of offenders who really seek to cheat the government out of taxes.this is not a case about greed.this is not a case about willful evasion.there is no evidence in the record that any of the money that should have gone to pay taxes was spent on luxury items.was spent on vacations or clothing or cars or anything like that.that simply not the case with both defendants.
quite to the contrary,they live a very modest life style.they have old cars,old clothes,a home in need of repair.they taken one vacation in the last ten years.this is simply not a case about greed.and for that matter,i believe they fall outside,certainly hall and hall,for that matter,fall outside the heartland of offenders who are seeking to cheat the government out of taxes,your honor.
id.hall attorney also argued that a variance was appropriate based on hall payments of the taxes that he owed and his acceptance of responsibility for his crimes.
after hall attorney completed his argument,hall gave his allocution following which the government responded to both defendants arguments.without specifying at the outset the defendant to whom it was referring,the government made the following statement 
section a compels that we first look at the nature and circumstances of the offense.and make no mistake here,the offense is failure to file returns.this is not a case before your honor of people who are being charged with failure to pay all they owed,having filed a return.people who could because of juggling financial responsibilities,come good on april.this is a case where for ten years,no tax returns were filed.this is a case of miscalculation.we filed a return.we innocently thought that travel and entertainment and car expenses were deductible and so we deducted it in good faith.but it turns out,no,that wrong,so we did pay them.
this is a case where,for ten years,no tax returns were filed.no taxes were paid.and not just federally.no city wage,no state tax.the only tax that has been paid here is property tax,because otherwise,the bank comes and takes your property.
a decision not to file a return is a decision that you make every single day for ten years.every april,when all your friends and colleagues are talking about having to file,it a decision that you know you are making.so,i think,first of all,it important to look at the offense and what the offense is.and the offense is fairly stark.
supp.app.at.
at this point,the government distinguished between hall and his wife by stating addressing blonde first and again,i will just say for the record that my comments concerning neal hall will be very limited,because i do not want to run afoul of united states,cir.supp.app.at.the government proceeded to discuss assets.during that discussion,it stated 
i believe,she and neal,between them have either sic or nine accounts that have been charged off and that are in collection status or vice versa.it a huge number of creditors who have been stiffed,just like the government.it is a choice on their part.it is a choice to own property and not pay taxes.it is a choice to have hundreds of thousands of dollars of income and not pay taxes.
supp.app.at.the government then prefaced its subsequent arguments with the words as to blonde hall,supp.app.at,and described educational and professional background.the government challenged her claim that she did not know she owed taxes,arguing that if she did believe she owned sic money she could have file d the tax returns showing no liability,and that s he did do that,because she knew she did owe taxes and she knew that the irs would reject her return as bogus.supp.app.at.
after arguing that statements concerning her lack of knowledge were not credible,the government addressed defendants arguments concerning their charitable works.the government specifically addressed ora,arguing 
ora was this charity that neal and blonde hall started.and i think,significantly,in terms of understanding that charity,it should be understood that neal acquired a building in his name in west chester,in his personal name.the halls,blonde in particular,well,the halls then solicited donations for the renovation of the building for the work of ora.but they did not disclose to the foundations and private contributors,that this building was owned in his name.so,in essence,they are getting charitable contributions to improve a facility that building that he owns in his own name.
supp.app.at.the government argued that what this money did,they basically solicited charitable money to improve their own station.to improve their own place in life,to improve their own financial standing.supp.app.at.the government then added,i think that also speaks to who blonde hall is as a person,one of the factors under a.supp.app.at.
the government concluded its response with the following statement 
finally,i want to just very briefly address a which requires that the sentence that you impose promote respect for the law and provide adequate deterrence.i think that just incredibly important in a crime.people pay attention to crime sic likes sic this.i gotten a phone call from a doctor in the community who read about this in the paper.and wants to know what their sentence is when they are sentenced.
you know,it calls to mind the statement of,was it leona helmsly,taxes are for little people.in other words,when you have the bus driver job,the fireman job,the taxes are withheld.but when you a doctor or a lawyer,do you have to pay taxes and is there a penalty if you do.is there a penalty beyond just,well,yes,now your building appreciated all this much and the irs is going to take their penalty,but maybe your real estate has appreciated more than the irs penalty is going to sock you for,so you still come out ahead.or maybe,you get away with it entirely,in this case,because we are past the statute of limitations for some of the years.there will be no penalty for some of the years for which no returns were filed and no taxes paid.
so,i think that in terms of the public perception of whether or not this is a significant crime,it necessary to have a sentence of imprisonment.and nastasi counsel is right,i am asking for the top of the guidelines as to blonde hall.it necessary to have a significant sentence of imprisonment to show people that,yes,you really do have to file your returns and pay taxes.it really is a significant crime.it may be white collar.maybe nobody gets hurt.maybe,you know,there no gun,no threat of violence.but it has a significant impact.and it is a significant crime.
supp.app.at.the government added that for those reasons,as to blonde hall,i do ask for a sentence at the top of the guidelines.and as to neal hall,consistent with the government plea agreement,it makes no recommendation.supp.app.at.
following the government argument,the district court sentenced to months imprisonment and an additional months of supervised release,and imposed a fine of.the district court then sentenced hall.the court observed that he is a highly educated,highly intelligent man who has acknowledged that he knew he was obligated to file tax returns but repeatedly failed to do so.supp.app.at.among the district court considerations was the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offenses to which hall pled guilty to promote respect for the law,t o provide just punishment,t o afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public from any further crimes.supp.app.at.although the court noted that it did not believe hall will commit any other crimes,it stated that it believe d that hall brought the law into disrespect when a licensed doctor simply fails to file tax returns for year after year after year.supp.app.at.the district court explained that it believe d a sentence of incarceration is a sic essential to promote respect for the law and to provide an adequate deterrence in these circumstances.id.the court then imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,followed by months of supervised release,and a fine of,the same sentence that it imposed on.the district court entered judgment against hall on the same date,march.hall then timely appealed.
iii.jurisdiction and standards of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a.hall challenges both the entry of his plea and the imposition of his sentence.with respect to the entry of his plea we evaluate the plea colloquy for plain error because he did not object in the district court.see united states vonn,d.our review of the question of whether the government breached its plea agreement with hall is plenary even though he did not object at the time of the alleged breach.see united states hodge,cir.we review hall sentence on an abuse of discretion basis.see gall united states,d.
iv.discussion 
we begin by noting that even though hall plea agreement included a conditional waiver of his right to appeal,the government has not moved to affirm summarily the appeal or even to limit its scope.we further observe that we retain subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal by a defendant who ha s signed an appellate waiver.united states gwinnett,cir.accordingly,inasmuch as the government addresses hall arguments on the merits,and we have jurisdiction,we will do the same notwithstanding hall waiver of the right to appeal.
a.did the district court exercise special care in determining whether hall plea,which was tied to plea,was voluntary 
hall argues that the district court failed to exercise the special care required in determining whether his plea which he entered as part of a tied plea agreement with the government was voluntary.see hodge,at.but he does not contend that he made this objection during the district court colloquy at the plea hearing.thus,as we indicated above,we review hall special care contention bearing in mind that a defendant who fails to object to rule error must carry the burden of showing on appeal that the error was plain,prejudicial,and disreputable to the judicial system.id.quoting vonn,at.at.in a plain error context,a defendant must show that an error was committed the error was plain,that is,clear and obvious and the error affected the defendant substantial rights.id.internal quotation marks omitted.when those elements are satisfied,an appellate court in its discretion may order a correction if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,on the ground that the district court committed plain error under rule,must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.united states dominguez benitez,d.
we have explained that there is a package deal plea bargain when the government accepts a defendant guilty plea on the condition that his s also plead guilty.hodge,at.as we indicated in hodge,t here is no question that package deal plea bargains are constitutional,a nearly axiomatic conclusion given the nature of our criminal justice system,of which plea bargains are an essential part.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.yet we also have observed that tied plea agreements pose special risks,particularly when a trial court is unaware that defendants pleas are tied together.id.accordingly,to address the risks associated with tied plea agreements,we require that package plea deals be disclosed to the court and colloquies with package plea participants be conducted with special care.id.at.
we have discussed the general terms of what constitutes special care in the context of a plea colloquy involving tied plea agreements 
at the threshold,a district court notified of a package deal plea bargain should question counsel closely to ensure that the precise terms of the package plea deal are on the record.once it is clear exactly how a defendant plea benefits his confederate s,it may be helpful to ask who first proposed the package deal,how extensively defense counsel was involved in developing the deal,and what benefit the defendant expects to gain from the deal.when asking whether a plea is a product of force,threats,or inducements and the like,a district court should take care not to ask only whether the prosecutor forced,threatened,or coerced the defendant,but whether anyone did so.having so inquired,the court should be particularly attuned to even mild expressions of reluctance by a defendant.such expressions always should trigger a more searching inquiry.on the other hand,as none of the defendants may be particularly eager to plead guilty,one defendant expressions of reluctance should be compared to those of other defendants involved in the package deal.
id.at internal citations omitted.we made clear,however,that this set of questions is not a checklist that,if followed,automatically will prevent a rule colloquy from going awry,but instead is a summary of lessons drawn from colloquies evaluated by other courts of appeals.id.at.the overarching rule is that a district court considering a package plea deal should be particularly attentive to a defendant responses to voluntariness questions throughout a plea colloquy.id.that being said,district courts of course should remember that package deal plea bargains are not inherently coercive,and that the judge goal is not to doom the deal but simply to ensure that the defendant plea is voluntary.id.
the record shows that the district court was aware that hall entered his plea as part of a tied plea agreement,and that it adequately exercised the special care required in determining that his plea was voluntary.hall is a individual who graduated from a leading university and thereafter obtained his medical degree from a medical school at another leading university.moreover,his attorney during the plea negotiations and at the plea hearing was separate from and independent of his wife attorney.during his colloquy,the court asked whether anyone had made threats against hall or promises to him to induce his plea,to which he replied no.app.at.it then asked hall whether you are voluntarily and freely electing to plead guilty,because you think,after consulting with your lawyer,it is in your best interest to do so,to which hall responded yes.app.at.the court confirmed that hall had had the opportunity to consult with his attorney,who represented only him and not.indeed,hall demonstrated his awareness of his opportunity to consult with his attorney when,during the government presentation of the factual basis for his plea,he asked the court for permission to talk with his attorney privately,who subsequently clarified a factual point that the government previously had made.there is no indication in the record that hall expressed even mild expressions of reluctance at any point during the plea hearing.hodge,at.
hall argues that the district court questions concerning his plea deviated from those that we have recommended that a court ordinarily should use in considering guilty pleas when there are tied plea agreements.he fails,however,to give any reason for us to suspect that he did not make his plea knowingly and voluntarily although the district court did not ask hall all of the questions that we suggested as examples in hodge for a court to use when considering a package plea agreement,we have noted the supreme court admonition that t he nature of the inquiry required by rule must necessarily vary from case to case,mccarthy united states,d,and that rule should not be given such a crabbed interpretation that ceremony was exalted over substance,vonn,at.at internal quotation marks omitted see hodge,at.we have emphasized that the set of questions that we suggested in hodge is not a checklist,but rather a summary of lessons,and that t he overarching rule is that a district court considering a package plea deal should be particularly attentive to a defendant responses to voluntariness questions throughout a plea colloquy.hodge,at.
hall does not explain,at least not convincingly,how answers to questions that we suggested in hodge that the district court did not ask in this case would have been particularly helpful in a determination of whether he entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily.in fact,we are satisfied that the answers to the unasked suggested hodge questions were not necessary in light of the proceedings before the district court.for example,although the court did not ask hall how he stood to benefit from pleading guilty,the government answered that question by informing the court that as of this agreement,the defendant has demonstrated acceptance of responsibility,making him eligible for a downward adjustment.app.at in short,hall has not identified evidence showing that there is a reasonable probability that,but for the claimed error,he would not have entered the plea.dominguez benitez,at.at.
in reaching our conclusion on the voluntariness question we are struck by the fact that even though hall on this appeal is being represented by experienced counsel who did not represent him in the district court he does not flat out claim that his guilty plea was not voluntary.while we recognize that he does not have to do so inasmuch as dominguez benitez speaks of a reasonable probability,rather than a certainty,of involuntariness,still it might be expected that he would make that claim unequivocally.instead,he indicates that there is good reason to believe his guilty plea was not voluntary,appellant br.at,this case had the potential for involuntariness,and there was a substantial probability that his plea was involuntarily entered,id.at.
in fact the closest he comes to suggesting that there is a basis for believing that his plea might have been involuntary is his point that while his wife,who is an attorney,benefitted substantially from the limitations of her plea,it is not nearly so clear that he faced any significant criminal exposure beyond that to which he pleaded guilty and that s ituations like this are rife with the potential for involuntariness.id.at.to this point hall adds that if questioned closer he might well have revealed that he was pleading guilty solely because of the tied nature of his wife deal with the government,although he himself had little if anything to gain.id.at.
we,however,reject as a matter of law a conclusion that a defendant who pleads guilty with his or her jointly charged defendant,whether or not his or her spouse,merely by entering that plea no matter how much it benefits the other defendant and how little it benefits the defendant challenging the plea has acted involuntarily.moreover,in this case there is a special reason to reject the theory that a tied plea agreement is involuntary merely because the defendants receive unequal benefits from it because hall,who benefitted from his guilty plea,just as he may have benefitted from her guilty plea,is as different as can be from the type of in many of the cases we see and hardly would have been likely to have threatened or coerced hall into entering a plea of guilty.we do not understand how a court could regard a guilty plea as involuntary merely because the defendant pleading guilty assisted his or her spouse more than he assisted himself or herself for it is natural that a defendant would want to assist his or her spouse in any event a conclusion that tied pleas with unbalanced benefits are suspect inevitably would doom tied plea agreements as that approach frequently would open up such agreements to involuntariness challenges on the basis of an analysis of the comparative benefits to the defendants of the tied plea agreements.
on the record,then,we conclude that the district court exercised the special care required in its colloquy concerning the voluntariness of hall plea,and accordingly we find no error in its acceptance of his plea.
b.did the government breach its plea agreement with hall requiring that it m ake no recommendation as to the sentence,by arguing that hall failure to file tax returns,to which both hall and his pleaded guilty,warranted a sentence of imprisonment 
hall contends that the government breached its plea agreement with him by making prohibited statements during the sentencing hearing.the plea agreement provided that the government would m ake no recommendation as to the sentence,but was allowed to c omment on the evidence and circumstances of the case,bring to the court attention all facts relevant to sentencing including evidence relating to the character and any criminal conduct of the defendant,and address the court regarding the nature and seriousness of the offense app.at.hall argues that the government breached the agreement by arguing that the court should impose a sentence of imprisonment on him.the government responds that its comments that hall challenges pertained to rather than to him.
in determining whether the government has breached its plea agreement with a defendant,we apply the de novo standard of review.united states rivera,cir.to the extent,however,that parties dispute the facts of a case,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.united states moscahlaidis,cir.in this case,we do not predicate our determination on the district court findings of fact and thus our review is plenary.
the rules for enforcing plea agreements are well established.w hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor,so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration,such promise must be fulfilled.santobello new york,d.because the defendant,by entering into the plea,surrenders a number of his constitutional rights,courts are compelled to scrutinize closely the promise made by the government in order to determine whether it has been performed.united states,cir quoting united states hayes,cir.
in determining whether the government has breached a plea agreement,a court must determine whether the government conduct is inconsistent with what was reasonably understood by the defendant when entering the plea of guilty.id.quoting united states badaracco,cir.accordingly,we will not permit the government to rely upon a rigidly literal approach to the construction of the terms of the plea agreement.id.quoting moscahlaidis,at.
although t he government need not endorse the terms of its plea agreements enthusiastically,badaracco,at internal quotation marks omitted,it nonetheless must adhere strictly to the terms of the bargain it strikes with defendants.moscahlaidis,at internal quotation marks omitted.t he doctrine that the government must adhere to its bargain in the plea agreement is so fundamental that even though the government breach is inadvertent and the breach probably did not influence the judge in the sentence imposed,due process and equity require that the sentence be vacated,at internal quotation marks omitted.if we find that the government has breached its plea agreement,we remand the case to the district court for it to determine whether to grant specific performance or allow withdrawal of the plea.moscahlaidis,at.
here,as we have indicated,the government promised to m ake no recommendation as to the sentence,rather than take no position regarding hall sentence.app.at.we have pointed out that t he difference between making a recommendation and taking a position is elementary,for the promise not to recommend is narrow,speaking only as to the sentence to be imposed,whereas a promise to take no position speaks to no attempt at all to influence the defendant sentence.united states miller,cir.nevertheless,though the distinction between making a recommendation and taking a position may be elementary in its articulation,it may be difficult to determine in a particular case whether the government at the sentencing made a recommendation or took a position.
the government acknowledges that if it had contended that the court should impose a sentence of imprisonment on hall it would have breached its plea agreement.but the government argues that it directed its statement that the court should impose a sentence of imprisonment solely to.of course,if we conclude that the government directed its recommendation of a sentence of imprisonment at hall,it would not matter whether it did so inadvertent ly,or whether the statements influence d the judge in the sentence imposed,at.
at the sentencing hearing,after briefly discussing the circumstances of the case,as it was permitted to do under the plea agreement,the government noted that almost all of the rest of its comments would pertain to.the government comments strongly suggest that it was aware that it could make no sentencing recommendation as to hall i will just say for the record that my comments concerning neal hall will be very limited,because i do not want to run afoul of nolan cooper.supp.app.at.after making this statement,the government proceeded to address role in the crimes and her circumstances relevant to.id.at.
towards the end of its comments at the hearing,the government argued 
finally,i want to just very briefly address a which requires that the sentence that you impose promote respect for the law and provide adequate deterrence.i think that just incredibly important in a crime.people pay attention to crime sic likes sic this.
is there a penalty for not paying taxes beyond just,well,yes,now your building appreciated all this much and the irs is going to take their penalty,but maybe your real estate has appreciated more than the irs penalty is going to sock you for,so you still come out ahead.or maybe,you get away with it entirely,in this case,because we are past the statute of limitations for some of the years.there will be no penalty for some of the years for which no returns were filed and no taxe
