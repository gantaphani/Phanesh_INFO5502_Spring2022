lawrence ligas appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the government for in unpaid taxes,interest,and penalties.although ligas raises multiple arguments in support of reversal,we need only consider one lack of personal jurisdiction.the government never properly served ligas.it sought multiple extensions of time to effectuate service,asserting that if the case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction,it could not be refiled because the statute of limitations had expired.after giving the government nearly a year to serve ligas,the district court dismissed the government complaint for failure to serve process as required under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.
because the government had imposed two liens on ligas property,ligas subsequently asked the court to extinguish the liens.the district court treated ligas motion as a request for affirmative relief that waived his prior objection to personal jurisdiction and on that basis reinstated the government complaint.that was an error.although jurisdictional defenses may be waived,ligas motion to quash the tax liens was not inconsistent with his jurisdictional objection,which he continuously maintained and on which he prevailed when the district court dismissed the case under rule m.the government tax liens were only valid if the government obtained a judgment against ligas removing them was a consequence of and consistent with the dismissal,since the government had maintained that the suit could not be refiled.ligas motion to quash was not a voluntary submission to the court jurisdiction,so there was no basis to reinstate the government complaint.accordingly,we reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss.
background 
this case stems from lawrence ligas failure to pay more than in taxes,interest,and penalties.between and,ligas reported that he owed in individual federal income tax,but he did not submit payment when he filed his tax returns.in addition,ligas was the president,sole stockholder,and director of ligas,an electrical contracting company,and it,too,owed back taxes.more specifically,the company failed to pay in income and fica taxes it claimed it withheld from employee paychecks in the final three quarters of and the first quarter of.in the internal revenue service determined that ligas was a responsible person of a corporation that willfully failed to pay taxes under and assessed a penalty against him.when ligas failed to pay these assessments,federal tax liens automatically attached to his property under.although the irs accidently released the liens in,they were reinstated in.as of,the government calculated that ligas owed.
on february,just before the statute of limitations expired,the government filed a complaint seeking to reduce to judgment the unpaid assessments of federal income taxes and the penalty.although ligas received a copy of the complaint and summons in the mail,he refused to waive personal service of process.the government thus embarked on an unsuccessful effort to serve ligas.when the government initially encountered difficulty serving ligas within the normal period,it asked the district court for additional time.the district court granted two extensions of time to serve ligas and on september,authorized service by publication as permitted by rule e and.comp.stat.
in late the government missed two obvious chances to accomplish service.following the district court september order authorizing service by publication,irs agents left a copy of the summons and complaint at ligas residence,claimed service by publication was perfected,and moved for default judgment when ligas did not answer the complaint.appearing for the limited purpose of challenging the sufficiency of process,ligas asked the court to vacate the september order and quash the service by publication.at a hearing on december,the district court concluded that the government had not complied with the requirements of.comp.stat.and quashed the service by publication.the court then invited the government to personally serve ligas right then and there he was present in court,having appeared pro se for the hearing.the government attorney did not have a copy of the summons and complaint,however,and the opportunity was lost.the court gave the government a third january,serve ligas.
on january,the third extension of time had government asked for a fourth extension.on march,the court granted the government request and authorized service under rule e and.comp.stat,which allows a court to order service in any manner consistent with due process.the district court permitted the government to serve ligas under section by posting a copy of the complaint and summons on the door to ligas home,mailing copies of the complaint and summons to ligas home by and certified mail,and by faxing the complaint and summons to the number listed on ligas pro se appearance form.
ligas asked the court to reconsider the march order this time he was acting through an attorney,and the district court agreed.two intervening developments persuaded the court to vacate its order.first,labe bank,which held a mortgage on ligas property and was added as a codefendant,had filed and successfully served a complaint by using the sheriff department to personally serve ligas at his home second,one of the private process servers the government used could not provide evidence of its attempts to serve ligas.the district court was troubled by the fact that the government had not used federal or state agencies to try to serve process and instead relied on seemingly inept process servers.taken together,these developments convinced the court that the government had not diligently attempted to serve ligas,had not shown good cause for its failure to serve ligas,and was not entitled to a fourth extension of time.on may,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to serve ligas within the period of time prescribed by rule m.the dismissal was without prejudice,but the government had represented in its motions for extension of time that it could not refile the complaint because the statute of limitations had run.
ligas immediately that very same day moved the court to quash the federal tax liens against his property.this was not the first time ligas had requested such relief he had asked the court to remove the liens in his brief opposing the government fourth request for an extension of time.the government responded with a asking the court to reconsider its may order dismissing the complaint.in the government view,when ligas asked the court to extinguish the liens,he waived any objection to service of process and consented to personal jurisdiction.
in another,the district court agreed.construing ligas motion to quash the liens as a waiver of his previous objections to personal jurisdiction,the court vacated the dismissal order,reinstated the government complaint,and denied the motion to quash.the case proceeded to discovery,and the district court eventually granted the government motion for summary judgment and ordered ligas to pay in back taxes,interest,and penalties.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a district court may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant unless the defendant has been properly served with process,see murphy,michetti pipe stringing,d,and the service requirement is not satisfied merely because the defendant is aware that he has been named in a lawsuit or has received a copy of the summons and the complaint,see mcmasters united states,cir.acceptable methods for service of process are specified in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure the preferred approach is for the plaintiff to mail the defendant a copy of the complaint and summons and obtain a waiver of personal service from the defendant under rule d.but if the defendant does not waive service and if no federal statute otherwise supplies a method for serving process,then rule e list of methods is exclusive personal service rule e a leaving a copy of the complaint and summons at the defendant usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there rule e b delivering a copy of the complaint and summons t
