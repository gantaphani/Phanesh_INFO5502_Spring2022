facts and prior proceedings 
in,appellant marcus katz entered into two collar option contracts covering stock shares he owned katz terminated the collars in september of,which generated a credit of.in october of,katz contributed stock to mk hillside partners mk hillside,a partnership between katz and his wholly owned corporation,mk hillside investors.katz also contributed real estate to the partnership.the partnership then sold the stock and real estate.
katz and mk hillside tax returns were received on september.katz return did not list the credit from the collar termination,and mk hillside return reported no gain on the real estate sale.the irs did not issue a notice of deficiency for katz taxes in july of,katz agreed to extend the time to assess his tax liability,including tax attributable to partnership items,until january.the irs issued a final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa to mk hillside on january,finding that mk hillside was a sham,lacked economic substance,and was formed and used principally to avoid taxes.
katz filed a petition in the tax court contesting that finding and asserting the statute of limitations the irs responded that the section e statute of limitations applied because katz omission of the on his return constituted more than of the gross income reported on the return.katz moved for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that he no longer had an interest in the partnership proceeding under section d,and,in the alternative,that the tax court lacked jurisdiction to consider at the partnership stage whether,due to a gross understatement of nonpartnership income,his tax year remained open at the time he agreed to extend his assessment period.
the tax court denied summary judgment,holding that a trial would be necessary to determine whether katz in fact omitted substantial income from his return,in which case his personal limitations period would have been six years and would have remained open at the time katz agreed to extend his limitations period.to avoid a trial,the parties agreed to a stipulation of facts and a second stipulation of settled issues.based on those stipulations,the tax court held that the period for assessing tax on the mk hillside partnership items was open as to katz.

legal standardsa.partnership taxation 
a partnership does not pay federal income taxes instead,its taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.united states woods,citing.partnerships are required to file an informational tax return,and the partners are required to report their shares of the partnership tax items on their individual tax returns.id.citing,a.before the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra,the irs disputed partnership tax matters through deficiency proceedings concerning individual taxpayers.id.this led to duplicative proceedings and the potential for inconsistent treatment of partners in the same partnership.id.at.tefra addressed these problems by establishing a process.id.first,the irs issues an fpaa notifying the partners of any adjustments to the partnership items,and the partners may seek judicial review of the fpaa.id.citing a,a b.second,once the adjustments are final,the irs may make the resulting computational adjustments to the individual partners tax liability,usually without a deficiency proceeding,in which case the partners only opportunity for further challenge is by way of refund action.id.citing a,c a 
generally,an individual tax return remains open for three years after the return is filed.for partnership items,the period for assessing tax expires no earlier than the later of three years after the date the partnership return was filed,or the last day for filing the partnership return.a.the mailing of a notice of fpaa tolls the statute of limitations until one year after the adjustment becomes final.d.
b.a partner ability to assert a personal statute of limitations in an fpaa proceeding 
partners are treated as parties to a petition for readjustment of the fpaa if they have an interest in the outcome.c d.such an interest exists if the items at issue remain partnership items for that partner and the period within which any tax attributable to the partnership may be assessed against that partner has not yet expired.d.however,even if a partner no longer has an interest in the outcome,it has a limited right specifically to participate in such action solely for the purpose of asserting that the period of limitations for assessing any tax attributable to partnership items has expired with respect to such person,and the court having jurisdiction of such action shall have jurisdiction to consider such assertion.d flush language.
this language is the primary focus of the parties dispute.katz contends that to consider can not mean to determine,except perhaps if the determination is based on certain undisputed facts.the irs contends that to consider an assertion that the statute of limitations has run necessarily requires either accepting or rejecting the assertion.
c.the tax court jurisdiction 
t he tax court,as an article i court,is a court of limited jurisdiction and may only exercise jurisdiction to the extent authorized by congress.adkison comm r,cir.citing estate of branson comm r,cir.tefra provides that 
a court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year,the proper allocation of such items among the partners,and the applicability of any penalty,addition to tax,or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.

katz statutory construction argument fails

katz grounds his argument on the difference in word choice between statutory subsections.while section f grants jurisdiction to determine all partnership items,section d grants jurisdiction to consider a partner assertion of its statute of limitations.katz,citing porter commissioner,argues that congress used determine jurisdictionally in sections e,a,h,and b,and that courts have interpreted determinations in those sections to involve de novo findings.but the standard
