in this case,stavros ganias appeals from a judgment convicting him,following a jury trial,of tax evasion.he challenges the conviction on the grounds that his fourth amendment rights were violated when the government copied three of his computer hard drives pursuant to a search warrant and then retained files beyond the scope of the warrant for more than years.he also contends that his right to a fair trial was violated when,during the trial,a juror posted comments about the case on his facebook page and friended another juror.we reject the second argument but hold that the government retention of the computer records was unreasonable.accordingly,we vacate the conviction and remand for further proceedings.
statement of the case 
a.the facts 
in the,after working for the internal revenue service irs for some fourteen years,ganias started his own accounting business in wallingford,connecticut.he provided tax and accounting services to individuals and small businesses.in,he began providing services to james mccarthy and two of mccarthy businesses,american boiler and industrial property management ipm.ipm had been hired by the army to provide maintenance and security at a vacant army facility in stratford,connecticut.
in august,the criminal investigative command of the army received a tip from a confidential source that individuals affiliated with ipm were engaging in improper conduct,including stealing copper wire and other items from the army facility and billing the army for work that ipm employees performed for american boiler.the source alleged that evidence of the wrongdoing could be found at the offices of american boiler and ipm,as well as at the offices of steve gainis sic,who perform ed accounting work for ipm and american boiler.
based on this information,the army commenced an investigation.army investigators obtained several search warrants,including one to search the offices of ganias accounting business.the warrant,issued by the united states district court for the district of connecticut and dated november,authorized the seizure from ganias offices of 
all books,records,documents,materials,computer hardware and software and computer associated data relating to the business,financial and accounting operations of ipm and american boiler 
the warrant was executed two days later.army computer specialists accompanied investigators to ganias offices and helped gather the electronic evidence.the agents did not seize ganias computers instead,the computer specialists made identical copies,or forensic mirror images,of the hard drives of all three of ganias computers.as a consequence,the investigators copied every file on all three computers including files beyond the scope of the warrant,such as files containing ganias personal financial records.ganias was present as the investigators collected the evidence,and he expressed concern about the scope of the seizure.in response,one agent assured ganias that the army was only looking for files related to american boiler and ipm.everything else,the agent explained,would be purged once they completed their search for relevant files.
back in their offices,the army computer specialist copied the data taken from ganias computers as well as data obtained from the searches of the offices of ipm and american boiler onto two sets of dvds,which were maintained as evidence.some eight months later,the army criminal investigation lab finally began to review the files.
in the meantime,while reviewing the paper documents retrieved from ganias offices,the army discovered suspicious payments made by ipm to an unregistered business,which was allegedly owned by an individual who had not reported any income from that business.based on this evidence,in may,the army invited the irs to join the investigation of ipm and american boiler and gave copies of the imaged hard drives to the irs so that it could conduct its own review and analysis.the army and the irs proceeded,separately,to search the imaged hard drives for files that appeared to be within the scope of the warrant and to extract them for further review.
by december,some thirteen months after the seizure,the army and irs investigators had isolated and extracted the computer files that were relevant to ipm and american boiler and thus covered by the search warrant.the investigators were aware that,because of the constraints of the warrant,they were not permitted to review any other computer records.indeed,the investigators were careful,at least until later,to review only data covered by the november warrant.
they did not,however,purge or delete the files.to the contrary,the investigators retained the files because they viewed the data as the government property,not ganias property.their view was that while items seized from an owner will be returned after an investigation closes,all of the electronic data here were evidence that were to be protected and preserved.as one agent testified,w e would not routinely go into dvds to delete data,as we altering the original data that was seized.and you never know what data you may need in the future i do normally go into electronic data and start deleting evidence off of dvds stored in my evidence room.the computer specialists were never asked to delete or even to try to delete those files that did not relate to ipm or american boiler.
in late,irs investigators discovered accounting irregularities regarding transactions between ipm and american boiler in the paper documents taken from ganias office.after subpoenaing and reviewing the relevant bank records in,they began to suspect that ganias was not properly reporting american boiler income.accordingly,on july,some twenty months after the seizure of his computer files,the government officially expanded its investigation to include possible tax violations by ganias.further investigation in and early indicated that ganias had been improperly reporting income for both of his clients,leading the government to suspect that he also might have been underreporting his own income.
at that point,the irs case agent wanted to review ganias personal financial records and she knew,from her review of the seized computer records,that they were among the files in the dvds copied from ganias hard drives.the case agent was aware,however,that ganias personal financial records were beyond the scope of the november warrant,and consequently she did not believe that she could review the files,even though they were already in the government possession.
in february,the government asked ganias and his counsel for permission to access certain of his personal files that were contained in the materials seized in november.ganias did not respond,and thus,on april,the government obtained another warrant to search the preserved images of ganias personal financial records taken in.at that point,the images had been in the government possession for almost years.because ganias had altered the original files shortly after the army executed the warrant,the evidence obtained in would not have existed but for the government retention of those images.
procedural history 
the indictment 
in october,a grand jury indicted ganias and mccarthy for conspiracy and tax evasion.the grand jury returned a superseding indictment in december,containing certain counts relating to mccarthy taxes and two counts relating to ganias personal taxes.the latter two counts were asserted only against ganias.the case was assigned to chief judge alvin thompson.
the motion to suppress 
in february,ganias moved to suppress the computer files that are the subject of this appeal.in april,the district court thompson,held a hearing and,on april,it denied the motion,with an indication that a written decision would follow.on june,the district court filed its written decision explaining the denial of ganias motion to suppress.see united states ganias,cr,wl.june.
in april,the case was transferred to judge ellen bree burns for trial.in may,the district court severed the two counts against ganias for tax evasion with respect to his personal taxes from the other charges 
trial commenced on march,with jury selection,and testimony was scheduled to begin on march.at on march,the evening before the start of the evidence,one of the jurors,juror x,posted a comment on his facebook page jury duty.i may get hang someone ca wait.
juror x posting prompted responses from some of his online friends,including gettem while the young lol and let not be to hasty.torcher first,then hang lol.during the trial,juror x continued to post comments about his jury service,including 
march at pm 
shit just told this case could last weeks.jury duty sucks 
march at pm 
your honor i object this is way too boring.somebody get me outta here.
march at pm 
guiness for lunch break.jury duty ok today.
during the second week of trial,juror x became facebook friends with another one of the jurors.
on april,the jury convicted ganias on both counts.later that evening,at pm,juror x posted another comment on his facebook page guilty.he later elaborated 
i spent the whole month of march in court.i do believe justice prevailed it was no cake walk getting to the end i am glad it is over and i have a new experience under my belt 
the motion for a new trial 
on august,ganias moved for a new trial based on alleged juror misconduct.on august,the district court burns,held an evidentiary hearing and took testimony from juror x.the district court denied the motion as well as a request for the further taking of evidence in a decision filed on october.see united states ganias,cr,wl.
at the evidentiary hearing,juror x explained that he posted the comment on his facebook page about hang ing someone as a joke,all friend stuff,and that he was j ust joking,joking around.at first he could not recall whether he had any conversations with the other juror,with whom he became facebook friends during the trial,outside the court.he later clarified,however,that he did not have any conversations with the other juror during the course of the trial,prior to deliberations,about the subject matter of the case.he also testified that he in fact considered the case fairly and impartially.the district court accepted juror x testimony,found that he was credible,and concluded that he had participated in the deliberations impartially and in good faith.
sentencing 
on january,the district court burns,sentenced ganias principally to months imprisonment.this appeal followed.ganias was released pending appeal.
discussion 
ganias raises two issues on appeal first,he contends that his fourth amendment rights were violated when the government seized his personal computer records and then retained them for more than years and,second,he contends that he was entitled to a new trial because of the jury improper use of social media.
as to the fourth amendment issue,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and its conclusions of law de novo.united states ramos,cir,cert.denied.as to the issue of the district court denial of ganias motion for a new trial for alleged juror misconduct,we review for abuse of discretion.united states farhane,cir,cert.denied.
although we vacate ganias conviction on the fourth amendment grounds,we address his juror misconduct claim because the increasing popularity of social media warrants consideration of this question.we address the juror misconduct question first,as it presents less difficult legal issues,and we then turn to the fourth amendment question.
juror improper use of social media 
applicable law 
defendants have the right to a trial by an impartial jury.const.amend.vi.that right is not violated,however,merely because a juror places himself in a potentially compromising situation.united states aiello,cir,abrogated on other grounds by rutledge united states,see also smith phillips,u,i t is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote.a new trial will be granted only if the juror ability to perform her duty impartially has been adversely affected,aiello,at,and the defendant has been substantially prejudiced as a result,united states fumo,cir.although courts are understandably reluctant to invade the sanctity of the jury deliberations,the trial judge should inquire into a juror partiality where there are reasonable grounds to believe the defendant may have been prejudiced.united states schwarz,cir united states sun myung moon,cir.that inquiry should end,however,as soon as it becomes apparent that those reasonable grounds no longer exist.see sun myung moon,at.
application 
a juror who friends his fellow jurors on facebook,or who posts comments about the trial on facebook,may,in certain circumstances,threaten a defendant sixth amendment right to an impartial jury those circumstances,however,are not present here.the district court inquired into the matter and credited juror x testimony that he deliberated impartially and in good faith.the district judge credibility determination was not clearly erroneous,and thus she did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.
this case demonstrates,however,that vigilance on the part of trial judges is warranted to address the risks associated with jurors use of social media.the third circuit has endorsed the use of jury instructions like those proposed by the judicial conference committee on court administration and case management.see fumo,at.we do so as well.
the committee proposes that,before trial,the district judge give an instruction that includes the following 
i know that many of you use cell phones,blackberries,the internet and other tools of technology.you also must not talk to anyone about this case or use these tools to communicate electronically with anyone about the case.this includes your family and friends.you may not communicate with anyone about the case on your cell phone,through,blackberry,iphone,text messaging,or on twitter,through any blog or website,through any internet chat room,or by way of any other social networking websites,including facebook,my space,linkedin,and youtube 
the committee also recommends giving a similar instruction at the close of the case 
during your deliberations,you must not communicate with or provide any information to anyone by any means about this case.you may not use any electronic device or media,such as a telephone,cell phone,smart phone,iphone,blackberry or computer the internet,or any internet service,or any text or instant messaging service or any internet chat room,blog,or website,such as facebook,my space,linkedin,youtube or twitter,to communicate to anyone any information about this case or to conduct any research about this case until i accept your verdict 
here,while the district court gave an appropriate instruction at the start of the jury deliberations,it does not appear that it did so earlier.as demonstrated by this case,instructions at the beginning of deliberations may not be enough.we think it would be wise for trial judges to give the committee proposed instructions both at the start of trial and as deliberations begin,and to issue similar reminders throughout the trial before dismissing the jury each day.while situations like the one in this case will not always require a new trial,it is the better practice for trial judges to be proactive in warning jurors about the risks attending their use of social media.
b.the seizure and retention of ganias computer records 
applicable law 
the fourth amendment protects the rights of individuals to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv see,united states ramirez.a search occurs when the government acquires information by either physically intruding on persons,houses,papers,or effects,or otherwise invading an area in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy.see florida jardines,internal quotation mark omitted see also katz united states,harlan,concurring.a seizure occurs when the government interferes in some meaningful way with the individual possession of property.united states jones.subject to limited exceptions a search or seizure conducted without a warrant is presumptively unreasonable.see kyllo united states.
we must construe the fourth amendment in light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted,and in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens.kyllo,at.applying century notions about searches and seizures to modern technology,however,is easier said than done,as we are asked to measure government actions taken in the computer age against fourth amendment frameworks crafted long before this technology existed as we do so,we must keep in mind that the ultimate touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness.missouri mcneely,roberts,concurring in part and dissenting in part internal quotation marks omitted.because the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the fourth amendment has been impacted by the advance of technology,the challenge is to adapt traditional fourth amendment concepts to the government modern,more sophisticated investigative tools.
the chief evil that prompted the framing and adoption of the fourth amendment was the indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted by the british under the authority of general warrants.united states galpin,cir quoting payton new york,internal quotation marks omitted.general warrants were ones not grounded upon a sworn oath of a specific infraction by a particular individual,and thus not limited in scope and application.maryland king.the british crown had long used these questionable instruments to enter a political opponent home and seize all his books and papers,hoping to find among them evidence of criminal activity.see stanford texas.the framers abhorred this practice,believing that papers are often the dearest property a man can have and that permitting the government to sweep away all papers whatsoever,without any legal justification,would destroy all the comforts of society.entick carrington,eng,
the fourth amendment guards against this practice by providing that a warrant will issue only if the government establishes probable cause to believe the search will uncover evidence of a specific crime and the warrant states with particularity the areas to be searched and the items to be seized.galpin,at.the latter requirement,in particular,makes general searches impossible because it prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another.id.at quoting marron united states,internal quotation marks omitted.this restricts the government ability to remove all of an individual papers for later examination because it is generally unconstitutional to seize any item not described in the warrant.see horton california,united states tamura,cir.certain exceptions have been made in those comparatively rare instances where documents we re so intermingled that they could not feasibly be sorted on site.tamura,at.but in those cases,the review had to be monitored by a neutral magistrate and nonresponsive documents were to be returned after the relevant items were identified.id.at.
these fourth amendment protections apply to modern computer files.like century papers,computer files may contain intimate details regarding an individual thoughts,beliefs,and lifestyle,and they should be similarly guarded against unwarranted government intrusion.if anything,even greater protection is warranted.see,galpin,at a dvances in technology and the centrality of computers in the lives of average people have rendered the computer hard drive akin to a residence in terms of the scope and quantity of private information it may contain.united states otero,cir the modern development of the personal computer and its ability to store and intermingle a huge array of one personal papers in a single place increases law enforcement ability to conduct a search into a person private affairs orin kerr,searches and seizures in a digital world,harv,explaining that computers have become the equivalent of postal services,playgrounds,jukeboxes,dating services,movie theaters,daily planners,shopping malls,personal secretaries,virtual diaries,and more.
not surprisingly,the ability of computers to store massive volumes of information presents logistical problems in the execution of search warrants.it is comparatively commonplace for files on a computer hard drive to be so intermingled that they can not feasibly be sorted on site.tamura,at.as evidenced by this case,forensic analysis of electronic data may take months to complete.it would be impractical for agents to occupy an individual home or office,or seize an individual computer,for such long periods of time.it is now also unnecessary.today,advancements in technology enable the government to create a mirror image of an individual hard drive,which can be searched as if it were the actual hard drive but without interfering with the individual use of his home,computer,or files.
in light of the significant burdens review would place on both the individual and the government,the creation of mirror images for offsite review is constitutionally permissible in most instances,even if wholesale removal of tangible papers would not be.indeed,the amendments to the federal rules of criminal procedure,which added rule e b,clearly contemplated review of computer hard drives in certain circumstances although rule e b was not in effect in,when the warrant was executed with respect to ganias computers,case law both before and after the rule adoption has recognized that review of seized electronic files may be necessary and reasonable.see,united states schesso,cir united states evers,cir united states hill,cir united states upham,cir.
the review of these mirror images,however,is still subject to the rule of reasonableness.see,ramirez,at the general touchstone of reasonableness which governs fourth amendment analysis governs the method of execution of the warrant.citation omitted.the advisory committee notes to the amendment of the federal rules of criminal procedure shed some light on what is reasonable in this context.specifically,the committee rejected a presumptive national or uniform time period within which any subsequent copying or review of the media or electronically stored information would take place.e b advisory committee notes to the amendments.the committee noted that several variables storage capacity of media,difficulties created by encryption or electronic booby traps,and workload influence the duration of a forensic analysis and counsel against a one size fits all time period.id.in combination,these factors might justify an review lasting for a significant period of time.they do not,however,provide an independent basis for retaining any electronic data other than those specified in the warrant.united states comprehensive drug testing,cir en banc.
even where a search or seizure violates the fourth amendment,the government is not automatically precluded from using the unlawfully obtained evidence in a criminal prosecution.united states julius,cir.to trigger the exclusionary rule,police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it,and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.herring united states.suppression is required only when agents effect a widespread seizure of items that were not within the scope of the warrant,and do not act in good faith.united states shi yan liu,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.

furthermore,evidence will be suppressed only where the benefits of deterring the government unlawful actions appreciably outweigh the costs of suppressing the evidence a high obstacle for those urging application of the rule.herring,at see pennsylvania bd.of prob.parole scott,citing united states payner.the principal cost of applying the exclusionary rule is,of course,letting guilty and possibly dangerous defendants go that offends basic concepts of the criminal justice system.herring,at quoting united states leon.
this case presents a host of challenging issues,but we need not address them all.the parties agree that the personal financial records at issue in this appeal were not covered by the warrant,and that they had been segregated from the responsive files by december,before the government began to suspect that ganias was personally involved in any criminal activity.furthermore,on appeal,ganias does not directly challenge the government practice of making mirror images of computer hard drives when searching for electronic data,but rather challenges the reasonableness of its review.accordingly,we need not address whether the description of the computer files to be seized in the warrant was stated with sufficient particularity,see,galpin,at the warrant authorized the government to make a mirror image of the entire hard drive so it could search for relevant files or the resulting sorting process was unreasonably long.
instead,we consider a more limited question whether the fourth amendment permits officials executing a warrant for the seizure of particular data on a computer to seize and indefinitely retain every file on that computer for use in future criminal investigations.we hold that it does not.
if the warrant authorized the government to retain all the data on ganias computers on the the information would become relevant to a subsequent criminal investigation,it would be the equivalent of a general warrant.the government retention of copies of ganias personal computer records for years deprived him of exclusive control over those files for an unreasonable amount of time.this combination of circumstances enabled the government to possess indefinitely personal records of ganias that were beyond the scope of the warrant while it looked for other evidence to give it probable cause to search the files.this was a meaningful interference with ganias possessory rights in those files and constituted a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment.see united states place,detaining a traveler luggage while awaiting the arrival of a dog constituted a seizure see also soldal cook,explaining that a seizure occurs when one property rights are violated,even if the property is never searched and the owner privacy was never violated loretto teleprompter manhattan ca tv,the power to exclude has traditionally been considered one of the most treasured strands in an owner bundle of property rights.
we conclude that the unauthorized seizure and retention of these documents was unreasonable.the government had no warrant authorizing the seizure of ganias personal records in.by december,these documents had been separated from those relevant to the investigation of american boiler and ipm.nevertheless,the government continued to retain them for another until it finally developed probable cause to search and seize them in.without some independent basis for its retention of those documents in the interim,the government clearly violated ganias fourth amendment rights by retaining the files for a prolonged period of time and then using them in a future criminal investigation.
the government offers several arguments to justify its actions,but none provides any legal authorization for its continued and prolonged possession of the files.first,it argues that it must be allowed to make the mirror image copies as a matter of practical necessity and,according to the government investigators,those mirror images were the government property.as explained above,practical considerations may well justify a reasonable accommodation in the manner of executing a search warrant,such as making mirror images of hard drives and permitting review,but these considerations do not justify the indefinite retention of documents.see comprehensive drug testing,at.without a warrant authorizing seizure of ganias personal financial records,the copies of those documents could not become ipso facto the government property without running afoul of the fourth amendment.
second,the government asserts that by obtaining the search warrant,it cured any defect in its search of the wrongfully retained files.but this argument reduces the fourth amendment to a form of words.silverthorne lumber united states.in silverthorne,the government,without a shadow of authority,went to the office of the defendants company and made a clean sweep of all the books,papers and documents found there.id.at.the originals were eventually returned because they were unlawfully seized,but the prosecutor had made p hotographs and copies of material papers and used these to indict the defendants and obtain a subpoena for the original documents.id.at.justice holmes succinctly summarized the government argument supporting the constitutionality of its actions as follows 
a lthough of course its seizure was an outrage which the government now regrets,it may study the papers before it returns them,copy them,and then may use the knowledge that it has gained to call upon the owners in a more regular form to produce them that the protection of the constitution covers the physical possession but not any advantages that the government can gain over the object of its pursuit by doing the forbidden act.
id.unsurprisingly,the supreme court rejected that argument the essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the court but that it shall not be used at all unless some exception applies id.at.the same rationale applies here.if the government could seize and retain electronic records indefinitely,so it could search them whenever it later developed probable cause,every warrant to search for particular electronic data would become,in essence,a general warrant.
third,the government argues that it must be permitted to search the mirror images in its possession because the evidence no longer existed on ganias computers.but the ends,however,do not justify the means.the loss of the personal records is irrelevant in this case because the government concedes that it never considered performing a new search of ganias computers and did not know that the files no longer existed when it searched the mirror images in its possession.and even if it were relevant,the fourth amendment clearly embodies a judgment that some evidence of criminal activity may be lost for the sake of protecting property and privacy rights.see,united states calandra,the judges who developed the exclusionary rule were well aware that it embodied a judgment that it is better for some guilty persons to go free than for the government to behave in forbidden fashion.
fourth,the government contends that returning or destroying the files is entirely impractical because doing so would compromise the remaining data that was responsive to the warrant,making it impossible to authenticate or use it in a criminal prosecution.appellee br.at.we are not convinced that there is no other way to preserve the evidentiary chain of custody.but even if we assumed it were necessary to maintain a complete copy of the hard drive solely to authenticate evidence responsive to the original warrant,that does not provide a basis for using the mirror image for any other purpose.
finally,the government argues that ganias failure to bring a motion for the return of property,pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure g,precludes him from seeking suppression now.although the district court accepted this argument,we find no authority for concluding that a rule g motion is a prerequisite to a motion to suppress.see.g a person aggrieved may move for the property return.emphasis added.h a defendant may move to suppress evidence emphasis added.imposing such a prerequisite makes little sense in this context,where ganias still had the original computer files and did not need the government copies to be re
