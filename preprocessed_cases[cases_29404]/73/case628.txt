in this appeal,valero energy corporation asks us to take a close look at the tax privilege.valero sought to protect several documents under this privilege,and the result was a mixed documents were shielded from the internal revenue service,while others were not.valero now contends that by reaching this decision,the district court misconstrued not only the privilege,but also an exception to the privilege,which grants the government access to certain documents when tax shelters are promoted.
valero is a large company involved in crude oil refining it the largest refiner in the united states according to its web site and marketing.the giant got even bigger in december,when it acquired ultramar diamond shamrock corporation uds,an oil company with canadian subsidiaries.this acquisition not only expanded valero reach northward,it also resulted in some pretty hefty tax savings.before the deal took place,uds consulted with ernst young about restructuring and refinancing its canadian operations.valero,in turn,called on its advisors at arthur anderson to review ernst young plan and provide further tax advice.at this time,the canadian currency was in a slump the united states dollar,and valero took advantage.in,shortly after the acquisition was completed,valero realized million in foreign currency losses under,through a complicated series of transactions implemented with arthur anderson help.the transactions included the creation of entities,several wire transfers of cash,a large distribution from one of the canadian subsidiaries to a parent,of a separate foreign subsidiary as a branch of valero for tax purposes,and the extinguishment of debt.
this loss was big enough to catch the government eye,and the irs began investigating.the irs eventually issued a summons to arthur andersen,seeking all documents related to 
tax planning,tax research,or tax analysis,by or for,ultramar diamond shamrock including any of its subsidiaries or partnerships,both domestic and foreign and valero energy corporation including any of its subsidiaries or partnerships,both domestic and foreign in connection with their,and canadian and income taxes 
valero,as a third party,asked the district court to quash the summons.see b.it argued that the summons was overbroad and that many documents were protected by either the doctrine or the tax privilege.the privilege shields communications between a federally authorized tax practitioner and her client to the extent the communication would be considered a privileged communication if it were between a taxpayer and an attorney.a.the government countered by arguing that the scope of the summons was appropriate and that even if the tax privilege applied,the documents were discoverable since they were made in connection with the promotion of a tax shelter,a statutory exception to the privilege.id.at b.the government presented little evidence to back up this claim and rested,instead,on valero failure to deny that saving on taxes was one of its motivations for the transactions.
there was no clear victor in this first dispute.the district court concluded that the irs issued the summons in good faith and that it was not overly broad.the court rejected valero claim of privilege under the doctrine but,after an in camera,review,sustained its claim of privilege under the tax privilege.in doing so,the court rejected the government argument regarding the tax shelter promotion exception,noting that it failed to meet its burden to prove the exception applicability by simply relying on valero silence.the court then directed valero to produce any documents withheld based only on the overbreadth and objections.
this order resulted in a second round of document production.valero found new documents responsive to the summons and sought to keep some of them out of the grasp of the government by again asserting the tax privilege.the government then filed a motion to enforce the summons before the district court,arguing,as it did before,that the privilege did not apply,and if it did,the exception required valero to produce the documents.this time,though,the government acted with more gusto.it supported its argument with a detailed declaration from the irs agent conducting the investigation into valero tax liabilities.attached to this declaration were several,billing records,and minutes from valero board bolster the contention that one of the driving purposes behind the multitude of transactions in was to avoid paying taxes.valero responded by asserting that arthur anderson was not trying to sell or peddle a corporate tax shelter,and therefore the exception was inapplicable.it contended that the rigamarole was necessary for paying off public debt,saving some canadian taxes,and restructuring the business operations.the foreign currency losses,valero maintained,were a natural result of fulfilling these goals.the government,however,poked holes in these purported motivations,arguing that the savings in united states taxes were much more substantial than any savings in canadian taxes and that valero could have achieved these purposed aims in a more direct manner without triggering the foreign currency losses.
the added support won over the district court.after another round of in camera,review,the court rejected some of valero claims of privilege outright.the court did sustain the privilege for other documents but held that some of these documents were discoverable since they fell within the exception for documents promoting tax shelters.this time,the court reasoned,the government had met its burden.the court found that it had laid a foundation in fact that arthur andersen promoted by providing input and helping to organize a plan,a significant purpose of which was to avoid federal income taxes.
valero appeals this second ruling.it has combed through the documents that the district court found unprotected and has identified a subset that,it argues,should have been privileged.we granted a stay,allowing the contested documents to remain under seal,and valero has provided a sealed appendix containing these documents for our review.valero first attacks the district court finding that a group of documents were not privileged since they concerned business or accounting advice or state tax issues.valero argues that the district court clearly erred in its assessment of of these documents,emphasizing that they cover federal tax issues.
we begin by noting that there is no general privilege.united states frederick,cir.in,congress provided a limited shield of confidentiality between a federally authorized tax practitioner and her client.this privilege is no broader than the existing privilege.it merely extends the veil of confidentiality to federally authorized tax practitioners who have long been able to practice before the irs,see c,to the same extent communications would be privileged if they were between a taxpayer and an attorney.a privilege does not apply in criminal proceedings.nothing in the statute suggests that these nonlawyer practitioners are entitled to privilege when they are doing other than lawyers work frederick,at see also united states bdo seidman,cir bdo ii.accounting advice,even if given by an attorney,is not privileged.
this means that the success of a claim of privilege depends on whether the advice given was general accounting advice or legal advice.admittedly,the line between a lawyer work and that of an accountant can be blurry,especially when it involves a large corporation like valero seeking advice from a accounting firm like arthur anderson.but we have set some guideposts to help distinguish between the two.for starters,the preparation of tax returns is an accounting,not a legal service,therefore information transmitted so that it might be used on a tax return is not privileged.in re grand jury proceedings,cir frederick,at united states lawless,cir.on the other side of the spectrum,communications about legal questions raised in litigation or in anticipation of litigation are privileged.in re grand jury proceedings,at frederick,at.of course,there is a grey area between these two extremes,but to the extent documents are used for both preparing ta
