this appeal involves what appears to be a question of first impression concerning a statute that addresses the cancellation of penalties imposed when property taxes are not timely paid.the case was filed by the state of california,by and through its commissioner of corporations,and is based on the state allegation that investors in certain real property limited partnerships were defrauded on a massive scale.the receiver who was appointed to oversee the assets involved in the case sought the cancellation of real property tax delinquency penalties,paid by certain of the limited partnerships to los angeles county and ventura county,so that the delinquency charges could be refunded to the receivership estate.when those counties denied the receiver request,he filed motions with the trial court,on behalf of one of the limited partnerships,for an order directing the counties to cancel the charges.subsequently,one of the other limited partnerships moved for such relief on its own behalf as to ventura county.ultimately los angeles county los angeles settled with the receiver,but ventura county ventura did not 
the receiver motions for relief were based on revenue and taxation code section section,which states any penalty,costs,or other charges resulting from tax delinquency may be cancelled by the auditor or the tax collector upon a finding of any of the following a failure to make a timely payment is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the taxpayer control,and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care in the absence of willful neglect,provided the principal payment for the proper amount of the tax due is made no later than june of the fourth fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the tax became delinquent.b there was an inadvertent error in the amount of payment made by the taxpayer,provided the principal payment for the proper amount of the tax due is made within days after the notice of shortage is mailed by the tax collector.c the cancellation was ordered by a local,state,or federal court.
the trial court determined that subdivision c of section gives a court independent authority to cancel tax penalties,costs and other charges and therefore a taxpayer seeking such cancellation need not invoke subdivisions a or b of section,or any other statutory authority,to obtain that relief.the court granted the motions directed against ventura for cancellation of tax delinquency charges,and this appeal was filed by ventura collector,lawrence matheney,and its county board of supervisors.
the main issue raised in the appeal is whether the trial court correctly construed subdivision c of section.we find it did not.we hold that subdivision c,which was added to section by amendment subsequent to the original enactment of the statute,was only intended by the legislature to authorize tax collectors and auditors to obey court orders directing them to cancel tax delinquency penalties,costs and other charges,and therefore such orders for cancellation must be based on some statutory authority other than subdivision c of section.subdivision c is not a grant of independent judicial authority to relieve taxpayers of liability for tax delinquency penalties.
factual and procedural background 
the complaint 
the commissioner of corporations commissioner filed this action on march.named as defendants were olen boyce phillips phillips,several companies and partnerships bearing his name,several other companies,limited partnerships entitled westoaks investment,each bearing a different numerical designation,westoaks investment,a california limited partnership,and the phillips financial group.the complaint alleges that phillips is the general partner of the limited partnership defendants,and the president and manager controlling supervisor of ten defendant companies.
by this suit,the commissioner sought to enjoin the defendants from,among other things,operating what amounted to a ponzi scheme,engaging in other acts of fraud and violations of state securities laws,and acting upon the real and personal property assets in their possession or under their control.the commissioner also requested an order for payment of civil penalties by the defendants for each and every one of their acts that violated corporate securities laws.a receiver was requested and attorney richard weissman weissman was appointed to that position on the date the suit was filed.he took control of the defendant entities and has remained the receiver throughout the case 
the default judgment 
a default judgment was signed and filed on august.weissman was directed to continue as receiver in the case and to submit a written plan for distribution of the defaulting defendants assets.the court retained jurisdiction to implement the terms of its orders past or future and to entertain applications and motions by any party for additional relief.
the motions to have ventura cancel real property tax penalties 
on march,the receiver filed a motion for an order directing ventura to show cause why the court should not order that county to cancel all real property tax delinquency penalties,costs and other charges hereinafter referred to collectively as penalties resulting from a delinquency in payment of real property taxes by defendant westoaks investment.the authority cited for such relief was section.the basis of the motion was the receiver assertion that westoaks investment did not have any financial resources with which to timely pay real property taxes to ventura from approximately through the date of the sale of westoaks investment real property in april,like the other westoaks investment defendants,westoaks investment was controlled by its general partner,phillips,and phillips had not paid the taxes owed by the partnership 
the receiver asserted that to avoid an imminent tax sale of westoaks investment land,the accrued principal taxes and delinquency penalties claimed by ventura for the years to were paid by a group of westoaks investment limited partners and holders of promissory notes secured by deeds of trust encumbering westoaks investment real property.such payment was made in for fiscal years through,in the amount of principal and penalties.a similar payment had been made in for fiscal years through,in the amount of principal and penalties.
according to the receiver,the westoaks investment limited partners and note holders who contributed to the payment of the above described tax principal and penalties were,in turn,granted by the court a first priority lien on the real property owned by westoaks investment,together with interest at the rate of.the lien was to be repaid when the property was sold.the lien granted by the court in extended to all of the limited partners and note holders who had advanced money for the payment of the tax principal and penalties,whether in or.thereafter,the in taxes and penalties,accruing from approximately through april,was paid from the proceeds of the sale of westoaks investment real property,as was the judicial lien.tax delinquency penalties paid to ventura by westoaks investment in,and totaled over 
in his motion for tax penalty relief,the receiver asserted that the undisputed fraud of the pfg defendants would support the court cancellation of the tax delinquency penalties on behalf of the victim investors,and that westoaks investment inability to make timely payments was due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond its control and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care in the absence of willful neglect.according to the receiver,westoaks investment purchased its real property approximately acres of land in ventura in the late or early,and thereafter,phillips had granted to various lenders deeds of trust on one or more lots of land in that acreage to secure promissory notes that totaled,as of march,in recorded debt over recorded deeds of trust.there were also unrecorded deeds of trust that encumbered that property.the receiver asserted that because of the fraudulent activities of the general partner and his unilateral control of westoaks investment,the limited partners and holders of deeds of trust had no reason to know or believe that the property taxes were not being paid,nor that the encumbrances on the property were of such magnitude that an attempted sale of the property by the receiver in could not be timely accomplished.
on april,the trial court issued an order requiring ventura to show cause why the court should not grant the receiver request to cancel,under section,subdivision c,the delinquency penalties paid to ventura on behalf of westoaks investment.subsequently,another show cause hearing for relief from tax penalties,also directed at ventura,was set pursuant to a request by a private attorney acting on behalf of defendant westoaks investment and an entity called joint venture,which had paid tax penalties on behalf of westoaks investment like the receiver motion,westoaks investment motion was based on the fraudulent scheme practiced by the pfg defendants,and it relied on section for statutory authority 
the trial court rulings respecting ventura 
on july,the trial court granted the motions to cancel the tax penalties imposed by ventura on westoaks investment and westoaks investment.the court found,among other things,that the investors did not know about the conduct of the defendant until after the filing of this action.the investors were actively engaged in attempting to assist the court in its control and management of the affected assets,directly and through the receivership.the partners in the limited partnerships subject to this action did not learn of the property tax delinquencies affecting their limited partnerships until after the filing of this action and were active and vigorous in their efforts with the county of ventura to seek relief from impending tax sales.the receivership lacked the cash resources with which to timely pay the real property taxes as those taxes came due.ventura county did not provide direct relief deferring the tax sales of real property held by westoaks investment and westoaks investment in,and ventura county did not advise the court or the receiver of availability of relief under revenue and taxation code.and in order to save their respective real properties from tax sales,the partners of westoaks investment and westoaks investment successors to real property owned by westoaks advanced the delinquent and defaulted taxes and all penalties that had accrued from approximately.
concluding that it had independent authority,under section,subdivision c,to cancel the tax delinquency penalties,and broad powers over administration and protection of the property subject to the receivership pursuant to,the court cancelled tax delinquency penalties in the sums of on behalf of westoaks investment,and,on behalf of westoaks investment.
the order canceling such penalties was signed and filed on july.thereafter,this timely appeal was filed by ventura.
discussion 
section,subdivision c does not authorize courts to make orders respecting cancellation of delinquency tax penalties 
the primary issue in this appeal is whether subdivision c of section was intended to give authority to courts to issue orders canceling tax delinquency penalties.stated another way,the issue is whether subdivision c of section,in and of itself,authorizes courts to order the cancellation of such penalties,or the only authority that subdivision c provides is to authorize auditors and tax collectors to cancel delinquency penalties when ordered to do so by a court that has based its cancellation order on some other statute or on another provision of section.construction of a statute is a question of law.it therefore warrants our de novo review on appeal.mamika barca th,d.
citing edison california stores mccolgan cal d,westoaks investment argues that when a tax statute is ambiguous,the ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer rather than the government.however,we do not perceive that a ruling by this court that subdivision c of section was never intended to give courts independent authority to order the cancellation of tax delinquency penalties is a ruling in favor of the taxing authority of government.the construction of subdivision c relates to the extent of judicial authority granted by that statutory subdivision with respect to certain taxation issues,not with the authority of government to tax.
ventura contention that subdivision c of section was only intended by the legislature to authorize auditors and tax collectors to cancel penalties pursuant to court orders issued under some other statute or under another subdivision of section is supported by the legislative history of the senate bill senate bill that added subdivision c to section.that history includes a may,memo from the office of san diego county counsel that is addressed to all counties in the state.attached to the memo is a proposed amendment to senate bill.that proposed amendment is essentially the language of subdivision c of section.the san diego memo notes that in bankruptcy cases,the bankruptcy court has the authority to determine tax liability and does not always give san diego county all of the penalties claimed by the county,but the county will nevertheless be ordered to expunge its tax lien after payment.the memo states that expunging a tax lien in those circumstances will result in a cancellation of some penalties,which according the memo,the auditor has no statutory authority to do.the memo goes on to state that the proposed amendment to section will allow the auditor to cancel penalties which will result in the lien being expunged when less than the full amount is ordered to be paid.the addition of subdivision c to senate bill came in the june,amendment of that bill,which was approximately three weeks after san diego county counsel office sought such an addition 
in addition to the san diego memo,ventura cites to other papers in the legislative history to support its position that section,subdivision c does not independently authorize courts to cancel tax delinquency penalties.they are letters from the county supervisors association of california and the california association of county treasurers and tax collectors to various state legislators wherein senate bill is described as one which makes technical and minor administrative changes to the revenue and taxation code.
interestingly,westoaks investment cites to a senate digest analysis of senate bill which states current law allows the auditor to cancel penalties only when failure to pay timely is due to reasonable cause,or there was an inadvertent error in the amount paid.this bill provides a third exception when cancellation of penalties is ordered by a local,state or federal court.italics added.the digest then references the memo of the san diego county counsel office.this use of the word allows in the senate digest analysis and its reference to the san diego county counsel memo supports ventura contention that the addition of subdivision c to section was only meant to county auditors and tax collectors to follow court orders to cancel tax penalties also of interest is westoaks investment citation to a senate rules committee memo which states that senate bill w ould acknowledge the cancellation of property taxes ordered by a local,state or federal court.italics added.such reference to an acknowledgement of court orders supports ventura position that subdivision c does not enable a court to make an independent order canceling a tax delinquency penalty absent the authority of some other statute or the other provisions of section.
westoaks investment is correct when it asserts that the legislative history on the addition of subdivision c to section is meager.when we follow that meager history,however,we find that it leads directly from the may,san diego county counsel memo to the june amendment of senate bill that added subdivision c.further,when we combine that history with the fact that subdivision c does not provide a court with standards or specifics as to when and under what circumstances it would be appropriate to permit a cancellation of penalties such as a specific time frame for seeking penalty relief from a court,and specific factors or circumstances that would warrant cancellation by a court of tax delinquency penalties we can only conclude that subdivision c was meant to do no more than give county tax officials the legal permission to comply with court orders issued pursuant to authority other than subdivision c.that subdivision was not meant to provide courts with the independent authority to make otherwise unauthorized tax delinquency penalty relief orders.moreover,even if westoaks investment is correct in its assertion that san diego county counsel office was wrong when it stated that county auditors lacked statutory authority to obey court orders directing cancellation of penalties,that does not change our analysis as to what was intended by the legislature when it added subdivision c to section.it is the intent of the legislature that is our first concern.walker superior court cal d.
nevertheless,we do not agree with ventura that the three subdivisions of section provide county auditors and tax collectors with discretion whether to cancel delinquency penalties.certainly,for example,we do not read subdivision c as a grant of discretionary authority to county auditors and tax collectors to ignore a court order.
nor do we find that subdivisions a and b of section give the auditor or tax collector discretion to deny cancellation of penalties if and when the taxpayer proof has established the factual predicates set out in subdivisions a and b.if the taxpayer presents such conclusive proof but the official refuses to make the corresponding subdivision a or b finding,or if the corresponding finding is made but the official then refuses to exercise the authority granted by section to cancel the penalties,that would be grounds for a code of civil procedure section petition for traditional mandamus.
while it is true that the introductory paragraph of section states that penalties may be cancelled rather than shall be cancelled,we read such use of the word may as simply providing a previously statutory authority to effect a cancellation.section should not be read to include a discretion to deny cancellation where the predicate facts have been established.
the legislative counsel digest for the legislation that added section to the revenue and taxation code section was section predecessor statute and was added to the revenue and taxation code by stats,ch,stated under existing law a penalty is imposed on property taxes which are not paid prior to becoming delinquent and there is no provision for the cancellation of a penalty.this bill would authorize the tax collector or the auditor to cancel a delinquent penalty on the property,with the approval of the board of supervisors on a finding that the delinquency was due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the assessee control,and occurred not withstanding the exercise of ordinary care and in the absence of willful neglect,provided the payment is made within days of the first delinquency date or within days after the second delinquency date.thus,the predecessor to section was enacted simply to authorize cancellation of penalties under specific circumstances,because prior to its enactment,there was no authority for such cancellation even under the very equitable circumstances addressed in subdivisions a and b.enactment of that predecessor statute solved a problem similar to that recognized by the san diego county counsel sometimes penalties should be cancelled but the auditor or tax collector needs statutory authorization to effect such cancellation 
further trial court proceedings under section,subdivisions a and b are required 
central to relief under subdivisions a and b of section are the required findings about the taxpayer and the timeliness of the payment of the delinquent taxes.because the matter of such relief has already come before the trial court,and because section currently has no procedural directives for how a party seeking such relief is to proceed and it does not appear that ventura has developed any procedures for its taxpayers,it would not be unwarranted for the motion papers which westoaks investment filed with the court to have the delinquency penalties cancelled be deemed a written request to ventura for section cancellation relief the request should be considered and decided by ventura.thereafter,if westoaks investment request for cancellation is denied by ventura,it can file a petition for a writ of mandate if it believes such a petition is warranted.
westoaks investment is a different matter.it has already in august and october filed a request with ventura specifically with ventura collector for cancellation of delinquency penalties under section,and its requests were denied in september and november of that year.can the instant case be considered a suit for traditional mandamus arguably it can.however,the trial court acted outside of its jurisdiction when it determined that it could decide the issues in this case under subdivision c of section that is,when it determined it has independent authority to cancel any penalty,costs,or other charges resulting from tax delinquency for real property taxes pursuant to c and broad powers over administration and protection of the property subject to the receivership pursuant to.the only power that the trial court has with respect to the decision of ventura to deny westoaks investment section relief is to decide westoaks investment motion as a petition for traditional mandamus by determining whether,solely under the parameters for relief set out in subdivisions a and b of section,such relief should have been granted to westoaks investment.the answer to this question will require at least in part,a determination as to whether,and to what extent,the acts of the general partner are,or should be,deemed to be the acts of the limited partnership this will involve legal and factual issues,which should be addressed in the first instance by the trial court.
disposition 
the order from which ventura has appealed is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.ventura,westoaks investment and westoaks investment will all bear their own costs on appeal.
ventura and los angeles were not named parties in the suit since they were not alleged to be connected to the fraudulent activities set out in the state complaint.they were issued orders to show cause by the trial court pursuant to the motions for cancellation of tax delinquency penalties,and thereafter they filed responsive papers and made court appearances on that matter.
unless otherwise indicated,all statutory references are to the revenue and taxation code.
in his declaration filed in support of his request for a judgment by default,receiver weissman stated that in the course of his duties,he had not discovered any evidence that trust deed investors were told,at the time of their investments in the late,of the true financial situation of phillips financial group and its entities and programs pfg.nor were they told that their investments were unsafe or significantly at risk,and that new investor money was being used to pay off old investors.additionally,they were not informed how many trust deeds were senior to theirs.the declaration states that in some cases,there were in excess of two hundred trust deeds senior to that investor.the receiver opined that pfg failure to so inform the trust deed investors of those facts was a material misrepresentation or omission,and further opined that much of the trust deed money raised by pfg in the late and in was raised by use of fraudulent statements or omissions,and that encumbering partnership properties with numerous deeds of trust securing promissory notes amounted to a theft of the investors investments.
as noted above,the receiver filed a similar motion directed at los angeles.that motion involved property belonging to other limited partnerships,not to westoaks investment.after los angeles filed opposition to the motion,it entered into a written stipulation for settlement with the receiver.it was agreed that the stipulated settlement would not represent,by either party,an admission of liability or validity of the other contentions.an order on the settlement was signed and filed,pursuant to
