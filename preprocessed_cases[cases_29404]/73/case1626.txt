factual and procedural summary 
unemployment insurance code sections and codify the tax concept of unity of enterprise.under these provisions,the employment development department edd is authorized to consolidate multiple businesses united by factors of ownership or control into a single employing unit for purposes of determining the rate of employer contributions.these statutes are aimed at preventing a tax evasion practice known as suta dumping.as explained in an information sheet published by the edd,suta dumping includes acts to manipulate state account numbers and the unemployment insurance experience rating process.when a low unemployment insurance rate is obtained,payroll from another entity with a high unemployment insurance tax rate is shifted to the account with the lower rate.the entity with the higher rate is then dumped.the entity inactivates the higher rated account and the charges are apportioned to the rest of the employers in the state.such abusive schemes leave other employers making up for the unpaid tax.suta dumping is also referred to as state unemployment tax avoidance and unemployment tax rate manipulation.
this action arises from the edd unity of enterprise determination against appellant american employers group,aeg.aeg is a nebraska corporation which contracts with businesses to provide payroll processing,workers compensation,and other related services with respect to individuals performing services for these businesses.it issues payroll checks using aeg checks,issues forms reflecting aeg as the employer,and reports federal payroll taxes using aeg federal tax identification number.aeg reports individuals who perform services in california under aeg edd identification number,and pays unemployment insurance contributions at the rate determined by the edd for aeg.
in june,the edd began an audit of aeg with respect to five california businesses whose workers were paid through aeg.in september,the edd issued a proposed notice of assessment for additional unemployment insurance contributions in the total amount of,including penalties and interest.the notice stated this assessment is estimated from the best information available to the department.reports were filed under an incorrect account number.the notice also explained if you do not concur with these amounts,you may contact the auditor at the phone number shown above to request a conference with the audit supervisor.it may be to your advantage to meet with the audit supervisor to correct any inaccuracies in this proposed notice of assessment before an official notice of assessment is issued.upon receiving an official notice of assessment,if you do not concur,you will have petition rights at that time.instructions for filing an appeal will be included with that notice.
representatives of the edd and aeg met to discuss the proposed assessment in october and november.according to aeg,after extensive settlement discussions,the parties agreed to a proposed settlement of the assessment at million,and to additional terms and conditions.however,in a letter to the edd dated november,aeg outlined the basic terms of settlement tentatively agreed to between the edd and aeg.italics added.aeg sent a supplemental letter on december,noting that it had agreed to settle the pending issues with the edd,but that a number of logistical problems remain in order to fully implement our agreement.aeg proposed solutions to each of the problems,and asked the edd to review these matters at your earliest opportunity and let me know your thoughts.
by letter dated april,the edd notified aeg that its settlement proposal had been rejected.as a result,a notice of assessment will be issued to aeg for the period january.thus,aeg may pursue its administrative remedies including filing a petition for reassessment.the following day,aeg delivered a check in the amount of million to the edd.by letter dated may,the edd returned the check to aeg,rejecting aeg assertion that a negotiated settlement had been reached between aeg and the edd.
on may,the edd issued a notice of assessment against aeg in the total amount of.the notice of assessment was issued under aeg account number,and listed as related entities california employer group,aeg processing center,aui employer group,and applied processing center.the notice stated this assessment is for underpayment of your unemployment insurance due to state unemployment tax rate manipulation suta dumping.the assessment was accompanied by a notice of petition rights,setting out the procedure for aeg to file a petition for reassessment by an administrative law judge of the california unemployment insurance appeals board.
aeg filed a timely petition for reassessment.aeg also brought an action in the nebraska state court to restrain the edd from assessing additional tax liability.the nebraska court dismissed the action,and aeg then filed this action in the los angeles superior court.aeg alleged that the edd had breached a settlement agreement.it also asserted causes of action for promissory estoppel and violation of federal and state due process.aeg alleged that the edd failed to discharge a mandatory duty to conduct a hearing prior to the issuance of any assessment,and that it improperly assessed taxes after the expiration of the calendar year rating period in which the alleged error occurred,in violation of section and california code of regulations,title,section.the seventh cause of action sought a writ of mandate to compel the edd to comply with its statutory obligations.
the trial court bifurcated the seventh cause of action for writ of mandate from the other causes of action,referred it to the writs and receivers department for hearing,and stayed proceedings on the remainder of the complaint.aeg filed a first amended petition for writ of mandate.the court dzintra janavs denied the petition.the edd demurrer to the remainder of the complaint was then heard.the court alice altoon sustained the demurrer to the remaining causes of action without leave to amend.the court entered an order of dismissal,and aeg appeals.
discussion 
in its first amended petition for writ of mandate,aeg sought to compel the edd to provide a hearing prior to issuing an assessment for additional unemployment insurance contributions based on a unity of enterprise determination.this relief was sought based on aeg interpretation of sections and,the statutes governing unity of enterprise determinations.as we explain,this is the same theory for relief aeg asserted in its petition for reassessment with the california unemployment insurance appeals board.
