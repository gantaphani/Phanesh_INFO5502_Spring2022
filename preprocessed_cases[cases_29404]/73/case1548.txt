introduction 
under article xiii a of the california constitution popularly known as,the most common trigger of the reassessment of real property is a change in ownership.the initiative measure,itself,did not define change in ownership,leaving that task to the legislature,which promptly appointed a task force to make recommendations.at the time the initiative measure was approved by california voters,joint tenancies were commonly used as an estate planning tool parents would deed property to themselves and their children so it would pass automatically to the latter upon the death of the last surviving parent.the task force therefore proposed treating family joint tenancies akin to the making of a will.since there is no change in ownership on the mere making of a will,there similarly would be no change in ownership on the creation of a family joint tenancy.rather,change in ownership would occur when the joint tenancy terminated,frequently on the death of the last surviving parent.the legislature adopted the task force recommendations,and the legislature and the state board of equalization have spent the ensuing decades refining the notion that there is no change in ownership when a family joint tenancy is created,but there is on termination.
in this case,after one of two brothers inherited a residential property from their mother,he created a joint tenancy with his brother.nearly a decade later,the second brother deeded his own joint tenancy interest to himself as a tenant in common with his brother.although he and his brother continued to own the property and retained the same percentage ownership as before,the marin county tax assessor determined a change in ownership had occurred,reassessed the property and sent the second brother,real party in interest james mikkelsen,a tax bill.mikkelsen appealed to the assessment appeals board,claiming a mere change in the way title was held was not a change in ownership.the board agreed with mikkelsen.the assessor sought a writ of review from the trial court.the court also agreed with mikkelsen.the assessor now appeals to this court,supported by the state board of equalization as amicus curiae.
as mikkelsen points out,the legislature has,indeed,specified a mere change in the way title is held is not a change in ownership when it comes to most property,and there certainly is logic to that approach.however,as we will explain,from the time the legislature enacted the change in ownership statutes implementing proposition,it has treated family joint tenancies differently.while the wisdom of the policy reason for that differential treatment to accommodate the use of joint tenancy as an estate planning tool may be a matter of debate,it was within the legislature prerogative to craft the change in ownership statutes accordingly.what mikkelsen,the board and the trial court overlooked was that mikkelsen got the advantage of this policy when his brother created the joint tenancy and no change in ownership was deemed to have occurred.the price for that property tax break,so to speak,was a change in ownership when the family joint tenancy was terminated.we therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.
ii.factual and procedural background 
when peter and james mikkelsen father died in the mid,he left a home in mill valley to their mother,dagmar mikkelsen.she subsequently created a joint tenancy in the property with peter.when dagmar died in july,peter became the sole owner of the property by right of survivorship.in december,peter created a joint tenancy in the property with james.as a result,each had a percent undivided interest in the property and reciprocal rights of survivorship.the brothers owned the home as joint tenants for a decade.in november,james severed his interest as a joint tenant by executing and recording a grant deed wherein he granted to himself an interest as a tenant in common.
the marin county assessor determined james transfer of his joint tenancy interest to himself as a tenant in common,was a change in ownership triggering reassessment under proposition.the assessed value of the property was determined to be,significantly higher than its previously assessed value of,and resulting in a tax increase of.
james challenged the reassessment and sought a tax refund,on the ground,inter alia,the change in legal title from joint tenancy to tenancy in common did not constitute a change in ownership.the assessor rejected his challenge.james appealed to the assessment appeals board for marin county.by a vote of two to one,the board reversed the assessor decision and returned the property assessed value to.the assessor petitioned the marin county superior court for a writ of review of the board decision,which the court denied.the assessor timely appealed to this court.
iii.discussion 
proposition specifies the maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property shall not exceed one percent of the full cash value of such property.cal.const.art.xiii a,subd.a.the measure defines full cash value to mean the appraised value of real property when purchased,newly constructed,or a change in ownership has occurred after the assessment.cal.const.art.xiii a,subd.a,italics added.of the three value benchmarks under proposition,the base,change in ownership,and new construction,change in ownership is by far the most important,as it is the primary reappraisal trigger under article xiii assem.revenue and taxation,of the task force on property tax administration january,task force report.it thus is no surprise that t he most complex area of law implementing proposition is the attempt to define change in ownership.assem.revenue and taxation,of the implementation of proposition,vol,property tax assessment october,implementation report,
statutory definition of change in ownership 
proposition did not explicate the meaning of change in ownership.pacific southwest realty county of los angeles cal th,d,pacific southwest.that task was left to the legislature which,the year after article xiii a passage,adopted a statutory framework for implementing it.steinhart county of los angeles cal th,d,see also pacific southwest,supra,cal th at pp.it was understood this initial legislation,enacted through senate bill no.sb,would be followed by more extensive legislation.see implementation report.
the task force report 
as a prelude to drafting the more comprehensive legislation,the legislature appointed a member task force consisting of legislative and board staff,county assessors,trade associations,and lawyers in the public and private sectors to create consistent and uniform guidelines to implement proposition undefined change in ownership provision.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at.the task force report became the blue print for the legislation.id.at.
with respect to the term change in ownership,the task force sought to distill the basic characteristics of a change in ownership and embody them in a single test which could be applied evenhandedly to distinguish between changes and.task force report,pacific southwest,supra,cal th at.the task force was also anxious the test be sufficiently consistent with normal understanding of change in ownership to withstand legal attack.task force report at pacific southwest,supra,cal th at.
the task force concluded the essence of a change in ownership is a transfer which has all three of the following characteristics.it transfers a present interest in real property.it transfers the beneficial use of the property and.the property rights transferred are substantially equivalent in value to the fee interest.task force report,emphasis omitted.the task force envisioned this proposed definition would control all transfers,both foreseen and unforeseen and recommended the use of statutory examples to elaborate on common transactions.task force report at,emphasis omitted.
with respect to,the task force stated and joint tenancies create undivided interests in land,with each owning a percentage fractional interest.transfer of any fractional interest is a change of ownership,but results in reappraisal only of the percentage interest transferred.unfortunately,such treatment imposes a new administrative burden on assessors.it requires them to keep separate accounting records and base year values for the fractional interests which are created or transferred at different times.the task force saw no means of avoiding the new burden altogether,but did its best to minimize the burden.under the task force recommendations separate accounting is not required for family joint tenancies,which are the great majority of joint tenancies in this state.thus the new burden on assessor sic is limited only to which do fit under the family joint tenancy rule and are not interspousal.that group of should not be numerous.task force report at pp.
as to family joint tenancies,the task force explained probably the vast majority of joint tenancies in california other than interspousal joint tenancies are those in which a parent places his property in joint tenancy with children.the special aspect of a joint tenancy as distinguished from is that the surviving joint tenant or joint tenants succeeds to the entire property by operation of law on the death of the other joint tenant.for that reason joint tenancy is often used as a substitute for a will.the same consideration which justifies excluding the making of a will from change in ownership also supports exclusion of the creation of a joint tenancy where the transferor,parent is one of the joint tenants.the rights of the new joint tenants,the children to obtain the entire property outright are contingent upon their surviving the transferor joint tenant.creation of such joint tenancies is not a change in ownership,but the entire property is reappraised when the joint tenancy terminates.again,fractional accounting and reappraisal by the assessor is avoided.the rule recommended by the task force is general it covers any joint tenancy created by a person who,after the creation of the joint tenancy,is one of the joint tenants,whether or not it is a joint tenancy.however,most such joint tenancies are created within a family.task force report at pp.
the comprehensive legislation ab 
the recommendations of the task force were originally incorporated into assembly bill no.ab,which was vetoed by the governor on june.in response to the governor veto message,a new bill,ab,made some changes,not relevant here,but otherwise included the provisions of ab.assembly revenue and taxation committee enrolled bill analysis of ab,as amended june.the governor approved the revised legislation on july.
the legislation enacted through ab dwarfed the initial legislation that had been enacted through sb.as the myriad of complexities involving property transfer rapidly became apparent,the resulting text of the law grew and grew,ultimately to nearly six times the size of the sb law of.implementation report at.
the legislature adopted the task force proposed definition of change in ownership as section of the revenue and taxation code.because the legislature,in enacting section,adopted its language verbatim after reviewing the task force report,it is evident that the legislature intended for section to contain the overarching definition of a change in ownership for reassessment purposes.pacific southwest,supra,cal th at.
the legislature adopted the task force proposed statutory examples as section illustrative of transfers constituting a change in ownership and section illustrative of transfers not constituting,or excluded from,a change in ownership.task force report at pp.see also pacific southwest,supra,cal th at.
with respect to joint tenancies,section,subdivision d,provided that the creation,transfer or termination of any joint tenancy interest,except as provided in subdivision f of section and in section did constitute a change in ownership.stats,ch,see task force report at.section,subdivision f,in turn,provided that the creation or transfer of a joint tenancy interest if the transferor,after such creation or transfer,is one of the joint tenants did not constitute a change in ownership.stats,ch,see task force report at.section spelled out the extent to which joint tenancy interests would be reassessed on termination.stats,ch,see task force report at.
the cleanup legislation stats,ab 
almost as soon as ab was passed,it became apparent the legislation needed to be massaged,and the legislature did so through ab.
pertinent to this case,section was amended to make clear no change in ownership and no reassessment would occur when an original joint tenant terminated his or her interest if the interest was transferred to the remaining joint tenants or the spouse of the original joint tenant.republican caucus,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.the bill revises joint tenancy provisions of ab to p rovide that no reappraisal occurs when an original joint tenant terminates interest,if such interest vests in the remaining joint tenants.reappraisal occurs only upon the complete turnover of all original owners,original transferors,or if an interest is transferred to a new party,and not to the remaining present joint tenants.a r tc.assemblyman thomas hannigan,letter to governor edmund brown,september,pp.or,as the state board of equalization explained the revision of ab provides that reappraisal occurs only upon the complete turnover of all the original owners or the termination of the interest of the last remaining original transferor,and does not result in a reappraisal if the property is transferred to the remaining joint tenants.state bd.of equalization,letter to governor edmund brown,re assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.
collectively,assembly bill and worked a significant change in the way joint tenancies were treated for purposes of reassessment.as the implementation report explained the legislation of ab and ab represents a complete turnaround in the treatment of joint tenancies and undivided interests,from that of sb.for pursuant to sb,the creation of a joint tenancy was the trigger for reappraisal,while any termination of a joint tenancy interest was not a change in ownership however,the task force found the sb treatment to be exactly backward.it reasoned that joint tenancy confers some rights in both joint tenants while they are both alive,but the most meaningful of ownership rights complete fee title to the whole property would occur on the termination of the joint tenancy,such as the death of one of the joint tenants.that right,like rights under a will or intervivos trust,is contingent upon survivorship.thus,the first exclusion to the general rule under present law defining change in ownership is for any creation or transfer of a joint tenancy interest where the transferor remains as one of the joint tenants after the transaction section f.the termination of a joint tenancy interest,however,is generally deemed a change in ownership,which is the reverse of the earlier policy.implementation report at pp.
the implementation report also discussed the new concept of original transferors,pivotal to the new view that creation of a joint tenancy would not constitute a change in ownership,but termination would.in determining whether a joint tenancy transaction constitutes a change in ownership,and if so the extent to which the property would be reappraised,ab introduced and ab refined the concept of an original transferor.an original transferor is one or more persons who hold joint tenancy interests in property immediately after a complete turnover of the previous original owners occurs after the point in time at which the original ownership is established,no subsequent joint tenants who are added to the current ownership except the spouses just mentioned are treated as original transferors section a.implementation report at.the report then elaborated on various kinds of transfers by and between joint tenants and the consequence in terms of reappraisal.implementation report at pp.
this rather complex treatment,the implementation report explained,was designed to protect family joint tenancy interests,and those of original owners.implementation report at.
subsequent legislative refinement 
in,the legislature continued to refine the change in ownership statutes by enacting several bills,including sb,which revamped section,pertaining to joint tenancies.of finance,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.as amended.sections,and with respect to joint tenancy interests generally are to consolidate and clarify such language in section.assem.revenue and taxation,on bill reg.sess.as amended may,accord,state bd.of equalization,letter to governor edmund brown,re.bill reg.sess,section was completely rewritten in sb to clarify the treatment of joint tenancies.
specifically,intervivos transfers among the original transferors do not trigger reappraisal further,it is clarified that the transfer of an interest by the last surviving original transferor results in reappraisal of the entire property interest held by the original transferors.assem.revenue and taxation,on bill reg.sess.as amended may.the legislation also made clear the transfer of an interest by the last surviving original transferor results in reappraisal of the entire property interest held by the original transferors.ibid.original transferors,explained the assembly revenue and taxation committee report,are persons who transfer property into joint tenancy.so long as they are part of the chain of ownership there will be no reappraisal.once the original transferor interests are transferred,the entire property is reappraised.thus,partial reappraisals are avoided during the term of the joint tenancy.this scheme has some administrative advantages,and while there will be fewer reappraisals in the short run,the total property will have a higher reappraisal when the term of the original transferors is terminated.douglas bell,executive secretary,letter to governor edmund brown.
in,additional technical corrections were made to section to clarify that a termination of an interest in a joint tenancy is excluded from change in ownership only if an original transferor is still among the joint tenant.legis.analyst,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.
state board of equalization regulations 
the state board of equalization is charged with promulgating rules and regulations to ensure statewide uniformity in appraisal practices.to this end,the board has promulgated regulations,tit,and published annotations of its opinion letters on the reassessment and taxation of joint tenancies.the board interpretation of the statutes it is charged with implementing is generally entitled to significant deference.environmental protection information center california of forestry fire protection cal th,d,yamaha,supra,cal th at.
since the passage of assembly bill and in,the board has consistently treated family joint tenancies in the manner discussed above that is,that the creation of a family joint tenancy does not result in a change in ownership,but termination of such a joint tenancy does.the board implementing regulations require such treatment of a family joint tenancy,tit,subd.b.likewise,in annotations of its opinion letters,the board has consistently explained that while the creation of a family joint tenancy does not constitute a change in ownership triggering reappraisal,termination of such a tenancy does,property tax annotations,annotation,joint tenancy april,property tax annotations,annotation,joint tenancy.in fact,annotation addresses a situation analogous to that here.explaining that a mother creation of a joint tenancy with her son would not constitute a change in ownership,the annotation states a subsequent change to holding title as tenants in common would effect a change in ownership for purposes of reassessment.property tax annotations,annotation,joint tenancy if the joint tenants later take title to the property as tenants in common,there is a change in ownership of the percent undivided interest in the property acquired by the son.see also property tax annotations,annotation,joint tenancy,husband and wife recording document that their joint tenancy interests were held as community property resulted in third joint tenant interest becoming a tenancy in common,constituting a change in ownership unless an exclusion,such as exclusion,applied robert lambert,tax counsel for state bd.of equalization,opinion letter,may,discussing effect of spouse death on a joint tenancy that included a child,and subsequent deed from widower to himself as the beneficiary and a widower the latter terminated the joint tenancy between the surviving parent and child,resulting in a tenancy in common,and constituted a change in ownership.
the board is also called upon to provide instructions to county assessors in connection with the classification,assessment and taxation of property,and does so,in part,by way of letters to assessors lta,subds.e f.lta,dated april,provided a quick reference chart as a tool to help local assessors identify changes in ownership one example was a joint tenancy that included an original transferor.upon creation of the joint tenancy there would be no change in ownership,but on change to a tenancy in common,there would be.state bd.of equalization letters to county assessors april.this example was repeated in lta.state bd.of equalization letters to county assessors march.
the statutes are interrelated and implement the legislature intent 
mikkelsen contends that under the general definition of change in ownership set forth in section,no change in ownership occurred when he terminated his joint tenancy and created a tenancy in common.he maintains there was no transfer of any present interest in the property including the beneficial use thereof,and asserts section is controlling and the other statutory provisions pertaining to change in ownership are subordinate to it.
while mikkelsen is correct that section reflects the task force effort to articulate a general definition task force report at,and the legislature adopted the proposed language see pacific southwest,supra,cal th at,the extensive legislative history makes clear section does not stand alone and the other statutes pertaining to change in ownership further explicate what constitutes a change in ownership.sections and,for example,set forth the myriad examples the task force provided to more concretely define change in ownership.task force report at pp.these two statutes,as we have discussed,along with section,specifically address family joint tenancies,subd.d,subd.f.moreover,given the detailed discussion of these joint tenancies in the task force report and the implementation report task force report at pp.implementation report,pp,as well as in the legislative history of the subsequent retooling of section,letter to governor,there can be no question the legislature intended that the complement of these statutes,and not section,alone,defines when a change in ownership occurs.
accordingly,we do not agree with mikkelsen view that no transfer of a present interest for purposes of section occurred on the termination of his joint tenancy and creation of a tenancy in common.what the task force,and in turn the legislature,meant by that phrase is fleshed out in sections,and.task force report at statutory examples set forth in sections and elaborate on the meaning of change in ownership,providing guidance as to common transactions.moreover,what the task force was particularly concerned about in connection with present interests was protecting purely contingent or inchoate transfers from reassessment.task force report at pp.mikkelsen termination of his family joint tenancy interest and creation of a tenancy in common was not such an ephemeral transfer.
change in method of holding title exception 
mikkelsen,the assessment appeals board and the trial court also focused on section,subdivision a,which provides in pertinent part change in ownership shall not include a any transfer between coowners that results in a change in the method of holding title to the real property transferred without changing the proportional interests of the coowners in that real property,such as a partition of a tenancy in common,subd.a.as mikkelsen points out,the term coowners can embrace joint tenants,as well as tenants in common.
we also note section,which lists numerous transfers and transactions that do constitute a change in ownership begins with the caveat,e xcept as otherwise provided in section,change in ownership includes,but is
