opinion of the court 
this case involves the availability of federal historic rehabilitation tax credits hrtcs in connection with the restoration of an iconic venue known as the east hall also known as historic boardwalk hall,located on the boardwalk in atlantic city,new jersey.the new jersey sports and exposition authority njsea,a state agency which owned a leasehold interest in the east hall,was tasked with restoring it.after learning of the market for hrtcs among corporate investors,and of the additional revenue which that market could bring to the state through a syndicated partnership with one or more investors,njsea created a new jersey limited liability company,historic boardwalk hall,llc hbh,and subsequently sold a membership interest in to a subsidiary of pitney bowes,pb through a series of agreements,the transactions that were executed to admit pb as a member of hbh and to transfer ownership of njsea property interest in the east hall to hbh were designed so that pb could earn the hrtcs generated from the east hall rehabilitation.the internal revenue service irs determined that hbh was simply a vehicle to impermissibly transfer hrtcs from njsea to pb and that all hrtcs taken by pb should be reallocated to njsea the tax court disagreed,and sustained the allocation of the hrtcs to pb through its membership interest in hbh.because we agree with the irs contention that pb,in substance,was not a bona fide partner in hbh,we will reverse the decision of the tax court.
background 
background of the hrtc statute 
we begin by describing the history of the hrtc statute.under section of the internal revenue code of,as amended the code or the,a taxpayer is eligible for a tax credit equal to percent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures qres with respect to any certified historic structure.a.hrtcs are only available to the owner of the property interest.see generally see also publication,tax aspects of historic preservation,at,available at.in other words,the code does not permit hrtcs to be sold.
the idea of promoting historic rehabilitation projects can be traced back to the enactment of the national historic preservation act of,pub,stat,wherein congress emphasized the importance of preserving historic properties significant to the nation heritage,b.its purpose was to remedy the dilemma that historic properties significant to the nation heritage are being lost or substantially altered,often inadvertently,with increasing frequency.pye united states,cir quoting b.among other things,the national historic preservation act set out a process which require d federal agencies with the authority to license an undertaking to take into account the effect of the undertaking on any site that is eligible for inclusion in the national register prior to issuing the license.id.quoting.it also authorized the secretary of the interior to expand and maintain a national register of historic places.a a.
the tax reform act of furthered the goals of the legislation by creating new tax incentives for private sector investment in certified historic buildings.see tax reform act of,pub,stat.the pertinent provisions of the act indicate that congress wanted to encourage the private sector to restore historic buildings,and,to provide that encouragement,it established incentives that were similar to the tax incentives for building new structures.see,cong.rec.specifically,to equalize incentives affecting the restoration of historic structures and the construction of new buildings,it included a provision allowing for the amortization of rehabilitation expenditures over five years,or,alternatively,an accelerated method of depreciation with respect to the entire depreciable basis of the rehabilitated property.see publication,rehabilitation tax credit,at,available at hereinafter referred to as irs rehab.
the revenue act of went further to incent the restoration of historic buildings.it made a rehabilitation credit available in lieu of the amortization period provided by the act.see revenue act of,pub,stat.see also irs rehab,at.in,congress expanded the rehabilitation credit to three tiers,so that a taxpayer could qualify for up to a credit for certain historic rehabilitations.see economic recovery tax act of,pub,stat.see also irs rehab,at.
the tax reform act of made extensive changes to the tax law,including the removal of many tax benefits that had been available to real estate investors.see tax reform act of,pub,stat.see also staff of comm.on tax n,general explanation of the tax reform act of comm.print.hereinafter referred to as general explanation of tra.the hrtc survived,although it was reduced to its modern form of a system with a credit for qres incurred in renovating a certified historic structure,and a credit for qres incurred in renovating a qualified rehabilitated other than a certified historic structure.see tax reform act of,stat.at see also.a congressional report for the act discussed the rationale for keeping the hrtc 
in,the congress restructured and increased the tax credit for rehabilitation expenditures because it was concerned that the tax incentives provided to investments in new structures,accelerated cost recovery would have the undesirable effect of reducing the relative attractiveness of the incentives to rehabilitate and modernize older structures,and might lead investors to neglect older structures and relocate their businesses.
the congress concluded that the incentives granted to rehabilitations in remain justified.such incentives are needed because the social and aesthetic values of rehabilitating and preserving older structures are not necessarily taken into account in investors profit projections.a tax incentive is needed because market forces might otherwise channel investments away from such projects because of the extra costs of undertaking rehabilitations of older or historic buildings.
general explanation of tra,at.
evidently mindful of how the tax incentives it had offered might be abused,congress in codified the economic substance doctrine,which it defined as the common law doctrine under which tax benefits with respect to a transaction are not allowable if the transaction does not have economic substance or lacks a business purpose.o a.at the same time,however,congress was at pains to emphasize that the hrtc was preserved.a congressional report noted 
if the realization of the tax benefits of a transaction is consistent with the congressional purpose or plan that the tax benefits were designed by congress to effectuate,it is not intended that such tax benefits be disallowed thus,for example,it is not intended that a tax credit,section,which provides for hrtcs,be disallowed in a transaction pursuant to which,in form and substance,a taxpayer makes the type of investment or undertakes the type of activity that the credit was intended to encourage.
staff of comm.on tax n,technical explanation of the revenue provisions of the reconciliation act of,as amended,in combination with the patient protection and affordable care act,at comm.print emphasis added.in sum,the hrtc statute is a deliberate decision to skew the neutrality of the tax system to encourage taxable entities to invest,both in form and substance,in historic rehabilitation projects.
factual background of the east hall renovation 
njsea background 
in,the state of new jersey formed njsea to build,own,and operate the meadowlands sports complex in east rutherford,new jersey.the state legislature expanded njsea jurisdiction in to build,own,and operate a new convention center in atlantic city and to acquire,renovate,and operate the east hall.completed in,the east hall was famous for hosting the annual miss america pageant,and,in,it was added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark.
in october,before renovations on the east hall began,njsea obtained a year leasehold interest in the property for per year from the owner,the atlantic county improvement authority.about a month later,njsea entered into an agreement with the atlantic city convention center authority,the of the east hall,to operate both the east hall and the new convention center.in july,njsea and the atlantic city convention center authority handed over management responsibility for both the east hall and the convention center to a private entity,spectacor management group spectacor.
commencement of the east hall renovation 
once construction started on the new convention center in the early,njsea began planning for the future of the east hall and decided to convert it into a special events facility.that conversion was initially anticipated to cost.renovations were to be performed in four phases,with the entire project expected to be completed in late.
the renovation project began in december of.by that time,njsea had entered into agreements with the new jersey casino reinvestment development pursuant to which the casino reinvestment development authority agreed to reimburse njsea up to for certain expenses and up to for costs incurred in the east hall renovation.in a march document prepared in connection with a separate bond issuance njsea noted that it had received grants from the casino reinvestment development authority to pay for the first phase of the east hall renovation and that f unding for the remaining cost of the project is expected to be obtained through the issuance by njsea of federally taxable state contract bonds.at.in june,njsea issued in state contract bonds to fund the east hall renovation.
the first two phases of the renovation were completed prior to the miss america pageant held in september,and phase began the following month.through,njsea had entered into rehabilitation contracts for approximately,and had expended of that amount.also at about that time,the estimate of the total cost of the project increased to.njsea annual report stated that the casino reinvestment development authority had agreed to reimburse njsea for all costs in excess of bond proceeds for the project.id.at.thus,by the end of,between the proceeds it had received from the bond issuance and funds provided or to be provided by the casino reinvestment development authority,njsea had assurances that the east hall rehabilitation project was fully funded.
finding a partner 
a the proposal from sovereign capital resources 
in august,a few months prior to the beginning of renovations on the east hall,paul hoffman from sovereign capital resources sovereign wrote to njsea regarding a consulting proposal for the sale of the historic rehabilitation tax credits expected to be generated by the east hall rehabilitation.id.at.that proposal was designed to give njsea representatives a better perspective on the structure of the historic tax credit sale,as well as the potential financial benefits estimated in excess of million to the project.id.as an initial summary,hoffman stated that the best way to view the equity generated by a sale of the historic tax credits is to think of it as an million interest only loan that has no term and may not require any principal repayment.id.hoffman noted that although njsea,as a entity,would have no use for the federal tax credit generated by qres incurred in renovating historic structures,there were entities that actively invest in hrtc properties and are generally fortune corporations with substantial federal income tax liabilities.id.at.hoffman explained that because t he hrtc is earned when the building is placed into service and can not be transferred after the fact,the corporate investor should be admitted into the partnership that owns the project as soon as possible.id.
hoffman next sketched out the proposed transactions that would allow njsea to bring an investor interested in hrtcs into of the east hall and yet provide for njsea to retain its interests in the east hall.id.at.first,njsea would sublease its interest in the east hall to a newly created partnership in which njsea would be the general partner and a corporate investor would be the limited partner.the sublease agreement would be treated as a sale for tax purposes since the sublease would extend longer than the useful life of the property under tax rules.next,that partnership would allocate of its profit and loss to the limited partner corporate investor so that such investor could claim substantially all of the tax credits,but only be allocated a small portion of the cash flow.id.at.finally,after a sufficient waiting period,njsea would be given a purchase option to the corporate investor interest.with all that said,however,hoffman warned that c orporate purchasers of hrtcs rarely accept construction risk,and t ypically provide no more than of their equity to the partnership during the construction period.id.at.thus,hoffman recommend ed that njsea plan to issue enough bonds to meet the construction financing requirements of the project.id.
hoffman then provided a valuation of the hrtcs.he estimated that njsea could expect an investor to contribute approximately to per each dollar of hrtc allocated to the investor.in valuing the hrtcs,hoffman assume d that njsea would like to minimize the cash distribution to the investor and retain ownership of the east hall.id.he also listed four standard guarantees that i nvestors in the tax credit industry would require as part of the transaction a construction completion guaranty an operating deficit guaranty a tax indemnity and an environmental indemnity.id.at.additionally,hoffman noted that the investor will expect that either njsea or the state of new jersey be obligated to make debt service on the bond issuance if operating revenue is insufficient to support the debt payments.id.
njsea decided to further explore the benefits described by sovereign.in march,njsea issued a request for proposal as supplemented by an addendum on april,the rfp from qualified financial advisors in connection with a proposed historic rehabilitation tax credit transaction relating to the rehabilitation of the east hall.id.at.the rfp provided that the selected candidate would be required to prepare a tax credit offering memorandum,market the tax credits to potential investors and successfully close a partnership agreement with the proposed tax credit investor.id.at.in june,after receiving four responses,njsea selected sovereign as its f inancial a rranger for the historic tax credit transaction.id.at.
b the initial and revised five year projections 
in september,as the second phase of the east hall renovation had just been completed,spectacor,as the east hall operator,produced draft financial projections for the east hall beginning for the fiscal year those projections estimated that the east hall would incur a net operating loss of approximately million for each of those five years.sovereign received a copy of the projections,and,in a memo dated october,responded that it was cautious about spectacor figures as they might prove excessively conservative.id.at.in a december,memo to njsea representatives,sovereign said that,for the partnership between njsea and an hrtc investor to earn the desired tax credits,the partnership should be able to reasonably show that it is a going concern.id.at.to that end,sovereign suggested that t o improve the operating results,njsea could explore shifting the burden of some of the operating expenses from the partnership to the land lessor either the atlantic county improvement authority or njsea depending upon how the partnership was structured.id.
approximately two months later,sovereign received revised estimates prepared by spectacor.those pro forma statements projected much smaller net operating losses,ranging from approximately in to in.within two weeks,spectacor made additional revisions to those projections which resulted in estimated net operating income for those five years,ranging from approximately in to million in.about of the remarkable financial turnaround the east hall thus was projected to enjoy on paper was due to the removal of all projected utilities expenses for each of the five years million in,indexed for inflation each year thereafter.when the accountants for the project,reznick,fedder silverman reznick,included those utilities expenses in their compiled projections one week later,sovereign instructed them to t ake the utility cost completely out of expenses,because njsea would pay at the upper tier and then we should have a working operating model.id.at.
c confidential offering memorandum 
on march,sovereign prepared a page confidential information memorandum the confidential memorandum or the memo which it sent to potential investors and which was titled the sale of historic tax credits generated by the renovation of the historic atlantic city boardwalk convention hall.id.at.although the executive summary in the confidential memorandum stated that the east hall renovation would cost approximately million,the budget attached to the memo indicated that the total construction costs of the project were.id.at.moreover,the memo stated that t he rehabilitation was being funded entirely by njsea.id.at.the difference between the million estimated renovation id.at,and the total construction costs of was,as the memo candidly put it,the p roceeds from the sale of the historic tax credits id.at.the memo did not contemplate that those proceeds,estimated to be approximately,would be applied to total construction costs but rather indicated that the funds would be used for three things payment of a development fee to njsea payment of in legal,accounting,and syndication fees related to the transaction and the establishment of a working capital reserve.
the memo also provided financial projections through.those projections assumed that the investor would receive a priority distribution the preferred return from available cash flow on its contribution,which contemporaneous njsea executive committee notes described as required by tax rules.id.at.the financial projections provided for sufficient net operating income ranging from in to in to pay a portion of the preferred return on an annual basis varying from in to in,but also showed substantial tax losses through that were mainly attributable to depreciation deductions.
d selection of pitney bowes 
four entities,including pb,responded to the confidential memorandum and submitted offers regarding the purchase of the historic tax credits anticipated to be generated by the renovation of the east hall.id.at.in a may letter supplementing its offer,pb recommended that njsea fund the construction costs through a loan to the partnership,rather than in the form of capital contributions,so that the managing member could obtain a profit and therefore the partnership would be respected as such for tax purposes.id.at.
on july,pb and njsea executed a letter of intent loi reflecting their agreement that pb would make capital contributions totaling million over four installments in exchange for a membership interest in hbh,which njsea had recently formed.the loi further indicated that pb would also make an investor loan of million.consistent with pb earlier recommendation,the loi said that njsea,as the managing member retaining a interest in hbh,would provide approximately million in the form of two loans a purchase money obligation that represented the amount of qres incurred by njsea in the east hall renovation prior to pb investment the acquisition loan and a loan to finance the remainder of the projected qres the construction loan.according to the loi,it was anticipated that the project would qualify for a minimum of in hrtcs in and in.the loi also noted that a preferred return would be paid to pb.although the loi contemplated that pb would receive of any available cash flow,hbh financial projections from to forecasted no cash flow available for distribution during that time frame.similarly,while the loi mentioned that pb would receive of the net proceeds from a sale of hbh,a memo from njsea outside counsel to njsea suggested that,d ue to the structure of the transaction,the fair market value of pb interest in hbh would be insignificant.at.thus,for its investment of million million in capital contributions and the million investor loan,pb would receive,in addition to the preferred return,of the approximately million worth of hrtcs that would be generated from the qres.
e additional revisions to financial projections 
prior to the closing on pb commitment to purchase a membership interest in hbh,an accountant from reznick who was preparing hbh financial projections,sent a memo to hoffman indicating that the two proposed loans from njsea to hbh ha d been set up to be paid from available cash flow but that t here was not sufficient cash to amortize this debt.id.at.to remedy the problem,hoffman instructed the accountant to increase the projection of baseline revenues in by million by adding a new revenue source of titled naming rights,and by increasing both parking revenue and net concession revenue by each.additionally,whereas the initial projections assumed that baseline revenues and expenses would both increase by on an annual basis,the revised projections used at closing assumed that baseline revenues would increase by annually,while maintaining the estimate for the annual increases in baseline expenses.with those modifications,reznick was able to project that,even after paying pb its preferred return,hbh could fully pay off the acquisition loan by,at which point hbh would then be able to make principal payments on the construction loan.
also prior to closing,by moving certain expenditures from the category to the eligible category reznick increased by about million the amount of projected qres that the east hall renovation would generate.that increase in qres resulted in an approximately million increase in projected hrtcs from to.that uptick in hrtcs,in turn,resulted in an increase in pb anticipated capital contribution from to 
on september,njsea and pb executed various documents to implement the negotiated transaction,and pb made an initial contribution of to hbh.
a the hbh operating agreement 
the primary agreement used to admit pb as a member of hbh and to restate hbh governing provisions was the amended and restated operating agreement the area.the area stated that the purpose of hbh was to acquire,develop,finance,rehabilitate,own,maintain,operate,license,lease,and sell or otherwise dispose of a n year subleasehold interest in the historic east hall for use as a special events facility.id.at.the area provided that pb would hold a ownership interest as the investor member,and njsea would hold a ownership interest as the managing member.the area also provided that pb,in addition to its initial contribution,would make three additional capital contributions totaling collectively,with the initial capital contribution.those additional contributions were contingent upon the completion of certain events,including verification of the amount of rehabilitation costs that had been incurred to date that would be classified as qres to generate hrtcs.according to section c v of the area,each of the four contributions were to be used by hbh to pay down the principal of the acquisition loan contemplated by the loi.pursuant to the area,njsea,in addition to providing hbh with the acquisition loan and the construction loan,agreed to pay all excess development costs the completion guaranty fund all operating deficits through loans to hbh the operating deficit guaranty,and indemnify pb against any loss incurred by pb as a result of any liability arising from hazardous materials relating to the east hall including remediation costs the environmental guaranty.
the area also set forth a detailed order of priority of distributions from hbh cash flow.after distributing any title insurance proceeds or any environmental insurance proceeds to pb,cash flow was to be distributed as follows to pb for certain repayments on its million investor loan contemplated by the loi to pb and njsea,in accordance with their respective membership interests,until pb received an amount equal to the current and any accrued and unpaid preferred return as mentioned in the loi to pb for an amount equal to the income tax liability generated by income earned by hbh that was allocated to pb,if any to njsea for an amount equal to the current and any accrued and unpaid payments of interest and principal owed on the acquisition loan and the construction loan to njsea in an amount equal to any loans it made to hbh pursuant to the operating deficit guaranty and the balance,if any,to pb and njsea,in accordance with their respective membership interests.
additionally,the area provided the parties with certain repurchase rights and obligations in the event that njsea desired to take certain actions that were prohibited under the area or otherwise required it to obtain pb consent to take such actions,njsea could instead without the consent of pb purchase pb interest in hbh.in the papers submitted to us,the name the parties gave to this ability of njsea to buy out pb without pb consent is the consent option.the purchase price under the consent option is not measured by any fair market value of pb interest,if any such value were even to exist,but rather is equal to the value of any realized projected tax benefits and cash distributions due to pb through the end of the tax credit recapture period in the event that njsea committed a material default as defined by the area,pb had the right to compel njsea to purchase its interest the material default option for that same price 
to protect pb interest,section of the area mandated that njsea obtain a guaranteed investment contract the guaranteed investment contract the guaranteed investment contract had to be reasonably satisfactory to pb,in the amount required to secure the payment of the purchase price to be paid by njsea in the event that njsea exercised the option to purchase pb interest under another purchase option agreement that njsea had id.at see supra note.the area also provided that the guaranteed investment contract had to be obtained on or before the payment of pb second capital contribution.in a memo dated two days prior to closing,sovereign explained to njsea that t he guaranteed investment contract should be sized to pay off the investor loan of million,accrued but unpaid interest on the investor loan,and pb annual priority distributions.id.at.
b lease amendment and sublease 
njsea also executed several documents that purported to transfer ownership of its interest in the east hall to hbh.first,njsea entered into an amended and restated agreement with its lessor,atlantic county improvement authority,to extend the term of njsea leasehold interest in the east hall from to after that agreement,njsea and hbh entered into a sublease with njsea,as landlord,and hbh,as tenant.id.at.
c acquisition loan and construction loan 
as contemplated in the loi,njsea provided financing to hbh in the form of two loans.first,njsea and hbh executed a document setting forth the terms of the acquisition loan,reflecting njsea agreement to finance the entire purchase price that hbh paid to njsea for the subleasehold interest in the east hall,which amounted to.that amount was intended to represent the construction costs that njsea had incurred with respect to the east hall renovation prior to pb making its investment in hbh.the acquisition loan provided for hbh to repay the loan in equal annual installments for years,beginning on april,with an interest rate of per year however,if hbh did not have sufficient cash available to pay the annual installments when due,the shortfall would accrue without interest and be added to the next annual installment.hbh pledged its subleasehold interest in the east hall as security for the acquisition loan.
second,njsea and hbh executed a document setting forth the terms of the construction loan,reflecting njsea agreement to finance the projected remaining construction costs for renovating the east hall,to be repaid by hbh in annual installments for years,beginning on april,at an annual interest rate of.although the parties only anticipated of additional construction costs the maximum amount that hbh could withdraw from the construction loan provided by njsea was.that difference,was nearly identical to the total investment that pb was to make in hbh in capital contributions and for the investor loan.see infra section.similar to the acquisition loan,the construction loan provided for equal annual installments out of available cash flow,but,if sufficient cash was not available,any shortfall would accrue without interest and be added to the next annual installment.hbh gave njsea a second mortgage on its subleasehold interest in the east hall as security for the construction loan.
d development agreement 
hbh and njsea also entered into a development agreement in connection with the ongoing rehabilitation of the east hall.the agreement stated that hbh had retained njsea as the developer to use its best efforts to perform certain services with respect to the rehabilitation of the east hall including renovation of the east hall,acquisition of necessary building permits and other approvals,acquisition of financing for the renovations,and acquisition of historic housing credits for the renovations.id.at.the agreement noted that since december,njsea ha d been performing certain of those services in anticipation of the formation of hbh.id.the agreement provided that hbh would pay a development fee to njsea,but that fee was not to be earned until the rehabilitation was completed.prior to the execution of the development agreement,as njsea was spending over million towards the renovation of the east hall,it did not pay itself any development fee or otherwise account for such a fee.
e purchase option and option to compel 
concurrent with the area and the sublease agreement,pb and njsea entered into a purchase option agreement the call option and an agreement to compel purchase the put option.the call option provides njsea the right to acquire pb membership interest in hbh,and the put option provides pb the right to require njsea to purchase pb membership interest in hbh.under the call option,njsea had the right to purchase pb interest in hbh at any time during the month period beginning months after the east hall was placed in service if njsea did not exercise the call option,then pb had the right to exercise the put option at any time during the month period beginning months after the east hall was placed in service.for both the put option and the call option,the purchase price was set at an amount equal to the greater of of the fair market value of of the membership interests in hbh or any accrued and unpaid preferred return due to pb.as already noted,supra section.a,the area mandated that njsea purchase the guaranteed investment contract to secure funding of the purchase price of pb membership interest,should either of the options be exercised 
f tax benefits guaranty 
as contemplated by the confidential memorandum,hbh and pb entered into a tax benefits guaranty agreement the tax benefits guaranty.pursuant to that guaranty,upon a final determination of a tax benefits reduction event,hbh agreed to pay to pb an amount equal to the sum of any reduction in projected tax benefits,as revised by the then applicable revised economic projections,as a result of an irs challenge any additional tax liability incurred by pb from partnership items allocated to it by hbh as a result of an irs challenge interest and penalties imposed by the irs on pb in connection with any irs challenge an amount sufficient to compensate pb for reasonable legal and administrative expenses related to such a challenge,up to and an amount sufficient to pay any federal income tax liability owed by pb on receiving any of the payments listed in through.id.at.although hbh was the named obligor of the tax benefits guaranty,the agreement provided that njsea shall fund any obligations of hbh to pb under the tax benefits guaranty.id.at.
hbh in operation 
a construction in progress 
pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement executed on the day of closing between njsea,as assignor,and hbh,as assignee,various agreements and contracts including occupancy agreements,construction contracts,architectural drawings,permits,and management and service agreements were assigned to hbh.hbh opened bank accounts in its name,and it deposited revenues and paid expenses through those accounts.
as previously indicated,supra section.a,pb capital contributions were,pursuant to the area,supposed to be used to pay down the acquisition loan.although that did occur,any decrease in the balance of the acquisition loan was then offset by a corresponding increase in the amount of the construction loan.as the tax court explained 
shortly after pb capital contributions were used to pay down the principal on the acquisition loan,a corresponding draw would be made on the c onstruction loan,and njsea would advance those funds to hbh.ultimately,these offsetting draws left hbh with cash in the amount of pb capital contributions,a decreased balance on the a cquisition l oan,and an increased balance on the c onstruction l oan.these funds were then used by hbh to pay assorted fees related to the transaction and to pay njsea a developer fee for its work managing and overseeing the east hall rehabilitation.
id.at.also as discussed above,supra section,the parties set the upper limit of the construction loan approximately million higher than the anticipated amount of the total remaining construction costs as of the closing date,which would allow hbh to use pb approximately million in contributions to pay njsea a development fee and expenses related to the transaction without being concerned that it would exceed the maximum limit on the construction loan provided by njsea.
pb made its second capital contribution in two installments,a payment in december,and a payment the following month.once those contributions were received by njsea and used to pay down the principal on the acquisition loan,njsea,instead of using the entire capital contribution to fund a corresponding draw by hbh on the construction loan,used of that amount to purchase the required guaranteed investment contract as security for its potential obligation or opportunity to purchase pb interest in hbh 
hbh experienced a net operating for both and,even though projections had indicated that hbh would generate net operating income of in for the tax years ending in and,hbh reported approximately million in qres,about million more qres than contemplated in the financial projections attached to the area see supra note.as a result,pb required aggregate capital contribution was increased by approximately million to and the investor loan was increased by to 
b post construction phase 
according to njsea annual report,the million renovation of east hall was completed on time and on budget and reopened in october.id.at.approximately a year later,pb made its third and largest capital contribution of.around the time that contribution was made,reznick prepared revised financial projections.whereas,at closing,reznick had forecasted of net operating income for,the accountants now projected a net operating loss of.ultimately,after reality finished with the pretense of profitability,hbh net operating loss for was.notwithstanding the discrepancy between the initial and actual budgets for,reznick did not alter projections for and future years.for years through reznick projected an aggregate net operating income of approximately million.hbh actually experienced an aggregate net operating loss of over million for those five years.in early,pb made a portion of its fourth and final capital contribution,paying of its commitment of 
when reznick was preparing hbh audited financial statements,it addressed a possible impairment issue under fasb.id.at.fasb requires a write down of an impaired asset to its actual value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable,such as when there is a operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a asset.statement of financial accounting standards,financial accounting standards board,http hereinafter referred to as fasb.in a memo to hbh audit file,reznick considered a write down of hbh interest in the east hall pursuant to fasb,d ue to the fact that hbh has experienced substantial operating losses and has not generated any operating cash flow since its inception.at.in the end,however,reznick was persuaded by the powers at hbh that hbh was never meant to function as a venture and that the state of new jersey was going to make good on hbh losses.in deciding against a write down,reznick explained 
per discussions with the client,it was determined that hbh was not structured to provide operating cash flow.instead,the managing member,njsea,agreed to fund all operating deficits of hbh in order to preserve the east hall as a facility to be used by the residents of the state of new jersey.njsea has the ability to fund the deficits as a result of the luxury and other taxes provided by the hospitality and entertainment industry in the state.
id.since there is no ceiling on the amount of funds to be provided by njsea to hbh under the area,reznick concluded there was no triggering event which require d a write down under fasb.id.that same discussion and conclusion were included in separate memos to hbh audit files for and by the end of,the operating deficit loan payable to njsea was in excess of million.
the tax returns and irs audit 
on its form hbh reported an ordinary taxable loss of,and in qres on its form,hbh reported an ordinary taxable loss of and in qres.on its form,hbh reported an ordinary taxable loss of and of qres.in accordance with its membership interest in hbh,pb was issued a schedule k allocating of the qres for each of those tax years collectively referred to herein as the subject years 
following an audit of the returns of the subject years,the irs issued to hbh a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa.that fpaa determined that all separately stated partnership items reported by hbh on its returns for the subject years should be reallocated from pb to njsea.the irs made that adjustment on various alternative,but related,grounds,two of which are of particular importance on appeal first,the irs said that hbh should not be recognized as a partnership for federal income tax purposes because it was created for the express purpose of improperly passing along tax benefits to pb and should be treated as a sham transaction and,second,it said that pb claimed partnership interest in hbh was not,based on the totality of the circumstances,a bona fide partnership participation because pb had no meaningful stake in the success or failure of hbh the irs also determined that penalties applied.
c.the tax court decision 
njsea,in its capacity as the tax matters partner of hbh filed a timely petition to the united states tax court in response to the fpaa following a trial in april,the tax court issued an opinion in favor of hbh.
the tax court first rejected the commissioner argument that hbh is a sham under the economic substance doctrine.see supra note and accompanying text.as the court saw it,all of the irs arguments concerning the economic substance of hbh were made without taking into account the percent return and the hrtcs.id.at.the court disagreed with the irs assertion that pb invested in the hbh transaction solely to earn hrtcs.id.at.instead,the court believe d that the percent return and the expected tax credits should be viewed together,and v iewed as a whole,the hbh and the east hall transactions did have economic substance because the parties had a legitimate business purpose to allow pb to invest in the east hall rehabilitation.id.in support of that determination,the tax court explained 
most of pb capital contributions were used to pay a development fee to njsea for its role in managing the rehabilitation of the east hall according to the development agreement between hbh and njsea.the commissioner contention that pb was unnecessary to the transaction because njsea was going to rehabilitate the east hall without a corporate investor overlooks the impact that pb had on the rehabilitation no matter njsea intentions at the time it decided to rehabilitate the east hall,pb investment provided njsea with more money than it otherwise would have had as a result,the rehabilitation ultimately cost the state of new jersey less.the commissioner does not allege that a circular flow of funds resulted in pb receiving its percent preferred return on its capital contributions.in addition,pb received the rehabilitation tax credits.
the tax court further explained that pb faced risks as a result of joining hbh.first it faced the risk that the rehabilitation would not be completed,and additionally,both njsea and pb faced potential liability for environmental hazards from the rehabilitation.id.at.while recognizing that hbh and pb were insured parties under njsea existing environmental insurance policy,the tax court noted that there was no guaranty that the insurance payout would cover any potential liability and if njsea was required to make up any difference,it would be financially able to do so.id.at.in sum,because njsea had more money for the rehabilitation than it would have had if pb had not invested in hbh,and b oth parties would receive a net economic benefit from the transaction if the rehabilitation was successful,the tax court concluded that hbh had objective economic substance.id.at.
the tax court used similar reasoning to reject the commissioner assertion that pb was not a bona fide partner in hbh.specifically,the court rejected the commissioner contentions that pb had no meaningful stake in hbh success or failure and pb interest in hbh is more like debt than equity.id.at.after citing to the partnership test laid out in commissioner culbertson,the court determined that pb and njsea,in good faith and acting with a business purpose,intended to join together in the present conduct of a business enterprise at.after t aking into account the stated purpose behind hbh formation,the parties investigation of the transaction,the transaction documents,and the parties respective roles,the tax court held that hbh was a valid partnership.id.at.
regarding the formation of a partnership,the court said that,because pb and njsea joined together in a transaction with economic substance to allow pb to invest in the east hall rehabilitation,and the decision to invest provided a net economic benefit to pb through its percent preferred return and rehabilitation tax credits,it was clear that pb was a partner in hbh.id.at.the court opined that,since the east hall operated at a loss,even if one were to ignore the hrtcs,pb interest is not more like debt than equity because pb was not guaranteed to receive a percent return every year as there might not be sufficient cashflow to pay it.id.at.
the tax court also placed significant emphasis on the parties investigation and documentation to support its finding that the parties intended to join together in a rehabilitation of the east hall.id.at.according to the court,the confidential memorandum accurately described the substance of the transaction an investment in the east hall rehabilitation.id.the court then cited to the parties investigation into mitigating potential environmental hazards,as well as the parties receipt of a number of opinion letters evaluating various aspects of the transaction,to support its finding of an effort to join together in the rehabilitation of the east hall.id.the court decided that t he executed transaction documents accurately represent ed the substance of the transaction to rehabilitate and manage the east hall.id.also,the court found it noteworthy that the parties carried out their responsibilities under the area njsea oversaw the east hall rehabilitation,and pb made its required capital contributions.id.at.
hence,the tax court entered a decision in favor of hbh.this timely appeal by the commissioner followed.
the alleges that the tax court erred by allowing pb,through its membership interest in hbh,to receive the hrtcs generated by the east hall renovation.he characterizes the transaction as an impermissible indirect sale of the hrtcs to a taxable entity by means of a purported partnership between the seller of the credits,njsea,and the purchaser,pb.appellant opening br.at.while the commissioner raises several arguments in his effort to reallocate the hrtcs from njsea to pb,we focus primarily on his contention that pb should not be treated as a bona fide partner in hbh because pb did not have a meaningful stake in the success or failure of the partnership we agree that pb was not a bona fide partner in hbh.
a.the test 
a partnership exists when,as the supreme court said in commissioner culbertson,two or more parties in good faith and acting with a business purpose intend to join together in the present conduct of the enterprise.at.see also comm r tower.when the existence of an alleged partnership arrangement is challenged by outsiders,the question arises whether the partners really and truly intended to join together for the purpose of carrying on business and sharing in the profits or losses or both.southgate master fund,ex rel.montgomery capital advisors united states,cir the sine qua non of a partnership is an intent to join together for the purpose of sharing in the profits and losses of a genuine business.
the culbertson test is used to analyze the bona fides of a partnership and to decide whether a party interest was a bona fide equity partnership participation.tifd iii e,united states,cir hereinafter castle harbour.to determine,under culbertson,whether pb was a bona fide partner in hbh,we must consider the totality of the circumstances,
considering all the facts the agreement,the conduct of the parties in execution of its provisions,their statements,the testimony of disinterested persons,the relationship of the parties,their respective abilities and capital contributions,the actual control of income and the purposes for which it is used,and any other facts throwing light on their true intent.
at.that test turns on the fair,objective characterization of the interest in question upon consideration of all the circumstances.castle harbour,at.
the culbertson test illustrat es the principle that a transaction must be judged by its substance,rather than its form,for income tax purposes.trousdale comm r,cir.even if there are indicia of an equity participation in a partnership,castle harbour,at,we should not accept at face value artificial constructs of the partnership agreement,id.at.rather,we must examine those indicia to determine whether they truly reflect an intent to share in the profits or losses of an enterprise or,instead,are either illusory of insignificant.id.at.in essence,to be a bona fide partner for tax purposes,a party must have a meaningful stake in the success or failure of the enterprise.id.
b.the commissioner guideposts 
the commissioner points us to two cases he calls recent guideposts bearing on the bona fide equity partner inquiry.appellant opening br.at.first,he cites to the decision of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in castle harbour.the castle harbour court relied on culbertson in disregarding the claimed partnership status of two foreign banks.those banks had allegedly formed a partnership,known as castle harbour,llc,with tifd iii e,tifd,a subsidiary of general electric capital corporation,with an intent to allocate certain income away from tifd,an entity subject to united states income taxes,to the two foreign banks,which were not subject to such taxes.id.at.relying on the doctrine,the district court had rejected the irs contention that the foreign banks interest was not a bona fide equity partnership participation because,in addition to the strong and obvious tax motivations,the partnership had some additional motivation to raise equity capital.id.at.in reversing the district court,the second circuit stated that it did not mean to imply that it was error to consider the sham test,as the irs purported to rely in part on that test.the error was in failing to test the banks interest also under culbertson after finding that the partnership characterization survived the sham test.id.the second circuit focused primarily on the culbertson inquiry,and specifically on the irs contention that the foreign banks should not be treated as equity partners in the castle harbour partnership because they had no meaningful stake in the success or failure of the partnership.id.at.
applying the bona fide partner theory as embodied in culbertson test,the castle harbour court held that the banks purported partnership interest was,in substance,overwhelmingly in the nature of a secured lender interest,which would neither be harmed by poor performance of the partnership nor significantly enhanced by extraordinary profits.id.at.although it acknowledged that the banks interest was not totally devoid of indicia of an equity participation in a partnership,the court said that those indicia were either illusory or insignificant in the overall context of the banks investment,and,thus,t he irs appropriately rejected the equity characterization.id.
the castle harbour court observed that consider ing whether an interest has the prevailing character of debt or equity can be helpful in analyzing whether,for tax purposes,the interest should be deemed a bona fide equity participation.id.at.in differentiating between debt and equity,it counseled that the significant factor is whether the funds were advanced with reasonable expectation of repayment regardless of the success of the venture or were placed at the risk of the business.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,in determining whether the banks interest was a bona fide equity participation,the second circuit focused both on the banks lack of downside risk and lack of upside potential in the partnership.it agreed with the district court recogni tion that the banks ran no meaningful risk of being paid anything less than the reimbursement of their investment at the rate of return.id.at.in support of that finding,the court noted that 
tifd was required to keep commercial paper or cash,in an amount equal to of the current value of the amount that the banks would receive upon dissolution of the partnership.the partnership,in addition,was obliged for the banks protection to maintain million worth of insurance.finally,and most importantly,general electric capital corporation a large and very stable corporation gave the banks its personal guaranty,which effectively secured the partnership obligations to the banks.
regarding upside potential,however,the second circuit disagreed with the district court conclusion that the banks had a meaningful and unlimited share of the upside potential.id.at.that conclusion could not be credited because it depended on the fictions projected by the partnership agreement,rather than on assessment of the practical realities.id.at.indeed,the second circuit stated that t he realistic possibility of upside potential not the absence of formal caps is what governs this analysis.id.in reality,the banks enjoyed only a narrowly circumscribed ability to participate in profits in excess of the repayment of its investment,because tifd had the power to either effectively restrict the banks share of profits at above an return of million,or to buy out their interest at any time at a negligible cost of approximately,id.at.the return on the banks initial investment of million was thus limited to million plus a relatively insignificant incremental return over the projected life of the partnership,id.at.in sum,look ing not so much at the labels used by the partnership but at true facts and circumstances,as culbertson directs,the castle harbour court was compel led to conclu de that the banks interest was,for tax purposes,not a bona fide equity participation.id.at.
the second,more recent,precedent that the commissioner directs us to as a guidepost is virginia historic tax credit fund lp commissioner,cir hereinafter virginia historic.there,the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit held that certain transactions between a partnership and its partners which sought to qualify for tax credits under the commonwealth of virginia historic rehabilitation credit program the virginia program were,in substance,sales of those credits which resulted in taxable income to the partnership.id.at.in virginia historic,certain investment funds the funds were structured as partnerships that investors could join by contributing capital.id.at.through four linked partnership entities with one source partnership entity the source partnership,t he funds would use the capital provided by investors to partner with historic property developers operating partnerships renovating smaller projects,in exchange for state tax credits.id.the confidential offering memorandum given to potential investors provided that,f or every contributed by an investor,one of the fund s would provide the investor with in tax credits.if such credits could not be obtained,the partnership agreement promised a refund of capital to the investor,net of expenses.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,the partnership agreement stated that the funds would invest only in completed projects,thereby eliminating a significant area of risk to the investors.id.t he funds reported the money paid to operating partnerships in exchange for tax credits as partnership expenses and reported the investors contributions to the funds as nontaxable contributions to capital.id.at.
the irs challenged the funds characterization of investors funding as contributions to capital because the irs believed that the investors were,in substance,purchasers of state income tax credits,and thus the money that the funds received from the investors should have been reported as taxable income.id.at trial,the commissioner supported his position with two theories.first,he relied on the doctrine,saying that the investors were not bona fide partners in the funds but were instead purchasers and,second,he said that the transactions between the investors and the partnerships were disguised sales under id.at.the tax court rejected both of those assertions,and found that the investors were partners in the funds for federal tax purposes.id.at.
the fourth circuit reversed the tax court.assuming,without deciding,that a bona fide partnership existed,the virginia historic court found that the commissioner properly characterized the transactions at issue as sales under the rules.id.at.the fourth circuit first turned to the regulations that provide guidance in determining whether a disguised sale has occurred.see id.at citing to,inter alia,reg,a.specifically,it explained that a transaction should be reclassified as a sale if,based on all the facts and circumstances,a partner would not have transferred money to the partnership but for the transfer of property the receipt of tax credits to the partner and the latter transfer the receipt of tax credits is not dependent on the entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations.id.at quoting reg.b.the fourth circuit concluded that the risks cited by the tax court such as the risk that developers would not complete their projects on time because of construction,zoning,or management issues,risk of liability for improper construction,and risk of mismanagement or fraud at the developer partnership level appear ed both speculative and circumscribed.id.while the fourth circuit acknowledged that there was no guarantee that resources would remain available in the source partnership to make the promised refunds,it determined that the funds were structured in such a way as to render the possibility of insolvency remote.id.
in holding that there was no true entrepreneurial risk faced by investors in the transactions at issue,the virginia historic court pointed to several different factors 
first,investors were promised what was,in essence,a fixed rate of return on investment rather than any share in partnership profits tied to their partnership interests second,the funds assigned each investor an approximate partnership interest and explicitly told investors to expect no allocations of material amounts of partnership items of income,gain,loss or deduction.third,investors were secured against losing their contributions by the promise of a refund from the funds if tax credits could not be delivered or were revoked.
and fourth,the funds hedged against the possibility of insolvency by promising investors that contributions would be made only to completed projects and by requiring the operating partnerships to promise refunds,in some cases backed by guarantors,if promised credits could not be delivered.
id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in sum,the fourth circuit deemed persuasive the commissioner contention that the only risk was that faced by any advance purchaser who pays for an item with a promise of later delivery.it was not the risk of the entrepreneur who puts money into a venture with the hope that it might grow in amount but with the knowledge that it may well shrink.id.at citing tower,at.staff of comm.on tax n,general explanation of the revenue provisions of the deficit reduction act of,at to the extent that a partner profit from a transaction is assured without regard to the success or failure of the joint undertaking,there is not the requisite joint profit motive.alteration in original.accordingly,it agreed with the commissioner that the funds should have reported the money received from the investors as taxable income.id.at.
the fourth circuit concluded its opinion with an important note regarding its awareness of the legislative policy of providing tax credits to spur private investment in historic rehabilitation projects 
we reach this conclusion mindful of the fact that it is the policy of the federal government to assist state and local governments to expand and accelerate their historic preservation programs and activities.and we find no fault in the tax court conclusion that both the funds and the funds investors engaged in the challenged transactions with the partial goal of aiding virginia historic rehabilitation efforts.but virginia historic rehabilitation program is not under attack here.
application of the guideposts to hbh 
the commissioner asserts that castle harbour and virginia historic provide a highly pertinent frame of reference for analyzing the instant case.appellant opening br.at.according to the commissioner,m any of the same factors upon which the castle harbour court relied in finding that the purported bank partners were,in substance,lenders to the ge entity also support the conclusion that pb was,in substance,not a partner in hbh but,instead,was a purchaser of tax credits from hbh.id.that is so,says the commissioner,because,as confirmed by the virginia historic court reliance on the entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations,reg.b,the distinction between an equity contribution to a partnership and a transfer of funds to a partnership as payment of the sales price of partnership property,tax credits,is the same as the principal distinction between equity and debt appellant opening br.at.the key point is that the recovery of an equity investment in a partnership is dependent on the entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations,whereas recovery of a loan to a partnership or receipt of an asset purchased from a partnership is not.id.at.in other words,an equity investor in a partnership,a bona fide partner has a meaningful stake in the success or failure of the enterprise,whereas a lender to,or purchaser from,the partnership does not.id.in sum,the commissioner argues that,just as the banks in castle harbour had no meaningful stake in their respective partnerships,and the investors in virginia historic were more like purchasers than participants in a business venture,it is clear from the record in this case that pb had no meaningful stake in the success or failure of hbh.id.
in response,hbh asserts that t here are a plethora of errors in the irs tortured effort to apply castle harbour and virginia historic to the facts of the present case.appellee br.at.first,hbh argues that it is abundantly apparent that castle harbour is completely inapposite to it because the actual provisions in castle harbour partnership agreement that minimized the banks downside risk and upside potential were more limiting than the provisions in the area.appellee br.at.hbh contends that,unlike the partnership agreement in castle harbour,pb has no rights under the area to compel hbh to repay all or any part of its capital contribution,pb preferred return was not guaranteed,and njsea has no right to divest pb of its interest in any income or gains from the east hall.id.
as to virginia historic,hbh argues that it has no application whatsoever here.id.at.it reasons that the decision in that case assumed that valid partnerships existed as a necessary condition to applying b disguised sale rules id.at,and that the case was analyzed solely under the disguised sale regime which is not at issue in the fpaa sent to hbh id.at.
overall,hbh characterizes castle harbour and virginia historic as pure misdirections which lead to an analytical dead end id.at,and emphasizes that t he question culbertson asks is simply whether the parties intended to conduct a business together and share in the profits and losses therefrom id.at.we have no quarrel with how hbh frames the culbertson inquiry.but what hbh fails to recognize is that resolving whether a purported partner had a meaningful stake in the success or failure of the partnership,castle harbour,at,goes to the core of the ultimate determination of whether the parties intended to join together in the present conduct of the enterprise,id.at quoting culbertson,at.castle harbour analysis that concluded that the banks indicia of an equity participation in a partnership was only illusory or insignificant,id.at,and virginia historic determination that the limited partner investors did not face the entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted,are both highly relevant to the question of whether hbh was a partnership in which pb had a true interest in profit and loss and the answer to that question turns on an assessment of risk participation.we are persuaded by the commissioner argument that pb,like the purported bank partners in castle harbour,did not have any meaningful downside risk or any meaningful upside potential in hbh.
lack of meaningful downside risk 
pb had no meaningful downside risk because it was,for all intents and purposes,certain to recoup the contributions it had made to hbh and to receive the primary benefit it sought the hrtcs or their cash equivalent.first,any risk that pb would not receive hrtcs in an amount that was at least equivalent to installments it had made,the investment risk was.that is so because,under the area,pb was not required to make an installment contribution to hbh until njsea had verified that it had achieved a certain level of progress with the east hall renovation that would generate enough cumulative hrtcs to at least equal the sum of the installment which was then to be contributed and all prior capital contributions that had been made by pb.see at,first installment of due at closing was paid when njsea had already incurred over million of qres which would generate over million in hrtcs id.at second installment,projected to be,was not due until,among other events,a projection of the hrtcs for which were estimated at closing to be based on a determination of the actual rehabilitation costs of hbh that qualify for tax credits in id.at third installment,projected to be,was not due until the later of,among other events,evidence of substantial completion of phase and a projection of the hrtcs for which were estimated at closing to be based on a determination of the actual rehabilitation costs of hbh that qualify for tax credits in id.fourth installment,projected to be,was not due until,among other events,pb received a k for evidencing the actual tax credits for,a tax document that would not have been available until after the estimated completion date of the entire project.while pb did not have the contractual right to compel hbh to repay all or any part of its capital contribution appellee br.at,pb had an even more secure deal.even before pb made an installment contribution,it knew it would receive at least that amount in return.
second,once an installment contribution had been made,the tax benefits guaranty eliminated any risk that,due to a successful irs challenge in disallowing any hrtcs,pb would not receive at least the cash equivalent of the tax credits,the audit risk.the tax benefits guaranty obligated to pay pb not only the amount of tax credit disallowed,but also any penalties and interest,as well as up to in legal and administrative expenses incurred in connection with such a challenge,and the amount necessary to pay any tax due on those reimbursements.virginia historic,at noting the fact that investors were secured against losing their contributions by the promise of a refund from the funds if tax credits could not be delivered or were revoked point ed to the conclusion that there was no true entrepreneurial risk faced by investors.
third,any risk that pb would not receive all of its tax credits or cash equivalent through the tax benefits guaranty due to a failure of any part of the rehabilitation to be successfully completed,the project risk was also effectively eliminated because the project was already fully funded before pb entered into any agreement to provide contributions to hbh.see at statement in the confidential memorandum that t he rehabilitation is being funded entirely by njsea id.at notes from a njsea executive committee meeting in march indicating that t he bulk of the investor equity is generally contributed to the company after the project is placed into service and the tax credit is earned,the balance when stabilization is achieved id.at notes to njsea annual report stating that the casino reinvestment development authority had agreed to reimburse njsea for all costs in excess of bond proceeds for the project.that funding,moreover,included coverage for any excess development costs in other words,pb contributions were not at all necessary for the east hall project to be completed.virginia historic,at noting that the fact that the funds hedged against the possibility of insolvency by promising investors that contributions would be made only to completed projects point ed to the conclusion that there was not true entrepreneurial risk faced by investors.furthermore,hbh own accountants came to the conclusion that the source of the project funds njsea backed by the casino reinvestment development authority was more than capable of covering any excess development costs incurred by the project,as well as any operating deficits of hbh,and njsea had promised that coverage through the completion guaranty and the operating deficit guaranty,respectively,in the area.see at memo to audit file noting that,because njsea has the ability to fund the operating deficits as a result of the luxury and other taxes provided by the hospitality and entertainment industry in the state,and there is no ceiling on the amount of funds to be provided by njsea to hbh,no triggering event had occurred which require d a write down under fasb.virginia historic,at noting that although i t was true there was no guarantee that resources would remain available in the source partnership to make the promised refunds it was also true that the funds were structured in such a way as to render the possibility of insolvency remote.thus,although the tax court determined that pb faced the risk that the rehabilitation would not be completed at,the record belies that conclusion.because njsea had deep pockets,and,as succinctly stated by reznick,there was no ceiling on the amount of funds to be provided by njsea to hbh id.at,pb was not subject to any legally significant risk that the renovations would falter 
in short,pb bore no meaningful risk in joining hbh,as it would have had it acquired a bona fide partnership interest.see asa investerings comm r,noting that the tax court did not err by carving out an exception for de minimis risks when assessing whether the parties assumed risk for the purpose of determining whether a partnership was valid for tax purposes,and determining that the decision not to consider de minimis risk was consistent with the supreme court view that a transaction will be disregarded if it did not appreciably affect taxpayer beneficial interest except to reduce his tax alteration in original quoting knetsch united states,d 
pb effective elimination of investment risk,audit risk,and project risk is evidenced by the agreement of the parties.culbertson,at.pb and njsea,in substance,did not join together in hbh stated business purpose to rehabilitate and operate the east hall.rather,the parties focus from the very beginning was to effect a sale and purchase of hrtcs.see at sovereign consulting proposal for the sale of historic rehabilitation tax credits expected to be generated by the east hall renovation id.at confidential memorandum entitled the sale of historic tax credits generated by the renovation of the historic atlantic city boardwalk convention hall id.at cover letter from sovereign to njsea providing njsea with four original investment offers from institutions that have responded to the confidential memorandum regarding the purchase of the historic tax credits expected to be generated by the east hall renovation.
that conclusion is not undermined by pb receipt of a secondary benefit the preferred return on its contributions to hbh.although,in form,pb was not guaranteed that return on an annual basis if hbh did not generate sufficient cash flow appellee br.at,in substance,pb had the ability to ensure that it would eventually receive it.if pb exercised its put option or njsea exercised its call option,the purchase price to be paid by njsea was effectively measured by pb accrued and unpaid preferred return.see infra note and accompanying text.and to guarantee that there would be sufficient cash to cover that purchase price,njsea was required to purchase the guaranteed investment contract in the event that njsea exercised its call option virginia historic,at noting the fact that investors were promised what was,in essence,a fixed rate of return on investment rather than any share in partnership profits tied to their partnership interests point ed to the conclusion that there was not true entrepreneurial risk faced by investors.thus,the tax court finding that pb might not receive its preferred return at all unless njsea exercised its call option at,was clearly erroneous because it ignored the reality that pb could assure its return by unilaterally exercising its put option 
hbh,of course,attacks the commissioner assertion that pb lacked downside risk,claiming that the irs theory that a valid partnership can not exist unless an shares in all of the risks and costs of the partnership has no basis in partnership or tax law,and is contrary to the standard economic terms of innumerable real estate investment partnerships in the united states for every type of real estate project.appellee br.at.hbh also asserts that many of the negotiated provisions such as the completion guaranty,operating deficit guaranty,and the preferred return are typical in a real estate investment partnership.id.at.the commissioner has not claimed,however,and we do not suggest,that a limited partner is prohibited from capping its risk at the amount it invests in a partnership.such a cap,in and of itself,would not jeopardize its partner status for tax purposes.we also recognize that a limited partner status as a bona fide equity participant will not be stripped away merely because it has successfully negotiated measures that minimize its risk of losing a portion of its investment in an enterprise.here,however,the parties agreed to shield pb investment from any meaningful risk.pb was assured of receiving the value of the hrtcs and its preferred return regardless of the success or failure of the rehabilitation of the east hall and hbh subsequent operations.and that lack of meaningful risk weighs heavily in determining whether pb is a bona fide partner in hbh.virginia historic,at explaining that entrepreneurial risks of partnership operations involves placing money into a venture with the hope that it might grow in amount but with the knowledge that it may well shrink castle harbour,at noting that congress appears to have intended that the significant factor in differentiating between debt and equity be whether the funds were advanced with reasonable expectations of repayment regardless of the success of the venture or were placed at the risk of the business quoting gilbert comm r,cir.
lack of meaningful upside potential 
pb avoidance of all meaningful downside risk in hbh was accompanied by a dearth of any meaningful upside potential.whether a putative partner is free to,and does,enjoy the fruits of the partnership is strongly indicative of the reality of his participation in the enterprise.culbertson,at.pb,in substance,was not free to enjoy the fruits of hbh.like the foreign banks illusory interest in castle harbour,pb interest in hbh residual cash flow gave a false impression that it had a chance to share in potential profits of hbh.in reality,pb would only benefit from its interest in residual cash flow after payments to it on its investor loan and preferred return and the following payments to njsea annual installment payment on the acquisition loan annual payment for years plus arrears annual installment payment on the construction loan and payment in full of the operating deficit loan in excess of million as of.even hbh own rosy financial projections from to,which at least through had proven fantastically inaccurate,forecasted no residual cash flow available for distribution.thus,although in form pb had the potential to receive the fair market value of its interest assuming such value was greater than its accrued but unpaid preferred return if either njsea exercised its call option or pb exercised its put option,in reality,pb could never expect to share in any upside castle harbour,at the realistic possibility of upside potential not the absence of formal caps is what governs the bona fide equity participation analysis.even if there were an upside,however,njsea could exercise its consent option,and cut pb out by paying a purchase price unrelated to any fair market value see supra section.a.in sum,the structure of the transaction ensured that pb would never receive any economic benefits from hbh.southgate master fund,at.and i n light of culbertson s identification of the actual control of income and the purposes for which it was used as a metric of a partnership legitimacy,the terms of the area and the structure of the various options constitute compelling evidence that pb was not a bona fide partner in hbh.id.at quoting culbertson,at.
hbh reliance on form over substance 
after attempting to downplay pb lack of any meaningful stake in the success or failure of the enterprise,hbh presses us to consider certain evidence that it believes overwhelmingly proves that pb is a partner in hbh under the culbertson test.appellee br.at.that overwhelming evidence includes that hbh was duly organized as an llc under new jersey law and,as the area provides,was formed to acquire,develop,finance,rehabilitate,maintain,operate,license,and sell or otherwise to dispose of the east hall id.at see at pb net economic benefit from the hrtcs and the preferred return appellee br.at pb representatives vigorous negotiat ion of the terms of the area id.at the nature and thoroughness of pb comprehensive due diligence investigation in connection with its investment in hbh id.at pb substantial financial investment in hbh id.various business agreements that had been entered into between njsea and certain third parties that were all assigned to,and assumed by,hbh id.at bank and payroll accounts that were opened in hbh name and insurance agreements that were amended to identify hbh as an owner and include pb as an additional insured and the fact that,following closing,njsea kept in constant communication with pb regarding the renovations to the east hall,and the business operations of the hall id.
much of that evidence may give an outward appearance of an arrangement to engage in a common enterprise.culbertson,at.frankfurter,concurring.but the sharp eyes of the law require more from parties than just putting on the habiliments of a partnership whenever it advantages them to be treated as partners underneath.id.indeed,culbertson requires that a partner really and truly intend to shar e in the profits and losses of the enterprise,id.at.majority opinion emphasis added citation and internal quotation marks omitted,or,in other words,have a meaningful stake in the success or failure of the enterprise,castle harbour,at.looking past the outward appearance,hbh cited evidence does not demonstrate such a meaningful stake.
first,the recitation of partnership formalities that hbh was duly organized,that it had a stated purpose under the area,that it opened bank and payroll accounts,and that it assumed various obligation misses the point.we are prepared to accept for purposes of argument that there was economic substance to hbh.the question is whether pb had a meaningful stake in that enterprise.see castle harbour,at the irs challenge to the taxpayer characterization is not foreclosed merely because the taxpayer can point to the existence of some business purpose or objective reality in addition to its objective.southgate master fund,at the fact that a partnership underlying business activities had economic substance does not,standing alone,immunize the partnership from judicial scrutiny under culbertson.the parties selection of the partnership form must have been driven by a genuine business purpose.internal footnote omitted.to answer that,we must look beyond the superficial formalities of a transaction to determine the proper tax treatment.edwards your credit,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
second,evidence that pb received a net economic benefit from hbh and made a substantial financial investment in hbh can only support a finding that pb is a bona fide partner if there was a meaningful intent to share in the profits and the losses of that investment.the structure of pb investment,however,shows clearly that there was no such intent.recovery of each of the contributions that made up the substantial financial investment was assured by the provisions of the area and the tax benefits guaranty.and,as the commissioner rightly notes,pb net economic benefit from the transaction in the form of the hrtcs or the cash equivalent via the tax benefits guaranty and the effectively guaranteed preferred return merely demonstrates pb intent to make an economically rational use of its money on an basis.appellant reply br.at.indeed,both parties in a transaction such as this one will always think they are going to receive a net economic benefit otherwise,the transaction would never occur.if in fact that was the test,there would be a for every transaction that calls itself a partnership.
third,the fact that njsea kept in constant communication regarding the east hall is hardly surprising.as discussed earlier,supra section,each installment contribution from pb was contingent upon njsea verifying that a certain amount of work had been completed on the east hall so that pb was assured it would not be contributing more money than it would be guaranteed to receive in hrtcs or their cash equivalent.the mere fact that a party receives regular updates on a project does not transform it into a bona fide partner for tax purposes.
fourth,looking past the form of the transaction to its substance,neither pb vigorous negotiat ion nor its comprehensive due diligence investigation is,in this context,indicative of an intent to be a bona fide partner in hbh.we do not doubt that pb spent a significant amount of time conducting a thorough investigation and negotiating favorable terms.and we acknowledge that one of the factors cited by culbertson is the conduct of the parties in execution of its provisions.at.but the record reflects that those efforts were made so that pb would not be subject to any real risks that would stand in the way of its receiving the value of the hrtcs not,as hbh asserts,to form a true business relationship.appellee br.at.we do not believe that courts are compelled to respect a taxpayer characterization of a transaction for tax purposes based on how the transaction becomes.recruiting teams of lawyers,accountants,and tax consultants does not mean that a partnership,with all its tax credit gold,can be conjured from a investment of the sort pb made here.
in the end,the evidence hbh cites focuses only on form,not substance.from the moment sovereign approached njsea,the substance of any transaction with a corporate investor was calculated to be a sale of historic rehabilitation tax credits.at.castle harbour,at finding that the banks interest was more in the nature of window dressing designed to give ostensible support to the characterization of equity participation than a meaningful stake in the profits of the venture.and in the end,that is what the substance turned out to be.
like the virginia historic court,we reach our conclusion mindful of congress goal of encouraging rehabilitation of historic buildings.see at.we have not ignored the predictions of hbh and amici that,if we reallocate the hrtcs away from pb,we may jeopardize the viability of future historic rehabilitation projects.those forecasts,however,distort the real dispute.the hrtc statute is not under attack here.id.it is the prohibited sale of tax credits,not the tax credit provision itself,that the irs has challenged.where the line lies between a defensible distribution of risk and reward in a partnership on the one hand and a violation of the tax laws on the other is not for us to say in the abstract.but,w here,as here,we confront taxpayers who have taken a circuitous route to reach an end more easily accessible by a straightforward path,we look to the substance over form.southgate master fund,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.and,after looking to the substance of the interests at play in this case,we conclude that,because pb lacked a meaningful stake in either the success or failure of hbh,it was not a bona fide partner.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will reverse the tax court january,decision,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
an llc offers the best of both worlds the limited liability of a corporation and the favorable tax treatment of a partnership.canterbury holdings,llc comm r,cch.generally,an llc is a entity that does not pay federal income tax.see reg.a.rather,profits and losses pass through the llc to its owners,called members,who pay individual income tax on their allocable shares of the tax items.see.although an llc with just one owner is,for tax purposes,disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for tax purposes,an llc with two or more members is classified as a partnership for tax purposes unless it elects to be treated as a corporation.reg.b.once hbh,as a duly formed new jersey limited liability company,had two members,it did not elect to be treated as a corporation and thus was classified as a partnership for tax purposes for the tax years in which it had more than one member.thus,as the parties do,we refer to hbh as a partnership when analyzing whether one of its stated members was a bona fide partner.
pb membership interest in hbh was through pb historic renovations,llc,whose sole member was pitney bowes credit.at all relevant times,pitney bowes credit was a subsidiary of pb.for ease of reference,we will refer to pb historic renovations,llc,pitney bowes credit,and pb as pb.
the of acronyms in this case is perhaps beyond parody,but the acronyms are a more efficient means of referring to various corporate and state entities,as well as the tax credits and other concepts,so we reluctantly fall into the soup.

specifically,the codification of the economic substance doctrine provides in the case of any transaction to which the economic substance doctrine is relevant,such transaction shall be treated as having economic substance only if a the transaction changes in a meaningful way apart from federal income tax effects the taxpayer economic position,and b the taxpayer has a substantial purpose apart from federal income tax effects for entering into such.o.section o applies to all transactions entered into after march.thus,the version of the economic substance doctrine,and not o,applies to the transaction at issue here.

the proceeds from that bond issuance by njsea,described as the luxury tax bonds,were not directly applied to the east hall renovation.rather,the luxury tax bonds were issued to effect the refunding of certain amounts from an earlier bond issuance.
sovereign describes itself as a boutique consulting firm that facilitates equity financing and offers financial advisory services for historic rehabilitation tax credit transactions.at.
because it was projected that the east hall renovation would be completed in late,fiscal year was anticipated to be the east hall first full year of operations.
a going concern is a commercial enterprise actively engag ed in business with the expectation of indefinite continuance.black law dictionary ed.evidently and understandably,sovereign viewed year after year of large losses from the operations of the east hall as inconsistent with an ordinary expectation of indefinite continuance.
although we use the term capital contributions because that was the term used by the parties in this context,we do not attribute any dispositive legal significance to it as used herein.
reznick apparently used the terms eligible and construction expenditures to differentiate between costs that were qres and those that were not.
the loi provided that pb contribution would be adjusted upward by per additional of historic tax credit in the event that the qres for the project after support ed historic tax credits in excess of the projected historic tax credits.at.
although it is unclear from the record exactly when phase of the rehabilitation project was completed,the march confidential memorandum estimated that phase,which began in october,would be completed by august.that same memo stated that njsea anticipated that the entire renovation would be completed by december,and,in fact,the east hall reopened in october.thus,it is likely that phase of the renovation was entirely completed by the time njsea and pb executed the various documents effecting pb investment in hbh.
the area defined the term excess development costs as all expenditures in excess of the proceeds of the acquisition and construction loans and the capital contributions of the members which are required to complete rehabilitation of the east hall,including,but not limited to,any interest,taxes,and property insurance premiums not payable from proceeds of the loans or capital contributions,and any construction cost overruns and the cost of any change orders which are not funded from proceeds of the loans or capital contributions of the members.at.
the term hazardous materials under the area included,among other things,any hazardous substance,pollutant or contaminant as defined in any applicable federal statute,law,rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect or any amendment thereto or any replacement thereof or in any statute or regulation relating to the environment now or hereafter in effect,and any hazardous substance,hazardous waste,residual waste or solid waste,as those terms are now or hereafter defined in any applicable state or local law,rule or regulation or in any statute or regulation relating to the environment now or hereafter in effect.at.
those rights and obligations are distinct from the put and call options set forth in separate agreements which were executed the same day and which are discussed infra in section.
in this context,the term tax credit recapture is apparently used to convey the concept that a taxpayer is required to repay to the irs a portion of a tax credit it had previously claimed with respect to a property interest because that property interest did not continue to qualify for the tax credit for the requisite period of time.specifically,if the east hall were disposed of or otherwise cease d to be an hrtc property with respect to hbh within five years after the east hall was placed into service,any hrtcs allocated to pb through its membership interest in hbh would be recaptured by,in effect,increasing pb tax through its membership interest in hbh by the amount of the total hrtcs taken multiplied by a recapture percentage,which varies based on the holding period of the property.see a.the amount of hrtcs subject to recapture would decrease by for each of the first five years after the east hall was placed in service.see id.a b.
at the time that the irs challenged this series of transactions,neither the consent option nor the material default option had been exercised.
a guaranteed investment contract is a n investment contract under which an institutional investor here,njsea invests a lump sum with an insurer that promises to return the principal the lump sum and a certain amount of interest at the contract end.black law dictionary ed.
that option,known as the call option,was one of two vehicles the other being the consent option that was available to njsea if it wanted to buy out pb interest in hbh.pb had a corresponding put option which gave it the right to compel njsea to buy out pb interest.as noted earlier,supra note,the put and call options are discussed infra in section.
it appears that the leasehold interest was extended so that its term was longer than the depreciable basis of the improvements to be made on the east hall for tax purposes.that extension was in accord with hoffman ultimate plan for njsea to transfer ownership of the east hall for tax purposes to the newly created partnership,a plan he laid out in sovereign consulting proposal to njsea albeit the actual lease extension was longer than that suggested in that proposal.see at since the useful life of commercial improvements is years,the tax industry consensus is that the should be for a period of years.extending the lease term beyond the useful life of the improvements was necessary so that when njsea entered into a sublease with hbh in connection with the east hall,hbh,as hoffman put it,could be recognized as the owner for tax purposes id,and thus would be eligible to incur qres that,in turn,would generate hrtcs.see c b vi the term qre does not include any expenditure of a lessee of a building if,on the date the rehabilitation is completed,the remaining term of the lease determined without regard to any renewal periods is less than the recovery period determined under c.
the final projections prepared during the week prior to closing contemplated of remaining construction costs.during that week,sovereign sent a memo to pb identifying an additional million of p otential additional expenditure s that included environmental remediation costs million,tenant improvements million,and an additional rehabilitation contingency million.at.if those expenditures were treated as qres,the memo indicated that the transaction would generate an additional million in hrtcs.
the month period was likely imposed so that,if njsea did exercise the call option,any of the hrtcs that pb had previously been allocated through its membership interest in hbh would not be subject to recapture.see supra note.
neither of those options were exercised prior to the irs challenge.
pursuant to the tax benefits guaranty,a tax benefits reduction event means as of any final determination for any taxable year the amount by which the actual tax benefits for such year are less than the projected tax benefits.at.a final determination was defined as the earliest to occur of certain related events which,with respect to either hbh or pb,result in loss of projected tax benefits.id.at.
the revised economic projections refer to the revised projections made by reznick that reflect the actual tax credits and federal income tax losses at the time of payment of the second,third and fourth installments.id.at.
as noted,supra section.a,the area required that njsea purchase the guaranteed investment contract in the amount required to secure the purchase price to be paid by njsea if it exercised its call option.however,pursuant to a pledge and escrow agreement entered into by njsea,pb,and an escrow agent in january,njsea also pledged its interest in the guaranteed investment contract as security for its potential purchase obligation in the event that pb exercised its put option,subject to njsea right to apply the proceeds of that contract toward payment of the purchase price if it exercised its call option or consent option,or if pb exercised its material default option.
we use the terms net operating income or net operating loss to mean the net income or loss before interest and depreciation expenses.
hbh statement of operations for covered the period june,date of inception through december.
hbh accountants did not make financial projections for operating revenues and expenses prior to.
it was possible for hbh to claim qres that were incurred prior to its purported acquisition of the east hall.see reg.c ii where qres are incurred with respect to a building by a persons or persons other than the taxpayer njsea and the taxpayer hbh subsequently acquires the building,the taxpayer acquiring the property shall be treated as having incurred the qres actually incurred by the transferor,provided that t he building acquired by the taxpayer was not placed in service after the qres were incurred and prior to the date of acquisition,and n o credit with respect to such qres is claimed by anyone other than the taxpayer acquiring the property.additionally,even if total construction costs were only approximately million as projected,it would also have been possible to generate over million in qres.see id.c noting that qres could include,among other things,development fees,legal expenses,and certain c onstruction period interest expenses.in any event,as discussed infra,the irs has not challenged the amount of the qres reported by hbh,but rather the allocation of any hbh partnership items to pb.
as contemplated by the loi,see supra note,the area provided that if the or tax credits which hbh will be entitled to claim with respect to such rehabilitation are greater than the projected tax credits the aggregate amount of pb capital contribution shall be increased by for each by which the tax credits exceed the projected tax credits.at.it is unclear from the record why a portion of the required increase in capital contributions was instead applied to increase the investor loan.
the million figure is at odds with the statement in the confidential memorandum that the renovation project would cost million.the difference approximates the sum eventually invested by pb.see supra section.
the record does not contain audited financial statements for hbh beyond.
after paying that portion of the fourth installment,pb had made of its required capital contribution.the notes to hbh audited financial statements indicate that the balance,plus interest,was still due,and was being reserved pending the outcome of litigation with the irs.the tax court also said that a portion of pb fourth capital contribution is currently being held in escrow.at.
fasb is an acronym for the financial accounting standards board,an organization that establishes standards which are officially recognized as authoritative by the sec for financial accounting and which govern the preparation of financial reports by nongovernmental entities.the number refers to the number assigned to the particular standard at issue here.
the record does not contain reznick audit files for hbh beyond.
as detailed earlier,supra note,since hbh was a duly formed new jersey limited liability company,had two members by the end of its tax year,and did not elect to be treated as a corporation,it was classified as a partnership for tax purposes for the tax years at issue here.see reg.b.partnerships do not pay federal income taxes,but rather are required to file a form,which is an annual information return of the partnership.a form also generates a schedule k for each partner,which reports a partner distributive share of tax items.the individual partners then report their allocable shares of the tax items on their own federal income tax returns.see.
hbh form stated that it began business on june.
while pb was also allocated of the ordinary taxable loss for both and,it appears it was only allocated approximately of the ordinary taxable loss for.although it is unclear from the record,pb could have only been allocated of the loss from the time it joined as a member in hbh in september,although,as noted above,it was allocated of the qres for hbh entire taxable year in.
the fpaa provided two additional grounds for reallocating partnership items from pb to njsea.it determined that no sale of the east hall occurred between njsea and hbh for federal income tax purposes because the burdens and benefits of ownership of the east hall interest did not pass from njsea,as the seller,to hbh,as the purchaser.although the irs has appealed the tax court rejection of that argument,see infra note,we will not address that contention in view of our ultimate disposition.the fpaa also determined that hbh should be disregarded for federal income tax purposes under the provisions of reg.b.the tax court also rejected that determination,and the irs has not appealed that aspect of the decision.
a partnership such as hbh designates a tax matters partner to handle tax questions on behalf of the partnership,and that partner is empowered to settle tax disputes on behalf of the partnership.mathia comm r,cir.
upon receiving an fpaa,a partnership,via its tax matters partner,may file a petition in the tax court once an fpaa is sent,the irs can not make any assessments attributable to relevant partnership items during the time the partnership seeks review mathia,at.once that petition is filed,a administrative proceeding is commenced,governed by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of.under that act,all partnership items are determined in a proceeding at the partnership level,which is binding on the partners and may not be challenged in a subsequent proceeding.see c,h.this streamlined process remove s the substantial administrative burden occasioned by duplicative audits and litigation and provide s consistent treatment of partnership tax items among partners in the same partnership.at.
rejecting a third alternative ground brought by the irs,see supra note,the tax court determined that njsea had transferred the benefits and burdens of its interest in the east hall to render hbh the owner of the east hall for tax purposes,see supra note.to support that conclusion,the court observed that t he parties treated the transaction as a sale possession of the east hall vested in hbh hbh reported the east hall profits and stood to lose its income if the east hall stopped operating as an event space and b ank accounts were opened in hbh name by spectacor as operator of the east hall.at.because of our ultimate resolution,we will not specifically address the tax court analysis of that contention.

the current commissioner of internal revenue is douglas shulman.
the commissioner also contends that hbh was a sham.specifically,the commissioner invokes a theory,which he says is a variant of the doctrine.appellant opening br.at.that theory,according to the commissioner focus es on whether the formation of the partnership made sense from an economic standpoint,as would be the case under the culbertson inquiry,and whether there was otherwise a legitimate business purpose for the use of the partnership form.id.hbh contends that the irs theory,which hbh asserts is merely a rehash of the factual claims that the irs made in challenging pb status as a partner in hbh,is distinct from the doctrine also known as the economic substance doctrine that was litigated before the tax court.amicus real estate roundtable the roundtable agrees,submitting that the commissioner argument inappropriately blur s the line between the economic substance doctrine and the doctrine,the latter of which applies when the form of a transaction is not the same as its economic reality.roundtable br.at.the point is,as the economic substance doctrine and the doctrine certainly are distinct.neonatology,comm r,cir see generally rogers united states,cir noting differences between the doctrine and the economic substance doctrine.the doctrine is applicable to instances where the substance of a particular transaction produces tax results inconsistent with the form embodied in the underlying documentation,permitting a court to recharacterize the transaction in accordance with its substance.neonatology,at.on the other hand,the economic substance doctrine applies where the economic or business purpose of a transaction is relatively insignificant in relation to the comparatively large tax benefits that accrue.the roundtable correctly explains,t he fact that a taxpayer might not be viewed as a partner under the doctrine or that the transaction should be characterized as a sale again,under the doctrine does not mean that the underlying transaction violated the economic substance doctrine.roundtable br.at.put another way,even if a transaction has economic substance,the tax treatment of those engaged in the transaction is still subject to a inquiry to determine whether a party was a bona fide partner in the business engaged in the transaction.see southgate master fund,ex rel.montgomery capital advisors,llc united states,cir the fact that a partnership underlying business activities had economic substance does not,standing alone,immunize the partnership from judicial scrutiny under culbertson.id.if there was not a legitimate,reason to operate as a partnership,then the partnership will be disregarded for tax purposes even if it engaged in transactions that had economic substance.at oral argument,the irs conceded that this case lends itself more cleanly to the bona fide partner theory,under which we look to the substance of the putative partner interest over its form.oral argument at,historic boardwalk hall,llc comm r,available at.accordingly,we focus our analysis on whether pb is as a bona fide partner in hbh,and in doing so,we assume,without deciding,that this transaction had economic substance.specifically,we do not opine on the parties dispute as to whether,under sacks commissioner,cir,we can consider the hrtcs in evaluating whether a transaction has economic substance.
