petitioner john mekulsia seeks interest abatement for payment deficiencies from tax years through.he appealed denials by the commissioner and the irs appeals office to the tax court,which affirmed.mekulsia now appeals to this court.the primary question before us is whether or not the tax code and regulations create a obligation on the irs to notify,and thereby remove from a partnership audit,a tax matters partner who is under criminal investigation.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the tax court holding that no such ministerial task exists.
statement of facts 
starting in,petitioner mekulsia began investing as a limited partner in cattle partnerships created,marketed and managed by jay hoyt.mekulsia investment relationship with hoyt continued through.unfortunately for mekulsia and thousands of other investors,hoyt partnerships were found to be illegal tax shelters.hoyt is currently serving a federal prison sentence of months for conspiracy to commit fraud,bankruptcy fraud,and money laundering.while the scheme was active,hoyt served as the general partner and the tax matters partner for all the partnerships,even completing the individual tax returns for many.investors paid money in exchange for units in a certain partnership.hoyt would then manipulate the value,purchase,sale and even existence of cattle assets in order to generate phony depreciation and losses for the partners.losses were allocated among the limited partners in amounts necessary to zero out their incomes for tax return purposes.there is conflicting evidence and testimony regarding the degree of complicity of the individual investors.some reports state that hoyt agents told the investors their payments would be a percentage of the amount they saved on their tax returns,indicating they knew from the beginning that these were partnerships.however,the judge in hoyt criminal case made a plea to the irs to show leniency for the hoyt victims,stating,
the victims in this case were not people that got into this as a matter of personal greed.they were truly victimized by a person who is capable of the greatest deceit,deceitful practices,who deceived everyone around him,including those closest to him it is my strongest recommendation that those remaining cases that remain open be resolved by denying the tax shelter,but to eliminate any penalties,or any interest that may have accumulated.
at as read into the record during mekulsia case before the tax court.
in the long government process that eventually led to his conviction in,hoyt was under criminal investigation at least four separate times.however,during none of these periods did the commissioner act in any way to remove him as the tax matters partner for the partnership involved in mekulsia case.
as the irs became aware of the irregularities in hoyt business practices,it conducted several audits of the partnerships returns.between and,the irs notified mekulsia that it was disallowing his partnership losses from tax years and and sent notices of final partnership administrative adjustment to that effect.the losses allocated to mekulsia in and had been carried back to,and and forward to.since all these losses were derived from and,all were disallowed.
between and,many of the hoyt partnerships including mekulsia filed tax court petitions,contesting the commissioner determinations.while the partnerships and the irs came close to negotiating a settlement in for all outstanding hoyt partnership petitions relating to tax years to,the agreement ultimately collapsed in.the court consolidated similar cases and began moving forward to conduct trials.
in,the irs sent mekulsia a form,income tax examination changes for years through,based on his involvement in the partnership in and.this form detailed the irs position with respect to tax payment deficiencies and interest accrual.interest accrual terminated on march,when mekulsia posted a cash bond in the amount of.
in june,mekulsia initiated correspondence with the irs that was interpreted as a request for interest abatement.finding that mekulsia investments were actually tax motivated transactions,under c,the irs denied mekulsia request.in july,mekulsia appealed to the irs appeals office,which also issued a denial.on august,the irs issued a final determination letter,its denial of interest abatement.mekulsia then appealed to the tax court under h,which grants the tax court initial appellate review over the commissioner refusal to abate interest.the tax court upheld the commissioner decision.
during the proceedings before the tax court,mekulsia complained about the commissioner alleged failure to produce documents requested through both informal and formal discovery procedures.soon after conclusion of mekulsia tax court case,his attorney received discovery documents in another hoyt partnership case that the attorney was also litigating.in a motion to the tax court to reconsider or vacate its earlier decision,mekulsia argued that the production of these documents proved that the irs had relevant documents but had chosen not to provide them to mekulsia.the irs responded that the documents were unrelated to the partnership in which mekulsia invested and that mekulsia had failed to identify any new factual or legal basis from the documents that would support a different holding in the case.mekulsia claimed that,because the records,practices and parties involved in all the partnerships were highly intertwined,the irs should have produced the new documents when originally asked.the tax court denied his motion to reconsider and his motion to vacate this appeal followed.
discussion 
commissioner decision not to abate interest was proper 
mekulsia argues that he should receive an abatement on his accrued interest because of the commissioner failure either to directly remove hoyt as the tax matters partner or to notify hoyt of the ongoing criminal investigations,which would have had the indirect effect of removing him as the tax matters partner.this argument is not persuasive.
abatement statute 
e abatement of interest attributable to unreasonable errors and delays by internal revenue service.
in the case of any assessment of interest on 
a any deficiency attributable in whole or in part to any unreasonable error or delay by an officer or employee of the internal revenue service acting in his official capacity in performing a ministerial or managerial act,or 
b any payment of any tax to the extent that any unreasonable error or delay in such payment is attributable to such an officer or employee being erroneous or dilatory in performing a ministerial or managerial act,
the secretary may abate the assessment of all or any part of such interest for any period.
in order to challenge successfully a denial of abatement,the taxpayer must first identify a ministerial act that was either required and not performed,or was performed but in an erroneous or dilatory manner.the regulations define ministerial act as a procedural or mechanical act that does not involve the exercise of judgment or discretion,and that occurs during the processing of a taxpayer case after all prerequisites to the act,such as conferences and review by supervisors,have taken place.a decision concerning the proper application of federal tax law or other federal or state law is not a ministerial act.b.
the failure or inappropriate completion of a ministerial act does not mandate abatement the statute simply says that when such an act has occurred,the secretary may abate the assessment of interest.e.a taxpayer must both demonstrate the ministerial act and prove abuse of discretion in denying the abatement.in this case,however,we need not reach the abuse of discretion question since we find that all relevant acts were discretionary and not ministerial.
c special enforcement areas 
mekulsia begins building his case for a ministerial act with of the tax code.in the area of partnership taxation,the code clearly identifies special enforcement areas,including criminal investigation of a partner for tax violations.c b.when one of these areas is implicated,continuing to treat an individual partner items as partnership items may interfere with
