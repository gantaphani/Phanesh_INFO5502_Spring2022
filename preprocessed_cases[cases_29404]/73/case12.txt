on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court,except as to part.
ordinarily,the government must assess a deficiency against a taxpayer within years after the return was filed.a ed.the period is extended to years,however,when a taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.e a emphasis added.the question before us is whether this latter provision applies and extends the ordinary limitations period when the taxpayer overstates his basis in property that he has sold,thereby understating the gain that he received from its sale.following colony,commissioner,we hold that the provision does not apply to an overstatement of basis.hence the period does not apply.
for present purposes the relevant underlying circumstances are not in dispute.we consequently assume that the respondent taxpayers filed their relevant tax returns in april the returns overstated the basis of certain property that the taxpayers had sold as a result the returns understated the gross income that the taxpayers received from the sale of the property and the understatement exceeded the statute threshold.we also take as undisputed that the commissioner asserted the relevant deficiency within the extended limitations period,but outside the default period.thus,unless the statute of limitations applies,the government efforts to assert a tax deficiency came too late.our conclusion that the extended limitations period does not apply follows directly from this court earlier decision in colony.
in colony this court interpreted a provision of the internal revenue code of,the operative language of which is identical to the language now before us.the commissioner there had determined 
that the taxpayer had understated the gross profits on the sales of certain lots of land for residential purposes as a result of having overstated the basis of such lots by erroneously including in their cost certain unallowable items of development expense.at.
the commissioner assessment came after the ordinary limitations period had run.and,it was consequently timely only if the taxpayer,in the words of the code,had omit ted from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return c ed.the code provision applicable to this case,adopted in,contains materially indistinguishable language.see e a ed.same,but replacing per centum with percent see also appendix,infra.
in colony this court held that taxpayer misstatements,overstating the basis in property,do not fall within the scope of the statute.but the court recognized the commissioner contrary argument for inclusion,at.then as now,the code itself defined gross income in this context as the difference between gross revenue often the amount the taxpayer received upon selling the property and basis often the amount the taxpayer paid for the property.compare,ed.with a,a ed.and,the commissioner pointed out,an overstatement of basis can diminish the amount of the gain just as leaving the item entirely off the return might do,at.either way,the error wrongly understates the taxpayer income.
but,the court added,the commissioner argument did not fully account for the provision language,in particular the word omit.the key phrase says omits an amount.the word omits unlike,say,reduces or understates means t o leave out or unmentioned not to insert,include,or name.ibid.quoting webster new international dictionary ed.thus,taken literally,omit limits the statute scope to situations in which specific receipts or accruals of income are left out of the computation of gross income to inflate the basis,however,is not to omit a specific item,not even of profit.
while finding this latter interpretation of the language the more plausibl e,the court also noted that the language was not unambiguous.colony,at.it then examined various congressional reports discussing the relevant statutory language.it found in those reports 
persuasive indications that congress merely had in mind failures to report particular income receipts and accruals,and did not intend the extended limitation to apply whenever gross income was understated at.
this history,the court said,shows that the congress intended an exception to the usual statute of limitations only in the restricted type of situation already described,a situation that did not include overstatements of basis,at.
the court wrote that congress,in enacting the provision,
manifested no broader purpose than to give the commissioner an additional two now three years to investigate tax returns in cases where,because of a taxpayer omission to report some taxable item,the commissioner is at a special disadvantage because the return on its face provides no clue to the existence of the omitted item w hen,as here,where the overstatement of basis is at issue,the understatement of a tax arises from an error in reporting an item disclosed on the face of the return the commissioner is at no such disadvantage whether the error be one affecting gross income or one,such as overstated deductions,affecting other parts of the return.ibid.emphasis added.
finally,the court noted that congress had recently enacted the internal revenue code of.and the court observed that the conclusion we reach is in harmony with the unambiguous language of e a,at,the provision relevant in this present case.
in our view,colony determines the outcome in this case.the provision before us is a reenactment of the provision that colony interpreted.the operative language is identical.it would be difficult,perhaps impossible,to give the same language here a different interpretation without effectively overruling colony,a course of action that basic principles of stare decisis wisely counsel us not to take.john sand gravel united states,s tare decisis in respect to statutory interpretation has special force,for congress remains free to alter what we have done internal quotation marks omitted patterson mclean credit union.
the government,in an effort to convince us to interpret the operative language before us differently,points to differences in other nearby parts of the code.it suggests that these differences counsel in favor of a different interpretation than the one adopted in colony.for example,the government points to a new provision,e a i,which says 
in the case of a trade or business,the term gross income means the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services if such amounts are required to be shown on the return prior to the diminution by the cost of such sales or services.
if the section basic phrase omi ssion from gross income does not apply to overstatements of basis which is what colony held,then what need would there be for clause i,which leads to the same result in a specific subset of cases 
and why,the government adds,does a later paragraph,referring to gifts and estates,speak of a taxpayer who omits items includible in the gross estate see e emphasis added.by speaking of items there does it not imply that omission of an amount covers more than omission of individual items indeed that it includes overstatements of basis,which,after all,diminish the amount of the profit that should have been reported as gross income 
in our view,these points are too fragile to bear the significant argumentative weight the government seeks to place upon them.for example,at least one plausible reason why congress might have added clause i has nothing to do with any desire to change the meaning of the general rule.rather when congress wrote the code prior to colony,it did not yet know how the court would interpret the provision operative language.at least one lower court had decided that the provision did not apply to overstatements about the cost of goods that a business later sold.see uptegrove lumber commissioner.but see reis commissioner.and congress could well have wanted to ensure that,come what may in the supreme court,uptegrove interpretation would remain the law where a trade or business was at issue.
nor does our interpretation leave clause i without work to do.trw andrews,noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any provision superfluous,void,or insignificant internal quotation marks omitted.that provision also explains how to calculate the denominator for purposes of determining whether a conceded omission amounts to of gross income.for example,it tells us that a merchant who fails to include of revenue from sold goods has not met the test if total revenue is more than,regardless of the cost paid by the merchant to acquire those goods.but without clause i,the general statutory definition of gross income requires subtracting the cost from the sales price.see a.under such a definition of gross income,the calculation would take total revenue from sales,minus the cost of such sales,say.the of revenue would thus amount to of the gross income of.and the clause does this work in respect to omissions from gross income irrespective of our interpretation regarding overstatements of basis.
the government argument about subsection e use of the word item instead of amount is yet weaker.the court in colony addressed a similar argument about the word amount.it wrote 
the commissioner states that the draftsman use of the word amount instead of,for example,item suggests a concentration on the quantitative aspect of the error that is whether or not gross income was understated by as much as.at.
but the court,while recognizing the commissioner logic,rejected the argument and the significance of the word amount as insufficient to prove the commissioner conclusion.and the addition of the word item in a different subsection similarly fails to exert an interpretive force sufficiently strong to affect our conclusion.the word appearance in subsection e,we concede,is new.but to rely in the case before us on this solitary word change in a different subsection is like hoping that a new batboy will change the outcome of the world series.
finally,the government points to treasury regulation e,which was promulgated in final form in december.see cfr e.the regulation,as relevant here,departs from colony and interprets the operative language of the statute in the government favor.the regulation says that an understated amount of gross income resulting from an overstatement of unrecovered cost or other basis constitutes an omission from gross income.e a iii.in the government view this new regulation in effect overturns colony interpretation of this statute.
the government points out that the treasury regulation constitutes an agency construction of a statute which it administers.chevron,natural resources defense council.see also mayo foundation for medical ed.and research united states,applying chevron in the tax context.the court has written that a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,emphasis added.and,as the government notes,in colony itself the court wrote that it can not be said that the language is unambiguous.at.hence,the government concludes,colony can not govern the outcome in this case.the question,rather,is whether the agency construction is a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,supra,at.and,since the government argues that the regulation embodies a reasonable,hence permissible,construction of the statute,the government believes it must win.
we do not accept this argument.in our view,colony has already interpreted the statute,and there is no longer any different construction that is consistent with colony and available for adoption by the agency.
the fatal flaw in the government contrary argument is that it overlooks the reason why brand x held that a prior judicial construction,unless reflecting an unambiguous statute,does not trump a different agency construction of that statute,at.the court reveals that reason when it points out that it is for agencies,not courts,to fill statutory gaps.ibid.the fact that a statute is unambiguous means that there is no gap for the agency to fill and thus no room for agency discretion.at.
in so stating,the court sought to encapsulate what earlier opinions,including chevron,made clear.those opinions identify the underlying interpretive problem as that of deciding whether,or when,a particular statute in effect delegates to an agency the power to fill a gap,thereby implicitly taking from a court the power to void a reasonable interpretation.thus,in chevron the court said that,when 
congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit.but in either instance,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.at.
see also united states mead,smiley citibank south dakota,ins,morton ruiz.
chevron and later cases find in unambiguous language a clear sign that congress did not delegate authority to an agency and they find in ambiguous language at least a presumptive indication that congress did delegate that authority.thus,in chevron the court wrote that a statute silence or ambiguity as to a particular issue means that congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue thus likely delegating power to the agency,at.in mead the court,describing chevron,explained 
congress may not have expressly delegated authority or responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap.yet it can still be apparent from the agency generally conferred authority and other statutory circumstances that congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law,even one about which congress did not actually have an intent as to a particular result.at internal quotation marks omitted.
chevron added that i f a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.at,emphasis added.
as the government points out,the court in colony stated that the statutory language at issue is not unambiguous.at.but the court decided that case nearly years before it decided chevron.there is no reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by colony reflects a conclusion that congress had delegated power to the agency.at the same time,there is every reason to believe that the court thought that congress had directly spoken to the question at hand,and thus left no gap for the agency to fill.chevron,supra,at.
for one thing,the court said that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument.colony,at.for another,its examination of legislative history led it to believe that congress had decided the question definitively,leaving no room for the agency to reach a contrary result.it found in that history persuasive indications that congress intended overstatements of basis to fall outside the statute scope,and it said that it was satisfied that congress intended an exception only in the restricted type of situation it had already described,at.further,it thought that the commissioner interpretation the interpretation once again advanced here would create a patent incongruity in the tax law.at.and it reached this conclusion despite the fact that,in the years leading up to colony,the commissioner had consistently advocated the opposite in the circuit courts.see,uptegrove,reis,goodenow commisioner,american liberty oil commissioner.slaff commisioner,davis hightower.thus,the court was aware it was rejecting the expert opinion of the commissioner of internal revenue.and finally,after completing its analysis,colony found its interpretation of the code in harmony with the now unambiguous language of the code,which at a minimum suggests that the court saw nothing in the code as inconsistent with its conclusion,at.
it may be that judges today would use other methods to determine whether congress left a gap to fill.but that is beside the point.the question is whether the court in colony concluded that the statute left such a gap.and,in our view,the opinion written by justice harlan for the court makes clear that it did not.
given principles of stare decisis,we must follow that interpretation.and there being no gap to fill,the government regulation can not change colony interpretation of the statute.we agree with the taxpayer that overstatements of basis,and the resulting understatement of gross income,do not trigger the extended limitations period of e a.the court of appeals reached the same conclusion.see.and its judgment is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

it would be reasonable,i think,to deny all precedential effect to colony,commissioner,to overrule its holding as obviously contrary to our later law that agency resolutions of ambiguities are to be accorded deference.because of justifiable taxpayer reliance i would not take that course and neither does the court opinion,which says that colony determines the outcome in this case.ante,at.that should be the end of the matter.
the plurality,however,goes on to address the government argument that treasury regulation e effectively overturned colony.see cfr e.in my view,that can not be once a court has decided upon its de novo construction of the statute,there no longer is a different construction that is consistent with the court holding and available for adoption by the agency.national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,scalia,dissenting citation and internal quotation marks omitted.that view,of course,did not carry the day in brand x,and the government quite reasonably relies on the brand x majority innovative pronouncement that a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute.at.
in cases decided x,the court had no inkling that it must utter the magic words ambiguous or unambiguous in order to poof expand or abridge executive power,and poof enable or disable administrative contradiction of the supreme court.indeed,the court was unaware of even the utility much less the necessity of making the determination in cases decided,before that opinion made the step determination of ambiguity vel non a customary though hardly part of analysis.for many of those earlier cases,therefore,it will be incredibly difficult to determine whether the decision purported to be giving meaning to an ambiguous,or rather an unambiguous,statute.
thus,one would have thought that the brand x majority would breathe a sigh of relief in the present case,involving a opinion that mirabile dictu makes it inescapably clear that the court thought the statute ambiguous it can not be said that the language is unambiguous.colony,supra,at emphasis added.as today plurality opinion explains,colony said that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument,ante,at emphasis added not what brand x requires to foreclose administrative revision of our decisions the only permissible reading of the statute.at.thus,having decided to stand by colony and to stand by brand x as well,the plurality should have found in order to reach the decision it did that the treasury department current interpretation was unreasonable.
instead of doing what brand x would require,however,the plurality manages to sustain the justifiable reliance of taxpayers by revising yet again the meaning of chevron and revising it yet again in a direction that will create confusion and uncertainty.see united states mead,scalia,dissenting bressman,how mead has muddled judicial review of agency action,vand.of course there is no doubt that,with regard to the internal revenue code,the treasury department satisfies the mead requirement of some indication that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law.at.we have given chevron deference to a treasury regulation before.see mayo foundation for medical ed.and research united states,slip,at.but in order to evade brand x and yet reaffirm colony,the plurality would add yet another story to the ugly and improbable structure that our law of administrative review has become to trigger the brand x power of an authorized agency to give content to an ambiguous text,a determination that language is ambiguous does not alone suffice the court must in addition have found that congress wanted the particular ambiguity in question to be resolved by the agency.and here,today plurality opinion finds,t here is no reason to believe that the linguistic ambiguity noted by colony reflects a conclusion that congress had delegated power to the agency.ante,at.the notion,seemingly,is that a finding of ambiguity is accompanied by a finding of agency authority to resolve the ambiguity,but that was not so.the premise is false.cases do not conclude that congress wanted the particular ambiguity resolved by the agency that is simply the legal effect of ambiguity a legal effect that should obtain whenever the language is in fact as colony found ambiguous.
does the plurality feel that it ought not give effect to colony determination of ambiguity because the court did not know,in that era,the importance of that determination that it would empower the agency to in effect revise the court determination of statutory meaning but as i suggested earlier,that was an ignorance which all of our cases shared not just,but before then it did not really matter whether the court was resolving an ambiguity or setting forth the statute clear meaning.the opinion might or might not advert to that point in the course of its analysis,but either way the court interpretation of the statute would be the law.so it is no small number of cases that today plurality opinion would exile to the land of uncertainty.
perhaps sensing the fragility of its new approach,the plurality opinion then pivots as the à la mode vernacular has it from focusing on whether colony concluded that there was authority to focusing on whether colony concluded that there was any gap to be filled the question is whether the court in colony concluded that the statute left such a gap.and,in our view,the opinion makes clear that it did not.ante,at.how does the plurality know this because justice harlan opinion said that the taxpayer had the better side of the textual argument because it found that legislative history indicated that congress intended overstatements of basis to fall outside the statute scope because it concluded that the commissioner interpretation would create a patent incongruity in the tax law and because it found its interpretation in harmony with the now unambiguous language of the code.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.but these are the sorts of arguments that courts always use in resolving ambiguities.they do not prove that no ambiguity existed,unless one believes that an ambiguity resolved is an ambiguity that never existed in the first place.colony said unambiguously that the text was ambiguous,and that should be an end of the matter unless one wants simply to deny stare decisis effect to colony as a decision.
rather than making our jurisprudence curiouser and curiouser,the court should abandon the opinion that produces these contortions,brand i join the judgment announced by the court because it is indisputable that colony resolved the construction of the statutory language at issue here,and that construction must therefore control.and i join the court opinion except for part.
i must add a word about the peroration of the dissent,which asserts that o ur legal system presumes there will be continuing dialogue among the three branches of government on questions of statutory interpretation and application,and that the constructive discourse,convers ations,and instructive exchanges would be foreclosed by an insistence on adhering to earlier interpretations of a statute even in light of new,relevant statutory amendments.post,at opinion of kennedy.this passage is reminiscent of professor davis vision that administrative procedure is developed by a partnership between legislators and judges,who working as partners produce better law than legislators alone could possibly produce.that romantic,image was obliterated by this court in vermont yankee nuclear power natural resources defense council,which held that congress prescribes and we obey,with no discretion to add to the administrative procedures that congress has created.it seems to me that the dissent vision of a troika partnership is a similar mirage.the discourse,conversation,and exchange that the dissent perceives is peculiarly.congress prescribes and where congress prescription is ambiguous the executive can within the scope of the ambiguity clarify that prescription and if the product is constitutional the courts obey.i hardly think it amounts to a discourse that congress or as this court would allow in its brand x decision the executive can change its prescription so as to render our prior holding irrelevant.what is needed for the system to work is that congress,the executive,and the private parties subject to their dispositions,be able to predict the meaning that the courts will give to their instructions.that goal would be obstructed if the judicially established meaning of a technical legal term used in a very specific context could be overturned on the basis of statutory indications as feeble as those asserted here.

this case involves a provision of the internal revenue code establishing an extended statute of limitations for tax assessment in cases where substantial income has been omitted from a tax return.see e a,supp.iv.the treasury department has determined that taxpayers omit income under this section not only when they fail to report a sale of property but also when they overstate their basis in the property sold.see reg.e,cfr e.the question is whether this otherwise reasonable interpretation is foreclosed by the court contrary reading of an earlier version of the statute in colony,commissioner.
in colony there was no need to decide whether the meaning of the provision changed when congress it as part of the revision of the tax code.although the main text of the statute remained the same,congress added new provisions leading to the permissible conclusion that it would have a different meaning going forward.the colony decision reserved judgment on this issue.in my view,the amended statute leaves room for the department reading.a summary of the reasons for concluding the department interpretation is permissible,and for this respectful dissent,now follows.
the statute at issue in colony,c ed,was enacted as part of the internal revenue code of.it provided for a longer period of limitations if the government assessed income taxes against a taxpayer who had omit ted from gross income an amount in excess of per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return.
there was disagreement in the courts about the meaning of this provision in the statute as first enacted.the tax court of the united states,and the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit,held that an overstatement of basis constituted an omission from gross income and could trigger the extended limitations period.see,reis commissioner,american liberty oil commissioner.the united states court of appeals for the third circuit came to the opposite conclusion in a case where a corporation misreported its income after inflating the cost of goods it sold from inventory.see uptegrove lumber commissioner.in the third circuit view there could be an omission only where the taxpayer had left an entire item of gain out of his computation of gross income.at.in the colony decision,issued in,this court resolved that dispute against the government.acknowledging that it can not be said that the language is unambiguous,at,and relying in large part on the legislative history of the code,the court concluded that the mere overstatement of basis did not constitute an omission from gross income under c.
if the government is to prevail in the instant case the regulation in question must be a proper implementation of the same language the court considered in colony but the statutory interpretation issue here can not be resolved,and the colony decision can not be deemed controlling,without first considering the inferences that should be drawn from added statutory text.the additional language was not part of the statute that governed the taxpayer liability in colony,and the court did not consider it in that case.congress revised the internal revenue code in,several years before colony was decided but after the tax years in question in that case.although the interpretation adopted by the court in colony can be a proper beginning point for the interpretation of the revised statute,it ought not to be the end.
the central language of the new provision remained the same as the old,with the longer period of limitations still applicable where a taxpayer had omit ted from gross income an amount in excess of per cent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.in colony,however,the court left open whether congress had nonetheless manifested an intention to clarify or to change the code.at.the revisions,of course,could not provide a direct response to colony,which had not yet been decided.but there were indications that,whatever the earlier version of the statute had meant,congress expected that the overstatement of basis would be considered an omission from gross income as a general rule going forward.
for example,the new law created a special exception for businesses by defining their gross income to be the total of the amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or services without factoring in the cost of such sales or services.e a i ed.e b i,supp.iv.the purpose of this provision,perhaps motivated by the facts in the third circuit uptegrove decision,seems to have been to ensure that the extended statute of limitations would not be activated by a business overstatement of the cost of goods sold.this did important work.there are,after all,unique complexities involved in calculating inventory costs.see,whittington pany,principles of auditing and other assurance services ed.the audit of inventories presents the auditors with significant risk because a they often represent a very substantial portion of current assets,b numerous valuation methods are used for inventories,c the valuation of inventories directly affects cost of goods sold,and d the determination of inventory quality,condition,and value is inherently complex see also internal revenue service,publication,accounting periods and methods discussing methods for identifying the cost of items in inventory.congress sought fit to make clear that errors in these kinds of calculations would not extend the limitations period.
colony itself might be classified as a special business inventory case.unlike the taxpayers here,the taxpayer in colony claimed to be a business with income from the sale of goods,though the goods it held for sale were real estate lots.see intermountain ins.serv.of vail commissioner,cadc tatel,colony described itself as a taxpayer in a trade or business with income from the sale of goods or services,as falling within clause i scope had the subsection applied the court,in turn,observed that its construction of the statute in favor of the taxpayer was in harmony with the unambiguous language of newly enacted e a.at.clause i of the new provision,as just noted,ensured that the extended limitations period would not cover overstated costs of goods sold.the revised statute special treatment of these costs suggests that overstatements of basis in other cases could have the effect of extending the limitations period.
it is also significant that,after,the statute continued to address the omission of a substantial amount that should have been included in gross income.in the same round of revisions to the tax code,congress established an extended limitations period in certain cases where items had been omitted from an estate or gift tax return.e ed.there is at least some evidence that this term was used at that time to mak e it clear that the extended limitations period would not apply merely because of differences between the taxpayer and the government as to the valuation of property.staff of the joint committee on internal revenue taxation,summary of the new provisions of the internal revenue code of,comm.print.congress decision not to use the term items to achieve the same result when it reenacted the statutory provision at issue is presumed to have been purposeful.see russello united states.this consideration casts further doubt on the premise that the new version of the statute,e a,supp.iv,necessarily has the same meaning as its predecessor.
in the instant case the court concludes these statutory
