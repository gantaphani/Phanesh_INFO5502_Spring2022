facts and procedural history 
james sparkman has sold solar water heating systems to homeowners since.until,sparkman operated his business as a sole proprietorship,under the registered trade name mercury solar.
hawaii environmental holdings heh 
in,sparkman purported to create and transfer his business to hawaii environmental holdings heh,styled in its formation document an unincorporated business organization.the formation document,entitled contract and declaration of unincorporated business organization,provides that sparkman identified as the exchanger or exchangers will convey the mercury solar business to heh in exchange for dollars of silver,certificates comprising a total of one hundred units,and other full and adequate consideration.the formation documents also provide for a trustee who will be responsible for the exclusive management and control of heh property and business affairs without any consent of certificate holders.the original such trustee was lee allan hansen,who is not otherwise identified in the record.the trustee immediately appointed sparkman as agent and president of heh,with authority to open bank accounts,act as the official authorized signature on said bank accounts and to operate the company to the same extent as if he were the owner.two months later,hansen appointed amanda porter at the time sparkman wife,to be trustee.in,porter was removed as trustee,and hansen appointed sparkman himself and cynthia mcneff as trustees.mcneff was removed as trustee the following year,and in,hansen was removed,leaving sparkman as the sole trustee of heh.
mercury solar pto 
in,heh purported to transfer its interest in the mercury solar business to mercury solar pto,styled in its formation documents a pure trust organization,in exchange for units in mercury solar.except for designating mercury solar a pure trust organization and entrusting exclusive management and control of the entity with a fiduciary owner rather than a trustee,the formation documents are in almost all respects identical to those of heh.clark atkinson,also not otherwise identified in the record,was initially named as fiduciary owner,but in porter was appointed trustee,and atkinson resigned as fiduciary owner.
the precise ownership of mercury solar pto is unclear and disputed.the formation documents call for beneficial units,which were initially given to heh in return for the mercury solar business.these appear to have been immediately transferred to sparkman.the record,stipulated to by both parties,contains a certificate record that records the assignment of one share each to william bright,william montgomery,and myron thompson.in testimony before the tax court,porter described the first two entries of assignment as administrational error s but testified that the assignment to thompson,an employee of mercury solar,was valid.according to porter,units are owned by heh,by sparkman,and one by thompson.when thompson himself was asked during testimony whether he was aware that he had a share,he responded,i am now,but said that he did not know what happened to the share.
operation of mercury solar and heh 
during the years at issue,heh purported to sell to customers solar energy produced by solar water heating components on the customer property.it would purchase this equipment from mercury solar pto,and hire mercury solar to install it.in addition to the solar service energy contract with heh,each customer also received a beneficiary certificate entitling him to a beneficial ownership interest in heh.the heh trustee would thereby have the discretion to pass through solar energy tax credits to the customer,and such credits would be reflected on schedules distributed to its beneficiary customers.see generally hvidding comm r,memo describing more fully the transaction in the case of a customer claiming a tax credit for the energy purchased richter comm r,same.as thompson testified 
mercury solar is really just a contractor,it a solar contractor.it basically was contacted to put solar panels and hot water heaters in homes and that kind of thing.so that what our function was.heh had another function of contracting mercury solar to do that for the purposes of selling energy and things like that.
heh had no employees and shared a common office space with mercury solar.mercury solar did not have a solar contractor license in its own name,but rather used sparkman.
heco payments 
according to the parties stipulation,in the hawaii electric company heco issued a form nec compensation reporting in income earned by mercury solar.regarding these payments,sparkman later testified 
i do know that mercury solar in its transaction with hawaiian electric company wanted to be paid faster.
w henever someone installs a solar system via the hawaiian electric company rebate program either the contractor or the homeowner is entitled to an cash subsidy.however,through its bureaucratic process hawaiian electric sometimes does pay anywhere between to months.
mercury sought out a factoring company that would take that receivable and pay it in cash and how it worked was mercury submitted invoices that it was owed by hawaiian electric company to aba funding and aba funding took a percentage of the rebate and then heco sent aba funding a check made payable to mercury solar which aba funding cashed 
and apparently aba funding or mercury solar or heh decided they wanted the funds directed into the hawaii environmental holdings account instead of the mercury solar account.
procedural history 
in,the irs issued sparkman a notice of deficiency with respect to the years to,inclusive.it identified mercury solar pto as a sham with no economic substance and accordingly attributed mercury solar income to sparkman directly.because the income was attributable as income to him personally,sparkman was assessed tax.the service adjusted his income to include the heco payment,asserting it to be attributable entirely to mercury solar,and hence to sparkman it disallowed losses flowing through from heh to sparkman as unsubstantiated.finally,it assessed both late filing a and negligent underpayment penalties.
the tax court conducted a trial,summarizing the issues for decision as follows 
whether mercury solar pto should be disregarded as an entity separate from sparkman for federal tax purposes and its net income attributed to sparkman for the years at issue whether in mercury solar pto and hence sparkman had unreported income resulting from certain rebate payments from hawaii electric company heco whether for the years at issue sparkman is liable for tax on his earnings from mercury solar pto whether for the years at issue sparkman is entitled to claimed losses from a purported business trust,hawaii environmental holdings heh whether sparkman is entitled to additional itemized deductions,allegedly not claimed on his federal income tax returns,for interest or charitable contributions and whether petitioners are liable for additions to tax and penalties.
it admitted into evidence a stipulation by the parties and attached exhibits including sparkman amended returns for and,and heard testimony from porter,sparkman,thompson,and joe miskowiec,identified as a salesman for heh.when sparkman tried to enter into evidence his and amended returns,the tax court excluded them as irrelevant,but encouraged him to attempt to substantiate their contents through relevant evidence.after trial,the tax court decided in favor of the commissioner on all the issues identified above and entered judgment upholding the service amended calculation of the deficiency and denying sparkman claim for additional deductions.sparkman appealed to this court.
ii.economic substance of mercury solar pto 
it has long been the law that a transaction with no economic effects,in which the underlying documents are a device to conceal its true purpose,does not control the incidence of taxes.sacks comm r,cir see gregory helvering.sparkman contends that mercury solar pto was not a sham organization,but a legitimate business enterprise.if mercury solar pto has an independent existence,that would mean that the income sparkman received from it would not constitute income,and,accordingly,that sparkman would not owe taxes on that income 
in reviewing the tax court determination that a transaction lacks economic substance,we review the factual determinations for clear error,and we review de novo the correctness of the legal standards applied by the tax court and the application of the legal standards to the facts found.sacks,at.under the clear error standard,we will reverse the tax court findings only when we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.wolf comm r,cir quoting united states united states gypsum.
in evaluating whether mercury solar pto had economic substance,the tax court employed a test derived from markosian comm r,wl,asking 
whether the taxpayer relationship to the transferred property differed materially before and after the trust creation whether the trust had an independent trustee whether an economic interest passed to other trust beneficiaries and whether the taxpayer respected the restrictions placed on the trust operation as set forth in the trust documents.
sparkman does not contest these criteria as probative of economic substance,and the precedent from which they derive has been cited with approval in this circuit.see zmuda comm r,cir hanson comm r,cir.this court reviews the tax court application of these factors for plain error.sacks,at.
the tax court concluded that sparkman formation of mercury solar pto and heh did little to change his relationship to the mercury solar business.as agent and president of both heh and mercury solar pto,sparkman was empowered to operate the company to the same extent as if he were the owner.as porter testified,he continued to have control of the mercury solar business,except during the period when thompson was operation manager.the business continued under the same name,and even continued doing business under sparkman contracting license.
the tax court next determined that mercury solar pto had no independent trustee.from sparkman failure to call atkinson,the first named fiduciary owner of mercury solar pto,the tax court properly inferred that atkinson testimony would not favor sparkman similarly,the tax court finding that porter was not an independent trustee was not due to confusion regarding the proper role of trustees and agents in a corporate trust,as sparkman contends.rather,the tax court found that she had no meaningful role whatsoever.that porter testified otherwise does not,in itself,establish that the tax court committed clear error.the tax court,describing porter testimony as vague,contrived,and,plainly did not believe her,and the tax court,like any other court,may disregard uncontradicted testimony by a taxpayer where it finds that testimony lacking in credibility.conti comm r,cir quoting lerch comm r,cir see also demkowicz comm r,cir holding the tax court not bound to accept taxpayer uncontradicted testimony if it found the testimony to be improbable,unreasonable,or questionable wood comm r,cir.
next,the tax court determined that,in reality,sparkman was the sole owner of mercury solar pto.the tax court was free to disregard the testimony of sparkman and porter,especially in the light of contradictory documentary evidence,consider thompson apparent admission that he was unaware that he had a share until the trial itself,and sparkman own testimony,in a prior unrelated proceeding,that he believed that he was the sole beneficiary of the trust.
finally,the tax court found that sparkman failed to respect the trust form.the record reflects several inconsistencies in form porter was named trustee rather than fiduciary owner the position title in mercury solar pto formation documents the certificate record showing ownership of the trust is,by the parties own admission,entirely false and there are two proffered dates when thompson was allegedly granted his one unit.
in light of the cumulative weight of this evidence,we conclude that the tax court did not commit clear error in finding that mercury solar pto lacks economic substance.we therefore affirm the tax court decision with respect to taxes 
iii.the tax court exclusion of sparkman and amended returns 
during his direct examination,sparkman attempted to enter his and amended returns into evidence,which he had filed with the irs shortly before trial.the tax court rejected them as not probative.the tax court evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion and will not be reversed absent a showing of prejudice.sacks comm r,cir.
a tax return,even though signed under penalty of perjury,is not per se evidence of the income,deductions,credits,and other items claimed therein.mays united states,cir lunsford comm r,cir wilkinson comm r,wl halle comm r,wl,aff,cir.as the tax court noted,sparkman retained the opportunity to substantiate the contents of his returns with testimony and documentary evidence.because sparkman amended returns did not hav e any tendency to make the existence of those underlying items more probable or less probable than it would be without them,the tax court was correct in declining to admit the returns into evidence.
even if the returns were somehow relevant,however,the tax court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit them.federal rule of evidence allows even relevant evidence to be excluded if its admission would result in needless presentation of cumulative evidence.in this case,an amended tax return filed only a few days before trial merely demonstrates that sparkman now contends he had a different level of income than was reflected on his original contention that sparkman presented in oral testimony immediately after the returns were rejected.sparkman has not demonstrated what the returns would have added to his own testimony that same day.because the returns were at best cumulative,and at worst irrelevant,we hold that the tax court did not abuse its discretion in declining to accept them into evidence.
iv.attribution of heco payments 
among the parties stipulations was the following 
for the year,hawaiian electric company heco issued a form,compensation,to mercury solar in the amount of.the statutory notices issued to sparkman and mercury solar both contain an adjustment in the amount of labeled nec that is based on the form issued by heco.
at trial,sparkman contradicted this stipulation and claimed that he never received the form.he conceded,however,that heco did make those payments,and contended only that of those payments should be attributed to heh,not to mercury solar pto.he renews his objection on appeal.
sparkman argues that the tax court incorrectly treated the stipulation as an admission that the heco payments were attributable to sparkman.but the tax court based its attribution of the payments not on an admission in the stipulation,but rather on basic principles and sparkman own admission in testimony.whether principles apply is a mixed question of fact and law.mixed questions are reviewed de novo unless the question is primarily factual.hood encinitas union sch,cir.
under principles,income must be taxed to him who earns it.comm r culbertson.see also lucas earl.sparkman was clear in his testimony that it was mercury solar,as the installing contractor,which earned the money,even if heh received some of it.he stated that i do know that mercury solar in its transaction with heco wanted to be paid faster and that mercury submitted invoices that it was owed by heco to the factor for paymen
