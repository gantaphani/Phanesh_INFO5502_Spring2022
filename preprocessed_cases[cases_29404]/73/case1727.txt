after the first phase of a trial in which the court found defendant palomba weingarten committed fraud and malice,the court ordered weingarten to produce her and personal tax returns to permit plaintiffs to prepare for the punitive damages phase.weingarten seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its disclosure order,contending the order violates her privilege to maintain confidentiality of her tax returns.we deny the requested relief.
we agree with weingarten that a finding a defendant is liable for punitive damages is insufficient,by itself,to establish the tax return privilege is inapplicable.but we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the privilege was inapplicable in this case because the record showed weingarten engaged in conduct precluding plaintiffs from obtaining relevant nonprivileged financial information necessary to support plaintiffs punitive damages claim,and there was no less intrusive alternative for plaintiffs to obtain the information.we modify the order only to include a provision requiring that weingarten husband,robert weingarten,receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the court can compel disclosure of the joint tax returns.
summary of factual and procedural background 
this case arises out of a complex business relationship that began in late when plaintiffs pointe san diego residential community and gosnell builders corporation of california entered into transactions with weingarten,and entities owned or controlled by weingarten,relating to the potential development of residential property.after weingarten engaged in conduct diminishing eliminating plaintiffs rights in the property,plaintiffs sued weingarten and other entities,alleging breach of contract,intentional interference with contract,rescission,and breach of fiduciary duty.plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages,a constructive trust,and an accounting.
approximately nine months before trial,the trial court directed weingarten to identify all witnesses and documents regarding her financial condition,presumably to permit plaintiffs to obtain necessary information in the event of a punitive damages finding.see,subd.c.in response,weingarten produced an unverified december personal financial statement and some supporting account statements.however,at her deposition taken one month before trial,weingarten acknowledged this financial statement was no longer accurate because all of her assets were now tied up in this residential development project.weingarten made no effort to produce additional information to explain this claimed change in her financial condition.
the court bifurcated the action,and,sitting without a jury,tried the equitable claims first.after a trial,the court found weingarten breached her fiduciary duties to plaintiffs in numerous ways,including by engaging in inherently unfair deals and intentionally acting to personally financially benefit herself to the detriment of plaintiffs.the court found weingarten conduct as a corporate director involved the absence of good faith,the receipt of an improper personal benefit and showed a knowing reckless disregard for her duty to the corporations its shareholder and resulting risk of serious injury.the court found plaintiffs failed to prove losses with respect to several of the breaches of fiduciary duty,but found that plaintiffs did prove monetary losses with respect to weingarten improper receipt of commissions and the improper fees and costs charged to the project.the court ordered an accounting to determine the proper amount of damages and a constructive trust with respect to these breaches,expressing concern that weingarten could once again engage in the improper transactions and commit future abuses.the court further found by clear and convincing evidence that weingarten was guilty of malice and fraud,and stated it would schedule a trial on the punitive damages amount after plaintiffs counsel had sufficient opportunity to conduct financial discovery.see mike davidov issod th,d.
shortly thereafter,plaintiffs requested that the trial court sign an order requiring weingarten to produce numerous specified financial documents to permit plaintiffs to meet their burden on the punitive damages issues.see adams murakami cal d.the requested information consisted of standard financial discovery,including bank and investment statements,loan and other credit applications,real and personal property appraisals,real property descriptions,certificates of deposit,retirement plan documentation,and documents relating to stocks and other interests in various businesses.plaintiffs also sought weingarten tax returns from until the present date.at a hearing,the court declined to issue an immediate order,and stated it would instead treat the proposed order as a discovery request.
three weeks later,weingarten served a response to plaintiffs document requests in which she raised numerous objections and essentially refused to produce any additional documents relating to her financial circumstances,claiming she had already produced her full financial information.with respect to the request for tax returns,weingarten objected on the grounds of tax preparers and privacy privileges 
the next day,plaintiffs moved to compel production of the requested documents,arguing that weingarten response was inadequate.plaintiffs explained they had the burden of proving weingarten wealth and ability to pay,but weingarten continued to possess all of the relevant information plaintiffs claimed they had tried repeatedly to obtain complete and accurate financial records but a t every stage of this litigation,weingarten has vigorously opposed those efforts and has provided incomplete,inaccurate and misleading financial documents.
plaintiffs supported their motion with the declaration of jeffrey sumpter,a certified public accountant,who they retained to provide an opinion on weingarten financial condition for purposes of determining the appropriate punitive damages amount.sumpter stated the financial documents previously produced by weingarten contained numerous discrepancies and raised substantial questions as to whether the information was complete.in particular,sumpter stated that weingarten excluded from her financial statement the current value of her residence,even though the residence appears to be a significant component of weingarten wealth weingarten failed to provide the current value of her investments and relevant supporting information weingarten failed to explain a large downturn in the assets of her wholly owned corporation from to april weingarten bank statement showed an unexplained sizeable decline from december to february weingarten failed to provide reliable back up information regarding the values she has assigned to her assets and weingarten failed to explain her efforts to link a significant amount of her net worth to the pointe san diego residential project.
in opposing the motion,weingarten did not specifically address the issues raised by sumpter.she instead urged the court to deny plaintiffs motion based on her assertions that she had made a full and complete production of financial documents and financial statements and that plaintiffs had no need for discovery beyond the financial statements.weingarten further asserted her tax returns were privileged and urged the court to deny the motion because the request potentially violates the privacy rights of her husband,robert weingarten,with whom she files a joint tax return.she additionally stated she had made available numerous additional documents and requested the court to delay ruling on the motion until plaintiffs reviewed those documents.
after considering the papers and counsels arguments,the court overruled weingarten objections to producing the tax returns,finding plaintiffs interests in assessing weingarten financial worth for purposes of the punitive damages phase of the trial outweighs weingarten tax privilege.but the court limited the required disclosure to the prior two years,and imposed a protective order permitting disclosure of the records only to plaintiffs attorneys and necessar
