in a jury determined that the state office of mental health central new york psychiatric center had terminated ian noel in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of and awarded him back and front pay.the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,entered a money judgment,and the state forwarded the judgment to the new york state office of the comptroller osc for payment.considering the payment as one for wages,the osc made various deductions mainly for state and federal taxes and forwarded a check for the balance directly to noel,ostensibly in full satisfaction of the judgment.
noel objected to the deductions and moved to require the state to pay him the full dollar amount of the judgment.the court granted the motion.it held that the state lacked the authority to make the deductions without prior court approval and ordered the state to directly to noel the full amount of the deductions.although it was clear that noel would be able to claim credits against his income tax liability for the taxes withheld and paid on his behalf by the osc,the court nonetheless required,in effect,double payment to noel.this appeal followed.we conclude that he was not entitled to this windfall.
background 
in noel was terminated from his job at the central new york psychiatric center.prior to his termination,he had cooperated in a formal investigation of race discrimination by his supervisors,and he brought a retaliation claim arising from this episode.noel prevailed at trial,and a jury awarded him in back pay,in front pay,and for emotional distress.the state appealed.we reversed the emotional distress award for lack of evidence but otherwise affirmed the judgment.see noel state office of mental health cent.psychiatric,app x cir.thereafter noel sought,and obtained,an amended judgment in the amount of,including for back and front pay.
the state forwarded the judgment to the osc for payment.without seeking to amend or resettle the judgment and without notice to counsel or to the district court the osc made various deductions and mailed a check for directly to noel noel objected to the deductions and moved under rule a for full satisfaction of the judgment and for sanctions.see.a,e.in response,the state took the position that,because the judgment was for back and front pay,which it understood to be wages,the osc was obligated by the internal revenue code and state law to make the deductions and forward them to the relevant taxing authorities.the state pointed out that,when noel filed his state and federal returns,he would be entitled to claim dollar for dollar credits against his income tax liability based on the taxes withheld and remitted on his behalf.def.aff.in opp to noel order to show cause at,march,ecf.to avoid what,it contended,would be a significant,undeserved windfall to noel,the state argued that it should not be required to also pay to noel the withheld taxes.
the court was not persuaded.it disagreed that the check for satisfied the judgment since the state was unable to submit examples of prior cases in which it withheld portions of plaintiff back and front pay awards.noel state office of mental health cent.psychiatric,cv,wl,at july,see also entry granting order to show cause,april,ecf.the court granted noel motion and chastised the state for sending the check directly to him without either consulting or copying his counsel or the court,or requesting a ruling from the court as to the legal status of such deductions.because the state was unable to provide legal authority in support of its decision to withhold a significant portion of plaintiff amended judgment,noel,wl,at,the court ordered the state to pay the balance of the final judgment,plus additional attorney fees and costs.although the court concluded that the state actions were not sanctionable,id.at,it found that the state failure to consult noel counsel about the many complicated and complex deductions was inexcusable.id.at.in,the court entered a judgment in the amount of,representing a second payment of the monies previously withheld and paid over,plus interest and fees.the state paid the new judgment and appealed.

discussion 
the state argues that title vii awards for back and front pay are wages when paid by an employer irrespective of whether such payment is made through a settlement or a final judgment,and,as such,it was required by law to withhold taxes.appellant br.at reply br.at.the united states supports this position,arguing that the district court decision is incorrect as a matter of law because it penalizes the state for fulfilling its legal duty,amicus br.at.noel primary response is that the state lacked authority to treat back and front pay incorporated in a judgment as wages without either seeking a ruling from the district court to that effect or pointing to specific authority that compels that result.
the internal revenue code broadly defines income as all income from whatever source derived.a.noel does not seriously dispute that title vii back and front pay awards normally are income,see id.a,but argues instead that,when the source of the obligation to pay is a judgment,the payment is not subject to withholding because the payment is for the judgment and not for wages.we disagree and hold that payments pursuant to title vii judgments for back and front pay are wages as defined under the internal revenue code and,as such,employers are required to withhold income and federal insurance contributions act fica taxes moreover,we conclude that although district courts have discretion to oversee the procedure by which these deductions are taken the district court should not have ordered the double payment.
the code defines wages for purposes of income tax withholding as all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer,id.a.the code defines wages for purposes of fica withholding in a substantially similar manner as all remuneration for employment,id.a,where employment is defined as any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him.id.b.for purposes of withholding,we construe that congress intended its definition of wages to be interpreted in the same manner for fica and withholding see rowan,united states.
the remedial provisions of title vii authorize front and back pay.see g.back pay is an amount equal to the wages the employee would have earned from the date of discharge to the date of reinstatement,along with lost fringe benefits such as vacation pay and pension benefits.united states burke,emphasis added,superseded by statute on other grounds.front pay is simply money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement.pollard du pont de nemours,see also id.at we see no logical difference between front pay awards made when there eventually is reinstatement and those made when there is not.
we have little difficulty in concluding that both back pay and front pay are wages as defined by the internal revenue code a id.a.both are remuneration paid to an employee to compensate for what he would have earned had he not been the victim of discrimination.the code requires that employers withhold taxes from remuneration paid to an employee for services performed by an employee for his employer,id.a income tax,or for remuneration for any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him,id.a,b fica tax.the term service performed means not only work actually done but the entire relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer.soc.sec.bd.nierotko,
both noel back and front pay were calculated with express reference to his employment relationship with the state and to all the wages and benefits that would have accrued absent the state unlawful discrimination these amounts are wages beca
