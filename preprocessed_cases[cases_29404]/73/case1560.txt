appellants steven goldman and azita etaati the goldmans seek a refund of interest they paid in on a state income tax deficiency for the tax year.while they do not contest the tax owed for,which was increased due to their participation in a disallowed tax shelter,they contend the california franchise tax board ftb should have suspended the accrual of interest on the deficiency.the trial court found the goldmans ineligible for interest suspension,denied their motion for summary judgment,and granted summary judgment for the ftb.we affirm.
resolution of this appeal involves the interplay of two provisions of the revenue and taxation code section provides that,with certain enumerated exceptions,the accrual of interest owed on unpaid tax obligations is normally suspended months after a taxpayer files a timely tax return,subds.a and b.this case deals with an enumerated exception to interest suspension that involves section.section,subdivision e specifies that interest suspension does not take effect for taxpayers affected by a federal audit who are required to report a change or correction to their federal taxes to the ftb pursuant to section,subdivision a.
section,subdivision a requires taxpayers to report the result of a change or correction to a federal tax return within six months after the date of each final federal determination,but only if the federal change or correction increase s the amount of state income tax payable.resolution of this appeal turns on construction and interpretation of the last sentence of section,subdivision a that says a taxpayer must notify the state of federal changes that increase the amount of tax payable.as we shall explain,the phrase refers to the effect of a federal audit on a taxpayer return filed for a given year,and the taxpayer obligation to notify the state does not turn on whether the taxpayer still owes the state money after the conclusion of a federal audit.thus,the goldmans obligation to provide the state notice was not extinguished because they filed amended returns and overpaid their ultimate state income tax liability before conclusion of the federal audit,and interest on the amount of their increased state tax liability was not suspended.
background 
the goldmans,a married couple,filed their state income tax return for the tax year on or about april.their return reported taxable income of and a tax liability of.in january,the goldmans were notified that the internal revenue service irs was going to examine their federal income tax return filed for the tax year.in august,the goldmans accountant requested that the ftb hold its examination of their income tax return in abeyance until the irs examination was complete.
in october the legislature enacted the voluntary compliance initiative vci,which allowed taxpayers who invested in potentially abusive tax shelters to file amended returns that disclosed all income without regard for the effects of the tax shelters,pay the resulting tax and interest and thereby possibly avoid penalties.et the vci was effective from january through april,subd.b.the goldmans elected to participate in the vci,and on or around april,before the federal examination of their return concluded,they filed an amended return for the tax year.because the amended vci return reversed in capital losses from a transaction claimed on the goldmans income tax return,it reported increased taxable income of and an additional in state tax liability.the goldmans stated the increased taxable income was due to a change in their federal adjusted gross income reported on line of their state income tax return.the option they selected under the vci allowed them to seek a refund of amounts reported and paid with the vci return.they made a payment of with the vci return and subsequent installment payments between july and april to satisfy the additional tax and interest shown on the vci return.as of april,the goldmans paid in interest.
in november,the goldmans filed a federal closing agreement for tax year with the irs.the closing agreement reflected federal tax adjustments of disallowed capital losses from the tax avoidance transactions that figured in their state vci return.the federal adjustments increased the goldmans income by for federal tax purposes,and reflected adjusted gross income of,rather than as stated in their vci return.
the goldmans filed a second amended state tax return for the tax year on or around april,seeking a refund of excess taxes and interest reported and paid with the vci return.the refund claim had two components.first,the goldmans sought a refund of in interest they claimed should have been suspended pursuant to section.second,they claimed a tax refund due to the federal adjusted gross income reflected in the closing agreement that reduced the adjusted gross income reported in their vci return by.
the ftb agreed the goldmans were entitled to a refund for overpaid taxes,but it denied their claim for a refund of interest on the ground that they were subject to an exception to interest suspension contained in section,subdivision f.the state board of equalization sbe upheld the ftb ruling in a summary decision.
the goldmans then filed this action.following the filing of for summary judgment,the trial court granted the ftb motion for summary judgment and denied the goldmans motion.the goldmans filed a timely notice of appeal.

when we construe a statute we are required to ascertain the intent of the legislature to effectuate the purpose of the law.we start with the statutory language and give the words used their ordinary meaning.if the language is clear and unambiguous,we apply it and look no further.if the language supports more than one reasonable interpretation we may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.using these extrinsic aids,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.people bojorquez th.
ii.the statutory framework 
under california law,interest normally accrues on all unpaid or underpaid personal income tax from the date the tax is due until it is paid in full,subd.a.however,interest accrual is suspended if the state does not provide a notice to the taxpayer specifically stating the taxpayer liability and the basis of the liability within a specified notification period,subd.a.the generally applicable notification period is the month period following the later of a the date on which the return is filed or the original unextended due date for the return,subd.b.
the notification period is extended in certain circumstances that afford the ftb more time to notify the taxpayer of a tax deficiency before interest on the underpayment will be suspended.under section,subdivision e,the notification period is extended when a taxpayer is required to report federal tax adjustments to the ftb under section,subdivision a.section,subdivision a,requires taxpayers to report within six months after the date of each final federal determination when federal tax adjustments increase the amount of income tax payable to the state,subd.a.
for a taxpayer who must report federal tax adjustments under section,the extended notification period is either one year after the ftb is notified of the federal adjustments,provided such notice is filed within six months of the final federal determination or if the federal adjustment is reported more than six months after the final federal determination,the notification period ends two years after notice is filed,subd.e.in both situations,the interest suspension period begins the day after the extended notification period ends,subd.e.
iii.the trial court ruling 
the trial court granted summary judgment for the ftb on two grounds.it first concluded there is no interest suspension where,as here,the ftb never issued a deficiency notice but the taxpayer independently filed an amended return reporting additional taxes after the close of the notification period.the court observed that section is silent as to the calculation of a suspension period where the taxpayer never receives a formal notice but files an amended return after the notification period.it acknowledged the ftb has an internal policy ftb notice of treating amended returns as if they were notice for purposes of determining interest suspension under section,but found that the result in this case was the same whether or not it followed that policy.
in the alternative,the court found that interest suspension was barred because the goldmans filed their amended return within the notification period as extended under section,subdivision e it is undisputed that the goldmans california taxable income for tax year was increased from to,as reflected in their second amended return.thus the goldmans were required to report the federal adjustment to california under section.in this case,because the goldmans filed their amended vci return within the notification period,as extended by subdivision e,they are not entitled to interest suspension.we agree that the notification period was extended in this case under section,subdivision e.since we will affirm on this ground,we need not address the goldmans other bases for reversal.
iv.analysis 
the goldmans contend that they are entitled to a refund of the interest paid on their taxes for the period between the date the taxes originally were due in and april,when the additional taxes were paid,because when they paid the tax in april the notification period in section,subdivision a had lapsed and they were not taxpayers required by subdivision a of section to report a change or correction in their federal taxes,subd.e.the goldmans base this argument on their claim that taxes payable as used in section refers to money owed to the state at the time a federal audit concludes.since they filed the vci return and made a payment on account of taxes that was more than they ultimately owed for the tax year before the federal audit concluded,the goldmans claim the federal determination did not increase their state taxes payable.we disagree.
the goldmans construction of section is not supported by the plain language of the statute,the context of the income tax scheme,and the ftb interpretation of the taxpayer obligation to report the results of a federal audit.
section,subdivision a is two sentences long.the first sentence directs taxpayers to report changes or corrections to a federal tax return due to a federal examination within six months after the date of each final federal determination.the second sentence states that taxpayers need not report the federal changes unless they increase the amount of tax payable for any year.according to the goldmans construction,the second sentence of section,subdivision a qualifies the first so that changes need not be reported unless the taxpayer must pay more in taxes following the date of a final federal determination.but that is not what section says.the construction urged by the goldmans implies that unless,as it is used in the second sentence of section,subdivision a,refers to a final federal determination.however,by our reading,unless refers to federal changes or corrections that may increase state tax liability.in full,the sentence reads for any individual subject to income tax under part commencing with section,changes or corrections need not be reported unless they increase the amount of tax payable under part commencing with section for any year,subd.a.
in order to give the second sentence the construction urged by the goldmans one must read it to mean that federal changes need not be reported unless following the conclusion of a federal audit there is an increase in the tax payable.but w ords may not be inserted in a statutory provision under the guise of interpretation.kirkwood bank of america nat.trust and sav.ass cal d.nothing in the text of section,subdivision a leads us to conclude that the ultimate sentence modifies the former in the way urged by the goldmans.a plain reading of it leads us to conclude that federal changes to a tax return must be reported whenever they change the tax payable by a state taxpayer.the context of the state income tax scheme supports our interpretation.
section is procedural.it is among the provisions of the revenue and taxation code that effect the administration of the tax laws.revenue and taxation code,part administration of franchise and income tax laws stats,ch.it does not by its terms create or extinguish a liability or compel a taxpayer to pay a deficient tax.see,mudd mccolgan cal d.there is nothing in the statutory scheme to suggest section is intended to confer substantive rights upon the taxpayer.rather,it specifies,for purposes of fixing the limitation period for the ftb to notice a deficiency,when the taxpayer must advise the ftb of the result of a federal audit.ordlock franchise tax board cal th,ordlock.
the goldmans construction would give section substantive import by making the reporting requirement following a federal audit subject to the taxpayer control.in situations such as this one,when the taxpayer files an amended return and pays taxes due before completion of the federal audit,the goldmans say there is no reporting requirement.in this scenario,the state would have to act to preserve its ability to collect interest by either notifying the taxpayer of a deficiency or opening investigation of the return during the notification period irrespective of a pending federal examination.but california income tax law is based largely upon federal income tax law,and an increase in a taxpayer federal tax liability will generally result in increased state tax liability.ordlock,supra,cal th at.state law provides that subject to exceptions,gross income,adjusted gross income,and taxable income for state tax purposes are defined as their equivalents for federal tax purposes.see,subd.a.thus,an increase in the amount of a taxpayer federal taxable income generally will signify an increase in the amount of his or her state taxable income.ordlock,supra,cal th at.
in apparent recognition of these equivalencies,the revenue and taxation code generally extends the time for the ftb to fix the amount of tax whenever the taxpayer files an amended return following a federal audit,and specifically allows the state an automatic extension to assess a deficiency whenever the taxpayer agrees to extend the federal deadline for examination.this statutory scheme contemplates the state use of information developed in the course of a federal audit so that the state,and its taxpayers as a whole,may thereby be saved both time and expense in the administration of the state tax laws.moreover,by state use of federal tax information,the interests of the particular taxpayer whose return is in question are served,in that he,too,is saved the time and expense of a dual audit of his personal and business affairs,and may in some cases ascertain errors in his state tax return sufficient to justify a claim for refund.rko teleradio pictures,franchise tax bd.d.the goldmans construction of section,subdivision a frustrates this purpose.
there are also aspects peculiar to the vci scheme that influence our consideration of what it means when a federal determination increases the amount of state taxes payable as they relate to interest suspension.under the vci option selected by the goldmans,the computation of any penalty that may be assessed is based upon the difference between the amount of tax shown on the original return and the correct amount of tax for the taxable year without regard for what may be reported on an amended return,subd.b b.it would
