kevin conway the taxpayer appeals the court of federal claims decision dismissing his suit for the refund of penalties and interest,holding that the internal revenue service irs deficiency assessment was timely and rejecting the taxpayer other contentions.conway united states,fed.cl.we affirm.
background 
in,the taxpayer,a professional actor,acquired a interest in a limited partnership known as stevens recycling associates the partnership for.the taxpayer did so after a conversation with david alter,a new york lawyer who had represented the taxpayer and provided investment advice.alter told the taxpayer that he and several other members of his law firm were planning to invest in the partnership and recommended that the taxpayer invest as well.alter did not provide the taxpayer with the partnership offering memorandum nor any other document relating to the partnership at the time.although a tax opinion about the project was prepared by another new york law firm,the taxpayer did not see it and apparently did not know of its existence until after he invested.the taxpayer made no independent investigation of the partnership.
on its tax return,the partnership claimed a investment in property eligible for a qualified investment credit,a investment in property eligible for a business energy credit,and in ordinary losses.on his federal tax return,the taxpayer reported adjusted gross income of and,pursuant to his investment in the partnership,claimed a business deduction of,an investment tax credit of,and a business energy credit of.altogether,the taxpayer used his investment in the partnership to reduce his income tax liability by,based on his investment of.
under the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of,a tax partnership is treated as a entity.although administrative and judicial proceedings concerning partnership items are conducted at the partnership level,the partnership is merely a entity,and all items of income,deduction,and credit are allocated among the partners in their individual capacities,id.the tax matters partner designated by the partnership agreement represents the partnership in judicial proceedings,id.a,but the individual limited partners,the taxpayer here are also deemed to be parties to the proceeding,id.c.the irs uses a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa to propose audit adjustments to a tax partnership.the statute provides that issues concerning the tax liability with respect to partnership items are generally to be determined by a judicial proceeding at the partnership level.id.
in following a examination,the irs issued an fpaa for the partnership for the tax year.the fpaa determined that the partnership had not invested in any property that qualified for either the investment tax credit or for the business energy credit.further,the partnership reported loss was disallowed in its entirety because it has not been established that the partnership incurred a loss in a trade or business or in an activity entered into for profit or with respect to property held for the production of income.conway,fed.cl.at.the fpaa explained 
it has been determined that the partnership has improperly taken deductions or credits based on overvaluation of assets and based on positions taken for which substantial authority was lacking.it has also been determined that the transactions were entered into for tax motivated reasons and adjustments to the partnership items were due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations.
id.at.the fpaa also advised that p enalties based on the above transactions are applicable at the individual partner level and will be raised in separate proceedings at the partner level following the present partnership proceedings.id.
on july,the tax matters partner filed a petition for readjustment under on behalf of the partnership in the united states tax court with respect to the adjustments set forth in the fpaa.the petition was entitled petition for readjustment of partnership items under code section.the case was assigned docket number.
on february,an opinion and judgment were signed by the presiding tax court judge and entered that same day on the tax court docket.stevens recycling assocs.comm r,first decision.the tax court upheld the fpaa in all respects.however,the tax court judge inadvertently failed to affix an entered date to the face of the judgment as was the usual practice.as will be discussed below,the government argues that this omission rendered the decision ineffective because of the requirements of c.on june,the tax court,sua sponte,vacated the first decision and replaced it with stevens recycling assocs.comm r,june,second decision.the second decision was substantively identical to the first except that the second decision included an entered date.the second decision explained 
on february,through inadvertent clerical error,the court served on the parties a decision which did not bear the requisite entered date.accordingly,it is 
ordered that the decision served on february,is vacated and set aside.it is further 
ordered and decided that the following statement shows the adjustments to the partnership items of stevens recycling associates for the taxable years of,and.
id.the tax court provided no further explanation for its decision.
section d established the limitations period for assessing the tax and penalties against the individual partners.section d provided 
if notice of a final partnership administrative adjustment with respect to any taxable year is mailed to the tax matters partner,the running of the period specified in subsection a as modified by other provisions of this section shall be suspended 
for the period during which an action may be brought under section and,if an action with respect to such administrative adjustment is brought during such period,until the decision of the court in such action becomes final,and 
for year thereafter.
d emphasis added in other words,the limitations period was one year after the decision of the tax court bec a me final.a decision became final upon the expiration of the appeal period,id.a,which was days after the decision of the tax court was entered,id.
on august,the irs made an individual assessment of tax against the taxpayer for in the amount of.on august,more than a year and days after the first decision but less than a year and days after the second decision,the irs sent the taxpayer a notice of deficiency determining that he was liable for negligence and overstatement penalties under a and of the internal revenue code of.between august,and november,underpayment interest was assessed against the taxpayer.on january,the commissioner assessed negligence penalties in the amount of and valuation overstatement penalties in the amount of against the taxpayer.the taxpayer paid all assessments,interest,and penalties.
the taxpayer filed a timely administrative claim for refund,which was denied on april.he filed a complaint in the court of federal claims on december,claiming a refund of both the underpayment assessments and the penalties 
the government contention was that by virtue of a decision of the tax court could not be entered until it had been rendered,and that a decision could not be rendered until a decision was issued bearing an entered date.thus,the government concluded,the assessment was timely because a decision had not been rendered until the second decision issued bearing an entered date.the taxpayer made two contentions that are relevant to this appeal first,he contended that the first decision was properly entered on february,and thus became final on may.he thus concluded that the statute of limitations in d ran from the first decision of the tax court and thus had expired on may,so that the notice of deficiency,issued on august,was untimely.second,he contended that,even if the notice of deficiency were considered timely,the penalties were improperly imposed.he argued that he had relied in good faith on alter professional advice,so that the negligence penalty under a was improperly imposed.the taxpayer also argued that he had had good faith basis for the overvaluation,so that the commissioner should have waived the overstatement penalty pursuant to e,which provided that the commissioner may waive an overstatement assessment on a showing by the taxpayer that there was a reasonable basis for the overvaluation claimed on the return and that such claim was made in good faith.e.the government moved for summary judgment on both the timeliness of the assessment and the propriety of the penalties.the taxpayer cross moved for summary judgment on timeliness but opposed summary judgment on the penalties.
the court of federal claims granted the government motion and denied the taxpayer.conway united states,fed.cl.at.it determined that the statute of limitations began to run not on the date the first decision was recorded in the tax court docket but on the date of the second decision.id.at.it noted that d measured the limitation on assessments against and notices of deficiency on partners from the date that the the decision of the court becomes final.d.tax court decisions become final,according to a and,days after the decision of the court is entered unless a notice of appeal is filed.however,the court of federal claims held that a decision could not be entered until it had been rendered,in accordance with c,which provided 
a decision of the tax court except a decision dismissing a proceeding for lack of jurisdiction shall be held to be rendered upon the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered into the records of the tax court or in the case of an action brought under section the code section under which the partnership action was brought the date of the court order entering the decision.if the tax court dismisses a proceeding for reasons other than lack of jurisdiction and is unable from the record to determine the amount of the deficiency determined by the secretary,or if the tax court dismisses a proceeding for lack of jurisdiction,an order to that effect shall be entered in the records of the tax court,and the decision of the tax court shall be held to be rendered upon the date of such entry.
c emphases added.the court of federal claims held that,while the tax court did not cite a source of law when it vacated the first decision 
it may fairly be assumed that it was c that prompted the court to proceed as it did.the tax c ourt,in other words,evidently read as requiring the issuance of a dated bearing an entered order to satisfy the statute requirement as to when a decision in a partnership proceeding under qualifies as a rendered decision.
conway,fed.cl.at.the court of federal claims agreed with this interpretation.id.at.
the court of federal claims noted that distinguished between deficiency determinations,for which the rendering date was the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered in the records of the tax court,and proceedings under,for which the rendering date was the date of the court order entering the decision.the court of federal claims held that,because these two provisions used different language,they must be construed differently.id.in cases,the court noted,the date that the decision became final and from which the limitations period began to run,was the date the order was entered into the records of the tax court.in partnership cases,however,the court held that the language the date of the court order entering the decision required that there be a date of entry on the order for it to be validly entered.thus,the court of federal claims concluded,the first decision did not cause the limitations period to begin to run because it lacked an entered date.only the second decision,by which the assessment was timely,caused the limitations period to begin.id.
the court of federal claims alternatively held that 
even if this court were to disagree with the tax court interpretation of,that difference of opinion would not justify our characterizing the tax court order of june,as a legal nullity and on that basis directing that the commissioner notice of deficiency be set aside.so long as the tax court had a valid basis in law for proceeding as it did,considerations of comity would compel us to respect the judgment that it entered.
the court of federal claims further held that the penalties were lawfully assessed.the court noted that,because the reduction in his taxable income was almost twice as great as his investment in the partnership,any reasonable person concerned with compliance with the tax law would have questioned whether this investment was a deal too good to be true.id.at.the court found that the taxpayer had been negligent in taking the deductions because he had done no more than act on an investment tip from alter,had not read the offering memorandum or any other document associated with the partnership,and had made no independent inquiry.id.at.finally,the court of federal claims held that the commissioner acted within his discretion in assessing the overstatement penalty because the taxpayer lacked a good faith basis for the overvaluation he had simply relied on alter tip.absent some reasonable basis for accepting that tip as informed advice,the taxpayer reliance simply amounts to an act of blind faith,not good faith,the court of federal claims concluded.id.at.
the taxpayer timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
this case was decided on cross motions for summary judgment,which we review without deference.shell petroleum,united states.
section d provided that the limitations period for the assessment of taxes after a proceeding did not begin to run until the decision of the tax court bec a me final.section a provided that,with exceptions not relevant here,a decision of the tax court shall become final upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a notice of appeal,if no such notice has been duly filed within such time.section provided that r eview of a decision of the tax court shall be obtained by filing a notice of appeal within days after the decision of the tax court is entered.
the parties have divergent positions.the taxpayer argues that the first decision was final for purposes of appeal.in support of this contention,the taxpayer cites the legislative history of and rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.he points out that originally all three relevant provisions dealing with finality of tax court proceedings a,and c made the render ing of the decision the relevant date for determining finality but the amendment of rule a of federal rules of appellate procedure made the relevant date the entr y of the tax court decision.accordingly,congress changed to make the date the decision of the tax court is entered the relevant date for determining the appeal period.thus,the taxpayer argues,the date upon which a tax court decision is rendered ceased to have any continuing significance.appellants br.at.the taxpayer also contends that the tax court lacked the authority to vacate the first decision and replace it with the second because after a decision becomes final,the tax court can not modify it.accordingly,the assessment occurred more than one year after the tax court decision became final and was thus untimely.
the government,on the other hand,urges that finality is to be determined by reference to c and that a decision of the tax court had not been entered for the purpose of assessing the limitations period in d until a decision had been rendered,issued with an entered date.like the court of federal claims,the government asserts that determined when a tax court decision was validly entered.section provided a decision of the tax court shall be held to be rendered in the case of an action brought under section on the date of the court order entering the decision.the government contends that the language the date of the court order rendering the decision required that the order bear an entered date,which the first decision did not.the first decision therefore did not comply with the statute.the tax court was therefore authorized to vacate that decision and enter a new decision that complied with the statute.only with the second decision did the limitations period begin to run.thus the notice of deficiency,the gov
