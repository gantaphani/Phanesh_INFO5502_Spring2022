this case presents questions regarding how the state board of equalization board may assess the value of an electric power plant for purposes of property taxation.the issue is complicated by the circumstance that,with exceptions not relevant here,assessors may not include the value of intangible assets and rights in the value of taxable property.cal,art.xiii,roehm county of orange cal d roehm.in this case,the power company purchased emission reduction credits ercs credits the company had to purchase to obtain authorization to construct the plant and to operate it at certain emission levels.all parties agree these ercs constitute intangible rights for property taxation purposes.however,they dispute whether the board improperly taxed the ercs when it assessed the power plant.this dispute turns on our construction of revenue and taxation code section,subdivisions d and e,and section,subdivision c hereinafter sometimes sections d,e,and c 
sections c and d prohibit the direct taxation of certain intangible assets and rights,including the ercs in this case.however,in assessing taxable property under section e,the board may assum e the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.the key issue is whether section,subdivisions d and e are mutually exclusive provisions,as the court of appeal held,or whether they can be applied together.we conclude that subdivisions d and e can be applied together.resolution of this issue determines the validity of the board assessment of the power plant.
in this case,the board used two methods of assessing the power plant,a replacement cost method and an income approach.with the replacement cost method,the board estimated the cost of replacing the assets of the power plant,tit.because ercs are necessary to put the power plant to beneficial use,the board included the estimated cost of replacing the ercs when it valued the plant.the issue is whether the board may include the estimated cost of replacing the ercs in using the replacement cost method.we conclude that the board directly and improperly taxed the power company ercs when it added their replacement cost to the power plant taxable value.
with the income approach,the board estimated the amount of income the property is expected to yield over its life and determined the present value of that amount,tit.the issue is whether the board was required to attribute a portion of the plant income stream to the ercs and deduct that value from the overall income estimate prior to taxation.we conclude that the board was not required to deduct a value attributable to the ercs under an income approach.there was no credible showing that there is a separate stream of income related to enterprise activity or even a separate stream of income at all that is attributable to the ercs in this case.
facts and procedural history 
elk hills power,llc elk hills,is a delaware limited liability company that owns and operates an independent electric power plant in kern county.elk hills brought this action under section,subdivision a,to recover property taxes paid to the county of kern county during the period from and.elk hills alleged that the county improperly added an increment of value to elk hills tax assessment that directly and impermissibly taxed its ercs.elk hills had purchased these ercs to gain authorization to construct the power plant and to operate it at specified emission levels.
in,elk hills had applied for a permit to construct and operate a power plant in tupman,california.tupman is in the jurisdiction of the san joaquin valley unified air pollution control district district,which ensures that proposed pollution sources comply with state air quality regulations.the california clean air act of stats,ch,california clean air act requires local air quality districts to achieve and maintain the state and federal ambient air quality standards and enforce all applicable provisions of state and federal law.health,subd.a.in the san joaquin valley,the district air quality rules forbid net increases in emissions above specified thresholds from new and modified stationary sources of all nonattainment pollutants.rules regs.of the san joaquin valley unified air pollution control,rule.
the district has also implemented an emission offset system to allow for the development of new pollution sources in compliance with local and federal mandates.health,rule.under the emission offset system,preexisting pollution sources that voluntarily reduce their emissions below the levels required by law are eligible to receive ercs.once ercs are certified by the district,they can be sold to other emission sources for profit or banked for future use.health,rule.the district requires new pollution sources to purchase ercs to offset future emissions before it will issue an authority to construct document.pub.resources code,subd.d rule.the use of surplus emission reductions,or credits,ensures the accommodation of economic growth without further increasing air emissions above the authorized levels of pollution,the baseline or cap for the air quality region.see health,subd.b,added by stats,ch,state air resources,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.
here,the district required elk hills to purchase five ercs at an approximate cost of million to offset the plant projected emissions of nitrogen oxides,sulfur oxides,and volatile organic compounds.the purchased ercs authorized elk hills to produce electricity at a continuous capacity of megawatts of power.elk hills surrendered its ercs to the district in and began producing electricity at specified levels.
the board used two different methods of unit valuation,the replacement cost approach and the income capitalization approach,to calculate the unitary value of the plant.power plants are valued using a system called unit taxation.itt world communications,city and county of san francisco cal d.the purpose of unit taxation is to capture the entire real value of the property when all of its component parts are considered together,as a unit,as opposed to valuing the component parts in isolation or at scrap value.id.at.it has long been recognized that public utility property can not be regarded as merely land,buildings,and other assets.rather,its value depends on the interrelation and operation of the entire utility as a unit.ibid.unit taxation prevents real but intangible value from escaping assessment and taxation by treating public utility property as a whole.ibid.
for the taxable years from to,the board used the replacement cost approach to assess the unit value of the plant.under the replacement cost approach,the tax assessor values the property by applying current prices to the labor and material components of a substitute property capable of yielding the same services and amenities and then applying a depreciation factor to arrive at a taxable base value,tit.for all five years in question,the board added a adjustment to account for the average replacement cost of the plant ercs.elk hills claimed that these annual additions directly and improperly assessed its ercs.
for the taxable years from to,the board also used the income capitalization approach to assess the unit value of the plant using the income approach,an appraiser estimates the future income stream a prospective purchaser could expect to receive from the enterprise and then discounts that amount to a present value by use of a capitalization rate.gte sprint communications county of alameda th,gte sprint see also,tit.in other words,the fair market value of an income producing property is estimated as the present value of the property expected future income stream.see union pacific state bd.of equalization cal d.the income approach may be called the capitalization method because capitalizing is the process of converting an income stream into a capital sum.ibid.elk hills claimed that the board improperly taxed its ercs because it failed to attribute a portion of the plant income stream to the ercs and deduct that value from the plant projected income stream prior to taxation.
during the property tax refund litigation,the parties filed for summary judgment.finding no triable issues of fact,the trial court denied elk hills motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment for the board and the county.the trial court found,in accordance with the parties stipulation,that ercs are intangible rights.it then determined that because ercs are intangible attributes of real property,they are subject to assessment under section,subdivision f section f.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court rulings on a different ground.it held that section,subdivisions d and e are mutually exclusive provisions,that ercs are necessary to the productive use of the taxable property at issue,that section d is inapplicable where intangible assets or rights are necessary,and that the board properly assum ed the presence of ercs under section e.
we granted elk hills petition for review to decide whether the court of appeal properly upheld the board valuation of elk hills power plant.
ii.discussion 
elk hills contends that the court of appeal construction of section d and section e is incorrect and that its holding contravenes the constitutional and statutory property tax exemption for intangible rights or assets.cal,art.xiii,c,d.on the other hand,the board and the county argue that the court of appeal correctly upheld the board decision because the board properly valued the plant at fair market value by assuming the presence of the ercs.cal,art.xiii,e.thus,we are presented with the question of how to properly value taxable property,with associated intangible assets,at fair market value.

taxation principles in general and related to intangible rights 
article xiii,section of the california constitution requires generally the assessment of property at fair market value.similarly,article xiii,section of the california constitution requires tax assessors to tax power plants at fair market value.fair market value means the amount of cash or its equivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other,and both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used,subd.a see de luz homes,county of san diego cal d.t he absence of an actual market for a particular type of property does not mean that it has no value or that it may escape from the constitutional mandate that all property shall be taxed in proportion to its value art.xiii,but only that the assessor must then use such pertinent factors as replacement costs and income analyses for determining valuation.citation.county of stanislaus county of stanislaus assessment appeals bd.d,county of stanislaus.thus,assessors have a constitutional mandate to tax all property at fair market value if not exempt under federal or state law.cal,xiii,county of stanislaus,supra,d at.
before,intangible property was subject to taxation under california law.roehm,supra,cal d at.in,former section of article xiii of the california constitution now,xiii,was amended to allow the legislature to tax,or to exempt from taxation,certain forms of intangible property,notes,debentures,capital stock,and bonds.in roehm,we found that the effect of the amendments was to make all nonenumerated forms of intangible property exempt from property taxation roehm,supra,cal d at.
sections c and implement article xiii,sections and of the california constitution.sections and are found in revenue and taxation code division,which governs property taxation.specifically,section is located in division,part.part sets out which types of property are exempt from the basic rule that a ll property in this state,not exempt under the laws of the united states or of this state,is subject to taxation.
section c broadly exempts intangible assets and rights from taxation.it provides,intangible assets and rights are exempt from taxation and,except as otherwise provided in the following sentence,the value of intangible assets and rights shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of taxable property.taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.c.
unlike section,section is located in division,part,which sets out general provisions that govern the construction of division as a whole.see t he general provisions hereinafter set forth govern the construction of this division.section defines full market value and full cash value,and provides rules of construction that harmonize section c tax exemption with the command that assessors tax all property at its fair market value.
section d provides in relevant part except as provided in subdivision e,for purposes of determining the full cash value or fair market value of any taxable property,all of the following shall apply the value of intangible assets and rights relating to the going concern value of a business using taxable property shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of the taxable property.if the principle of unit valuation is used to value properties that are operated as a unit and the unit includes intangible assets and rights,then the fair market value of the taxable property contained within the unit shall be determined by removing from the value of the unit the fair market value of the intangible assets and rights contained within the unit.
thus,section d and prevents the direct taxation of intangible rights and assets when assessors use methods of unit valuation.section d prevents tax assessors from including the value of intangible assets that relate to the going concern value of a business within the unit value of property prior to assessment.section d requires taxing authorities to value intangible assets and actively remove that value from a unit taxable base value,so that the intangibles are not directly taxed.the procedures in section d operate in conjunction with section e.d except as provided in subdivision e all of the following shall apply.
section e provides taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.
here,ercs fall within the class of intangibles described in section,subdivisions d and e.section d applies to intangible assets and rights relating to the going concern value of a business.the going concern value of a business means t he value of a commercial enterprise assets or of the enterprise itself as an active business with future earning power,as opposed to the liquidation value of the business or of its assets.black law dict.abridged ed,defining value.ercs fall within the class of intangibles described in section d because they are intangible assets that enable the functioning of the power plant,and therefore necessarily relate to the going concern value of that business under either definition of going concern value.
section e applies to intangible assets or rights that are necessary to the beneficial or productive use of taxable property.the parties stipulated that ercs are intangible rights that enable elk hills to emit pollutants at levels that would otherwise exceed legally allowable emission rates.thus,they agree that ercs are necessary for the power plant to operate at its projected maximum production capacity.furthermore,the district required elk hills to purchase ercs to get the initial authority to construct the plant.consequently,section e applies in this case moreover,because power plants are valued as a unit,section d is also applicable.
the key question in this case is whether the application of section e,in light of the opening language preamble of section d,renders section d inoperable.the preamble states except as provided in subdivision e all of the following shall apply.d.relying on this language,the board and the county argue that subdivisions d and e are mutually exclusive provisions and can not both be implemented,and that because subdivision e clearly applies,subdivision d can not apply in this case.elk hills responds that subdivisions d and e must be harmonized and applied together or intangible assets will be directly taxed in violation of section c.the court of appeal concluded that subdivisions d and e are mutually exclusive provisions and thus upheld the board assessment under both the replacement cost and income stream approach.
settled principles of statutory construction mandate that t he statute plain meaning controls the court interpretation unless its words are ambiguous.citations.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citation.reid google,cal th.moreover,every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.stafford los angeles county employees retirement bd.cal d.
the language of section d preamble,except as provided in subdivision e all of the following shall apply,permits more than one reasonable interpretation.on its face,this language might mean that subdivision e applies to the complete exclusion of subdivision d,but it might also mean that the principles in subdivision d should be construed so that they do not conflict with subdivision e.because section is ambiguous as to the applicability of subdivision d when subdivision e applies,we turn to the statute structure,purpose,and legislative history.these extrinsic sources,combined with the case law that directly preceded the enactment of sections c and,subdivisions d and e,show that subdivisions d and e contain nonconflicting principles that must be applied together.
legislative history of sections d and e and c 
in october,governor pete wilson signed the omnibus property tax reform act of into law.the act clarified the property tax treatment of intangibles by adding subdivisions d and e to section,and subdivision c to section.stats,ch.
the legislative history supports the conclusion that section,subdivisions d and e apply together.a senate report analyzing the enacting bill stated that since most of the property tax is based in the constitution,most of what we know about the property tax comes from the courts.if courts agree that these changes are merely clarifying,then they make no change to the law.revenue taxation,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.the legislative analysis expressly referred to five published appellate decisions that all relied on our seminal case,roehm,supra,cal d,and its progeny.revenue taxation,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,relying on roehm,these cases applied the principles that would later be embodied in section,subdivisions d and e,in harmony.gte sprint,supra,th at,service america,supra,th at shubat sutter county assessment appeals bd.th,shubat county of orange orange county assessment appeals bd.th,county of orange county of los angeles county of los angeles assessment appeals bd.th,county of los angeles.in fact,the principles contained in subdivisions d and e originated in roehm.
in roehm,we addressed a challenge to a county decision to assess a taxpayer general liquor license.we held that the county improperly levied a tax on the license because the liquor license was of intangible value,which was not subject to ad valorem taxation as personal property.roehm,supra,cal d at.first,we noted that article xiii,former section now of the california constitution authorized the legislature to provide for the taxation of certain forms of intangible property only,specifically that enumerated in the constitutional provision.roehm,at.we then noted that the legislature had affirmatively exempted all but one of the constitutionally taxable intangibles solvent credits from direct taxation when it passed former section roehm,at.finally,we counseled that our interpretation was supported by the need for an administrable state tax system.id.at.as the variety of intangible assets expanded in the and,the extent to which those assets were either evading taxation or,when found,were being subjected to inordinate and unjust burdens had grown to be a real evil in the structure and operation of our state laws on local taxation.id.at.thus,we concluded that the county ad valorem taxation of roehm intangible asset was statutorily and constitutionally impermissible,and contrary to sound public policy roehm,at.the main principle supporting the roehm decision is now reflected in section d the value of intangible assets and rights relating to the going concern value of a business using taxable property shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of the taxable property.
however,we also stated intangible values that can not be separately taxed as property may be reflected in the valuation of taxable property.thus,in determining the value of property,assessing authorities may take into consideration earnings derived therefrom,which may depend upon the possession of intangible rights and privileges that are not themselves regarded as a separate class of taxable property.roehm,supra,cal d at.this principle is reflected in section e.roehm provides no indication that this second principle in any way supersedes the prohibition on taxing intangible assets.indeed,by holding that the assessment improperly included the value of the liquor license,roehm suggests that to the extent this second principle applies to the assessment of properly taxable property,the value of related intangible assets simply has not been taxed.
fourteen years later,we reaffirmed the principles set forth in roehm in michael todd county of los angeles cal d michael todd.in michael todd,a taxpayer corporation argued that the property tax assessment of motion picture film negatives could not be enhanced by the presence of the motion picture copyright and that consequently the film could only be valued at scrap or salvage value.id.at.in rejecting the taxpayer position,we explained that market value for assessment purposes is the value of property when put to beneficial or productive use it is not merely whatever residual value may remain after the property is demolished,melted down,or otherwise reduced to its constituent elements.ibid.because t he sole beneficial or productive use of the negative film of a motion picture is for making prints thereof for exhibition,whether such prints be sold or leased,the assessor was permitted to value the film negatives at its beneficial and productive use.ibid.thus,the assessor could properly assume the existence of a motion picture copyright to determine the fair market value of the film negatives,without assessing the copyright itself.id.at.
roehm and michael todd show that although intangible rights and assets are not directly taxable,much of the value of taxable assets can be intangible in nature.for example,a vacant lot has value not as a vacant lot but by virtue of its intangible right to hold a structure or to serve another purpose.revenue taxation,analysis of bill,supra,as amended.roehm provided a sensible caveat to the prohibition against taxing intangibles where the beneficial or productive use of tangible property depend s upon the possession of intangible rights and privileges that are not themselves regarded as a separate class of taxable property,an assessor must assume the presence of those intangible rights.roehm,supra,cal d at.if assessors could not assume the presence of intangible assets,then much of the fair market value of taxable property would escape taxation,in violation of the california constitution.michael todd,supra,cal d at.
after roehm,courts recognized that even if intangible assets are necessary to the beneficial or productive use of taxable property,the inquiry did not end simply with a finding that section e applied,as the court of appeal held here.instead,courts proceeded to determine whether the value of the intangible assets was improperly subsumed in the taxation.if so,those courts instructed assessors to go back and attribute a portion of the income stream to account for the value of the intangible asset,and remove that value.see gte sprint,supra,th at,board must exclude value of intangible assets when assessing tangible property it can not assume unit valuation,which,when calculated by income method,only assesses the intangible values as they enhance the tangible property service america,supra,th at assessor erred in using entire income flow earned by franchisee ballpark concession company large part of income earned based on enterprise value as distinguished from value of use of property shubat,supra,th at assessor erred in failing to exclude value of cable television company intangible assets,right to conduct business,subscriber list,going concern county of orange,supra,th at assessor valuation of cable television system failed to exclude value of company intangibles that enhanced value of business,existing franchises,licenses to construct,goodwill county of los angeles,supra,th at assessment of airport car rental concession based on capitalized fees measured as percentage of income from airport area operations improperly included value of right to do business intangibles.
as noted,the legislature codified roehm and its progeny by adding subdivision c to section,and subdivisions d and e to section.because section d and e,and section c,were added at the same time for the same purpose,they should be read consistently.section c contains three clauses,and their interrelation sheds light on the proper reading of the preamble to section d.while the second and third clauses track principles contained in section,subdivisions d and e,the first clause provides a blanket tax exemption for intangible assets intangible assets and rights are exempt from taxation c.this broad prohibition is only contained in section and not section,because section falls within the part of the revenue and taxation code describing property tax exemptions.on the other hand,section falls within the part of the code that provides rules that govern the construction of property taxation as a whole.
section c second clause tracks the language of the preamble to d as well as the contents of section d.however,it is different in a respect that is key to unlocking the relationship between section,subdivisions d and e.e xcept as otherwise provided in the following sentence,the value of intangible assets and rights shall not enhance or be reflected in the value of taxable property.c,italics added.t he following sentence refers to section c third clause,which tracks the language of section e taxable property may be assessed and valued by assuming the presence of intangible assets or rights necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use.c.
looking to the second clause,the phrase except as otherwise provided in the following sentence governs the relationship between the principles contained in clauses two and three.c,italics added.this language does not indicate that when clause three applies,clause two does not.it simply means that assessors can not tax the value of intangible assets directly clause two,but that principle does not prevent assessors from assuming the presence of intangible assets when valuing taxable property clause three.in other words,assessors must do their constitutional duty to assess taxable property at fair market value clause three while making sure that the value of intangible assets is not improperly subsumed within the value of taxable property clause two.thus,section c statutory structure is consistent with roehm,which also forbids the direct taxation of intangibles,but allows the value of taxable property to be enhanced from scrap value to fair market value when assessors assume the presence of necessary intangibles.roehm,supra,cal d at.
with this reading of section c in mind,the meaning of section d preamble becomes apparent.except as provided in subdivision e,can not mean that when section subdivision e applies,subdivision d does not because that reading would be inconsistent with our interpretation of section.rather,it means that section d can not negate a tax assessor constitutional duty to value taxable property at fair market value in accordance with the principle laid out in section e.
from the above legislative history and statutory language,several points emerge.first,roehm and section c make clear that even if an intangible asset fits within the scope of section e,that is,its presence is necessary to put the taxable property to beneficial or productive use c,that asset still may not be directly taxed.second,although subdivision d is limited by the phrase e xcept as provided in subdivision e,section,subdivisions d and e are mutually exclusive only in this limited sense if the assessor assumes the presence of an intangible asset necessary to put taxable property to beneficial use within the meaning of subdivision e,and does no more than this,then by definition the assessor has not violated subdivision d prohibition on the value of intangible assets relating to the going concern value of a business enhancing the value of the taxable property.but there is no reason why an intangible asset can not enhance both taxable property and the going concern value of the business on which the property resides.the case law recognizes that assessors,if they are valuing taxable property according to the income produced,may have to apportion income between enterprise activity and the property itself.see county of stanislaus,supra,d at.
third,section d is a stopgap provision that requires assessors to remove intangible assets that are improperly included in the unitary value of property prior to assessment.see,gte sprint,supra,th at.thus,even when an intangible asset enhances the value of taxable property pursuant to section e,to the extent that the unitary valuation reflects a direct valuation of the asset itself,or includes income appropriately attributed to enterprise value,section d requires the removal of such values.
finally,since the cases all apply the concepts embodied in section,subdivisions d,and e together,the statute should be interpreted the same way.see cases cited,ante,at.thus,the operative principles in section subdivisions d and e do not conflict.section d prevents the value of intangible assets from enhancing or being reflected in the valuation of taxable property.section e allows assessors to enhance the valuation of taxable property,not by including the value of intangible assets in the valuation see d,but simply by assuming the presence of intangible assets when valuing the taxable property put to beneficial or productive use.while the value of the taxable property is enhanced,it is not enhanced by the value of intangible assets.that would violate section d as well as section c.rather,it is enhanced by the presence of intangible assets.
on a motion for summary judgment,the court must acknowledge that c exempts intangible assets and rights from taxation.if the plaintiff taxpayer presents evidence that the value of intangible assets contributed in some way to the unit valuation of its taxable property,the court must first determine if those intangible assets were necessary to the beneficial or productive use of the property,because if they are not,then they could not have been taken into account in the valuation,subds.d,e.
second,if the intangible assets are necessary to the beneficial or productive use of the taxable property,the court must determine whether the plaintiff has put forth credible evidence that the fair market value of those assets has been improperly subsumed in the valuation.if so,then the valuation violates section d,which prohibits an assessor from using the value of intangible rights and assets to enhance the value of taxable property,and the fair market value of those assets must be removed pursuant to section d.
accordingly,legislative history,case law,and the structure of the applicable tax code provisions demonstrate that the court of appeal erred in concluding that section e operates to the complete exclusion of section d.since d has mandatory provisions that apply to unit valuation cases,it was an error not to apply that provision here.therefore,it is necessary to address what effect section d has on the board assessment under both its replacement cost and income stream valuations.
d.the board improperly assessed elk hills ercs under the replacement cost approach 
the board used the replacement cost approach to approximate the fair market value of the power plant at the total cost of obtaining a substitute property capable of yielding the same services and amenities,tit.for each of the taxable years from to,the board added a adjustment to the replacement cost of the plant to account for the replacement cost of ercs.under section d and section c,the board improperly taxed elk hills ercs under the replacement cost approach.
section d requires assessors to remove the fair market value of intangible assets from the fair market value of the taxable unit prior to assessment so that the intangibles are not directly taxed.in a replacement cost assessment,the fair market value of the ercs is the replacement cost of the ercs.here,the board included the value of the ercs in the base value of the unit when it added their replacement cost to the replacement cost of the plant.
the board argues that its adjustment for ercs and other soft costs is not direct taxation,but rather an appropriate assessment of the plant,assuming the presence of the intangibles that are necessary to its productive use.however,there is a meaningful difference between assuming the presence of an intangible asset and adding value to the unit whole to account for the presence of that intangible asset.see,shubat,supra,th at while we agree intangible values may be reflected in the value of a possessory interest,it does not follow such values are subsumed as a matter of law.
further,the board own assessment manual states sections e and c do not authorize adding an increment to the value of taxable property to reflect the value of intangible assets.bd.of equalization,assessor handbook,section advanced appraisal,ch,assessor handbook,italics added.thus,assuming the presence of intangibles is permitted.see,los angeles smsa limited partnership state bd.of equalization th,los angeles smsa valuation of cellular telephone company taxable property operating at its highest and best use assumes presence of fcc license.however,including the fair market value of an intangible asset within the unit whole amounts to the direct taxation of those assets.see,county of los angeles,supra,th at.
the board also attempts to distinguish ercs as different in kind from the intangibles that required a deduction in other cases.see case cited,ante,at.however,this argument is unavailing in the context of the board direct taxation of an intangible asset under the replacement cost approach.intangible rights are exempt from direct taxation whether or not they are necessary and whether or not they enhance the going concern value of a business.see c.although the board was permitted to assume the presence of the ercs in valuing elk hills taxable property as an operating power plant e,it impermissibly added the fair market value of the ercs to the unit whole as part of its replacement cost valuation,and then failed to deduct that value prior to assessment.d,in failing to deduct the fair market value of the ercs,the board directly taxed elk hills intangible right in violation of section c.accordingly,the court of appeal erred in upholding the board valuation of elk hills plant under the replacement cost approach.
e.the board properly assumed the presence of the ercs under the income capitalization approach 
elk hills argues that when the board calculated the plant unitary value,it failed to attribute a portion of the plant income to its ercs and deduct that amount from the plant projected income stream.in other words,elk hills claims that the board failed to apply section d to its income stream analysis.section d requires the assessor to remov e from the value of the unit the fair market value of the intangible assets and rights contained within the unit.however,under an income stream approach,not all intangible rights have a quantifiable fair market value that must be deducted.there are two lines of income capitalization cases that illustrate when a section d deduction is and is not required.
in the first line of cases,as in this case,courts have upheld assessments that properly assumed the presence of intangibles assets necessary to the productive use of taxable property without deducting a value for intangible assets.see,michael todd,supra,cal d at los angeles smsa,supra,th at american sheds,county of los angeles th.for example,in american sheds,the county assessment appeals board taxed a landfill under the income approach.american sheds,supra,th at.for the taxable years between and,the landfill use permit authorized operation at full capacity.in,the government restricted the landfill use to about percent of its previous capacity.accordingly,the tax assessment of the property was about percent lower than previous assessments.ibid.american sheds argued that the difference between the assessment of the landfill when it operated at percent capacity as opposed to percent capacity confirms that the board included the permits as a principal component of the property and its value.id.at.the court disagreed.it held that the board assessment was consistent with treating the intangibles as nontaxable,while recognizing the impact of their presence or absence on the beneficial use of the property,and consequently the amount of income it could yield.id.at.plaintiff evidence did not establish that the assessment appeals board improperly utilized or included for valuation the intangibles of the permits and related business enterprise.see also los angeles smsa,supra,th at board permissibly calculated cellular telephone company income stream without a deduction for the value of its fcc license fcc license merely enabled the telephone company to enhance the value of its tangible property.
the second line of cases disapproved assessments that failed to attribute a portion of a business income stream to the enterprise activity that was directly attributable to the value of intangible assets and deduct that value prior to assessment.see cases cited,ante,at.these cases illustrate the principle that although assessors may assume the presence of intangibles when considering the income stream derived from taxable property that is put to beneficial or productive use e,the value of intangibles that directly enhance that income stream can not be subsumed in the valuation of taxable property d,and must be deducted from the unit prior to assessment d.the difference is one of degree intangible rights like ercs merely allow for the taxable property to generate income when put to its beneficial or productive use.thus,their contribution to the income stream is indirect,whereas intangible assets like the goodwill of a business,customer base,and favorable franchise terms or operating contracts all make a direct contribut
