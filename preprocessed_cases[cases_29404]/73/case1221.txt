the estate of evelyn mcmorris appeals a tax court decision in favor of the commissioner of internal revenue.the tax court held that the commissioner properly considered an event occurring after the death of evelyn mcmorris in disallowing her estate deduction pursuant to a for payment of federal and state income taxes owed at the time of her death.exercising jurisdiction under a,we reverse and remand with directions to vacate the deficiency assessment at issue here and to recalculate any remaining unrelated deficiencies owing.
the facts are undisputed.donn mcmorris,evelyn husband,died in,and evelyn received shares of stock in nw transport service,from his estate.the stock was reported in donn estate tax return at an appraised value of per share as of the date of his death and that value became evelyn basis in the stock evelyn,through her conservator jerry mcmorris,entered into an agreement with nw transport to redeem the stock for approximately per share,payable over months at ten percent interest.
evelyn died in,a resident of colorado.in her federal estate tax return,her estate claimed deductions of and,respectively,for her federal and state income tax liabilities.federal income tax in the amount of and colorado income tax in the amount of actually were paid with evelyn individual tax returns.a large part of the income reported on evelyn income tax returns resulted from the gain on redemption of the nw transport stock.
in january,the commissioner issued a deficiency notice to donn estate disputing,among other things,the value of the nw transport stock.specifically,the commissioner valued the stock at per share.donn estate contested the commissioner determinations and,after lengthy negotiations,the parties reached a settlement in january for an increased value of the nw transport stock at per share as of donn death.this value became the new basis for the nw transport stock redeemed by evelyn.as a result of her increased basis,the taxable gain from evelyn redemption of the stock was eliminated and she realized a loss.
evelyn estate filed an amended federal individual income tax return seeking a refund of.the amended return reflected a loss from redemption of the nw transport stock and eliminated certain dividend income reported on the original return.meanwhile,evelyn estate was challenging a deficiency notice received in november concerning an unrelated gift deduction in the amount of in her estate tax return the estate contested the deficiency in tax court and that litigation was ongoing when evelyn amended federal income tax return was filed in january.
in march,the commissioner filed an amended answer in evelyn estate tax litigation,asserting an increased deficiency in estate taxes.according to the commissioner,the estate was no longer entitled to deduct evelyn federal and state individual income taxes because those liabilities were subject to refunds.indeed,the commissioner approved a refund of evelyn federal income taxes in,but the record filed with this court does not indicate that her estate filed an amended state income tax return or a protective refund claim with the colorado department of revenue.
evelyn estate later conceded the commissioner original deficiency determination in its entirety including disallowance of the gift deduction.however,the estate refused to accept the commissioner view that the estate deduction for evelyn income tax liabilities should be limited to the amount ultimately found to be due and owing by evelyn.the estate instead took the position that events may not be considered in determining the amount of its deduction for evelyn individual income tax liabilities because those liabilities were valid and enforceable claims against the estate at the time of evelyn death.unable to resolve their differences,the parties submitted the case to the tax court on a fully stipulated basis.
the tax court held that the estate deduction for evelyn federal income tax liability must be reduced by the amount actually refunded in.according to the tax court,it was proper for the commissioner to consider events occurring after evelyn death in calculating this deduction because the estate challenged evelyn individual income tax liability through her amended return.the tax court also held that the estate deduction for evelyn colorado income tax liability should be reduced to reflect the proper amount of tax after being adjusted downward as a result of her decreased federal taxable income.although the record revealed that evelyn estate had not filed an amended colorado income tax return and evelyn had not received a refund of any state income taxes,the tax court reasoned that nothing prevented the estate from seeking such a refund on evelyn behalf.the tax court determined there was an estate tax deficiency of based on the amounts set forth in the original notice of deficiency,and the increased deficiency arising from disallowance of the estate deductions for evelyn individual income tax liabilities.the estate appeals the latter deficiency determination.
we review decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.a.because this case was submitted to the tax court on a fully stipulated basis,we review the purely legal question presented by this appeal de novo.see duke energy natural gas comm r,cir.
section a of the internal revenue code authorizes a deduction for claims against the estate in calculating the value of a decedent taxable estate there is no dispute in this case that unpaid income taxes incurred by a decedent prior to death may be deducted as a claim against the estate.see reg.f.rather,the disagreement centers on whether events occurring after a decedent death may be considered in calculating that deduction.in particular,the parties debate the effect of the settlement between donn estate and the commissioner on the value of the section a deduction taken by evelyn estate for her income taxes.the estate argues the settlement is not relevant because the value of its deduction should be determined as of evelyn death.the commissioner counters that the settlement was properly considered because the deduction is limited to the actual amount of taxes evelyn ultimately owed.
this is an issue of first impression in our circuit,notwithstanding the commissioner assertion to the contrary.specifically,he observes that the eighth circuit resolved this issue in his favor in jacobs commissioner,cir,shortly after congress divided the former eighth circuit into the new tenth and eighth circuits he argues that under the statute that created the tenth circuit,jacobs is a decision of the former eighth circuit and,thus,should be treated as binding precedent here.appellee br.at.there are two fundamental problems with the commissioner argument 
first,unlike the eleventh circuit,which chose to adopt all decisions issued by the former fifth circuit before its october,split as binding precedent,see bonner city of prichard,cir en banc,we have never held that the decisions of our predecessor circuit are controlling in this court second,even assuming we are bound by the decisions of the former eighth circuit,jacobs does not fall within that category of cases.as the commissioner concedes,the eighth circuit decided jacobs almost four months after the act creating our circuit took effect.moreover,we are not persuaded by the commissioner argument that section of that act obligates us to treat the eighth circuit decision in jacobs as a decision of the former eighth circuit simply because that case was argued and submitted prior to the effective date of the act that section states if any hearing before the former eighth circuit has been held in the case,or if the case has been submitted for decision,then further proceedings in respect of the case shall be had in the same manner and with the same effect as if this act had not been enacted.stat.at.
notably,the act creating the eleventh circuit contains nearly identical language,see bonner,at,yet that circuit has never adopted the per se rule urged by the commissioner in this case.the eleventh circuit has instead held that where an appeal was submitted before the split but decided by the fifth circuit thereafter,the decision has precedential effect only if the appeal arose in the geographical confines of the eleventh circuit.see stein reynolds,cir but as the estate points out in this case,jacobs arose in missouri,which has always been in the eighth circuit.the commissioner offers no reason why an eighth circuit case decided after the split and arising outside the geographical confines of our circuit should be binding on this court,and we decline to announce such a rule here.
because we are not bound by jacobs in deciding whether events may be considered in valuing a deduction under section a,we may answer this question on a clean slate.neither section a nor the tax regulations clearly indicate whether events that occur after a decedent death are relevant in calculating a deduction for a claim against the estate.the statute is silent on this issue.the regulations,on the other hand,contain language which arguably supports the positions of both parties.for instance,one regulation cited by the estate provides the amounts that may be deducted as claims against a decedent estate are such only as represent personal obligations of the decedent existing at the time of his death.reg.but,another regulation relied upon by the commissioner permits estates to deduct a decedent tax liabilities as a claim against the estate even if the exact amount is not known,as long as the deduction is ascertainable with reasonable certainty,and will be paid.reg.b.in light of these apparent inconsistencies,the most we can discern from these regulations is that the situation we now face is not expressly contemplated.estate of smith comm r,cir.
we therefore begin our analysis with the leading case on this issue,ithaca trust united states.in ithaca trust,the decedent left the residue of his estate to his wife for life,with the remainder to certain charities.to ascertain the amount of the charitable deduction for estate tax purposes,the wife residual was calculated with a mortality table and subtracted from the principal of the estate.however,the wife died much sooner than expected.the question for the court was whether the value of the estate deduction should be calculated according to the wife life expectancy as of the date of the testator death or by applying the wife actual date of death.in a unanimous opinion,the court adopted a valuation rule the estate so far as may be is settled as of the date of the testator death.id.at.the court acknowledged that t he first impression is that it is absurd to resort to statistical probabilities when you know the fact,but it stated that the value of the thing to be taxed must be estimated as of the time when the act is done,the passing of the decedent estate at death.id.the court therefore concluded by stating that,as t empting as it is to correct uncertain probabilities by the now certain fact,we are of opinion that it can not be done.id.
several courts have relied on the valuation rule announced in ithaca trust to hold that events occurring after a decedent death are irrelevant in valuing an estate deduction under section a.see estate of smith,at allowing estate to deduct value of claim against it even though estate later settled for lesser amount propstra united states,cir same estate of van horne comm r,wl same,aff,cir greene united states,declining to consider creditor failure to comply with statute of limitations for filing claim after decedent death in allowing estate deduction for claim russell united states,same winer united states,same while most of these courts acknowledged that ithaca trust involved a different section of the federal estate tax statute,charitable bequest deductions under the precursor to,they interpreted the opinion as announcing a broad principle that the value of a taxable estate should be determined as closely as possible to the date of the decedent death.
other courts,however,have refused to extend the principle of ithaca trust beyond charitable bequest deductions,holding that postmortem events may properly be considered in calculating the value of a claim against the estate deduction.see estate of sachs comm r,cir holding that commissioner could rely on retroactive tax forgiveness legislation enacted four years after decedent death in disallowing estate deduction for paying those taxes comm r estate of shively,cir holding that decedent estate could not deduct full value of spousal support obligations because before estate filed return jacobs,at holding that husband estate could not deduct amount of claim against it arising from antenuptial agreement as a result of wife waiver of claim after husband death estate of kyle comm r,wl disallowing estate deduction for value of litigation claim against it because case was resolved in estate favor six years after decedent death estate of hagmann comm r,wl refusing to allow estate to deduct valid claims against it because creditors never filed those claims after decedent death,aff per curiam,cir although these courts have offered a variety of reasons why ithaca trust should be limited to charitable bequests,three recurring themes emerge.
one explanation for not extending ithaca trust to claims against the estate is that the congressional purpose underlying that deduction is different from that of deductions for charitable bequests.according to this rationale,the valuation rule does not apply to section a because the purpose of that deduction is to appraise the decedent actual net worth at death,while the purpose of section is to encourage charitable bequests by ensuring that if a testator makes a charitable gift in a prescribed form,a deduction will be allowed in a specified amount.see,sachs,at there is no legislative interest behind the a deduction in encouraging claims against the estate in the same way that valuation encourages charitable bequests.
another justification for not applying ithaca trust to section a is based on the other deductions in the section.this approach places heavy reliance on the fact that section a allows a deduction not only for claims against the estate but also for funeral and estate administration expenses.under this view,since these expenses are calculated after death,congress must also have intended that claims against the estate be ascertained by events.see,jacobs,at funeral expenses,administration expenses,and claims against the estate,under this paragraph,were intended by congress to be determined in the course of an orderly administration of the estate.
the third reason these courts reject a valuation approach is they do not consider it sensible to allow an estate to deduct a claim it does not ultimately owe or pay.see,shively,at to permit an estate such a deduction under these circumstances would be to prefer fiction to reality and would defeat the clear purpose of the precursor to section a.
we do not find any of these explanations particularly persuasive.even assuming congress had different motives for allowing deductions under section than it did for deductions under section,this distinction fails to explain why deductions for claims against the estate should be computed any differently from charitable bequests.propstra,at.further,we find it insignificant that congress placed funeral and estate administration expenses,which are calculated after death,with claims against the estate in section a,because that section also contains a deduction for unpaid mortgages,which may be calculated without reference to events.finally,we note that the emphasis on actuality in valuing claims against the estate is at odds with the supreme court admonition that as t empting as it is to correct uncertain probabilities by the now certain fact,we are of opinion that it can not be done.ithaca trust,u.at.thus,instead of facing compelling arguments why we should reject valuation for claims against the estate,we are left with ambiguous interpretations of the appropriate method for calculating section a deductions.
these ambiguities,of course,do not automatically lead to the conclusion that events occurring after a decedent death may never be considered
