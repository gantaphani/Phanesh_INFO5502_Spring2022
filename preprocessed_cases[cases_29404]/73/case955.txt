the fifth amendment protects individuals from having to disclose documents when the very act of production would constitute.cherie and benjamin bright the brights,subjects of an internal revenue service investigation concerning past tax liability,jointly appeal the district court order enforcing irs summonses requiring production of documents,including those relating to offshore accounts.the brights invoked their fifth amendment privilege and refused production.they also separately appeal the district court subsequent order finding them in contempt for failing to produce the documents.we hold that the district court acted properly in enforcing the irs summonses and finding the brights in contempt,although we modify the conditions necessary to purge the contempt.
background 
cherie bright is a of bright enterprises,a tax consulting business.in,the department of justice filed a civil fraud action against bright enterprises and its owners,accusing them of promoting tax shelters.before bringing that action,the irs investigated cherie and her business partner personal returns,seeking information concerning the same shelters that would appear in the fraud complaint.specific to this appeal,on june,the irs issued and served identical summonses to cherie and her husband,benjamin bright,directing them to appear before an irs revenue agent to address suspected past tax liability.the summonses also directed the brights to bring numerous categories of records relating to two credit cards identified with the brights that were linked to offshore accounts and any other offshore credit cards.the brights failed to appear or to produce any documents.
the government then filed an enforcement petition in the united states district court for the district of hawaii,which ordered the brights to show cause why they should not be compelled to comply with the summonses.the brights appeared and each asserted an intention to evoke all rights afforded to them,including the fifth amendment right against.the district court granted the irs petition on september,ruling that the brights privilege claim failed because they had not specified which portions of the summonses requested privileged documents or what facts supported a privilege claim.the court specifically found that 
t he irs knows the name and location of the offshore banks,the credit card numbers,and that the brights used and maintained these cards.thus the existence of the offshore credit card accounts is a foregone conclusion,and the production of the records relating to these credit card accounts has no testimonial significance.
after denying the brights motion for reconsideration,the district court entered an enforcement order the enforcement order,and the brights jointly and timely appealed.
the irs then established a new schedule for the production of documents.on the day the documents were due,however,the brights unsuccessfully moved for a stay in the district court.this court also denied a stay.
the brights finally began producing documents,but none concerning offshore accounts or many other categories of documents.this refusal prompted the government to seek a contempt order from the district court.meanwhile,the brights continued to produce some documents.they also submitted declarations outlining their attempts at compliance with the document requests and their purported lack of possession or control of any relevant documents not yet produced.
after affording the brights additional time to finish production,the district court instituted contempt proceedings.rather than produce documents related to offshore accounts,cherie reasserted her fifth amendment privilege,and benjamin contended that he had produced all documents in his possession or control.cherie eventually filed a substantial declaration detailing the exception of offshore benjamin lack of involvement in the family finances or in any of the activities that were the subjects of the specific document requests.
in an august,order the contempt order,the district court found both cherie and benjamin bright in contempt of the enforcement order,making five key findings and conclusions 
the fifth amendment privilege could not be relitigated in contempt proceedings.
the enforcement order requirement that the brights produce documents related to any other offshore credit cards mandated production of documents concerning two additional offshore accounts not specifically named in the summonses,even though the government did not discover the connection between these accounts and the brights until after entry of the enforcement order.however,the failure to produce these particular documents was not necessary to the finding of contempt.
the government had established that other documents remained outstanding.
the brights were not in substantial compliance because they had engaged in extensive delaying tactics and had failed to argue during the enforcement proceeding that relevant documents were not in their possession or control.
the brights had failed to provide evidence establishing that benjamin did not have custody or control of the requested documents.
the court imposed a daily fine until the brights either fully comply with the summonses or sufficiently establish that they are unable to do so,as well as a compensatory sanction.the court further noted that a satisfactory response would include a more definitive declaration by the brights that documents do not exist,or documentation showing that despite making all reasonable efforts to comply,they have a present inability to do so.benjamin and cherie bright separately and timely appealed the order of contempt.
jurisdiction 
the united states brought its petition under b,and the district court had jurisdiction under a.the brights appeals have been consolidated pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure b,and we review under.
discussion 
entry of the enforcement order 
the brights first assert that the district court erred in granting the enforcement order.they advance two parallel contentions.as a matter of procedure,they argue that the district court erred by issuing a blanket denial of their assertion of a fifth amendment privilege as to the production of all responsive documents.as a matter of substance,they argue that the district court erred by finding that the production of records concerning offshore bank accounts had no testimonial significance,foreclosing a privilege claim.

procedure applying privilege to document requests 
a claim of fifth amendment privilege may be asserted if there are substantial hazards of that are real and appreciable,not merely imaginary and unsubstantial,that information sought in an irs summons might be used to establish criminal liability.united states drollinger,cir per curiam quoting united states rendahl,cir.a proper application of this standard requires that the fifth amendment be raised in response to specific questions propounded by the investigating body.id.quoting united states pierce,cir accord united states bodwell,cir per curiam.the privilege is not limited to oral questioning an individual may refuse to provide documents to an investigative body if the act of production would be testimonial.see,in re grand jury subpoena,dated april,cir.the taxpayer bears the burden of showing that testimony or documents are privileged.see united states brown,cir per curiam.
the brights were able to litigate fully their asserted fifth amendment privilege concerning document production in the enforcement proceeding.the magistrate judge scheduled a hearing over a month after the government filed its enforcement petition,setting a clear and reasonable deadline for submission of briefs and documents in support of a privilege claim.the hearing occurred over a year after the irs issued summonses to the brights,allowing the brights more than sufficient time to search for responsive documents.before the hearing,the brights submitted both opposition papers and a surreply.the brights contention that the district court addressed the privilege prematurely is not well taken.
moreover,the scope of the brights privilege claim was clear it applied to all documents responsive to each category and subcategory specified in the summonses.had the brights wished to narrow their privilege claim or provide targeted support concerning particular documents,they had the opportunity to produce a privilege log or turn over any contested documents for in camera review.i n camera review does not destroy the privileged nature of contested communications united states zolin,u.in the absence of such targeted support,the district court was not precluded from making a reasoned assessment of the claimed privilege with respect to each category of requested documents.see brown,at.
the application of privilege to a document production is different from a blanket privilege claim at an interview.an unscripted interview is undefined,so a court can not make a reasoned assessment of privilege before particular questions have been posed.see,drollinger,at.in contrast,a document request lays out categories of documents requested a claim of privilege over all documents can be assessed as repeated assertions of privilege in response to each category.see united states grable,cir t he effect was as if the revenue agent had asked for each document listed in the summons,and the taxpayer had responded by repeatedly raising his fifth amendment privilege in response.quoting united states argomaniz,cir.the scope of the assertion is clear and circumscribed.thus,although in the context of oral questioning a taxpayer has not fully litigated the privilege by issuing a general claim of privilege,drollinger,at rendahl,at,the same can not be said of a claim of privilege over documents 
the district court gave the brights an opportunity to present evidence concerning issues such as privilege,possession and control at a hearing before a magistrate judge.a taxpayer can not refuse to produce a privilege log or documents for in camera review in response to an order to show cause and then protest an insufficient opportunity to present a claim of privilege.see united states grace,cir en banc holding that a party discretion to investigate and present its case does not override the district court authority to manage the trial by setting discovery and disclosure deadlines.such dilatory tactics would undermine efficient tax enforcement,which appears to have been the brights goal.
substance fifth amendment privilege 
the fifth amendment grants persons the privilege not to provide the state with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature.united states,cir quoting schmerber california.
the act of producing evidence in response to a subpoena has communicative aspects of its own,wholly aside from the contents of the papers produced.compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer.it also would indicate the taxpayer belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena.
fisher united states.however,where t he existence and location of the papers are a foregone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the government information by conceding that he in fact has the papers,enforcement of the summons does not touch upon constitutional rights.id.at citing in re harris.for this foregone conclusion exception to apply,the government must establish its independent knowledge of three elements the documents existence,the documents authenticity and respondent possession or control of the documents.see united states hubble.the government bears the burden of proof and must have had the requisite knowledge before issuing the summons or subpoena.see in re grand jury subpoena,at.
the brights argue that the district court clearly erred in finding that the act of producing records concerning offshore bank accounts had no testimonial significance,foreclosing a claim of privilege under the fifth amendment.we conclude that the foregone conclusion exception does apply to documents related to the two credit cards expressly named in the summonses.the exception,however,does not apply to documents concerning the two additional credit cards named during contempt proceedings,and the production of those documents is therefore privileged under the fifth amendment.
the irs independently knew about the existence of documents related to the first two credit cards before it issued the summonses.in the initial enforcement proceeding,an irs agent declared under oath that the irs offshore credit card project had gathered information showing that the brights maintained accounts at both hallmark trust and butterfield bank and provided the brights account numbers to the court the government also showed that hallmark trust and butterfield bank provided their account holders with specific account documents,demonstrating the existence of particular documents responsive to the summonses.see norwood,at applying foregone conclusion exception when the government could demonstrate the existence of accounts and account documents even though it did not enumerate specific responsive documents hubbell,at holding foregone conclusion exception did not apply to request for broad categories such as tax records when the government made no showing that it had any prior knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts of the pages of documents ultimately produced under an immunity agreement doe,at,holding foregone conclusion exception did not apply to subpoena naming broad categories of documents such as financial statements and workpapers.
the government did not need the brights to authenticate such documents,because the records could be independently authenticated by banking officials.see,united states sand,cir.nor did the government need to prove that it had previously authenticated the same documents or that it had used these same bank officials in the past it needed to show only that it could do so without the taxpayer assistance,including without information gleaned from the documents.see in re grand jury subpoena,at 
finally,the government showed that at both banks have access to basic account records through the internet,thus demonstrating that the records were in the brights custody and control.in sum,the district court correctly found that the existence of offshore account records was a foregone conclusion.
on the other hand,application of the foregone conclusion exception to records of the two additional credit cards not named during the enforcement proceeding was clear error.the government asserts that at the time the irs issued the summonses,it knew of the cards existence and of their use by cherie business partner.however,the government made no showing that it knew that the brights maintained possession or control of the accounts and thus of the account documents.the government may not issue a summons for other documents and then apply the foregone conclusion exception when it becomes aware of documents through an ongoing investigation.see in re grand jury subpoena,at.therefore,the act of producing these documents is protected by the fifth amendment.the enforcement order is narrowed accordingly to exclude documents related to these two credit cards.
ii.contempt order 
cherie and benjamin bright separately appeal the district court contempt order.each argues that neither of them was in contempt of the enforcement order,and they collectively argue that the district court order was deficient because it was improperly punitive and did not specify purgation conditions.
