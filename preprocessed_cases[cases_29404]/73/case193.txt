defendant richard josephberg appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a jury trial before charles brieant,judge,convicting him on all counts of a indictment,to wit evasion of payment of personal income taxes for the years and,in violation of count conspiracy to defraud the internal revenue service irs and,in violation of,to defraud josephberg health care insurer,all in violation of count evasion of personal income taxes for the years and,in violation of counts and subscribing false income tax returns for the years and,in violation of counts and willful failure to file timely personal income tax returns for the years,in violation of counts willful failure to pay income tax due for the years,in violation of counts obstructing and impeding the due administration of the internal revenue laws,in violation of a count and health care fraud,in violation of and count.josephberg was sentenced principally to months imprisonment to be followed by a period of supervised release.
on appeal,josephberg contends a that his convictions on counts,and should be reversed,and those counts dismissed,on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence b that his convictions on the remaining counts,should be reversed and those counts dismissed on the ground that they violate his fifth amendment privilege against c that as to any counts not dismissed,he is entitled to a new trial on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct errors in the district court instructions to the jury and d that there were errors in the calculation of his sentence.for the reasons that follow,we reject josephberg contentions.
background 
the present prosecution focused on the financial activities of josephberg,an investment banker and investment advisor,during the period.at issue principally were transactions generating losses that were not permissible tax deductions because the transactions were entered into with no profit motive and involved no market risk,and josephberg conduct with respect to his personal tax liabilities resulting from those transactions.at trial,the government presented,inter alia,a documentary evidence such as irs computer printouts of josephberg tax activity showing,the dates on which returns were filed or assessments were made or notices were sent,irs certificates of assessments stating josephberg tax liability,irs notices of deficiency,and financial records of josephberg and his children and b testimony from numerous witnesses,including josephberg former business partner jeffrey feldman,josephberg former accountant hyman fox,former clients of josephberg who were instructed by josephberg to send his compensation to accounts in the names of his children rather than to josephberg himself,and revenue agents and officers of the irs.the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the government,summarized here and discussed in greater detail as necessary in part ii below,showed the following.
a.the straddle,and simulated straddle,transactions 
in the late,a company owned by josephberg and feldman,cralin associates,cralin,entered into an agreement with a company owned by one bernard manko,pursuant to which josephberg and his cralin business associates would syndicate,sell interests in trial transcript tr.limited partnerships that were created to invest in tax shelter straddle transactions involving united states treasury bills collectively the manko tax shelters or tax shelter partnerships.a straddle is the simultaneous ownership of a contract to buy a commodity for delivery in a future month and a contract to sell the same amount of the same commodity in a different future month,see generally united states atkins,cir.atkins,cert.denied,d.as each manko tax shelter partnership owned both contracts to buy and contracts to sell,either the purchase contracts or the sale contracts could be sold at a loss.each year the partnerships sold the category of contracts that had decreased in value,thereby realizing losses.as the losses or gains realized by a partnership flow through to the individual partners in proportion to their respective ownership interests,see generally united states helmsley,cir,cert.denied,d,the individual investors in a given manko tax shelter partnership claimed their shares of those losses as deductions on their income tax returns for that year.the partnership sale of the offsetting profitable contracts was deferred until the following year but tax shelter straddle transactions were repeated through,with the amounts escalating each year see tr.in order to generate losses that would offset the gains that had been rolled forward from the year before see id.at.while an ordinary straddle is not risk free because there is no assurance that the gain on the second leg will be equal in amount to the loss on the first leg,atkins,at,josephberg and his cralin associates sought to structure their straddles or simulated straddles in ways that would ensure that everything washe d out,that if there was a profit it was the same amount as the loss tr.
in,the accumulated deferred gains for josephberg,feldman,and their tax shelter partners totaled some million absent an offsetting loss,taxes on those gains would have been owing in.these gains could not be offset by further manko tax shelters,however,because of a provision in the economic recovery tax act of requiring generally that a straddle owner claiming a straddle loss must recognize the gain in the offsetting commodity contract in the same year as the claimed loss,even if the gain was as yet unrealized.see.in order to obtain losses to offset the million in gains rolled into,josephberg and his associates entered into an agreement with a government bond dealer,new york hanseatic hanseatic,whose principal was charles atkins,to generate tax losses in transactions by using repurchase agreements or repos,which are devices for financing the purchase or sale of securities,atkins,at.are purchased at a discount and appreciate through the dates of their maturity.repo transactions were used by josephberg and his associates to simulate a straddle tr.by deducting the financing expense in one year and realizing the gain from the appreciation in the following year.in cralin paid hanseatic approximately million to purchase million in repo losses without any physical securities being involved id.at,and the individual investors claimed their shares of those losses as deductions on their income tax returns to offset the gains see id.at.
the manko tax shelter straddles had been designed to create deductions amounting to four times the investor capital contribution.see id.at.both the manko and the shelter transactions were,manipulated,rigged,and riskless,id.at,and josephberg and his partners engaged in these transactions not for the purpose of producing profits but solely for the purpose of generating losses that investors could deduct from income on their tax returns see id.at.indeed,in,when cralin entered into its first transaction with hanseatic,cralin could have made a profit of more than million at the second planned stage of the financing process,due to an anomalous and precipitous decline in interest rates but instead of financing the repo expense at the lower rate,cralin chose to pay the originally planned,higher interest rate in order to achieve the desired million loss.see id.at.
cralin continued these simulated straddle transactions until the irs began an investigation of the transactions with hanseatic.see tr.the last hanseatic repo deal occurred in,with losses taken in that year and the gains deferred into.see id.at.feldman,who described the manko and hanseatic transactions at trial,and had pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit tax fraud with respect to the purchase of million in tax losses from hanseatic in see id.at,testified w e did care about profits id.at.
among those claiming shares of the losses generated by these tax shelter transactions on their individual tax returns were josephberg and other cralin principals,who received syndication fees for creating and marketing the manko partnerships.see id.at.because of their roles as syndicators,the cralin principals were not even required to make cash investments in the manko tax shelter partnerships in order to claim losses josephberg and his partners simply received an allocation of the losses in the structure of the transaction.id.at.
because of the losses claimed,the tax returns of the cralin principals for the years in question generally showed no tax liability.see id.at.in,for example,josephberg reported more than in wages and other income on his personal income tax return but,claiming more than in losses attributable to the transactions,he paid nothing in taxes.for the period,josephberg earned more than,a significant portion of which came from his sales,through cralin,of the manko and tax shelters because of the tax shelter losses he claimed,he paid a total of only in taxes for those nine years.see gx.
b.the irs investigation and josephberg of assets 
in,the irs sent josephberg a letter indicating that it calculated he owed some in taxes for the years,based on its rejection of losses generated by the cralin tax shelter partnerships in which josephberg participated.see gx.the letter informed josephberg of his right to challenge this calculation through the irs appeals process.josephberg appealed these adjustments unsuccessfully,and the irs in issued a notice of deficiency to josephberg with respect to this debt see gx.josephberg had also received a notice of deficiency in december stating that he had an additional tax liability of for.see gx.josephberg commenced tax court actions,petitioning for redeterminations of these deficiencies.in the action challenging the calculations for,josephberg failed to answer,object to,or otherwise respond to irs requests for factual admissions the facts set forth in those requests were deemed admitted and the irs motion for summary judgment against him was granted.see josephberg cir,tax,tax court judgment i.josephberg action challenging the calculation of his tax deficiency for was dismissed for lack of prosecution after neither he nor anyone representing him showed up for trial.see josephberg cir,tax,tax court judgment ii.
after the entry of these tax court judgments,the irs commenced efforts to collect josephberg tax debts for and,including accrued interest and penalties.in addition,in it issued to josephberg notices of deficiency for the tax years and,which josephberg did not challenge.the irs efforts to collect josephberg tax debts were impeded because josephberg repeatedly maintained,in the ensuing irs interviews and in his representations on irs asset disclosure forms,that he had no assets that had not already been seized by the irs.
in fact,however,josephberg was merely hiding his income.on his irs asset disclosure form dated june,josephberg represented that he owned only a percent interest in his investment banking firm,josephberg grosz.see gx,despite the fact that since he had owned percent of that firm see tr.in the fall of,josephberg created two new entities,jg capital,jg capital,and jg partners.see gx.jg capital was wholly owned by jg partners,which in turn was by josephberg three children,unbeknownst to them josephberg owned the remaining percent.see tr.on his subsequent irs asset disclosure form,josephberg did not disclose the existence of jg capital or jg partners.see,gx.he told fox,his accountant,that he created the two entities for the purpose of placing his investment banking income beyond the reach of the irs,because any account in his name would undoubtedly have been levied upon.see tr.
in addition,in or around see id.at,the year in which he received the irs notice of deficiency for,josephberg had created securities accounts in the names of his children,likewise unbeknownst to them,which he alone managed see,id.at.josephberg then,as compensation for his investment banking and other professional services,had his clients issue stock in the names of jg capital,jg partners,his wife,or his children.see,id.at.josephberg did not disclose the existence or contents of these accounts,or his unfettered control over them,to the irs.see gx.for example,although josephberg stated in a may irs interview that he lacked the wherewithal to pay his bills and that he had not closed a deal as an investment banker in two years see tr,in fact within that period josephberg had raised capital for gk intelligent systems gk and had caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of his fee to be paid in the form of stock and placed in the accounts of his children.although the stock was restricted stock,in that it could not be sold for a period of time,when the restrictions lapsed josephberg used those assets at will.
in and,for example,without the knowledge of his daughter kara,josephberg sold shares of gk stock that had been issued in her name as compensation for his services,and he caused the gains resulting from those for and for be reported on kara tax returns.see tr.gx,gx.at trial,kara testified that she had never filed her own tax returns before,that she had not signed the returns showing the sales of the gk stock,and that she had not even been aware that she owned gk stock.see tr.in,kara filed an individual tax return for the year,reporting income she had received for her work as a summer associate at a law firm,and she expected a significant tax refund.instead of receiving a refund,she learned that she had a personal tax liability of more than resulting from josephberg sales of the gk stock he had had put in her name.see id.at.
josephberg also had some of his income placed in accounts in the name of his younger daughter,jessica and in,and,he sold shares of stock in her name for a total of more than.see gx,gx,gx.the parties stipulated that if jessica were called as a witness at trial,she would testify that she had no recollection of signing or filing,and no role in preparing,tax returns that she had never been required to file a return and had not known that in fact returns in her name were filed for the tax years,and she was years of age.as a result of those returns,jessica tax liability by the time of trial,including penalties and interest resulting from nonpayment of taxes,was some.see tr.
josephberg told fox that he caused stock to be issued in his children names because t he irs had levied all of his bank accounts,and he had no place else to put it.tr.as a result,while his tax debts remained outstanding,josephberg used the accounts of his children and the corporate accounts of jg capital and jg partners to pay various personal expenses,such as rent totaling some,country club dues totaling nearly,and parties costing tens of thousands of dollars.see,gx gx.
c.the fraudulent and returns,the subsequent failures to file timely and to pay,and the health care fraud 
for the years spanning,josephberg claimed and carried forward on his individual tax returns a substantial net operating loss or nol stemming from cralin tax shelter activities.the irs notice of deficiency informed josephberg that his claimed losses from the cralin tax shelter transactions were disallowed because they were not bona fide economic transactions,but rather were,manipulated,fixed,rigged transactions that generated artificial tax losses and because it had not been shown that the partners or the partnership entered into the transactions primarily for profit.gx.josephberg nonetheless continued to carry the nol forward and claimed it on his returns for tax years through,signing and filing those returns under penalty of perjury.see tr,gx,gx,gx,gx,gx,gx.the nol carried over was substantial.on josephberg return,for example,it was more than million see gx on his return,it was more than million see gx and on each such return,except for his social security tax,the nol deduction resulted in a claimed tax liability of zero.
in addition,on his returns for and,josephberg failed to pay withholding,social security,and medicare taxes collectively employment taxes for norma grant,who resided with the josephbergs,was nanny for their daughter jessica,and did housekeeping chores.for the tax years,josephberg failed to file timely tax returns and he made no payment of taxes for the years.
as to the charge of health care fraud,the record showed that in the fall of,josephberg submitted to oxford health plans oxford,his health care provider,two false documents designed to induce oxford to provide coverage for josephberg and to charge a group insurance rate to josephberg company.see part.below.the documents were false tax forms prepared by fox,who testified that he prepared the first after josephberg asked me to prepare a phony schedule c showing josephberg as an employee of tr.josephberg had fox prepare a second false tax form in response to a request from oxford for further documentation.see id.at.
prior to trial,fox had pleaded guilty to tax fraud with respect to josephberg returns,to health care fraud with respect to the documents submitted to oxford,and to conspiring with josephberg to commit those frauds.see id.at.
d.the verdicts and sentence 
the jury found josephberg guilty on all seventeen counts of the indictment,to wit,income tax evasion for the years and,in violation of count evasion of tax assessments for the years,in violation of id.counts and subscribing fraudulent tax returns for the years,in violation of id.counts and willful failure to file timely tax returns and to due for the years,in violation of id.counts willful failure to pay taxes for the year,in violation of id.count attempting to obstruct the irs investigation into his assets,in violation of id.a count and health care fraud,in violation of and count.it found josephberg guilty as well of conspiring with fox to defraud the irs,to violate by defrauding oxford,to evade assessment of his tax obligations for the years,and to subscribe fraudulent tax returns for those years,all in violation of count.
by the time of his trial in,josephberg total tax debt dating back to his tax year,including interest and penalties,was approximately.the district court calculated josephberg sentence under the version of the advisory sentencing guidelines guidelines but imposed a sentence of,principally,months imprisonment.see part.below.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,josephberg contends principally a that the government evidence was legally insufficient to convict him on counts,and,the tax evasion,tax fraud,obstruction,and health care fraud counts,and that those counts should thus be dismissed b that counts,the and counts,should be dismissed because they violate his fifth amendment privilege against and c in the alternative,that he is entitled to a new trial on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct errors in the court jury charge.he also challenges his sentence on the grounds that the application of the guidelines violated the ex post facto clause and that the district court miscalculated the tax loss attributable to his offenses.finding no merit in these contentions,we affirm.
standards of review 
in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction,a defendant bears a heavy burden.see,united states leonard,cir leonard united states morgan,cir united states hamilton,cir,cert.denied,d.in reviewing such a challenge,we are required to view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,see,united states eppolito,cir eppolito,cert.denied,d leonard,at,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor,see,eppolito,at leonard,at,and we must affirm the conviction so long as,from the inferences reasonably drawn,the jury might fairly have concluded guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,see,eppolito,at united states jackson,cir.
the assessment of witness credibility lies solely within the province of the jury,and the jury is free to believe part and disbelieve part of any witness testimony,see,united states gleason,cir,cert.denied,d.w here there are conflicts in the testimony,we must defer to the jury resolution of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.united states miller,cir,cert.denied,d see,united states morrison,cir.the weight of the evidence is a matter for argument to the jury,not a ground for reversal on appeal.united states hamilton,at see,united states roman,cir,cert.denied,d.these principles apply whether the evidence being reviewed is direct or circumstantial.see,glasser united states.the conviction must be upheld if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in original.
in contrast,we review de novo claims of legal error such as constitutional challenges to the indictment,see,united states ebbers,cir,cert.denied,d,and alleged errors in the trial judge instructions,united states masotto,cir,cert.denied,d united states dove,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the district court denial of a motion for a new trial.see,united states ferguson,cir united states autuori,cir united states sanchez,cir.in deciding such a motion,the district court must take care not to usurp the role of the jury,and the ultimate consideration is whether letting a guilty verdict stand would be a manifest injustice.see,united states ferguson,at.
b.the sufficiency challenges 
in order to prevail on a charge of income tax evasion in violation of,the government must prove the existence of a substantial tax debt,willfulness of the nonpayment,and an affirmative act by the defendant,performed with intent to evade or defeat the calculation or payment of the tax.see,united states ellett,cir united states helmsley,at united states romano,cir united states koskerides,cir.josephberg contends principally that the government evidence at trial was insufficient to show that he had any tax debt,that he made any material false statement in his returns for and,and that he engaged in any affirmative conduct to evade payment or obstruct collection of his tax debt.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
the existence of a substantial tax debt 
with respect to counts,and,josephberg contends,inter alia,that the government evidence was legally insufficient to support a finding of substantial tax due.josephberg conceded in the district court see defendant requests for jury instructions at,that the irs tax assessment certificates for introduced by the government,reflecting relevant information pertaining to his personal returns and the notices sent to him,constituted prima facie evidence that josephberg had a substantial tax debt.see generally united states silkman,cir id.at the formal assessments were prima facie evidence of tax deficiencies.united states voorhies,cir a valid assessment is one method of establishing tax liability united states england,cir approving jury charge that included the instruction that an assessment is prima facie correct.on appeal,josephberg argues that the evidence was insufficient because he mounted a strong challenge to the certificates on the ground that the assessments against him were based on the disallowance of his deductions of his shares of the losses of the tax shelter partnerships at issue and that the government did not introduce evidence of audits and adjustments made to any of the partnerships themselves.josephberg brief on appeal at.
this contention is meritless,amounting essentially to an argument as to the weight of the evidence,which,as discussed in part.above,is not a ground for reversal on appeal.as josephberg brief concedes,if irs certificates of assessments are challenged,then the issue is one for the jury.id.here,the evidence was ample to permit a rational juror to conclude that josephberg had a substantial tax debt.first,the certificates of assessments themselves showed that before the end of,the year in which the irs collection efforts began,josephberg had tax debts,including interest and penalties,of,for example,more than million for the year and more than million for the year.by the end of,josephberg tax debt,including interest and penalties,for year into which all of the cralin gains were ultimately more than million.see gx,gx,gx.
second,although josephberg argues that the government could not prove his tax deficiency on the basis of the certificates alone josephberg brief on appeal at,we need not address his legal premise because the government did not in fact rest its case on the certificates alone.the government also introduced the notices of deficiency sent to josephberg informing him of the amounts due see,gx,gx,gx,gx,gx these notices included statements with respect to specified tax shelter partnerships that the partnership is not entitled to the claimed losses because it has not been shown that the partners or the partnership entered into the transactions primarily for profit,gx emphasis added.
in addition,the government introduced the tax court judgments rejecting josephberg challenges to the assessments for the years and.see gx,gx.although josephberg argues that the tax court judgments against him were not on the merits josephberg brief on appeal at,we disagree.the tax court actions were brought by josephberg for redetermination of the deficiencies calculated by the irs he had the initial burden of showing that the irs calculations were erroneous,see tax court rule a see also a and he plainly failed to carry that burden.as described in part above,in his action challenging the calculations,josephberg failed to the irs requests for factual admissions,and the facts set forth in the irs requests were deemed admission s of the facts set forth in the request s for admissions,tax court judgment i,at see id.at.on the basis of those admissions,the tax court granted summary judgment against a merits decision.in his action challenging the calculations,josephberg and his attorneys failed to appear when the case was called for trial,and the action was dismissed for lack of prosecution.tax court judgment ii.the internal revenue code or code provides that i f a petition for a redetermination of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer,a decision of the tax court dismissing the proceeding shall be considered as its decision that the deficiency is the amount determined by the secretary.d emphasis added.thus,the tax court decision in josephberg action challenging the calculations was likewise a ruling on the merits.
in sum,despite the absence of direct proof as to the audits of the tax shelter partnerships themselves,the evidence viewed as a whole was ample to permit a rational juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt that josephberg had a substantial tax debt.
false statements in the returns for and 
as to counts and,which charged josephberg with subscribing false income tax returns for the years and,josephberg also contends that the certificates alone josephberg brief on appeal at were not sufficient to establish that he made material misstatements in those returns but he makes no arguments in support of that contention other than those he makes to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to show that he had a substantial tax debt.we reject his contention in part for the reasons discussed in the preceding section.
in addition,we note that,as described in part above,the record included the testimony of fox that josephberg returns for falsely claimed entitlement to deduct his net operating loss,based on the tax shelter partnerships,in spite of the fact that josephberg had been expressly informed in that that loss was not allowed.the amounts claimed were plainly material for,and for.
affirmative acts of evasion 
josephberg contends that,with respect to count,the government evidence was also insufficient to prove that he engaged in any affirmative act of evasion,arguing,in part,that the witnesses on whose testimony the government relied to prove this element withdrew the essential points of their direct testimony upon josephberg brief on appeal at.this argument is doubly flawed.first,the witnesses referred to by josephberg in making this argument are irs revenue agent john dennehy and irs revenue officer joseph lewandoski,and for the reasons discussed in part.below,we do not agree with josephberg characterizations of the record.second,as discussed in parts.above and.below,it is the province of the jury as the appropriate arbiter of the truth to determine what part,if any,of a witness testimony to credit or discredit.
josephberg also asserts that there was utterly no evidence to prove that josephberg concealed assets or income id.at,and that the stock he caused to be issued in the names of his children lacked economic value see id.at.these contentions border on the frivolous.
an affirmative act of evasion includes any conduct,the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.united states klausner,cir quoting spies united states.such conduct includes false statements made to treasury representatives for the purpose of concealing unreported income.united states klausner,at quoting united states beacon brass.see also united states winfield,cir an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax occurs when false statements are made to the irs after the tax was due.accordingly,concealment of assets or covering up of sources of income,and handling of one affairs to avoid making the records usual in transactions of the kind are examples of conduct sufficient to create an inference of evasion.spies,at.
as described in part above,after the irs began trying to collect josephberg tax debt following the entry of the tax court judgments,josephberg in concealed the fact that he was the sole owner of,stating that he owned only percent.in the fall of,he set up jg capital and jg partners in order he confided to his accountant his investment banking income in accounts not bearing his name so as to avoid having the irs seize that income.in the asset disclosure form he subsequently submitted to the irs,josephberg did not disclose the existence of these two entities.
further,in,the year in which josephberg received the irs notice of deficiency with respect to the earliest years,he established the stock accounts for his children into which he thereafter had his investment banking income redirected.josephberg told fox that he had caused the stock to be placed in his children names because t he irs had levied all of his bank accounts,and he had no place else to put it.tr.fox testified on that josephberg had not been putting such stock into his children names prior to having serious problems with the irs.see id.at.
josephberg contention that because the stock thus issued in the names of his children was restricted stock it had no value,is contrary to both the law see part.below and the evidence.the jury was entitled to infer that the stock was not worthless in light of the evidence as to its market value,as well as the evidence that josephberg was willing to accept it as payment of his investment banking fees totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars and that josephberg later sold the stock for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
evidence of health care fraud 
josephberg also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show that he defrauded his health care insurer count.he argues that josephberg testified that she worked hours a week for josephberg business,and there was no evidence in the trial to prove otherwise.josephberg brief on appeal at.the record is to the contrary.
the evidence was that in the fall of,josephberg,seeking a group rate for health insurance and inexpensive coverage for his wife,told fox that he needed to supply his health care insurer with tax documents that showed his wife was an employee tr.see id.at,and he asked fox to prepare a phony schedule c id.at see also id.at,a schedule designed to be attached to a taxpayer federal income tax form,form,to show his income from a business.fox,though know ing it was wrong to do that,immediately complied he took the schedule c and added a salary to josephberg wife.id.at.this document was submitted to oxford by josephberg,bearing fox handwritten statement that t his form was included in richard josephbergs sic form gx see tr.fox testified that that handwritten statement was a lie id.at in fact josephberg had not yet filed his tax return and when he did eventually file a return in,the accompanying schedule c bore no indication that josephberg was employed by josephberg company see gx.
further,when oxford asked josephberg for verification in the form of a new york state tax return for josephberg to show that she reported salary from,fox prepared a new york state tax form representing that josephberg was employed by in,which josephberg then sent to oxford.see tr.gx.this form too was false.see tr.
josephberg herself testified at trial that she had not received any salary from josephberg company.see tr.indeed,the government introduced evidence that in josephberg commenced a personal bankruptcy proceeding in which she,inter alia,said she was employed solely as a teacher by westchester county,and that she stated under oath that she ha d no knowledge of richard josephberg business operations tr.quoting josephberg response to interrogatory in her bankruptcy proceeding.asked at trial if she had given that answer,josephberg responded that true,i really did know about his business operations.id.at.
the evidence that josephberg had fox prepare false documents to indicate that his wife worked at his firm was itself sufficient to permit an inference that she did not in fact work there.and that inference was amply supported by josephberg sworn statements that she lacked any knowledge of josephberg business operations.
other sufficiency challenges 
although josephberg brief also lists count conspiracy and count obstruction in the heading of the section challenging the sufficiency of the evidence,the ensuing discussion contains no argument with respect to those counts.to the extent that josephberg means to imply that his convictions on those counts are flawed because of the insufficiencies he asserts with respect to other counts,any such contention founders on our rejection of his sufficiency challenges to those other counts.any other sufficiency challenges to counts and are waived.
c.the fifth amendment challenge to counts 
josephberg contends here,as he did in the district court,that counts of the indictment,charging him with willful failure to file timely income tax returns for the years and willful failure to pay tax for the years,must be dismissed as violative of his fifth amendment privilege against.he argues principally that because in those years there was an ongoing investigation into the propriety of his continued claims of net operating loss,the very filing of returns for those years would tend to incriminate him,for if he continued to claim the loss he would subject himself to prosecution for those years as well,whereas if he did not claim the loss it would be tantamount to an admission that his prior nol claims were impermissible.the district court properly rejected this argument,based on supreme court precedent.
it is well settled that the fifth amendment does not provide a blanket defense for a failure to file tax returns.see california byers,d united states sullivan.although a taxpayer may,on his return,invoke his fifth amendment privilege selectively as to any particular item of information solicited,see,id.at.united states barnes,cir cert.denied,d,t here is no constitutional right to refuse to file an income tax return,byers,at.this principle has been applied even where there is an ongoing investigation into the taxpayer affairs.see,united states poschwatta,cir e ven assuming that the irs was known to be conducting an ongoing criminal investigation,defendant was required to file his returns citing sullivan,cert.denied,d,effectively overruled on other grounds by cheek united states,d,as noted in united states powell,cir united states malquist,cir.failure to file a tax return within the meaning of is not excused by fifth amendment concerns over a pending investigation citing sullivan,cert.denied,d.
although josephberg contends that this court in united states romano,romano,ruled that the fifth amendment provides protection against a charge where there is an ongoing investigation into the taxpayer affairs,that contention is squarely contradicted by romano itself.the case involved a defendant who in november attempted to transport in cash from the united states into canada.the cash was seized and held by united states customs officials,and the irs immediately served romano with a termination assessment of as income tax due,an assessment that causes the resulting tax to be due immediately.romano,at.on the following day,the irs filed a lien to secure payment of the assessed tax.thereafter the government sought forfeiture of the entire.while the forfeiture proceeding was pending,the government commenced a criminal prosecution against romano alleging various tax violations ultimately,all but a charge of tax evasion were dismissed on consent and after a bench trial on stipulated facts,romano was convicted of that offense.
on appeal,we held that the evidence was insufficient to prove the element of tax evasion,despite several theories advanced by the government.one of the theories we rejected was that romano failure to file a tax return in april five months after the border incident,the seizure of the cash,and the irs filing of its an attempt to evade taxes.although josephberg states that t his court reversed romano conviction,holding that by filing a tax return romano might have revealed the source of the currency and incriminated himself,in violation of his fifth amendment privilege josephberg brief on appeal at,the romano opinion itself,far from supporting this imputation of a fifth amendment rationale for the reversal,expressly noted that romano was not excused from filing the return.the offense of which romano was convicted was tax evasion,not failure to file.this court rejected the government theory of evasion simply because a mere willful omission is not an affirmative act,see romano,at,and romano failure to file could not logically be viewed as an act of evasion or attempted evasion because,as romano was well aware,before the tax return was due the government already knew of the money and,indeed,had custody of it,see id.at.notwithstanding the fact that the tax return could have called for incriminating information as to the source of the money,we stated that romano was,of course,required to file a tax return,id.at see also id.at the filing of a termination assessment does not relieve the taxpayer of her obligation to prepare,sign,and file a true and correct income tax return for that year.citing sullivan,we reasoned that the mere requirement that the tax return be filed did not infringe romano fifth amendment privilege because romano need only have filed a return reporting this money as sullivan case income.id.at.
w hatever romano specific reasons may have been for not filing the return,an attempt to evade taxes was not one of them,for there was nothing for romano to gain,nothing to conceal from the irs,except possibly some incriminating information as to the source of the that is protected by the fifth amendment.
romano was,of course,required to file a tax return,and his failure to do so might have been a basis for the lesser criminal charge of failure to file,see,one of the charges that was dropped.however,given that romano was required to provide only the bare minimum of information under sullivan,to protect his fifth amendment rights,information which the government already had and which romano knew the government had,we can not accept the government claim that romano failure to file under these circumstances has probative weight in establishing the more serious crime of tax evasion.

we agree with the reasoning adopted in romano.the pendency of a government investigation does not give a taxpayer a fifth amendment option to fail to file his tax return.his privilege against is protected by his right to refuse,with a sullivan citation,to answer the questions that implicate that privilege.the district court correctly denied josephberg motion to dismiss counts.
allegations of prosecutorial misconduct 
josephberg contends that as to any counts against him that are not dismissed,he is entitled to a new trial on the grounds that the government made knowing use of false testimony josephberg brief on appeal at,made efforts to elicit false and misleading testimony from certain witnesses id.at,and made improper prejudicial remarks in summation id.at.we are unpersuaded.
in order to be granted a new trial on the ground that a witness committed perjury,the defendant must show that i the witness actually committed perjury ii the alleged perjury was material iii the government knew or should have known of the perjury at the time of trial and iv the perjured testimony remained undisclosed during trial united states zichettello,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.differences in recollection do not constitute perjury,see,united states sanchez,cir,and when testimonial inconsistencies are revealed on,the jury i s entitled to weigh the evidence and decide the credibility issues for itself,united states mccarthy,cir,abrogated on other grounds by eberhart united states,d see also united states joyner,cir c and jury instructions regarding witness credibility will normally purge the taint of false testimony.it is the task of the jury as the appropriate arbiter of the truth to sift falsehoods from facts and determine whether an inconsistency in a witness testimony represents intentionally false testimony or instead has innocent provenance such as confusion,mistake,or faulty memory.united states zichettello,at internal quotation marks omitted see,united states blair,cir.josephberg arguments fall far short of meeting the criteria for showing perjury.his principal allegations of perjury focus on the testimony of irs revenue agent dennehy.in the background section of his brief,josephberg asserts that 
dennehy attempted to bolster his reliance on the assessment certificates by testifying for a time that he verified tr and he reviewed tr the audit reports rars showing the audit adjustments for the partnerships and that he had spoken with the revenue agents who had performed the partnership audits and written the rars in the.tr.
dennehy testimony that he reviewed and verified the partnership rars and spoke to the agents was false 
dennehy claims that he had verified and reviewed the rars for the partnerships on josephberg tax returns were proven false.
josephberg brief on appeal at,emphases added.
the trial transcript,however,demonstrates that these are mischaracterizations of dennehy testimony.first,there were two groups of rars,revenue agent reports one for josephberg individual tax returns,and the other for the tax shelter partnership returns.at the transcript page cited by josephberg for the proposition that dennehy testified i verified the rars tr,dennehy was being about the top line of a chart he had prepared,which was in evidence as gx,of josephberg taxable income for the years as corrected for the disallowance of josephberg net operating loss carryovers the rars that dennehy testified he had used to prepare this chart were the rars for josephberg individual returns,not for the returns of the partnerships.see id.at see also id.at in discussing the rars that were the basis for adjusting the top line,defense counsel asked,t hese rars that you referring to,these are the revenue agent reports prepared by the revenue agents who audited richard josephberg tax returns dennehy responded yes.id.at again discussing gx q.now these revenue agent reports that you relied on,they all in regard to audits of richard josephberg well,yes,and there were additional revenue agent reports with regard to the partnerships.q.but you relied on the ones regarding the,correct correct.
second,at the transcript page cited by josephberg for the proposition that dennehy testified that he had verified and reviewed the rars for the partnerships josephberg brief on appeal at emphasis added see also id.at,dennehy testified as follows 
q.did you review the rars concerning the partnerships 
yes,i think i indicated that.i looked at some of those rars.
tr.emphasis added.defense counsel plainly understood dennehy to mean he had looked at only some,not all.he asked so which of the partnership rars that are listed on richard josephberg schedules e for those nine years did you read id.at emphases added.
nor did dennehy testify that he had spoken with all of the revenue agents who had prepared those partnership rars.rather,he testified that he did locate one who was working on one of the cralin partnerships id.at see also id.at when i became aware of the partnership aspect of the case,i made contact with whoever and wherever i could i found one particular agent who i thought may be of some help.
in the perjury section of his brief,josephberg only argument with respect to dennehy is that 
dennehy was an integral part of the prosecution since.he claimed that he did not review the rars until october,after the court ordered that all partnership audit records be provided to the defense.thus,okula an assistant united states attorney knew that the government did not even possess the rars dennehy claimed he reviewed.
josephberg brief on appeal at.on its face,the logic of this assertion,even if it were accurate in its details,is hardly clear and as an allegation of perjury,it is incomprehensible.
josephberg also points to varying statements in the testimony of irs revenue officer lewandoski 
lewandoski testified on direct examination that josephberg told him on may,that he has no deals going,and no income coming in at the time.tr.
however,on,lewandoski admitted that josephberg actually had told him on may,that he had six deals pending at the time.lewandoski then amended his testimony and said that josephberg had told him in december that he had no deals pending.but then lewandoski amended that testimony and admitted that josephberg had not told him in december that he had no deals pending.tr.in the end,it was clear to lewandoski that josephberg informed him on may,that he had six deals pending.
josephberg brief on appeal at.but lewandoski testimony that josephberg said he had no pending deals and no income,which appears on only two of the eight pages cited by josephberg,tr.and,and which obviously was thoroughly explored on,was not shown to be false.testifying a decade after his dealings with josephberg,lewandoski refreshed his recollection by reviewing his notes of his various conversations with josephberg he testified that an entry in his may notes show ed that josephberg said that he has no deals imminent,and that another entry showed that josephberg did say later in the interview that he was working on six deals id.at.thus,while lewandoski acknowledged that on may,josephberg had said he had six deals pending,his testimony that josephberg had also said he had no deals imminent id.at,was not shown to be untrue.
in essence,josephberg attacks on the testimony of dennehy,lewandoski,and other witnesses amount only to arguments that the testimony unfavorable to josephberg should not have been credited.as discussed in parts.and.above,however,witness credibility and the weight of the evidence were matters for argument to the jury they are not bases for reversal on appeal and the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury verdicts.
josephberg further suggestions that the government may have denied him a fair trial by coercing favorable testimony from witnesses,such as grant by threatening deportation,or fox by threatening a perjury prosecution if his trial testimony were inconsistent with his prior plea allocution,were rejected by the district court 
there is no evidence in the trial record which could support a finding that norma grant was coerced in any way by the government or that her testimony was altered.if efforts were made to do so,such efforts were ineffectual.the same is true with respect to jeffrey feldman.
district court memorandum and order dated may,at.our review of the record persuades us that there was no error in that decision.
finally,josephberg contention that the government made prejudicially improper remarks in summation was likewise rejected by the district court,stating in part as follows 
i t is noteworthy that the defense did not object contemporaneously with respect to the rebuttal summation and made no request for surrebuttal.the rebuttal was in fact somewhat lengthy and tedious.however,the propriety of the government conduct has to be measured in relation to the closing arguments asserted by the defense.the defense tendered a diatribe taking two and hours,not counting interruptions for recesses.much of the closing argument was not directed to the charges themselves nor was there much concession to common sense.defendant argued,among other things,that the internal revenue service was arrogant,which it probably is,and that because of this,defendant should be acquitted.this court with great refrained from interrupting and telling the jury that if you think the government is arrogant,write your congressman,and if you think the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,enter a judgment of conviction.see united states cheung,cir.
this court is convinced that the trial viewed as a whole was a fair trial directed towards the merits,and that at least with respect to most of the counts of conviction,the proof of guilt was overwhelming.to the extent some of the prosecutor comments may in hindsight be regarded as somewhat in excess,they did not distort the trial,and constituted at most harmless error,which may not be a basis for relief,particularly in the absence of a contemporaneous objection.see united states elias,cir.the comment presently being criticized concerning the effect of feldman plea and his later motion to withdraw the plea,was a fair response to a defense argument.the jury was clearly told by this court that guilt is personal and a plea of guilty by a josephberg accomplice is not evidence of josephberg guilt.
the argument that the defense had a chance to investigate prior wrongdoing by hyman fox was a fair response to defense claims that fox testimony was incredible in that he claimed josephberg was the he knowingly aided in preparing false tax returns.the argument that josephberg took no legal action against the attorney who had represented him in the tax court actions is inaccurate but in this court opinion was,at most,harmless error.it was reasonable for the government to argue that there were many other lawyers available in new york city to litigate the civil side of the issues which josephberg had with the tax court and the treasury.the court finds no error in the government rebuttal argument which would justify granting a new trial or any other relief to defendant.
district court memorandum and order dated may,at.we see no error in these rulings.
challenges to the jury instructions 
josephberg also contends that he should be given a new trial because of the district court refusal to give jury instructions he requested as to the proper valuation of restricted stock,the employment status of grant,and the permissible inferences from irs certificates of assessments.we find no basis for reversal,and only the last of these causes us any concern.
valuation of restricted stock 
josephberg asked the district court to instruct the jury that market value is an inappropriate indication of the value of restricted stock,and that the jury could find that because the stock he caused his clients to place in the accounts of his children was restricted stock,it had no value.his theory was that if that stock had no value or only nominal value,it could not be considered concealed assets.josephberg brief on appeal at.
the court properly refused to give the requested instruction.the internal revenue code provides that i f,in connection with the performance of services,property is transferred to any person other than the person for whom such services are performed,the fair market value of the property transferred is to be determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which by its terms will never lapse a.thus,although t he actual value of the stock arguably may be less than the value of stock readily transferable on the open market because of restrictions imposed these restrictions,other than permanent,nonlapsing restrictions,may not be considered in determining fair market value.sakol cir,cir,cert.denied,d emphases added.
the restrictions on the stock that josephberg caused to be issued to his children were not permanent.and when they lapsed,josephberg sold the stock.the instruction he requested would have been contrary to law.
statutory nonemployees 
contending that he believed that grant was not his employee,but rather was an independent contractor for whom an employer is not required to pay employment taxes,josephberg asked the district court to read to the jury an excerpt from an irs publication stating,inter alia,that individuals who furnish personal attendance,companionship,or household care services to children and who are not employees of a placement service are generally treated as for all federal tax purposes,publication,employer supplemental tax guide pub.or irs pub,at.josephberg argued that even if this excerpt did not represent the law governing the relationship between the individual who furnishes services and the family using her services,it should be included in the instructions because josephberg reliance on the publication language would show that his nonpayment of employment taxes for grant was not willful.see tr.the district court properly refused to give the requested instruction.
irs publications,though aimed at explaining existing tax law to taxpayers,do not have the force of law.taylor united states.the authoritative sources of federal tax law are the statutes,regulations,and judicial decisions they do not include informal irs publications.miller cir,wl.
the code itself defines employee to include any individual who,under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the relationship,has the status of an employee.d.irs regulations provide detailed guidance for determining whether a person providing services to an individual is an employee of that individual rather than an independent contractor,see d who are employees id.d who are employers,and official irs interpretations set out factors to be considered in making that determination,see irs rul.i,c.
the paragraph of pub.invoked by josephberg,which is titled companion sitters,appears in a section of that publication entitled statutory nonemployees and is drawn from a,a section that simply describes the circumstances under which an employment agency,conducting the business of putting sitters in touch with individuals who wish to employ them,is not to be considered the sitter employer.the regulations interpreting of the code,after paraphrasing the terms of a,see b,and defining sitters and companion sitting placement service,see a and a,state that 
a ny individual who,by reason of this section,is deemed not to be the employee of a companion sitting placement service shall be deemed to be for purposes of the tax on income,
c emphasis added,and that 
t he rules of this section operate only to remove sitters and companion sitting placement services from the relationship when,under d and d,that relationship would otherwise exist i f,under d and d,a sitter is considered to be the employee of the individual for whom the sitting is performed rather than the employee of the companion sitting placement service,this section has no effect upon that relationship.
d emphases added.thus,the statement in irs pub.that a sitter who is not an employee of the agency is generally treated as for all federal tax purposes,irs pub,at emphases added,could not reasonably be taken at face value.
the district court here properly instructed the jury that as to the willfulness element of the offense of tax evasion under section and subscribing a materially false return,section,
b efore you may conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that josephberg owed employment taxes for grant you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that josephberg was aware that norma grant was his employee,as the law defines that term,as opposed to being an independent contractor for whom such tax payments are not required.
tr.the court added 
you may not conclude that he knowingly and willfully failed to pay employment taxes unless the government proves to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly and willfully acted in violation of the law as opposed to relying on a belief that miss grant was an independent contractor.
id.at.the district court then described for the jury each of the factors set out in the pertinent irs revenue ruling,rul.see tr.the court properly refused to add the overly broad pub.language,which would have been confus
