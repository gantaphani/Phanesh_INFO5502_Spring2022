this case raises important questions about the scope of the privilege.william and patricia cavallaro cavallaros owned knight tool,founded in.their adult sons owned camelot systems,created in.the cavallaros and their sons merged their respective corporations in and,on july,the merged entity sold for approximately million.subsequently,the internal revenue service began an investigation into the cavallaros correct estate and gift tax transfer tax liabilities.the irs suspected that the parties might have undervalued the cavallaros knight company and overvalued the sons camelot company to disguise a gift to the sons in the form of stock.
in the course of this investigation,the irs served a summons on ernst young,an accounting firm that camelot had retained in june of.the summons requested that ernst young produce all records in its possession regarding any work it did between and for the cavallaros,their sons,and their respective corporations.the cavallaros moved to quash the summons as overly broad and calling for privileged materials.they argued that the documents in ernst young possession were protected by the privilege because the documents were created by,or provided to,ernst young in the course of the efforts of the law firm hale and dorr to provide legal advice particularly,advice sought in and concerning transfer tax and merger issues arising from the close relationship between camelot and knight.the irs counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons.on july,the district court denied the cavallaros petition to quash and allowed the government motion to enforce the summons.cavallaro united states,d.subsequently,the district court granted the cavallaros motion for stay pending appeal,thereby permitting the cavallaros to continue to refrain from disclosing the documents that they allege are privileged.
as in the district court proceedings,three categories of documents requested by the irs are at issue documents pertaining to the december,the cavallaros,their sons,a camelot accountant,accountants from ernst young,and at least one lawyer from hale and transfer tax issues subsequent transfer tax communications arising from the december meeting and documents related to communications addressing the merger of knight and camelot.all of the requested documents are in ernst young possession.they are all documents either created by ernst young or transmitted to ernst young,not documents preserved solely in hale and dorr files.
on appeal,as in the district court,the cavallaros argue that these documents are privileged under united states kovel,cir,despite having been either created by or disclosed to ernst young,because ernst young aided hale and dorr in providing legal advice.they also argue that the documents fall within the exception to the rule that disclosure to a third party waives the privilege.
assuming arguendo that this circuit would adopt the kovel rule,we conclude that the documents are not privileged.we follow somewhat different reasoning than the district court.we need not decide whether,in all instances,the attorney or client as opposed to some third party must hire the accountant in order to sustain a privilege under kovel.kovel requires that to sustain a privilege an accountant must be necessary,or at least highly useful,for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.at.here,no party hired ernst young for this purpose.therefore,the privilege did not extend to the documents in question under the kovel doctrine.having found that the documents were not covered by the privilege,we also conclude that they can not fall within the exception,which presumes a valid underlying privilege in the first place.consequently,we do not reach the district court conclusion that u nder the strict confines of the doctrine,the lack of representation for the sons and camelot vitiates any claim to a privilege,cavallaro,d at,because ernst young was providing accounting services and so the kovel extension of the privilege is inapplicable to the summoned documents,all of which were created by or disclosed to ernst young.
the following facts are undisputed except where otherwise noted.in,the cavallaros formed knight tool,to manufacture tools to be used by companies such as mcdonnell douglas,polaroid,and raytheon to assemble their products.seven years later,in,william cavallaro and one of his three sons,kenneth,developed a rudimentary machine,which,for several years,was commercially unsuccessful due,at least in part,to difficulty in marketing the machine.
in,the cavallaros formed a new company,camelot systems,to give the cavallaros three sons an opportunity to pursue the machine business.in addition to paying its own employees,knight paid the salaries of camelot employees.the three sons were named as camelot sole shareholders and,although knight continued to make the machines,camelot became the machines only distributor.knight was camelot biggest supplier.in fact,camelot only business was selling machines and accessories manufactured by knight.the sons,working at camelot,completely redesigned the knight machine and developed several new models of the machine.as a result,camelot became a lucrative business.
in,the cavallaros contacted attorney louis hamel.hamel was a senior partner at the hale and dorr law firm,specializing in trusts and estates,exempt organizations,and pensions.he,along with other hale and dorr attorneys,periodically counseled the cavallaros regarding knight corporate matters.
the cavallaros again contacted hamel,in october,this time for help with estate and retirement planning.hamel considered,among other things,potential transfer tax issues arising in the context of the close business and family relationships between knight and camelot.between december,and december,hale and dorr provided legal advice to knight and the cavallaros,acting on knight behalf,with respect to the merger of knight into camelot.hale and dorr advised the cavallaros on,among other things,the drafting of affidavits purporting to establish the values of knight and camelot.
while the cavallaros were receiving legal advice from hale and dorr,their sons,as agents of camelot,had begun receiving tax planning advice from ernst young.camelot began meeting with ernst young in june of.on november,ernst young documented its relationship with camelot in a letter of engagement,stating that ernst young would be providing a review of corporate structure and recommendations,a tax checkup,and transfer planning.the letter,addressed to david frac,camelot chief financial officer,further stated that a ll advice and other services we provide pursuant to this engagement are solely for the benefit of camelot and not for the benefit of anyone other than the corporation and its shareholders.frac signed the letter and returned it to ernst young.
a draft of the invoice,however,for ernst young services rendered through december,which explicitly included tax services rendered pursuant to the november engagement letter,refers to services rendered to both camelot and knight.it was addressed and mailed to cavallaro at knight.in addition,lawrence goodman,of ernst young,testified in his october,deposition that,in,he was involved in providing tax advice to camelot,knight,and the cavallaros.he also testified that around november or december of,an ernst young employee began providing services to both camelot and knight.the district court,nonetheless,concluded that the undisputed evidence is that ernst young was paid by,and worked solely for,camelot and its shareholders.cavallaro,d at.
on december,ernst young sent a letter to william cavallaro recommending the merger of knight and camelot and suggesting a strategy for minimizing transfer tax liability.ernst young understood that the cavallaros and their sons would consider selling their respective companies,and proceeded to explain how the parties might structure the corporate relationship in order to facilitate a transfer of some of the proceeds from such a sale from the cavallaros to their children while minimizing tax liability.ernst young stated that the letter would serve as the discussion document for an upcoming meeting between ernst young,hale and dorr,the cavallaros,their sons,kevin mcgillivary an accountant working for camelot,and david frac of camelot.
the letter explained that the irs would scrutinize the values of knight and camelot to determine the proper allocation of the sale proceeds between the cavallaros and their sons.the values were important because they would be the benchmark for determining whether the cavallaros had disguised a gift to their sons in the form of stock and,if so,the size of that gift and the resulting transfer tax liability.ernst young stated that the profit disparity between knight and camelot did not reflect the true values of the companies 
the current structure and resulting profit split does not seem to reflect the economic reality of the business arrangement.if one were to combine the entities,as currently structured,approximately of the profit is earned by the company that bears no risk with respect to product development,has no employees,does not bear any costs of sales,does not service or provide any warranty coverage on the product or own any of the technology.in a normal distributor relationship this arrangement does not exist.
the irs,ernst young said,would likely attribute most of the value of the corporation to the cavallaros,which would defeat the tax saving goal of allocating most of the profits of the corporations to their sons.the letter stated that b ased on the facts that exist today,it would be hard to justify camelot taking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds from a sale of the businesses.more specifically,ernst young suggested that,upon merger,as much as of the shares of the merged entity would go to the cavallaros,with only of the shares going to their sons.
it appears that the cavallaros desired a distribution more favorable to their sons,but that a redistribution would create significant transfer tax liability.ernst young proposed a solution.ernst young recommended a two step approach to eliminate the exposure related to reallocation of income.step one was to merge knight and camelot.step two involve d the gifting of stock in the merged entity by the cavallaros to their sons in the amounts that would result in the desired ownership split.ernst young recommended that the gifting be done using a grantor retained annuity trust.this gifting was necessary,according to ernst young,because of the real distribution of assets,which heavily favored knight and the cavallaros and disfavored camelot and the sons.
prior to december,the parties agree that ernst young and hale and dorr were not working together or in a coordinated fashion,even if each firm knew that the other was somehow involved in advising the cavallaros,their sons,or the companies.on december,the cavallaros,their sons,a camelot accountant,accountants from ernst young,and at least one lawyer from hale and dorr met as planned.this meeting is important to the case because the cavallaros assert that,at this meeting,ernst young began assisting hale and dorr with respect to providing advice on transfer tax issues.the cavallaros say that ernst young continued in this role,as an assistant to hale and dorr,through.at the meeting,neither camelot nor the sons were represented by an attorney hale and dorr represented only the cavallaros.
it is unclear what happened next.as the irs has stated,this is,at least in part,what they are attempting to investigate by way of the challenged subpoena.what we do know is that the cavallaros did not follow ernst young december,recommendations.instead,on may,cavallaro and one of his sons signed affidavits that were at odds with ernst young conclusion that it would be very hard to justify camelot taking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds from a sale of the businesses.hale and dorr,not ernst young,prepared these affidavits.in these two separate,but nearly identical affidavits,cavallaro and his son stated that knight had transferred,for no compensation,its machine technology to camelot when camelot was formed in.they stated that,at the time of the transfer,the technology had no ascertainable value,had no reasonable prospect of realizing a profit,and was no more than a promising but raw idea.they stated that camelot entirely redesigned the original dispensing product.knight and camelot then supplemented these affidavits with a confirmatory bill of sale,also dated may,purporting to confirm the previously undocumented gift from knight to camelot.the cavallaros say that hale and dorr had prepared drafts of all of these documents before the december,meeting.
this claimed,undocumented transfer was important to the valuation of the companies and hence to the correct distribution of shares.on december,knight merged into camelot.as part of the merger,the cavallaros received of camelot stock.this allocation was based on ernst young december,valuation of the companies,which reflected the alleged,but undocumented,technology transfer.ernst young december valuation,attributing most of the value of the corporation to camelot,was at odds with its suggestion that camelot shares would form only a small part of the corporation value.on july,the merged corporation was sold for approximately million.the merger,based on the valuation,resulted in a distribution of assets to the cavallaros sons that substantially reduced the cavallaros transfer tax liabilities.
suspicious of these circumstances,the irs began a tax fraud investigation into the cavallaros correct federal tax liabilities for the years through.the investigation focused on whether the cavallaros had manufactured a prior gift to their children,through the use of the alleged technology transfer,to avoid transfer taxes.the irs sought to determine whether knight was undervalued and whether camelot was overvalued at the time of the merger because,if this were the case,then the cavallaros would have disguised a gift to their sons in the form of stock.
as part of this investigation,the irs,on december,issued a recordkeeping summons to ernst young the summons began by requesting a ll records relating to ernst young engagements with william,patricia,paul,kenneth,or james cavallaro,knight tool or camelot systems at any time from through.the irs issued the summons because,in response to a prior summons it had issued in the investigation,it had obtained a copy of the december,ernst young letter,which it believed to be materially inconsistent with subsequent sworn statements made by william cavallaro and a subsequent valuation rendered by ernst young.the irs stated that the valuation sets forth a analysis which is materially inconsistent with a subsequent valuation rendered by ernst young and materially at odds with sworn statements submitted by william cavallaro.
the cavallaros moved to quash the summons as overly broad and calling for privileged materials.they argued that the summoned documents are privileged because ernst young helped hale and dorr provide legal advice beginning on december.they also argued that the documents fall within the rule.
subsequently,the cavallaros provided the irs with a substantial number of documents,including excerpts from the diaries of ernst young employees who worked for knight or camelot and what the cavallaros say are nearly all of knight and camelot accounting records.this dispute is over those remaining documents that the cavallaros have refused to produce.
the irs counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons.on september,the district court heard arguments and authorized the irs to depose lawrence goodman,a senior manager in ernst young tax department,primarily to determine whether any additional documents existed relating to ernst young work for the cavallaros,their sons,and the two companies.b.after the deposition,hale and dorr provided the irs with an amended privilege log and a letter stating the reasons why it believed each of the documents in the log to be privileged.
on july,the district court denied the cavallaros petition to quash and allowed the government motion to enforce the summons.cavallaro,d.the district court noted that the communications in is,those documents that the cavallaros continued to assert were into three categories notes from the december,meeting addressing transfer tax issues communications arising from the meeting and subsequent communications addressing the merger of the two companies.id.at.these same categories of documents remain at issue 
the district court reasoned that the documents were not privileged under kovel,because the cavallaros had failed to demonstrate that one of the key elements of a kovel privilege was met that is,the cavallaros had not shown that ernst young role was to facilitate communications,between the cavallaros and hale and dorr,made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.cavallaro,d at.the case does not fit into the kovel paradigm,the district court held,because ernst young,at all times,acted as an agent of camelot and the sons,not as an agent of hale and dorr or the cavallaros.id.at.
as to the argument,the district court concluded that,at the december,meeting,and going forward,hale and dorr represented only the cavallaros,and possibly knight,but not the sons or camelot.id.at.therefore,the district court held that,u nder the strict confines of the doctrine,the lack of representation for the remaining parties vitiates any claim to a privilege.id.b ecause only one party to this purported arrangement was represented by counsel,the district court held,there is no valid claim of privilege under the doctrine.id.at 
on an appeal respecting a privilege claim,the standard of review depends on the issue.united states.inst.of,cir.we review district court rulings on questions of law de novo we review district court fact findings for clear error and we review discretionary judgments such as evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.id.here the parties contest the formulation of both the kovel doctrine and the doctrine,legal questions which we review de novo.the parties also contest the district court findings of fact.indeed,the cavallaros assert that the district court found no facts,a claim which is an overstatement.
neither the united states constitution,nor any federal statute,nor any supreme court rule governs the proper scope of the privilege in this case.nor does state law provide the rule of decision.states that in such cases,the issue shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience.
before discussing exceptions to the privilege,and exceptions to those exceptions,we first lay out the essential elements of the privilege,as described by wigmore and previously endorsed by this court 
where legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such,the communications relating to that purpose,made in confidence by the client,are at his instance permanently protected from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser,except the protection be waived.
wigmore,evidence,at mcnaughton,quoted in.inst.of,at.
the rationale for the privilege is that safeguarding communications between attorney and client encourages disclosures by the client to the lawyer that facilitate the client compliance with the law and better enable the client to present legitimate arguments should litigation arise.inst.of,at.the privilege is well established indeed,it first appeared in the sixteenth century,rice,privilege in the united states,at ed,and it is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law,upjohn united states,d see also wigmore,supra,at.we note,but do not rely on,the doctrine of construing the privilege narrowly,which has particular force in the context of irs investigations given the congressional policy choice in favor of disclosure of all information relevant to a legitimate irs inquiry.united states arthur young,d.even in other contexts,there is a more general reason for construing the privilege narrowly the belief that t he investigation of truth and the enforcement of testimonial duty demand the restriction,not the expansion,of these privileges.wigmore,supra,at see also in re grand jury subpoena,cir t he privilege applies only to the extent necessary to achieve its underlying goal of ensuring effective representation through open communication between lawyer and client.
in contrast to the privilege,no confidential privilege exists under federal law.couch united states,d,quoted in arthur young,at.see also united states arthur andersen,cir declining to depart from couch general rule.the parties to this litigation recognize as much,but agree,correctly,that communications are privileged if they meet the traditional requirements of the privilege.with this foundation laid,we turn to the cavallaros privilege claims.
the cavallaros argue that the privilege protects the three categories of subpoenaed documents,all of which are in ernst young possession.for a communication to be covered by the privilege,the communication must be made in confidence.wigmore,supra,at.another requirement is that the privilege not be waived.id.the presence of third parties during an communication is often sufficient to undermine the made in confidence requirement,weinstein federal evidence mclaughlin,ed,or to waive the privilege,epstein,the privilege and the doctrine,ed.
here,however,the cavallaros invoke two doctrines to support their claim that disclosing the subpoenaed documents to ernst young neither undermined the confidentiality requirement nor waived the privilege.first,they say that the documents were all created or received by ernst young after it began to assist hale and dorr in rendering legal advice and so the documents fall under the kovel doctrine,which they characterize as holding that the presence of some third parties that are necessary,or at least highly useful,to facilitating communication does not destroy the privilege.at.second,they say that the documents fall within what they call the privilege.the cavallaros bear the burden of establishing that the privilege is a defense to the enforcement of the irs summons,but,if the privilege is established,the government bears the burden of showing that the privilege is defeated by an exception.fed.deposit ins.ogden,cir.
generally,disclosing communications to a third party undermines the privilege.united states ackert,cir stating that the privilege generally applies only to communications between the attorney and the client weinstein federal evidence,supra,at epstein,supra,at.an exception to this general rule exists for third parties employed to assist a lawyer in rendering legal advice.standard weinstein federal evidence,supra,at a and b.in kovel,the second circuit held that,because the complexities of modern existence prevent attorneys from effectively handling clients affairs without the help of others,the privilege must include all the persons who act as the attorney agents.at quoting wigmore,supra,at 
this logic applies to accountants t he presence of an accountant,whether hired by the lawyer or by the client,while the client is relating a complicated tax story to the lawyer,ought not destroy the privilege when the accountant is necessary,or at least highly useful,for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.id.at.the communication,however,must be made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the lawyer.id.if what is sought is not legal advice but only accounting service,or if the advice sought is the accountant rather than the lawyer,no privilege exists.see also united states adlman,cir.
the district court concluded that kovel requires that either the cavallaros,knight,or hale and dorr hired ernst young for the purpose of facilitating a legal communication with hale and dorr.cavallaro,d at.it said that the cavallaros must show that ernst young was an agent of hale and dorr,knight or the cavallaros.id.at.we know that such a showing is not sufficient to sustain the privilege as the district court recognized,an attorney,merely by placing an accountant on her payroll,does not,by this action alone,render communications between the attorney client and the accountant privileged id.at kovel,at.we need not reach the question
