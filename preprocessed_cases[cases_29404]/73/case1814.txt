section of the property tax code code defines taxable property as t he land itself,with all things contained therein,and also all buildings,structures and improvements,and other permanent fixtures thereon,and all rights and privileges belonging or pertaining thereto,except where otherwise specified by this code.ilcs west.in the instant case,petitioner kankakee county board of review assessed the property of respondent natural gas pipeline company of america taxpayer for the tax years of and.in its assessments,petitioner included the value of the rights and privileges taxpayer enjoys to two gas storage reservoirs that lie under the surface property of others.taxpayer appealed these assessments before the property tax appeal board ptab which found that the rights and privileges to the reservoirs should not have been assessed to taxpayer property.the ptab then reduced the property assessed value for each year.the appellate court confirmed the decision of the ptab.
we granted petitioner petition for leave to appeal and permitted the central illinois public service company,central illinois light company,centerpoint river transmission corporation,commonwealth edison company,illinois power company,invenergy investment company llc,magellan pipeline company,northern illinois gas company,nicor gas,north shore gas company,and the peoples gas light and coke company to file a brief amici curiae in support of taxpayer.we have also permitted the illinois telecommunications association to file a brief amicus curiae in support of all respondents.for the reasons that follow,we find that the rights and privileges to the reservoirs should not be included in the assessment of taxpayer property,and affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
taxpayer,a subsidiary of kinder morgan,a kansas corporation,owns a parcel of land in kankakee county hereinafter,the subject property on which it operates a multibuilding control center.the control center,known as compressor station,facilitates the piping of gas to a pipeline miles away and the storage of natural gas in two underground storage facilities.the underground storage facilities,known as reservoirs,are actually two separate layers of porous rock lying and feet below the surface,respectively.these reservoirs lie below approximately surface acres that surround and include the subject property.taxpayer owns the portion of the reservoirs that lies directly below the subject property,but does not own any of the surrounding acres or the reservoirs that lie below them.
for storage purposes,natural gas is injected into the reservoirs through a system of pipes that connect the pipeline to the compressor station,and connect the compressor station with wells that reach down into the reservoirs at various surface points throughout the acres.the injected gas displaces the water that naturally occurs within the porous rock.the displaced water then creates a natural vessel which keeps the gas from escaping laterally.the gas is prevented from exiting to the surface by a layer of nonporous rock that is likened to an soup bowl.the injection process is reversed when gas is removed from the reservoirs.taxpayer charges its customers monthly reservation charges and tariffs based on gas volume transported.
in the early,before it acquired the subject property or began construction of the compressor station,taxpayer secured voluntary easements from the owners of the land that lay above and included the reservoirs so that it could install and operate the wells and pipes used in its storage system.the easements taxpayer acquired are similar for each granting owner.an easement identified as the dickman easement,which was found to be representative by the ptab,reads in pertinent part this instrument made this date by record owner name of the fee landowner,herein referred to as grantors,is in favor of natural gas storage company of illinois,a delaware corporation,herein referred to as grantee.the easements give taxpayer,as grantee,the exclusive right,privilege and easement to introduce natural gas or other gases or vapors into the reservoirs to store gas in said storage reservoir and retain the possession of gas so stored as personal property,and to remove gas from the storage reservoir.
the easements also give taxpayer the right to drill wells,construct and maintain those wells,lay pipes and electric lines on the grantees properties,and to enter onto the grantees properties to maintain the wells and pipes.in return,taxpayer pays each landowner an annual monetary sum.taxpayer also agrees to pay the landowners for any damage to crops,timber,or fences that its activities may cause,and to provide grantees with free city water.
in,orders from the illinois commerce commission icc and federal power commission fpc gave taxpayer the exclusive right to store gas in the reservoirs,to construct compressor station,to run approximately miles of pipe from compressor station to the pipeline,to dig the wells down to the reservoirs,and to lay the pipe that connects the wells with compressor station once the fpc and icc orders were in place,taxpayer purchased the subject property from otto kruse and constructed compressor station.operations began thereafter and continue to this day.
petitioner assessed the subject property based on market values of for the tax year of,and for the tax year of.market value is defined by the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice as the most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale,the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably,and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.
taxpayer paid the taxes in full for each year,and then appealed both the and assessments to the ptab.these appeals were consolidated.before the ptab,taxpayer submitted several other appraisals of the subject property,all of which estimated its market value at between and.kankakee county officials,employees of taxpayer,and the drafters of all the appraisals appeared and testified at two hearings before the ptab in april and may.
at the hearing,brad baker,the assessor for the subject property township,testified that he assessed the subject property for the tax year based on a market value of.he testified that this market value was on the books,and it was just a value that been carried on throughout the years.baker stated that he did not know how any of the previous assessment values,or the cost ladders detailing appreciation,were calculated.
sheila donohoe,the chief county assessment officer for kankakee county,also testified.donohoe testified that she had no record of any complete appraisal of the subject property prior to the year,although adjustments to the valuation of the subject property had been made throughout the years to account for the addition of new buildings and structures.donohoe stated that the county assessment records for the subject property make no reference to the reservoirs,nor attribute a value to them.donohoe also testified that the county does not assess pipelines.
steven beatty,a member of the board of review,testified that petitioner endorsed the market value provided by baker for based on testimony and research that was done and review of information that was available at the hearings that we had,as well as research that we did elsewhere.beatty also testified that petitioner based its assessment on an appraisal of the subject property market value prepared by gary declark and nancy myers of integra realty resources of chicago integra.
integra appraisal was entitled a converted aquifer natural gas storage facility of bcf capacity beneath fee owned acres at west road and inclusive of subterranean easement rights beneath some acres of unowned land.the special limiting conditions section of the appraisal stated,
t he subject storage field actually lies below the surface of some acres of land meanwhile,that land area under fee ownership,according to available public records,is acres,a mere fraction of the total surface area over the storage field.therefore,this analysis assumes that the rights to be considered include the subterranean easement rights for access to and utilization of the storage field across the remaining acres of land not owned in fee title by subject property ownership.
the assumption that the subject property is the beneficiary of easement rights to the reservoirs was repeated and relied upon several times throughout integra appraisal.on,declark admitted that he did not read the gas storage easements before he prepared his appraisal.he also admitted that,upon inspection,the easements name taxpayer as the grantee,and not the subject property,or any specific piece of property.when asked to indicate on a map exactly where the parcels burdened by easements were,declark was unable to do so.declark also admitted that portions of the reservoirs extend into iroquois county,and that his appraisal did not take that fact into account.
declark testified that he believed taxpayer easements,along with the permits and certifications from the icc and fpc,created a bundle of rights that met the unit rule test of common ownership,which is why he included them in the valuation.declark defined the unit rule as a rule in real estate valuation that requires the value of the property in its entirety or its whole to be valued as an entity,rather than the summation of the various parts to which it may have been divided.the unit rule should be applied,declark stated,if a common use,common ownership,and contiguity are all present in the property being appraised.declark explained that,in applying the unit rule to the subject property,he looked at the relationship between the reservoirs and the subject property and found a common use and contiguity because the entire entity of taxpayer facility,which incorporates the buildings,the acres and the subterranean easement rights to use the aquifer for gas storage is the use.declark stated that the common ownership requirement of the unit rule was met because taxpayer owns the land in fee and also owns the buildings thereon,but it also has a portion of the bundle of rights that ascribe to it from the use of the reservoirs.on,declark admitted that he did not mention the unit rule in his appraisal but considered it implicit in the valuation analysis that he conducted.
declark appraisal valued the subject property under three different methods the cost approach,the income approach,and the property tax valuation method.under the cost approach,the appraisal valued the replacement cost of the reservoirs,main buildings,ancillary buildings,wellheads,tanks,fencing,and dikes,then detailed their values given minus the appropriate depreciation and obsolescence costs,and arrived at a cost approach market value of.
for the income approach,declark appraisal used a discounted cash flow analysis.declark stated that such an analysis take s a look at the anticipation of future benefits to get a present value calculation or value conclusion.in applying this analysis,the appraisal noted that the subject is a special use facility with an income stream tied directly to the capacity of an underground storage vessel.on,declark admitted that he was unable to acquire income data specific to the subject property,but that he calculated a proportionate share of taxpayer total storage income and assumed it to be applicable to the storage facility in question.the appraisal did this by considering the storage facility capacity,location,and customer base as compared to taxpayer total gas storage capacity and the locations of its other storage fields.after arriving at a net operating income,declark appraisal applied a royalty percentage to the income stream based on his research of landfills,which he deemed similar in that they are land based as is this underground storage vessel.the appraisal then estimated market value for the income approach at.
on,declark stated that,for the property tax methodology,he used a system based on how taxation of depleted gas fields occurs in ohio.the ohio method calls for the property owner to pay a tax predicated upon the plant,buildings,and wells,as well as the volume of gas in the reservoir.these values are then depreciated accordingly to arrive at an assessed value.in applying this system to the subject property,declark arrived at a value of.as to the ohio method,declark admitted on that he was not sure if depleted gas fields in ohio were assessed and taxed as real estate or personal property.declark also testified that he was aware that the property tax approach is not currently applicable in illinois.according to declark,he implemented it in his appraisal as a check of reasonableness.
the integra appraisal then reconciled the values from the cost approach,the income approach,and the property tax methodology,and arrived at a market value of.
in support of their appeal before the ptab,respondent taxpayer presented several appraisals of the subject property,all of which estimated its market value at between and.two of these appraisals were created by howard richter associates,of deerfield.the valuation dates for the richter appraisals were january,and january.the richter appraisals identified the subject property as natural gas pipeline company of america,storage facility.richter appraisals detailed the characteristics of the subject property and all of its buildings,and mentioned that the underground storage facility is controlled through easements with the neighboring farm owners but did not attribute those easements to the value of the property.
richter appraisals applied only the cost approach,and arrived at an estimated value of for and for.a passage in one appraisal explained richter reasoning for not using the income approach.it stated,no rental attributable to the real estate alone can be ascertained and the basis of this approach is negated.when about this statement,richter replied,any income generated by the ability to tap into this aquifer is attributable to the business and exists only because of the business operations of this company and t he market value of the real estate in this case has virtually no relationship to the income generated as a result of this property operations.richter then likened the storage of gas to the storage of files in a warehouse.in each business,he explained,the customer does not care where their files or gas are stored,but only that the files or gas are transported away from the business,stored safely,and returned or delivered when the need arises.according to richter,the location of the storage facility is immaterial in each case and,therefore,the property itself can not be said to have contributed in any way to the income of the business.
respondent taxpayer also submitted appraisals done by robert herman and michael kelly of real estate analysis corporation.herman appraisals were dated january,and january.kelly appraisal was dated january.each document appraised only the subject property and its improvements.herman and kelly testified that,for their appraisals,they used only the cost approach and the sales comparison approach.kelly stated that he did not utilize the income approach because taxpayer could conduct its operations away from the subject property,including in iroquois county.herman stated that he did not include the value of the easements because they related to the going concern of the business,and not to the subject property.each appraiser testified that they were aware that the entire facility was constructed to utilize the reservoirs,and that easements and government permits were essential to the creation of the facility.however,in their opinion,neither of these factors added any value to the subject property.both appraisers noted that an analysis of the assessments of other parcels which sit atop the reservoirs showed no added value as a result of their location.herman appraisal estimated the value of the subject property at for each year,and kelly appraisal arrived at a figure of.
floyd hofstetter,the vice president of storage management for taxpayer,then testified in depth about the history and current operations of the compressor station and its connection to the pipeline miles away.his testimony touched on such details as the monitoring of the facility,managing the containment of the stored gas,the makeup and installation of the well network,the geological characteristics of the aquifer,the deliverability rate of the two reservoirs,the cost estimates that should be accounted for in the development of a gas storage field,and descriptions of the compressor,gas processing equipment,and piping.hofstetter confirmed that taxpayer had to obtain a certificate of convenience from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc the successor to fpc to operate the facility and that the rates taxpayer charges for storage are regulated by ferc.
over petitioner objection,patrick mcfadden,a professor from loyola school of law,testified about the difference between easements appurtenant and easements in gross.according to mcfadden,easements appurtenant benefit a designated property and run with the land.conversely,easements in gross accrue not to property,but to an individual or entity.mcfadden testified that he had examined the dickman easement,and determined it to be an easement in gross which benefitted taxpayer.
during the hearing,petitioner attempted to have the ptab compel the testimony of donald puckett.petitioner referred to puckett as taxpayer district manager,but in actuality puckett is the operations manager of the plant on the subject property.petitioner felt that puckett testimony was necessary because he was the tour guide and source of some information for declark when declark visited the facility during the course of his assessment.petitioner motion requesting that the ptab subpoena puckett was denied.
at the conclusion of the hearings,the ptab found that petitioner erred in relying on the declark appraisal for its valuation of the subject property.in its decision,the ptab noted that petitioner failed to provide any evidence that illinois law authorizes application of the unit rule to the subject property,or that it was appropriate to include the reservoirs in the valuation of the subject property.the ptab noted that its decision was based on the fact that portions of the reservoirs were in iroquois county,that the subject easements did not run with the subject property,that petitioner failed to establish any sort of legal nexus between the government permits and the subject property,and that declark appraisal contained several errors.the ptab also held that petitioner failed to adequately describe the reservoirs it wished to be included in the valuation of the subject property.the ptab found that no weight could be given to declark appraisal and instead deemed kelly appraisal to be the most appropriate.the ptab concluded that the market value of the subject property was.
with one justice dissenting,the appellate court confirmed the decision of the ptab.the appellate court held that petitioner failed to adequately describe the reservoirs it proposed to include in its valuation,and failed to provide any authority to support its contentions that the easements and government permits that accrued to taxpayer benefitted the subject property.unpublished order under supreme court rule.this appeal followed.
before this court,petitioner characterizes the main issue of this case as the proper interpretation of section of the code,which holds that taxable real estate includes all rights and privileges belonging or pertaining thereto.ilcs west.as this is an issue of statutory interpretation,petitioner contends de novo review is proper.petitioner also contends that the appropriate property tax assessment methodology is at issue as well,and that this too should be reviewed de novo.
respondents argue that this case involves a mixed question of law and fact.respondents admit that the ptab was required not only to construe the meaning of section of the code,which is a question of law to be reviewed de novo.however,respondents claim that the ptab also had to make factual findings as to whether there was some basis for each appraiser valuations.respondents then contend that the ptab had to apply these facts to determine whether the right to store gas in the reservoirs was a right attributable to the subject property.according to respondents,this application should be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.
we initially note that we are not charged with the responsibility of determining the market value of the subject property.rather,the central question before us is whether the ptab decision to reduce petitioner tax assessments for the and tax years was correct.the determination turns on whether petitioner employed a proper valuation method in assessing the subject property.more particularly,it turns on whether the easements,governmental permits,and rights to utilize the reservoirs for gas storage should be considered rights and privileges belonging or pertaining to the subject property.accordingly,our first determination is one of statutory construction,which is reviewed de novo.fisher waldrop.following that,we must determine whether the ptab considered appraisals that utilized the proper methodology for the valuation of the subject property.this,too,is a legal question to be reviewed de novo.kankakee county board of review property tax appeal board.see also united airlines,pappas,d,this appeal requires us to examine the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used by taxpayer expert in valuing the leasehold interest to support its objection to the leasehold assessed value.therefore,our standard of review relating to the question of law at issue in this appeal is de novo board of review property tax appeal board,d,where the propriety of the method of valuation is challenged the issue is one of law.
belonging or pertaining 
section of the code defines taxable property as t he land itself,with all things contained therein,and also all buildings,structures and improvements,and other permanent fixtures thereon,and all rights and privileges belonging or pertaining thereto,except where otherwise specified by this code.ilcs west.petitioner contends that,by choosing to include the words belonging or pertaining in the definition,the general assembly intended another property right short of fee simple ownership.
in construing a statute,we must give effect to the intention of the legislature so that each word,clause,or sentence is given reasonable meaning and not deemed superfluous or void.quad cities open,city of silvis.a tax statute must be strictly construed against the government and in favor of the taxpayer.van material department of revenue,gem electronics of monmouth,department of revenue.
the primary meaning,and also the common and ordinary meaning,of the word belong,is to be the property of.in re estate of ostrowski,d.see also black law dictionary ed defining belong as t o be the property of a person or thing.petitioner maintains that,if belonging connotes ownership of rights or privileges,the disjunctive reference to pertaining in section of the code must indicate something different and broader than mere ownership of said rights and privileges.pertain is defined as t o relate to to concern.black law dictionary ed.
there is no dispute by either party that the reservoirs at issue belong,proportionately,to those who own the surface land directly above them.see jilek chicago,wilmington franklin coal,the owner in fee owns to the center of the earth.petitioner argues,however,that the easements and governmental permits that allow taxpayer to utilize the portions of the reservoirs not under the subject property make up a bundle of rights that pertains to the subject property,thus enhancing its value beyond that of the neighboring industrial or farming property.
according to respondents,all of petitioners arguments contain the same fundamental flaw incorrectly assuming that the gas storage rights that taxpayer obtained and exercised benefitted the subject property,and not taxpayer business.we agree with respondents and find that,while pertain,for purposes of section of the code,might imply a less rigid connection than belong,there still must be some direct relationship between the rights and the property at issue.for the following reasons,we find that petitioner has not established such a relationship.
the first components of the bundle of rights which petitioner contends pertain to the subject property are the easements that allow taxpayer to operate its pipes and wells on the acres of property owned by others that surrounds compressor station.petitioner concedes that these easements are easements in gross that name taxpayer,and not the subject property,as their beneficiary,but maintains that the classification of the easements is irrelevant because the easements provide only part of the basis for taxpayer exclusive storage rights.petitioner argues that,because the easements are only part of the bundle of rights,their classification is not determinative.further,according to petitioner,there is no legal authority to support the contention that easements in gross may not be considered as rights and privileges of a particular property.
an easement appurtenant is created to benefit another tract of land,the use of easement being incident to the ownership of that other tract.black law dictionary ed.an easement appurtenant runs with the land and may be transferred.traylor parkinson.an easement in gross is defined as a n easement benefiting a particular person and not a particular piece of land.black law dictionary ed.see also traylor,at,easement in gross is personal and nontransferable.
the dickman easement,found to be representative,reads,this instrument made this date by record owner name of the fee landowner,herein referred to as grantors,is in favor of natural gas storage company of illinois,a delaware corporation,herein referred to as grantee.such wording clearly indicates that these easements are in gross,and benefit taxpayer rather than the subject property,as petitioner concedes.
we find,contrary to petitioner unsupported argument,that the classification of the easements in question is relevant here.were the easements at issue here appurtenant,naming the subject property as the beneficiary of the right to place wells and pipes on the land of others,then such right would be attributed to the subject property and assessable by petitioner.the easements in question,however,are easements in gross,benefitting taxpayer,and not the subject property.petitioner contention that the legal effect of the easements is somehow negated by the fact that they are part of a bundle of rights has no support in logic or the law.accordingly,we find that the easements in question do not pertain to the subject property.
icc and fpc permits 
petitioner next argues that certain passages in the orders of the icc and fpc,as well as taxpayer correspondence with those agencies,serve as evidence that the rights and privileges to the reservoirs that accrued to the taxpayer pertain to the subject property.petitioner initially notes that the september order of the fpc,which granted taxpayer the right to construct compressor station and utilize the reservoirs,includes the words storage rights in approximately acres together with all necessary and appropriate consents,permits,contracts,easements,and other interests in property pertaining to or used in connection with the storage project.petitioner notes that the fpc used the term pertaining,which is the statutory term at issue here.petitioner argues that the ptab incorrectly concluded that the method of assessing the subject property may not take account of these pertaining underground storage rights.
petitioner also details the history of the creation of compressor station and the use of the reservoirs,concluding that the history of regulatory approvals leading to the development of the gas storage project shows that the reservoirs were intended to be operated as a single facility which would necessarily be managed and controlled from one control center,wherever constructed.in support of its contention,petitioner cites two orders from the icc and fpc,each granting taxpayer the right to acquire ownership in fee simple or by other estate of parcels of real estate within or adjacent to the storage area necessary for the erection of compression plants,dehydration plants,and any structures appurtenant thereto,and lay gathering lines to connect them to the centrally located compressor station and dehydration plant.petitioner also relies on a supplemental order from the icc as well as a legal notice that ran in the kankakee daily journal.these provide that taxpayer owns and operates under authority of certificates of public convenience and necessity issued to it by the fpc an underground storage reservoir near herscher.
petitioner asserts that these passages from the recorded history of regulatory approval leading up to the development of the gas storage operation show plainly that the reservoirs were intended to be operated in union with a compressor station located in their vicinity.petitioner contends that,since compressor station is located on the subject property,the subject property can not then be separated from the reservoirs for valuation purposes.
illinois case law is consistent in holding that government permits,ordinances,licenses,orders,or regulatory approvals do not create assessable entities.see,boland walters,a license in respect to real property is merely a privilege to do certain things on land without being an estate itself dimucci home builders,metropolitan life insurance,d,permits are not conveyances of title pasquinelli village of mundelein,d,permits and village board approvals to operate a sewer line are not indicia of ownership.
central illinois public service swartz,is instructive.in swartz,the plaintiff was granted,by ordinance,the right to construct and maintain an electric plant as well as electric poles and wires in the town of bushnell.swartz,at.when the property of the plaintiff was assessed for taxation,the assessor included the franchise,got through an ordinance of the city of bushnell,to operate a plant in the city.swartz,at.the swartz court rejected the assessment of the franchise as tangible property.swartz,at.specifically,it stated,
this permission or license exists independently of the poles,wire,apparatus,machinery or other means whereby it may be available.it attaches not to the tangible property of the corporation but to the franchise,and would remain and be available to the corporation if all its tangible property were destroyed.swartz,at.
in the instant case,all of the icc and fpc orders attached to taxpayer,and not to the subject property.just as in swartz,should the taxpayer choose to leave the subject property,or suffer any destruction of its tangible property,the orders would remain in place,continuing to benefit taxpayer regardless of where its property was located.see also quantum pipeline illinois commerce comm n,d,permit issued by the icc grants only a business right,not one of property.accordingly,we find that the icc and fpc orders did not,as petitioner alleges,create an indivisible union between the subject property and the reservoirs.rather,the rights to the reservoirs accrue to taxpayer,and do not pertain to the subject property.
we note that petitioner attempts to draw an analogy between governmental orders such as those at issue in the instant case and property zoning.petitioner argues that,just as zoning changes can affect the use of property and therefore its value,the rights to use the reservoir,which arise from easements and governmental rulings which have transpired over years,enhance the value of the subject property.we find no merit in this argument.
zoning regulations apply to particular properties and not their owners.see lake forest chateau,city of lake forest,zoning ordinances apply to property.as noted,the government orders at issue here accrue to taxpayer and not the subject property.accordingly,petitioner analogy to zoning is unpersuasive.
in light of our holdings above regarding easements and government permits,we find that the rights and privileges taxpayer enjoys to the reservoirs neither belong nor pertain to the subject property for purposes of section of the code.
ii.location 
petitioner next contends that regardless of whether the rights and privileges to the reservoirs are tied to it through any recorded basis or legal title,the
