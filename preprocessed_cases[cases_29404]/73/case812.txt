joseph mcgraw appeals the decision of the united states tax court finding him liable for the tax deficiencies,including fraud penalties,of metro refuse,metro for tax years ending on june,and.we affirm.
metro was a minnesota corporation that provided waste disposal services to commercial customers in the.paul area.william butler was the founder of the company and its chief executive officer and majority shareholder during the relevant time.butler job duties included business development,acquisitions,expansion planning,and assisting with the financial management of the business.joseph mcgraw started working as general manager for metro in.in,mcgraw became the president of metro.butler was the sole shareholder until mcgraw bought percent of butler metro shares in june.in both his general manager and president capacities,mcgraw handled the operations of metro and served as its chief financial person.specifically,he supervised the accounting department and was personally responsible for maintaining the general ledger and preparing the balance sheets,income statements,and tax returns.
during the three taxable years in question,and,metro engaged in two schemes that resulted in the omission of gross receipts from metro income tax returns and the taking of fictitious deductions.the first scheme scheme i involved metro provision of loading services to poor richards,another service operated by richard wybierala.when metro sent poor richards invoices for these services,poor richards issued checks payable to metro or a defunct waste hauler called village sanitation.wybierala,however,endorsed the checks using butler name and gave the cash directly to butler.over the period,the checks issued as part of scheme i totaled.metro did not report the cash from poor richards as taxable income on its tax returns.
mcgraw was aware that metro tax returns for the period did not include any gross receipts for the subcontracting work it performed for poor richards.according to mcgraw and butler,however,the receipts were properly deductible from income by metro as salary paid to butler or business expenses of metro.they say that poor richards paid butler in cash,so that butler could receive additional compensation in order to avoid paying personal income taxes,and so he could pay for certain metro wage,spare part,repair,and kickback expenses in cash.despite their contention that the cash was used for butler salary and metro business expenses,however,metro did not report this compensation or these business expenses as deductions on its income tax filings.
the second scheme scheme ii,which began in,entailed metro issuing checks to poor richards for subcontract work,and wybierala of poor richards cashing the checks and giving the money to butler.the amount of each transaction was always less than,which avoided federal reporting requirements.again,butler allegedly used the money to augment his personal income,to make kickback payments to a landfill employee,and to purchase items for metro.
in and,scheme ii resulted in butler receiving.to carry out this scheme,mcgraw created false vouchers,and the metro accounts payable staff recorded the transactions as accounts payable.as a result,metro reported these payments as deductible subcontract business expenses rather than as compensation to butler.at the time of filing,mcgraw was aware that metro tax returns for the and tax years overstated the amount of deductions for subcontracting expenses.for tax year,the proceeds from scheme ii totaled.instead of continuing to report this amount as a subcontracting service deduction,metro claims that it consulted with legal counsel and reclassified of these payments as a deduction for butler compensation.
in august,metro entered into an agreement with browning ferris industries,bfi in which all of metro assets were sold to bfi minnesota subsidiary bfim.in return,bfi assumed metro debt and transferred shares of bfi stock to metro.metro and its stockholders,butler and mcgraw agreed not to compete with bfi in the twin cities for a period of five years.on december,as part of its plan of liquidation,metro distributed and the bfi stock to butler and mcgraw,who at that time owned percent and percent of metro shares,respectively.accordingly,butler received shares and mcgraw received.metro filed its articles of dissolution on december.
according to mcgraw,since metro dissolution,butler and mcgraw have paid other tax deficiencies and penalties owed by metro.mcgraw testified that in and,butler and mcgraw paid the irs and the minnesota department of revenue for additional taxes,penalties,and interest that metro owed for tax years through.he averred that the total amount butler and mcgraw had to expend,including legal fees,was.also,in,butler pled guilty to filing a false individual income tax return and aiding and abetting the filing of a false corporate tax return on behalf of metro.as part of this plea agreement,butler admitted filing false individual tax returns,and aiding and abetting the filing of false corporate tax returns for metro,in,and.
on november,the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner issued separate notices of tax liability to mcgraw and butler.the total liability alleged for tax deficiencies,fraud penalties,and interest was.mcgraw and butler filed petitions with the united states tax court challenging the commissioner notices of liability.in his amended answer,the commissioner alleged an additional deficiency of for the tax year,and asserted that the reclassified officer compensation deduction taken in was also subject to the fraud penalty.mcgraw and butler contested the notices of liability in tax court.
after a trial,the tax court issued a decision upholding the majority of the commissioner notices of liability,and finding that mcgraw and butler were jointly and severally liable for the following amounts 
mcgraw raises numerous issues on appeal relating to the calculation of the tax deficiencies,the imposition of fraud penalties,the finding of transferee liability,and the total amount of transferee liability.we review the tax court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.howard clendenen,comm r,cir.
first,we consider whether the tax court erred in finding that metro submitted fraudulent income tax returns for the tax years ending june,and,and was thereby subject to fraud penalties pursuant to b,b,and.the finding of fraud is also pertinent to whether the commissioner timely filed its notices of liability in.see a,c a tax assessment can not be imposed three years after the return was filed unless it was a false or fraudulent return filed with the intent to evade tax.it is the commissioner burden to establish the taxpayer fraud by clear and convincing evidence.id.a scallen comm r,cir.the tax court finding of fraud is an issue of fact,which will be overturned only if it is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,or if it is clearly erroneous or induced by an erroneous view of the law.scallen,at.we hold that the tax court finding of fraud was not clearly erroneous.
tax fraud is established when a taxpayer engages in intentional wrongdoing and has the specific purpose to evade taxes the taxpayer knows or believes to be owing.day comm r,cir.mcgraw claims that there was no evidence that metro possessed the requisite specific intent to evade any income tax liability.although metro knew the tax returns were false because they omitted the scheme i income and claimed the scheme ii deductions,mcgraw argues that unclaimed deductions for additional compensation to butler and his payment of kickbacks and business expenses from these funds undermine the tax court finding that metro intended to evade taxes.
because fraudulent intent is rarely established by direct evidence,it may be established through circumstantial evidence.scallen,at.accordingly,we look for badges of fraud to determine whether there is substantial circumstantial evidence to support a finding of specific intent to evade taxes.id.such intent 
may be inferred from conduct such as keeping a double set of books,making false entries of alterations,or false invoices or documents,destruction of books or records,concealment of assets or covering up sources of income,handling of one affairs to avoid making the records usual in transactions of the kind,and any conduct,the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.
spies united states.our court has said that a consistent pattern of sizeable underreporting of income,inadequate records,and unsatisfactory explanations for such underreporting also can establish fraud.scallen,at lessmann comm r,cir.in a case cited by mcgraw,the ninth circuit also recognized failing to cooperate with tax authorities and using cash to avoid scrutiny of finances as additional badges of fraud.bradford comm r,cir.
upon review of the record,we find abundant circumstantial evidence supporting the tax court finding of fraudulent intent.the amounts of money at issue are substantial of unreported income and of fictitious deductions.scheme i had begun by and involved the maintenance of a separate set of invoices,which were incomplete and deliberately excluded from metro computerized accounting system.similarly,scheme ii involved the manipulation of metro accounting system for three years by creating false vouchers for the subcontracting work purportedly performed by poor richards and submitting those false vouchers to the accounts payable staff in order to deduct the phony costs.the transactions in both of these schemes involved exchanges of cash in amounts less than.see a business is required to report to the federal government all transactions in excess of.neither butler nor mcgraw informed the irs or the minnesota department of revenue about the underreporting of income or the overstatements of deductions during audits in and.specifically,metro misrepresented to the minnesota department of revenue that the deductions taken as a result of scheme ii were for hauling services.
despite these badges of fraud,mcgraw contends that metro did not have the requisite specific intent to evade its taxes because the purpose of the omitted income and false deductions was to evade butler personal income taxes,not metro corporate tax.this argument is unpersuasive it actually supports a finding of fraudulent intent.a concession with regard to butler individual taxes is pregnant with the admission that metro had a similar intention with respect to its own taxes.see koscove comm r,cir taxpayers admission that their understatement of income was for the purpose of misleading local tax authorities and evading local taxes further supported a finding of fraud internal quotation omitted.metro intent to assist butler in evading his personal income taxes,which necessarily involved deceiving government officials with regard to its own income,constitutes another badge of fraud supporting a finding of fraudulent intent.see hecht comm r,wl finding fraud where taxpayer claimed he intended to deceive employer rather than irs,but knew his actions would necessarily deceive government officials as well.
mcgraw also contends that metro specific intent to evade its taxes was negated by its good faith objectively reasonable or any unreported income was offset by the deductions it did not take with regard to butler compensation.see cheek united states,d a taxpayer entitled to reasonable deduction for compensation for services actually rendered.before determining whether his belief was in good faith,it is necessary to determine whether the payments to butler were even intended to be compensation.whitcomb comm r,cir it is now settled law that only if payment is made with the intent to compensate is it deductible as compensation.internal quotation and citation omitted.we agree with the tax court that there was substantial evidence that metro did not intend the payments to butler to be additional compensation.metro did not report any of the cash payments to butler on its employment tax returns,withhold employment taxes,or issue a form or form with respect to the payments.further,butler used the payments to pay metro business expenses and kickbacks to a landfill owner,which is inconsistent with an inference that the money was personal compensation.moreover,there was no evidence that the amount butler received from these in and reasonably related to his duties as an officer of the company,considering that he already received a reported compensation of approximately per year.see a allowance for salaries and compensation must be reasonable.
although the badges of fraud identified above continued into the tax year,mcgraw contends that two additional circumstances negate a finding of fraud in that year.first,mcgraw argues that the omission of income from scheme i for tax year,totaling,was inadvertent because mcgraw believed the scheme had ended before the beginning of the tax year.the record reflects,however,that scheme i ended in august second month of the tax poor richards sold its routes to metro.in view of the continued manipulation of metro accounting system,the substantial amount of money involved,and the use of cash transactions totaling less than,the tax court was not obligated to accept mcgraw denial of intent for the tax year.see paul kummer realty comm r,cir the tax court is the judge of the credibility of witnesses and is not compelled to accept the testimony of a witness even if it is not contradicted.in addition,butler admitted in his criminal plea agreement that during the tax year he knew that the corporate tax returns were materially false in that the returns omitted subcontracting income that was earned by the corporation.this is further evidence that at least one of the corporate officers of metro had the specific intent to evade metro taxes in.see ruidoso racing ass n,comm r,cir fraud of shareholder could be imputed to corporation where it produced tax benefit for corporation.the tax court did not err in finding that the scheme i income was subject to a fraud penalty.
second,mcgraw contends that in,he relied on the advice of counsel regarding the reporting of the scheme ii subcontracting deductions,totaling.he claims that after consulting with counsel,he reclassified the subcontracting deductions as officer compensation deductions.according to mcgraw,his reliance on the advice of counsel negates any intent he had to evade taxes in,and metro should not be subject to a fraud penalty.good faith reliance on expert advice of a tax preparer,an attorney or accountant may be a defense to a tax evasion charge.united states meyer,cir.to establish this defense,however,the taxpayer must demonstrate that it provided the tax preparer with a complete disclosure of all the relevant facts.scallen,at.
we conclude that the tax court did not clearly err by refusing to credit mcgraw good faith reliance defense.there is little or no evidence that mcgraw and butler provided their tax advisors with all relevant information and documentation.although mcgraw testified that he had many conversations with his counsel about properly classifying deductions on metro tax return and told him about schemes i and ii,mcgraw did not specify that he provided all relevant facts to his counsel.specifically,there is no indication that mcgraw told metro attorney about the lack of forms,forms,or board approval for butler alleged compensation,or that the funds paid to butler were used to pay for metro business expenses,including kickbacks.the attorney did not testify before the tax court.based on the evidence presented to the tax court,it was not clearly erroneous for the tax court to find that mcgraw did not fully disclose all necessary information to outside advisors.see meyer,at.
mcgraw raises several arguments challenging the tax court calculation of the tax deficiencies for the three tax years in question.first,mcgraw contends that the tax court should have determined the amount paid in scheme i by poor richards to metro for the services by using metro invoices rather than poor richards returned checks.the invoice total was,whereas the check total was.the commissioner may use any method of computation that,in his opinion,clearly reflects the taxpayer income in the absence of sufficient or reliable records.b rowell comm r,cir day,at.the method of calculating the income is presumptively correct so long as it is rationally based.denison comm r,cir per curiam.if the method is reasonable,then the burden is on the taxpayer to show the determination is wrong.id.
in this case,there was evidence that metro invoices did not provide a reliable basis to determine income.several months of invoices were missing from the period.there also was evidence that the invoices to poor richards were created manually by metro employees rather than by the normal computerized method.the commissioner method of using check receipts issued to metro to establish the amount of metro income for the services is reasonable on its face.scheme i was effectuated through the use of checks issued to metro from poor richards.the checks are therefore a reliable indicator of the income metro received from scheme i.in response,mcgraw failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that the metro invoices are a better measure of money butler received through scheme 
second,mcgraw argues that metro is entitled to deduct the kickback payments butler made to a landfill employee because they were ordinary and necessary business expenses under a.with the cash butler received as a result of schemes i and ii,he made cash payments to robert miller,the manager of burnsville sanitary landfill,in exchange for lower dumping rates.mcgraw had the burden to show that the kickback payments were deductible under a.indopco,comm r,d.
relying on the definition of ordinary in deputy du pont,and united draperies,commissioner,cir,the tax court found that the kickback payments were not normal,usual,or customary,and the transactions which gave rise to these expenses were not of common or frequent occurrence in the type of business involved.add.on that basis,it denied the deduction under a.there is some question whether the tax court employed the proper standard for ordinary expenses,given the supreme court statement that t he principal function of the term ordinary in a is to clarify the distinction,often difficult,between those expenses that are currently deductible and those that are in the nature of capital expenditures,which,if deductible at all,must be amortized over the useful life of the asset.comm r tellier,d see also welch helvering.under this definition,kickbacks in some circumstances have been recognized as ordinary expenses eligible for deduction under a.raymond bertolini truck.comm r,cir.we need not resolve this question,however,because we conclude that the kickback payments were illegal,and thus can not be deducted,even if they were ordinary expenses of the business.
assuming mcgraw established that the kickback payments were deductible as ordinary business expenses,the burden shifts to the commissioner to establish that the kickbacks were illegal under federal or state law.see c.the commissioner also must prove that the federal or state law is generally enforced.id.the minnesota commercial bribery statute provides that 
subdivision definition.corruptly means that the actor intends the action to injure or defraud 
the employer or principal of the person to whom the actor offers,gives or agrees to give the bribe or from whom the actor requests,receives,or agrees to receive the bribe.
subdivision acts constituting.whoever does any of the following,when not consistent with usually accepted business practices,is guilty of commercial bribery and may be sentenced as provided in subdivision 
corruptly offers,gives,or agrees to give,directly or indirectly,any benefit,consideration,compensation,or reward to any employee,agent or fiduciary of a person with the intent to influence the person performance of duties as an employee,agent,or fiduciary in relation to the person employer or principal business.
the tax court holding that this state law is generally enforced was not clearly erroneous.at trial,an assistant county attorney testified that his office prosecuted individuals under the minnesota commercial bribery statute,and there is no policy against enforcing the statute.this evidence was not controverted,and it is sufficient to support the tax court finding on the general enforcement prong of c.
with regard to whether butler kickback payments satisfied the elements of the crime of commercial bribery,there was substantial evidence that butler intended to influence robert miller,an employee of burnsville sanitary landfill,by making cash payments to him so that miller would give metro lower dumping fees.second,there was evidence that butler intended to defraud ed kraemer sons,the owner of the landfill.although butler testified that he believed that making the cash payments to bob miller for a lower rate did not harm the owner,there was evidence that butler knew miller was keeping the money.miller also testified that his retention of the cash payments resulted in a criminal conviction for not reporting the payments on his personal income tax return.further,the president and chief executive officer of ed kraemer sons since,david kraemer,testified that the company did not receive a portion of these payments,and he personally was not aware of the payments to miller 
finally,the tax court finding that such kickbacks were not consistent with usually accepted business practices,subd,was not clearly erroneous.the tax court concluded that paying cash to landfill operators in exchange for lower dumping fees was not a common practice in the twin cities area,and other burnsville customers did not make such payments.this finding is supported by the record.robert miller,the only landfill manager to testify,stated that the only from whom he received cash payments was butler,and that such payments were not a common practice in the industry.kraemer,the owner of the landfill,approximated that the landfill had well over waste hauler customers,and perhaps as many as.in addition,kraemer testified that he was not aware that kickbacks at landfills were a common industry practice.while mcgraw and butler sought to rebut this testimony with hearsay evidence and testimony from one of butler associates that butler practice of cash payments for lower fees was common in the industry,the tax court did not clearly err in resolving this dispute in favor of the commissioner position.in sum,even assuming butler payments to the landfill employee were a business expense under,they were illegal under minnesota law,and metro is therefore not entitled to a business expense deduction for the kickback payments to miller 
next,we address whether mcgraw is subject to transferee liability for metro tax deficiencies and fraud penalties because he was a recipient of metro remaining assets upon its dissolution in.when a taxpayer such as metro transfers its assets to its shareholders,leaving it unable to pay its federal taxes,the federal government may be able to collect those taxes from the shareholder pursuant to.section is merely procedural,however,and the existence and extent of a shareholder liability is determined by state law.comm r stern,d.the commissioner bears the burden to establish whether mcgraw is liable as a transferee.a.
the tax court found mcgraw and butler liable as transferees for metro tax obligations pursuant to the minnesota uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.to,and the minnesota business corporation act mbca,subd.the ufta provides that a transfer is fraudulent,and therefore voidable,when the debtor made the transfer without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer,and the debtor was insolvent at the time or became insolvent as a result of the transfer.id.under the mbca section,a distribution to shareholders is illegal when it results in the corporation not being able to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business.id,subd.the tax court found that under either of these standards,mcgraw and butler were personally liable,because metro distribution of its bfi stock to them without consideration resulted in metro insolvency and its inability to pay tax deficiencies that mcgraw and butler knew to be owing.
mcgraw asserts that it was error to base his liability on the ufta in light of,subdivision d of the mbca,which provides that the ufta is inappli
