under the redevelopment dissolution law,the legislature directed that a dissolved redevelopment agency funds not needed to meet enforceable obligations must be turned over to the county for distribution to local taxing entities.after the california supreme court found that dissolving the redevelopment agencies was an appropriate exercise of the legislature constitutional power,the legislature enacted assembly bill providing what to do if the successor agency or sponsoring agency of the former redevelopment agency did not turn over those funds to the county.one method of enforcing the turnover is for the board of equalization to withhold sales and use tax revenues to which the sponsoring agency is entitled,and another is for the county to withhold property tax revenues to which the sponsoring agency is entitled.
these two cases,consolidated for oral argument and decision,present a facial constitutional challenge whether the statute allowing withholding of sales and use tax revenues and property tax revenues violates proposition,which prohibits the state from reallocating,transferring,or otherwise using revenues from taxes imposed or levied by a local government solely for the local government purposes.we conclude that the statutes are unconstitutional to the extent they allow the state to reallocate,transfer,or otherwise use tax revenue belonging to the local government.
background 
the law on facial constitutional challenges 
this is a facial challenge,not an as applied challenge,to the constitutionality of a statute.therefore,we consider only the text of the statute and not its application to any particular circumstance.tobe city of santa ana cal th.
the test a court must apply in a facial challenge is unclear,as two different tests have been employed.under the stricter test,we uphold the statute unless it conflicts with the constitution in all circumstances.under the more lenient test,we uphold the statute unless it conflicts with the constitution in most circumstances.under either test,the party challenging the constitutionality of the statute bears a heavy burden and can not prevail simply by suggesting a hypothetical in which the application of the statute would be unconstitutional.zuckerman state bd.of chiropractic examiners cal th.
in this case,it does not matter which test is applied because the relevant statute violates proposition under either test.we therefore apply the stricter test whether the challenged statute conflicts with the constitution in all circumstances.
the parties 
under the community redevelopment law,cities and other local government entities could sponsor redevelopment agencies.when the legislature dissolved those redevelopment agencies,many of the sponsoring agencies,such as the plaintiffs in this case,provided for the governance of the successor agencies,and thus were responsible for winding down the former redevelopment agency,paying enforceable obligations,and remitting unencumbered balances to the county for distribution to local taxing entities,such as cities,counties,special districts,and school districts.california redevelopment matosantos cal th,matosantos.successor agencies and sponsoring agencies are separate public entities,even though the sponsoring agency may provide for the governance of successor agency.health,subd.g.
the plaintiffs in these two cases are cities,both in their municipal capacity and as successor agencies of the former redevelopment agencies that they sponsored,joined by the league of california cities,which is an association of more than california cities.since it is unnecessary to differentiate among the plaintiffs in this opinion,we refer to them collectively as the cities.
the principal defendant in these two cases is the state director of finance.other defendants and interveners are the state board of equalization,the state controller,and various local government entities.we refer to these parties collectively as the state,even though some are local governmental entities,unless more specificity is required 
the dispute 
adopted by the voters as proposition in,article xiii,section,subdivision b of the california constitution limits the power of the legislature the legislature may not reallocate,transfer,borrow,appropriate,restrict the use of,or otherwise use the proceeds of any tax imposed or levied by a local government solely for the local government purposes.we refer to this provision as proposition,even though we recognize that there are other provisions in proposition that are not applicable to this case.
the cities challenge health and safety code section,subdivision h,passed as part of assembly bill in.stats,ch.specifically,they contend that the statute violates proposition to the extent the statute allows the state to withhold from the cities their shares of sales and use tax revenue and the county to withhold from the cities their shares of property tax revenues 
the history 
in,after several years in which the legislature raided local governments tax revenue to cover shortages at the state level,california voters passed proposition.that initiative stopped the raids by placing local tax revenues off limits to the legislature.voter information guide,text of.
in,the legislature dissolved redevelopment agencies in california to discontinue the allocation of substantial tax revenues to those agencies.directing the tax revenues away from redevelopment agencies and to local taxing entities including schools helps the state meet its obligation to fund schools.the california supreme court found that dissolving redevelopment agencies was within the legislature constitutional power.we need not chronicle the dissolution law but instead refer to the cases that have dealt with other issues arising from redevelopment dissolution.see,matosantos,supra,cal th city of cerritos state of california th city of brentwood campbell th brentwood.
a component of the dissolution law,enacted as assembly bill in,requires an accounting of the assets,expenditures,and enforceable obligations of the successor agency and payment of the unobligated balance to the county for distribution to local taxing entities.this due diligence review requires the successor agency to employ a licensed accountant to determine the assets of the former redevelopment agency transferred a to the successor agency,b to the sponsoring agency,and c to any other public agency or private party,and provide documentation of an enforceable obligation that required each transfer.the unobligated balance of the successor agency assets is available for distribution to local taxing entities.this unobligated balance includes not only funds retained by the successor agency but also funds that were transferred to another agency or party,including the sponsoring agency,without an enforceable obligation,subd.c.
assembly bill requires the successor agency to submit the results of the due diligence review to its oversight board and to the department of finance for review,subd.a.and the statute empowers the department of finance to adjust any amount associated with the determination of the unobligated balance based on its analysis and information provided by the successor agency and others,subd.d.the successor agency or sponsoring agency may request to meet and confer with the department of finance if the agency disagrees with the department determination,but there is no other remedy provided in the statute if the department does not change its determination,subd.e.
assembly bill requires the successor agency,within five working days after the determination of the department of finance,to transfer the unobligated balance to the county for distribution to local taxing entities,subd.f.this case deals with some of the remedies provided by assembly bill if the successor agency fails to transfer some or all of the unobligated balance to the county.the cities challenge the authority that the legislature,through assembly bill,gives to the department of finance to direct the state board of equalization to withhold or,in the words of the statute,offset an allocation of sales and use tax revenue to the sponsoring agency or the county to reduce the property tax allocation to the sponsoring agency 
two provisions providing for withholding of local tax revenue are at issue here 
first,a sponsoring agency sales and use tax revenue or property tax revenue can be withheld if the former redevelopment agency or successor agency improperly transferred funds to the sponsoring agency without an enforceable obligation and the money is not returned.h a.
and second,a sponsoring agency sales and use tax revenue or property tax revenue can be withheld if the successor agency fails to make the due diligence review payment consistent with the department of finance determination.h c.
under either scenario,tax revenue that would have been allocated to the sponsoring agency is,instead,given to the county for distribution to local taxing entities.the legislature identifies this withholding of local tax revenue as remedies for the failure to turn over money owed to local taxing entities under the dissolution law.h.
in our analysis on appeal,there is no reason to differentiate between assembly bill withholding of sales and use tax revenues through the board of equalization and the withholding of property tax revenues through the county because each is an unconstitutional reallocation,transfer,or other use of local tax revenue.we therefore refer to the two types of withholding collectively as withholding of local tax revenue.
trial court decisions 
the two cases on appeal produced conflicting trial court decisions one holding that section h does not violate proposition and the other that the statute violates proposition 
in the bellflower case,the trial court considered whether proposition prohibit s withholding property,sales,and use taxes owed to cities and counties it found no violation of proposition 
in considering whether withholding tax revenues violated proposition,the bellflower trial court looked to what it determined was the intent of the voters.it concluded that the intent was to prevent the state from reducing the net amount of tax revenue available to the local governments.this narrow finding of intent permitted the bellflower trial court to judge the constitutionality of the section h by whether those provisions reduced tax revenue available to the local governments in the sense of net loss rather than whether the provisions allowed the state to transfer local tax revenue away from the local governments.
with this version of the voters intent in mind,the bellflower trial court considered two separate circumstances that it deemed legally different first,withholding taxes from the sponsoring agency when the sponsoring agency wrongfully obtained funds from the former redevelopment agency,and,second,withholding taxes from the sponsoring agency without regard to whether the sponsoring agency wrongfully received funds from the former redevelopment agency.
in the first circumstance under section h a,when the sponsoring agency wrongfully obtains funds from the former redevelopment agency,the court held that withholding of local tax revenue from the sponsoring agency does not violate proposition,under either test.the court wrote 
the court is persuaded that if the offset provisions of ab are applied to sponsoring agencies in the manner the department of finance asserts,only when the are in receipt of funds no violation of proposition will occur.an offset will not reduce local governments tax proceeds it will simply restore or recover the funds.this does no violence to the purpose of the initiative.
since section h a allows an offset only when the public agency has received improperly transferred funds from the successor agency,the court is persuaded that this section is facially constitutional.the statute passes muster not only under the strictest test,but also under the more lenient standard.
in the second circumstance without regard to whether the sponsoring agency wrongfully obtained funds from the former redevelopment agency,the court determined that whether the statute h c violates proposition comes down to which test is applied.it further determined that the stricter test applies,thus supporting a conclusion that the statute is not unconstitutional.
according to the bellflower trial court,under the stricter test,the statute is not facially unconstitutional because there are circumstances in which the statute can be applied without violating proposition that is,when the sponsoring agency has wrongfully obtained funds from the former redevelopment agency.since the statute can be applied constitutionally under some circumstances,the facial challenge is unsuccessful under the stricter test 
on the other hand,the league of cities trial court found that section h,allowing the state to withhold sales and use taxes from the sponsoring agency,is unconstitutional under proposition.the court did not determine what test applies because it concluded that the statute is unconstitutional under either test.
the league of cities trial court looked first to the language of proposition to determine the voters intent.it reasoned looking first at the language of article xiii,section b,the court finds that such language is framed as a complete prohibition against the legislature taking or using local tax revenues.article xiii,section b contains no exceptions from this prohibition for any reason.
the league of cities trial court also found that nothing in the ballot measure contradicts the language of the constitutional provision looking next to the ballot measure through which article xiii,section b was enacted,proposition contained an explicit statement of purpose the purpose of this measure is to conclusively and completely prohibit state politicians in sacramento from seizing,diverting,shifting,borrowing,transferring,suspending,or otherwise taking or interfering with revenues that are dedicated to funding services provided by local government or funds dedicated to transportation improvement projects and services.nothing in this statement of purpose indicates that the intent of the voters was to permit the taking of local tax revenues for remedial or penalty purposes,even on a limited basis.instead,the language of the statement of purpose,particularly the language highlighted above,indicates that the intent of the voters was to enact a total prohibition on the taking of local tax revenues for any reason.bold text in original,fn.omitted.
the league of cities trial court found merit in the facial challenge because there appeared no circumstances under which the statute could be constitutionally applied 
discussion 
iconstitutionality of local tax withholding 
before we turn to the issues presented on appeal,we find it necessary to identify what is actually in play.we consider only whether withholding local tax revenue from the sponsoring agency under section h violates proposition and is therefore prohibited.
the state introduction in its respondent brief in the bellflower case betrays the state argumentative overreach with respect to the issues the trial courts decided and that we must review on appeal.the state writes that the cities,as sponsoring agencies,challenge any aspect of ab that holds them monetarily responsible for their failure to comply with the law.given that the supreme court has upheld the dissolution of all redevelopment agencies in the state,it is absurd that the sponsoring agencies continue to insist that they can resist dissolution.to the contrary,the cities,in a focused argument,claim that withholding of local tax revenue under assembly bill is unconstitutional.they make no argument with respect to other means the state may use to implement and enforce the dissolution law.
the state overreach continues as it characterizes the cities argument as being that the legislature can not provide for a remedy when the sponsoring agencies do not remit monies that were either sent to them in error or are otherwise required to be released.but the state knows that the sponsoring agencies argument is that the legislature can not provide an unconstitutional remedy,not that it can not provide any remedy.
while the state briefing gets more specific and to the point later on,these introductory arguments seem to signal desperation on the state part and inspire a feeling that the state knows its efforts to defend the challenged statute are in jeopardy.
similarly,intervener and amicus curiae county of santa clara argues that proposition does not give sponsoring agencies license to loot their former redevelopment agencies with impunity.again,this case is not about whether the sponsoring agencies are entitled to the funds held instead,it is only about whether the state can withhold local tax revenue.
having made that observation,we turn to the constitutional argument.
when we interpret a statutory or constitutional provision adopted by initiative,our overriding charge is to effectuate the voters intent in adopting the provision.to determine the intent,we begin with the provision language because it is the best indicator of the voters intent,and,if there is no ambiguity,we give effect to the plain meaning of the provision.if the text is ambiguous,we also consider the provision context within the statutory or constitutional scheme.matosantos,supra,cal th at outfitter properties,llc wildlife conservation bd.th,see also taxpayers to limit campaign spending fair pol.practices com.cal d.
as relevant to this case,the language of proposition provides that the legislature may not reallocate,transfer,borrow,appropriate,restrict the use of,or otherwise use the proceeds of any tax imposed or levied by a local government solely for the local government purposes.cal,art.xiii,subd.b.the statute at issue here,section h,violates this constitutional limitation.there is no dispute that the sales,use,and property taxes are levied by the local government solely for the local government purposes.the statute allows the state to take that revenue away.at the very least,the tax revenue belonging to the local government is reallocate ed,transfer red,or otherwise us ed in the language of proposition,taking it away from the local government to be given to other taxing entities.
the state cites the california supreme court discussion of proposition in matsosantos as if that discussion,rather than the text of the initiative,represents the entirety of the voters intent and is the only basis on which proposition can be applied.to the contrary,matosantos did not address the issues we must decide,and cases are not authority for propositions not considered.fricker uddo taormina cal d.
the matosantos court wrote proposition was drafted with the specific intent of ending further educational revenue augmentation fund shifts of the sort previously imposed on the agencies,and restricting the state ability to demand back,for schools or other state purposes,a percentage of the money county auditors allocated to redevelopment agencies.matosantos,supra,cal th at.nothing in this description of the voters intent precludes a literal interpretation of the plain language of proposition,even if the state is not shifting revenues to the educational revenue augmentation fund.
the conclusion of the league of cities trial court,with which we agree,was that the language of proposition is framed as a complete prohibition against the legislature taking or using local tax revenues.but the bellflower trial court deviated from this straightforward,approach because it perceived that the literal language was inconsistent with the voters intent.we therefore turn to the supreme court guidance on interpreting constitutional provisions consistent with voters intent.the court has declined to apply the plain meaning only when either it would frustrate the manifest purposes of the provision or it would lead to absurd results.roberts city of palmdale cal th.here,neither reason to disregard the plain meaning of the constitutional provision applies.
holding that proposition prohibits the reallocation,transfer,or other use of local tax revenue under section h does not frustrate the manifest purpose of proposition.the bellflower trial court disagreed and reasoned as follows 
based on the language used,the ballot summary,and the argument and analysis presented to the voters,the purpose of proposition is to protect local government funding and ensure that existing local tax dollars will continue to be available for local purposes by prohibiting the state from shifting local tax revenues to schools or other agencies,and placing strict limits on the state ability to alter the allocation of tax revenues among local governments.
the purpose of proposition is similar to restrict the state ability to temporarily borrow or redirect tax revenues dedicated for transportation and local government services as part of the state budget solution.
in sum,the principal purpose of both initiatives is to prohibit the state from reducing existing local tax revenues.
we see two problems with this analysis.first,the language of proposition is not limited to a prohibition on reducing the net local funds.instead,it is a prohibition on transferring away from the local government any tax revenue to which the local government is entitled.nothing cited by the bellflower trial court or the state supports the limited intent perceived by the bellflower trial court.and second,even if the main purpose of proposition is to prohibit the state from reducing a local government net funds,enforcing the plain meaning of proposition and preventing the state from withholding local tax revenue,thus allowing the local government to retain,at least temporarily,the funds it may be required to turn over for distribution to other tax entities,does not frustrate that limited purpose of proposition.therefore,even assuming the bellflower trial court was correct about the purpose behind proposition,enforcing the plain meaning of proposition does not frustrate that purpose.
but the voters intent in passing proposition was not as narrow as the bellflower trial court surmised.in addition to the broad language used in the constitutional provision,the stated purpose of the initiative,contained in the language of the initiative,was to conclusively and completely prohibit state politicians in sacramento from seizing,diverting,shifting,borrowing,transferring,suspending,or otherwise taking or interfering with revenues that are dedicated to funding services provided by local government voter information guide,supra,text of.
enforcing the plain meaning of proposition also does not lead to an absurd result.withholding the tax revenue to which the sponsoring agency is entitled is not the only means by which the state can acquire from the sponsoring agency the funds that should be distributed to other taxing entities,if such a result is justified.for example,the state is authorized to obtain judicial relief for violation of the dissolution law,subd.a.
the state asserts that prohibiting withholding of local tax revenue will force the state to resort to other remedies that are costly or take too much time.however,the state cites no authority for the proposition that the constitution is to be applied only if application is not too costly or too.we are unaware of any such authority.
attempting to narrow the issues we consider,the state claims that it will use the sales and use tax withholding only if the sponsoring agency is in possession of funds wrongfully transferred to the sponsoring agency from the former redevelopment agency or successor agency.while this promised of the state power is irrelevant in a facial challenge tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at only the text considered in facial challenge,it is also immaterial here because we hold that any withholding of local tax revenues under the challenged statute violates proposition,even if it is determined that the sponsoring agency is wrongfully holding funds that should be distributed to local taxing entities under the dissolution law.
withholding local tax revenue simply is not a remedy available to the state for taking funds away from a local government entity because the voters precluded that remedy when they passed proposition.nothing in the language of the initiative or the purpose of the initiative dictates otherwise.
arguments in favor of constitutionality 
the state and the county of santa clara make several arguments in fa
