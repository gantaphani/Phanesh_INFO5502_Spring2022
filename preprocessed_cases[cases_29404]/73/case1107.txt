the question in this case is whether the government is an intended beneficiary,for the purpose of securing the payment of taxes due,of the surety bond that insured a subcontractor performance.parties to surety contracts are free,of course,to choose whether or not to insure for tax obligations.we interpret the language of the contract in this case to have done so,and therefore hold that both the state and federal governments are intended beneficiaries of the surety contract to the extent of the subcontractor past due tax obligations.
background 
oahu construction oahu or obligee or prime contractor contracted with the city and county of honolulu to build a golf course.oahu subcontracted some landscaping work to hawaiian foliage landscape,hawaiian or subcontractor or principal.island insurance island or the surety issued a subcontractor performance and payment bond the bond to insure hawaiian performance.hawaiian was required by its contract with oahu the subcontract to obtain such a bond.the bond named hawaiian as principal and oahu as obligee and was for the amount of,the amount to be paid for work performed under the subcontract.
hawaiian eventually defaulted on the subcontract,and island paid various of hawaiian obligations.island refused,however,to pay the subcontractor tax debts.instead,island sought a judgment declaring that it is not liable under the bond for employment taxes owed to the united states and to hawaii the governments.the governments filed demanding the unpaid taxes.with penalties and interest,these amount to by the united states and by hawaii.all the parties moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of the surety liability.
the district court granted the surety motion,finding that the governments were not intended beneficiaries of the bond and therefore the surety was not liable for the subcontractor unpaid taxes.
discussion 
the appropriate inquiry 
as this case is before us on summary judgment,we review the judgment de novo.branco california employers joint pension plan,cir.here,the pivotal question is one of contract interpretation.
federal courts look to state law to construe common law surety contracts.mai steel,blake constr,cir.in construing contractors bonds,hawaii law applies traditional principles of contract interpretation.see van dusen shima contracting.under those traditional contract principles,the terms of a contract should be interpreted according to their plain,ordinary and accepted use in common speech,unless the contract indicates a different meaning.pancakes of hawaii,pomare properties,app internal citations and quotation marks omitted.barring ambiguity,then,our focus should be on the contractual language.
the contracts language 
appellants make a simple and convincing argument from the texts of the subcontract and bond.the subcontract mentions taxes in two places.the first sentence of article i states subcontractor agrees to pay in full for all labor,materials,equipment,supplies,superintendence,insurance,taxes,and other items used in,upon,or for the work called for in this agreement.emphasis added.article xiv states 
subcontractor agrees to pay any and all taxes and contributions for unemployment insurance,old age retirement benefits and life pensions and annuities which may now or hereafter be imposed by the united states or any state or local government upon any wages,salary or remuneration paid to persons employed by subcontractor or otherwise,for the work required to be performed hereunder.subcontractor shall comply with all federal and state laws on such subjects,and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,and shall maintain suitable forms,books and records and save oahu harmless from the payment of any and all such taxes and contributions,or penalties.subcontractor agrees to pay any and all taxes,excises,assessments or other charges levied by any governmental authority on or because of the work to be done hereunder,on any equipment,supplies,materials,freight,or other matter used in the performance thereof.emphasis added.
it is apparent from these two passages that the subcontract required the subcontractor to pay its payroll taxes.
the bond states 
now,therefore,if the said principal hawaiian shall duly and truly perform and complete said subcontract and pay for all materials used in the performance of same and shall hold the said obligee oahu free and harmless from and against all claims for any and all labor and materials used in the performance of said subcontract,which may or shall arise by reason of the failure of the said principal to furnish,deliver and pay for any and all labor and materials in connection with the said subcontract,then this obligation shall be null and void otherwise to remain in full force and effect.emphasis added.
the bond language is archaic and awkward.as we read it,the bond lists three conditions in parallel,the breach of any of which will create an obligation on the part of the surety.the first of these conditions incorporates the entire subcontract principal shall duly and truly perform and complete said subcontract.so,taken together,the texts of the two contracts do designate the payment of federal and state taxes as one of the bond conditions for discharge.the subcontractor was bound to pay its taxes,the surety insured the subcontractor obligations under the subcontract,and so the surety is now bound to pay the taxes the subcontractor defaulted upon.
once we accept that the surety was bound to cover the subcontractor tax obligations,it follows that the federal and state governments are intended beneficiaries of the surety contract.under the restatement second of the law of contracts an individual or entity is an intended beneficiary of a contract if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and either a the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation to the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary or b the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.restatement second of contracts main vol.
term a applies in this case.island,the promisor,has promised to ensure the performance of the subcontract entered into by hawaiian,the promisee.that includes a commitment to pay taxes.island will therefore satisfy an obligation to the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary by paying hawaiian unpaid taxes.and because the governments are intended beneficiaries,a direct action by beneficiary against promisor is normally appropriate to carry out the intention of promisor and promisee.restatement second of contracts comment on this view,the governments are in an analogous position to that of other that supplied materials,for would suffer from the subcontractor default 
the contracts purpose 
one of island arguments to the contrary is based not on the text of the contracts but on assertions concerning the purpose of surety bonds.island maintains that the bond primary beneficiary is the contractor,and the contractor is not liable for the subcontractor unpaid taxes,so the government can not be a beneficiary to the bond.
a tenth circuit case,united states fidelity guaranty united states,cir,did rely on similar reasoning,noting that an employer duty to pay taxes is his alone,and concluding from that premise that the surety and bond did not confer that obligation.there are,however,certain circumstances under which a third party can be held liable for unpaid withholding taxes,see a b and.a b,although these statutory provisions apply only when the third party either pays wages directly or controls the payment of wages.the taxes sought in this case,however,accumulated at a time when hawaiian controlled its funds and payment of wages.
the premise that the contractor was not liable for the subcontractor unpaid taxes in this case is quite correct.but to rely on the way that the facts actually played out,giving short shrift to the actual language of the pertinent agreements,is to view matters from the wrong vantage point 
first,it is worth keeping clear that the bond agreement is between the subcontractor and the surety.the bond is required of the subcontractor by the subcontract,and is presumably designed to satisfy the principal contractor interests.but these interests only inform the interpretation of the bond it is the contractual language that ultimately controls.whether or not there could have been any motive to designate the governments as intended beneficiaries is only relevant to the extent that it influences our contractual interpretation.that is to say,the complete absence of a motive might lead us to conclude that the contracts could not possibly mean what they seem to mean.
second,the proper inquiry regarding potential tax liability should not have been whether the contractor could be held liable today,but rather whether,at the time of contracting,the possibility of unpaid taxes would have posed any threat to the contractor interests.if so,it seems that the parties to the bond could have reasonably intended to insure against the subcontractor potential future default,and there is no anomaly in reading the bond to have done so.
at the time of contracting,it could well appear to a principal contractor that the possibility that the subcontractor would not pay his payroll taxes would pose a threat to the contractor interests.a primary contractor could hypothesize several circumstances in which a subcontractor default on its tax obligations could wind up costing the primary contractor money.
for example,if the principal contractor were to assist the subcontractor in payment of wages at any point during the relationship,the contractor could be held liable under federal and state law for any unpaid taxes related to such wages.in united states algernon blair,cir,for example,a contractor made payroll advances to a financially strapped subcontractor and was held liable for withholding taxes under b.viewed from the time of contracting,this is exactly the kind of occurrence that a cautious primary contractor would want to insure against in a surety bond.
also,there is the possibility that tax authorities could seize either the assets of a defaulting subcontractor,precluding the subcontractor from completing the contract,or those assets of the primary contractor owed as payments to a defaulting subcontractor,impairing the ability of the primary contractor to complete the contract should the subcontractor fail to do so.the latter was the case in wynne phillips construction,cir,which upheld an irs levy on a contractor assets for the progress payments owed to a.progress payments are also part of the subcontract agreement in this case.
again,a careful primary contractor,intent upon assuring against all species of default by a subcontractor that could cause it financial loss,would want a bond to cover the subcontractor tax liabilities in order to avoid these possible outcomes 
our conclusion that there could well have been such a motive is not a claim about what the parties were actually thinking.in fact,there is some evidence in the record that neither of the parties gave any thought at the time of contracting to whether the bond would cover the subcontractor taxes.but such evidence is barred by hawaii parol evidence rule,based on the principle that an agreement reduced to writing serves to integrate all prior agreements and negotiations concerning the transaction into the written instrument which then represents the final and complete agreement of the parties.state farm fire and casualty company pacific.accordingly,our ruling rests on the language of the contracts.the bond plainly incorporates the subcontract,which in turn covers the subcontractor tax obligations.to ignore the express contractual language would be to endanger the reliability and clarity of surety contracts.
island also argues that because tax obligations arise at law that is,they are created by statute rather than by contract,such obligations just recite preexisting legal duties.two appellate court cases with facts similar to the one before us found this consideration relevant.see united states maryland casualty,cir,united states fidelity guaranty united states,cir.
as discussed,however,there are reasons why parties might want to contract to insure the fulfillment of the tax obligations that arise under law the legal obligation thereby becomes a contractual obligation as well.none of the cases cited suggests that parties should be disallowed from insuring such an obligation.so the definitive question remains one of contractual were the parties trying to which the contract itself is most relevant.
conflicting precedents 
both parties cite cases,none of which is binding authority,which support their position.the governments rely largely on two appellate court cases.see united states phoenix indemnity,cir holding sureties liable to the united states for tax obligations in a construction contract for which the sureties provided performance and payment bonds home indemnity donovan painting,cir holding surety liable for the tax obligations of a subcontractor where bond incorporated subcontract and subcontract specified tax obligations.these cases are indeed pertinent and persuasive,island attempts to distinguish them notwithstanding.
island invokes several cases.see,united states maryland casualty,cir,united states seaboard surety,united states fidelity guaranty united states,cir,united states crosland construction,cir,oklahoma tax commission seaboard surety company,cir,westover william simpson constr,cir.the general thrust of these cases is in accordance with island position that the government is not an intended beneficiary with regard to surety bonds similar to the one in this case,and therefore the surety may not be held liable for the subcontractor tax obligations.
some of the cases island cites barred possible recovery because of contractual language not present in the contracts before us.see,united states crosland construction,cir bond specified that the principal shall promptly make payment to all persons supplying labor and material,presumably without incorporating entire subcontract united states maryland casualty company,cir bond was specified to benefit laborers,materialmen,and other creditors of the principal whose indebtedness arises out of said contract,and court held that government was not a creditor in the usual sense oklahoma tax commission seaboard surety company,cir bond assured payment to claimants,and a claimant was defined as one having a direct contract with the principal or with a subcontractor of the principal who has furnished labor,material,or both.others of appellee authorities involved bonds entered into under the miller act,which protects only suppliers of labor and material.see a,westover william simpson constr,cir,united states fidelity guaranty united states,cir in any event,none of these authorities is binding upon us,and we are obliged to decide the case based on contract principles and the language the parties have chosen.
conclusion 
relying on the plain language of the contracts in question,we hold that the state and federal governments are designated as intended beneficiaries of the surety bond.parties are free,of course,to create surety bonds that do not insure for tax liabilities.they need only embody their intentions in the language of their contracts.
i respectfully dissent from the court determination that the state and federal governments were intended beneficiaries of the surety bond insuring hawaiian foliage and landscape hawaiian performance.the purpose and language of the surety bond nowhere evinces an intent that island insurance island be held liable for hawaiian unpaid taxes.indeed,as i explain below,it would have made little sense for the parties to enter into the agreement described by the majority.
i do not dispute the majority recital of the facts or the relevant language of the bond and subcontract.i part company,however,with its conclusion that the surety bond,which is clearly meant to protect oahu construction oahu from hawaiian failure to perform and nowhere mentions the state or federal government as beneficiaries,requires island to pay hawaiian taxes.
the bond provides that island is liable if hawaiian fails to duly and truly perform and to complete the subcontract,to pay for all materials used in performance of the subcontract,and to hold oahu harmless from all claims for any labor and materials used in the performance of the subcontract.because,in a litany of other provisions,article xiv of the subcontract mentions hawaiian responsibility to pay its own taxes,the majority divines that hawaiian failure to pay such taxes is a failure to duly and truly perform and complete the subcontract that triggers island obligation under the bond.even more problematic,instead of being obligated to entity the surety bond was meant to majority holds that island must directly reimburse the state and federal governments.
however,it is hornbook law that only if the governments are intended beneficiaries of the surety just incidental island obligated to pay the taxes owed by hawaiian.see pancakes of hawaii,pomare prop,app stating the general rule that a third party does not have enforceable contract rights unless it is an intended beneficiary.the contracting parties must have intended directly to benefit the third party.wright associated ins,cir.
as the majority recognizes,the governments may be intended beneficiaries of the bond if recognition of a right to performance in the governments is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of island to pay money to the beneficiary.restatement second of contracts a hereinafter restatement.the bond reference to the subcontract,which includes a provision requiring hawaiian to pay its own taxes,seems to satisfy the majority that island bound itself to pay those taxes should hawaiian fail to do so.i am not persuaded.
true,the surety bond references the subcontract,which,in turn,required hawaiian to pay its own taxes.however,that fact alone does not make the governments intended beneficiaries of the bond.we presume that parties contract for themselves alone,see united states seaboard surety,so a party claiming intended beneficiary status bears the burden of showing that the contracting parties intended to confer a direct benefit on it,united states.cas,cir.an intent to benefit the third party must be apparent from the construction of the contract in light of all surrounding circumstances to qualify that party as a third party beneficiary.lafferty,cir.
the language of the bond indicates that the only identified and intended beneficiary of the bond is oahu it does not name the governments.the governments seize upon the fact that the bond and subcontract do not explicitly exclude them.however,to qualify as third party beneficiaries,the governments must show more than just that the original contracting parties did not consciously exclude them rather,they must demonstrate that those parties intended to include them.of course,the bond benefits entities to whom oahu could be held liable in the event of a default by hawaiian,such as those to whom hawaiian might owe funds for materials and supplies,and for which oahu,as the primary contractor,could be liable under state law.these suppliers are intended beneficiaries of the surety bond because they were clearly contemplated by the bond requires that hawaiian hold oahu harmless from all claims for any labor and materials used in the performance of the subcontract.the governments are not so named.
furthermore,the purpose of a performance bond is to guarantee to an obligee,such as oahu,that its contract will be completed even if the subcontractor defaults.this generally involves the surety,here island,agreeing to complete the construction or pay the obligee the reasonable costs of completing it,aetna cas.sur.united states.the primary and obvious reason to reference the subcontract in the bond is to establish the limits of and to aid in measuring island obligation to oahu under the bond indeed,virtually all of the provisions in the subcontract consist of obligations that hawaiian undertakes for the benefit of oahu performance in a timely manner,obtaining insurance,providing qualified personnel,and indemnifying and defending oahu against claims.
in construing contracts,we should adopt the interpretation that,under all circumstances,ascribes the most reasonable,probable,and natural conduct of the parties,bearing in mind the objects to be accomplished.alliance metals,hinely,cir quotations omitted see also am.home assurance larkin,so d,to determine the intent of the parties,a court should consider the language in the contract,the subject matter of the contract,and the object and purpose of the contract.the purpose of this bond was to ensure to oahu that hawaiian portion of the project was completed,to protect oahu from actual damages it could suffer if hawaiian failed to perform.
paying hawaiian taxes has nothing to do with completing the actual construction of the project,particularly considering that oahu needs no protection from hawaiian tax liability since a general contractor is not liable for a subcontractor failure to pay its taxes.united states fid.guar.united states,cir employer duty to pay state and federal employment taxes is a tax liability for which it alone is liable to the government.hawaiian liability for its unpaid taxes could not have been imposed on oahu,an innocent third party,because that duty inhered solely in hawaiian thus,the bond,which was intended only to protect oahu who needed no protection from hawaiian tax liability,should not be read to protect the governments 
the bond purpose becomes even more evident when one considers the result of the majority holding,which essentially ascribes to oahu the intent to seek protection in a bond that harms,not guards,its interests.allowing the governments to collect taxes from performance bonds reduces the amount of funds available to oahu for completion of the project,payment to laborers,and payment of other damages that oahu could incur as a result of hawaiian default.for example,the owner of the golf course indicated that it might file a claim for alleged defects in hawaiian work,involving almost per hole of the golf course.the governments tax claims,not including interest and penalties,total almost.the sum of the bond is,of which has already been expended for claims.when one considers the amount of the golf course potential claim,it becomes clear why oahu would want the full amount of the bond available to cover claims against it.i can not believe that the parties intended that this bond,which was meant to protect oahu,would cover payments to taxing authorities,thereby reducing the bond value to oahu by over percent 
both oahu and hawaiian admit that they had no intention for the bond to cover hawaiian tax obligations.see mccarthy azure,cir as is generally the case in matters of contract interpretation,t he crux in beneficiary analysis is the intent of the parties.quoting mowbray moseley,hallgarten,estabrook weeden,cir.indeed,as discussed above,it would make little sense for a general contractor like oahu to seek such an arrangement.neither the language nor the purpose of the bond lead me to conclude that the governments were intended beneficiaries of it.
the majority lists two instances in which a general contractor like oahu might be affected if its subcontractor did not pay its taxes,supra at.however,the fact that oahu may have reasons for requiring hawaiian to pay its taxes does not establish that the governments are intended beneficiaries of oahu subcontract and bond.rather,as island argues,it demonstrates that the subcontract tax provisions are for the primary benefit of the general contractor and only incidentally for the benefit of any taxing authority.see seaboard surety.at holding that a provision requiring subcontractor to pay taxes did not evidence an intent to benefit the united states,but showed instead that the general contractor was primarily concerned with its own position.one should remember that incidental beneficiaries have no legal right to enforce a contract.eastman mcgowan.if hawaiian failure to pay its taxes did affect oahu in the form imagined by the majority,the bond would mitigate oahu actual loss stemming from hawaiian failure it is quite a lea
