background 
orenuga was employed as a tax auditor for otr and its predecessor,the department of finance and revenue,from to.he was principally responsible for auditing businesses that were believed to have either failed to pay or underpaid sales taxes owed to the district of columbia.this case arises out of orenuga assignment to audit bestway liquors bestway in.during this audit,orenuga was recorded by the federal bureau of investigation fbi on audio and video tapes accepting money as part of an agreement to unlawfully reduce the tax liability of two local businesses.
the parties accounts of the events leading to the unlawful relationship differ,although not in ways that materially affect our analysis.broadly,orenuga testified that after being assigned the bestway audit,he received only limited cooperation from bestway owner,fikerte yemane,and her independent representatives,mohammed mobaidin and connie meyers.according to orenuga,compliance with his document requests was not forthcoming until after he sent yemane a jeopardy assessment an assessment based on incomplete information designed to get the auditee attention.following the jeopardy assessment,mobaidin served as the main contact for bestway and submitted most of the requested information.orenuga claimed to be uncomfortable working with mobaidin,however,as mobaidin allegedly hounded orenuga about his personal and family interests and repeatedly chastised him for acting like a cop.trial transcript tr.at.orenuga testified that mobaidin eventually offered him an illicit payment if he would lower bestway tax liability.
the government case was presented largely through the testimony of mobaidin,who assisted the fbi with its investigation.mobaidin suggested that he and meyers initially shared the audit responsibilities and promptly responded to each of orenuga information requests.he also testified that,in his first few meetings with orenuga,he was surprised by how little attention orenuga gave to the information that was provided on behalf of bestway.in june,after meyers stopped working on the bestway account,orenuga allegedly informed mobaidin that bestway owed in taxes,but remarked,if you take care of me,i take care of yemane.tr.at.according to mobaidin,orenuga then wrote down on a piece of paper that he wanted for himself and for otr the latter to avoid the appearance of impropriety.this offer is allegedly what led mobaidin to contact fbi special agent mary jo ervin,for whom mobaidin had previously served as an informant.
what transpired from this point forward is largely undisputed.upon learning from mobaidin about orenuga alleged proposal,special agent ervin sought mobaidin continued cooperation.mobaidin was provided with equipment to record his future meetings and phone calls with orenuga.in exchange for mobaidin assistance,special agent ervin aided him in his pending immigration and naturalization service deportation proceedings.
over the course of the first two audio recorded meetings on june and,orenuga and mobaidin settled on a reduced tax assessment for bestway in exchange for an illicit payment of to orenuga.during a videotaped meeting in his office on june,mobaidin made an initial payment of.at special agent ervin suggestion,mobaidin requested,and orenuga agreed to give him,of the for his role in the deception.this move was designed to show that the was,in fact,for orenuga,and not otr.
a week later,on june,the fbi videotaped another meeting at mobaidin office where orenuga received the remaining.during this meeting,the two men weighed the possibility of a similar deal with one of mobaidin other clients.orenuga proposed that he could conduct fictitious audits,and then mobaidin would tell his clients that they could reduce their tax liability through a clandestine payment to orenuga.at one point,when strategizing about the identity of their next target,orenuga instructed mobaidin to steer clear of jew s,black american s,or white m e n,ostensibly to focus on people more susceptible to coercion.see tr.of recorded conversation between obafemi orenuga and fbi cooperating witness at june,june transcript,reprinted in record material for appellee tab.
the fbi subsequently arranged for a local restauranteur to assist in the investigation by posing as one of mobaidin clients.through a series of recorded conversations,orenuga planned to fabricate a to tax deficiency for the restaurant and then agree to reduce it to zero for a payment of which he would keep for himself.on march,orenuga was videotaped accepting from mobaidin in exchange for the clean audit.orenuga was then arrested on august.
at trial,faced with the irrefutable audio and video recordings of his illicit dealings with mobaidin,orenuga relied on a defense of entrapment.he asserted that mobaidin relentlessly badgered him to look the other way on the bestway audit,and eventually the pressure was so much that he capitulated.see tr.at.given the centrality of the entrapment defense to orenuga case,he requested that the district court question the venire about their knowledge and attitude towards its application.the trial court denied orenuga request on the grounds that it would inject complications into the voir dire and was not necessary in order to get a fair and impartial jury.tr.at.in response to orenuga suggestion that entrapment was a novel defense that might be unfamiliar to many jurors,the district court judge replied that,while entrapment may not be as familiar as the defenses of or insanity,the court was not persuaded that it would be an issue.id.at.
orenuga also objected to the admission of a portion of the videotape evidence.he asserted that his comments regarding jews,black americans,and white men during the june,meeting were inflammatory and added little,if anything,to the government case.see tr.at.after weighing the issue,the district court permitted the government to play the tape in its entirety,ruling that the contested segment provided context that is relevant,and not only to the government burden in proving its case but also with respect to the defense of entrapment.id.at.
finally,before the jury was given its instructions,orenuga objected to the district court proposed description of the elements required to prove that a public official has committed bribery under b a.orenuga asserted that an indispensable component of bribery is that the public official must perform a quid pro quo,which would require proof that orenuga actually altered the audit figures from what they otherwise would have been.because the government allegedly failed to show any adjustment of the tax liability figures,orenuga argued that the government case did not support a finding that he violated the statute.the district court rejected this reading of the statute,and orenuga was found guilty on both counts of bribery.
on july,the trial judge sentenced orenuga to months in federal prison on each count,to be served concurrently,followed by three years supervised release.see amended judgment,united states orenuga,crim.july,reprinted in tab.orenuga now appeals,and seeks reversal of the district court judgment and remand for a new trial.
