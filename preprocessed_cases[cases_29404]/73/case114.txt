lisa boulerice appeals from a judgment of conviction following a jury trial in which she was found guilty of having filed false income tax returns for and in violation of.on appeal boulerice claims that there was insufficient evidence to support the findings of guilt,and that the district court therefore erred in denying her rule motion for judgment of acquittal.see.she also claims that the district court improperly admitted evidence of prior bad acts,and that the court abused its discretion when it declined to grant a request from the jury to read back testimony.finally,boulerice argues that the prosecutor closing argument impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to her,thereby violating her due process rights.discerning no reversible error in any of these claims,we affirm.
background 
this case arose out of an investigation by the internal revenue service irs and the united states postal inspection service uspis into the suspected criminal activities of american inventor corporation aic and massachusetts patent services mps,entities owned and controlled by lisa boulerice father,ronald boulerice aic and mps were ostensibly in the business of helping inventors secure patents for their inventions,when in fact the companies did little more than bilk the inventors out of their money.in,acting on the complaints of numerous aic and mps clients,the uspis launched an inquiry into the activities of aic and mps.this investigation ultimately led to the execution of search warrants in october at the companies places of business in westfield,massachusetts,and the subsequent indictment of ronald and eight other individuals for numerous offenses,including mail fraud,conspiracy to commit mail fraud,money laundering,conspiracy to commit money laundering,filing false income tax returns,and conspiracy to defraud the united states.ronald ultimately pleaded guilty to several of the charges and was sentenced to months imprisonment.he was also ordered to pay million in restitution and million in fines.
the government investigation into ronald also unearthed evidence of wrongdoing on the part of his daughter lisa,the appellant in this case.the government discovered that lisa had been on the payroll of mps and aic for several years.during that time,she accepted and cashed paychecks from aic and mps,claiming these proceeds as wages on her tax though she had done no work for the two companies.indeed,during the period at issue,lisa was pursuing her own career as a fashion designer in new york city,living in an expensive apartment on the city upper east side.aic paid for this apartment,deducting the cost as a business expense on its income tax returns.the government also uncovered evidence that,in response to a irs audit of aic,lisa had backdated two job description forms,falsely detailing her supposed duties as an aic employee.
on april,a grand jury sitting in springfield,massachusetts,returned a indictment against lisa,charging her with one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of,and three counts of filing false income tax returns for,and,in violation of.on august,the district court commenced a jury trial,and on august,the jury found boulerice guilty of filing false income tax returns for and,but acquitted her of the other two counts conspiracy and filing a false tax return for.the district court sentenced boulerice to a term of two years probation.this appeal ensued.
ii.the rule motion 
boulerice argues that the evidence at trial fell far short of proving that when she submitted irs form for and,she willfully made false statements with the intent of violating her duty under the tax laws.thus,she claims,the district court erred in denying her rule motion for judgment of acquittal.see.a indicating that court must enter judgment of acquittal if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.our review of the district court ruling is de novo.united states carroll,cir.we will affirm the conviction if,after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states,cir.we need not be convinced that the government succeeded in eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant innocence.united states moran,cir.rather,we simply consider all the evidence,direct and circumstantial,and resolve all evidentiary conflicts in favor of the verdict.united states hernandez,cir.we will affirm if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.
the jury found boulerice guilty of two counts of violating,which provides 
any person who 
declaration under penalties of perjury.
willfully makes and subscribes any return,statement,or other document,which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter 
shall be guilty of a felony and,upon conviction thereof,shall be fined not more than in the case of a corporation,or imprisoned not more than years,or both,together with the costs of prosecution.
as the verdict forms make clear,the jury found boulerice guilty of willfully filing a false tax return and guilty of willfully filing a false tax return.
we take this opportunity to clarify the government burden under.the elements of an offense under are 
that the defendant made or caused to be made,a federal income tax return for the year in question which he verified to be true that the tax return was false as to a material matter that the defendant signed the return willfully and knowing it was false and that the return contained a written declaration that it was made under the penalty of perjury.
united states laspina,cir quoting united states pirro,cir quoting united states peters,cir see also united states scholl,cir.boulerice concedes that she filed the returns,and she does not challenge the materiality of the false statements.she also does not contend that the tax returns failed to include the required declaration.boulerice does maintain,however,that the government failed to demonstrate that she willfully violated the statute.she also asserts that the government failed to demonstrate that she had actual knowledge of the returns material falsity.we address these two contentions in turn.
willfulness 
boulerice insists that the government failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that she acted willfully when she filed her income tax returns for and.at trial,boulerice took the stand in her own defense,testifying that she held an honest belief that she was required by law to file an income tax return for money that she had received from her father corporation.she maintained that she was only doing what her accountant told her to tax returns which reflected the wages she received from aic and mps.therefore,the argument goes,the government failed to demonstrate willfulness as required by the statute.see any person who willfully emphasis added.
we have previously indicated that willfully,as that word is used in,means a voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.united states monteiro,cir citing drape,at.the government need not present direct evidence of willfulness rather,circumstantial evidence of willfulness can be sufficient to sustain a conviction.id.at see also united states olbres,cir i n proving tax evasion,the government does not need to show direct evidence of tax motivation so long as the jury has a sufficient circumstantial basis for inferring willfulness.quoting united states hurley,cir.
our decision in olbres is illuminating.having been convicted of tax evasion under,the defendants maintained on appeal that the government had not presented sufficient evidence of willfulness to sustain the verdict.they asserted that blind reliance on their accountant,and not willfulness or criminal intent,caused an underreporting of income.olbres,at.in rejecting their argument,we indicated that the critical datum is not whether the defendants ordered the accountant to falsify the return,but,rather,whether the defendants knew when they signed the return that it understated their income.id.at.moreover,a jury may permissibly infer that a taxpayer read his return and knew its contents from the bare fact that he signed it.id.at see also drape,at holding that defendant signature on tax return sufficed to establish knowledge of incorrect contents united states romanow,cir holding that jury could conclude from nothing more than the presence of defendant uncontested signature that violation was willful.hence,in boulerice case,the government need only have presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that when boulerice signed her tax returns,those returns were not true and correct as to every material matter.the jury was then permitted though by no means required to infer willfulness.
at trial,however,the government elicited significantly more evidence of willfulness than boulerice signature on two false returns.under,boulerice admitted that she knew that wages means income one earns by working,and she also admitted that she had never worked at aic or mps.nevertheless,on her tax returns she claimed as wages the money she received from aic and mps.moreover,marvin kennedy,aic former accountant,testified for the government that in boulerice had voiced concerns about the propriety of receiving payroll checks from the companies when she was not actually working for them.because of her unease,she wanted to know how she could eradicate sic herself from the situation.when kennedy responded that her only option would be to forego further disbursements,boulerice decided to remain on the payroll.
the government also produced evidence that,in response to an irs audit of aic,boulerice signed and backdated phony job descriptions that falsely held her out as an employee of aic.in june,the irs auditor asked aic to produce more information about boulerice employment duties and the rent payments for her new york city apartment,which aic had been deducting as a business expense.laurie,a of aic,testified that she sent boulerice two job description forms falsely detailing boulerice duties as an employee with the company.each form was accompanied by a note one was dated and instructed boulerice to sign and date using date of,and the other was dated and informed boulerice that she should sign using the date of.this is for audit.boulerice signed the forms as requested and returned them to.
boulerice misrepresentations did not end there.postal inspector gerry carmody testified that boulerice continued to hold herself out as an employee of aic as late as.in may of that year,as a result of the criminal investigations into aic and mps,carmody interviewed boulerice concerning her relationship with the companies.when he asked her if she was an employee of aic,she responded in a curt and annoyed manner that she was.after answering that question,boulerice terminated the interview,telling carmody that she wanted to speak to her father before answering any more questions.
finally,while boulerice insists that she had only rudimentary knowledge of her obligations under the tax code,the government produced evidence that boulerice was not altogether unsophisticated.for example,in boulerice provided her tax preparer with check stubs documenting income from her freelance work,together with a note revealing that she understood that those payments had to be included in her returns.this,when combined with boulerice testimony that she understood that wages meant money actually earned from working,supports an inference that boulerice knew that the line wages,salaries,tips,on her tax returns did not merely mean the dollar amounts contained in box of her forms,but that it meant income actually earned from work.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that there was ample evidence to support the jury finding that boulerice willfully filed tax returns that she knew to be false.the jury reasonably could have found that boulerice knew of her obligation to accurately report her income,she knew that the money she was receiving from aic and mps was not wages,and she repeatedly attempted to cover up the truth about her relationship with aic and mps.she nevertheless reported as wages on her tax returns the money she received from aic and mps.we will not disturb the jury verdict.
actual knowledge of material falsity 
in her opening brief,boulerice also claims that the district court erred in denying her rule motion because there was no evidence that boulerice actually knew the return s were materially false when she filed them.she asserts that the government was required to prove that she knew her father was deducting her wages as a business expense on his corporate income tax returns.since the government did not do so,she maintains,she is entitled to judgment of acquittal.
this assignment of error has no basis in law.although the government had to prove to the jury the materiality of boulerice false statements,the government did not have to prove her knowledge of the materiality see laspina,at drape,at united states notarantonio,cir holding that in prosecution under,knowledge is assessed with respect to the defendant knowledge of the falsity of the statements rather than with respect to the defendant knowledge of the statement materiality to the federal agency involved.hence,whether boulerice actually knew of the false statements materiality to the government does not enter the calculus of proof 
iii.the admission of evidence of unreported freelance income as other bad act evidence 
at trial,the government,without objection,boulerice concerning her failure to report freelance income to the irs after.boulerice now claims that this extrinsic evidence,as she describes it was highly prejudicial other bad act evidence offered to show criminal propensity without serving another legitimate purpose,in violation of federal rules of evidence b and 
the government responds with a number of theories of admissibility.we need not dwell at length on any of them,however,for two reasons.first,since boulerice failed to object below,we review only for plain error.united states olano,d united states baldyga,cir.under this standard,we will disregard the purported error unless a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result,or if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.olano,at.second,the government had already introduced evidence of boulerice unreported freelance income,without objection,during its,precluding any argument that this affected boulerice substantial rights.see.a.
among the witnesses called by the government was marvin kennedy,the aic accountant who assisted with the preparation of boulerice and tax returns and who testified that boulerice had provided him with receipts for freelance income which he included on her returns for those years.thereafter,the government elicited testimony from michael barret,the aic accountant who assisted with the preparation of boulerice and tax returns,that boulerice did not claim any freelance income during those two years.when the government asked barret if he would have included freelance income had boulerice provided documentation of any,boulerice objected to the question as calls for speculation.the objection was overruled.subsequently,the objection from evidence of paid freelance work performed by boulerice in and through,among other things,the testimony of boulerice employers.
when boulerice took the stand,the government first her about her knowledge of her responsibilities under the tax code
