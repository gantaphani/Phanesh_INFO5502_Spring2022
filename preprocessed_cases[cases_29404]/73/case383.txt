volvo trucks of north america,commenced this action against the internal revenue service irs to obtain an refund of federal excise taxes paid under a for heavy trucks that volvo sold to its dealers during the period.volvo claimed to be entitled to an exemption from the tax,but the irs disallowed the exemption because volvo failed to support its claim with the documentation required by temporary treasury regulation.
volvo contends that regulation was an arbitrary and capricious regulation as promulgated and as applied that volvo substantially complied with the regulation requirements and that volvo noncompliance with the regulation was attributable to representations made by irs agents and therefore that the irs should be equitably estopped from disputing volvo refund request.
the district court dismissed volvo equitable estoppel claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,and it granted the irs motion for summary judgment on the other two claims.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
before,the internal revenue code imposed an excise tax on the first sale by a manufacturer or importer of trucks,but in,congress changed the law to impose the tax on the value of the first retail sale of such trucks.congress defined the first retail sale as the first sale for a purpose other than for resale or leasing in a lease.id.a.under this scheme,manufacturers and importers would be exempt from excise tax on trucks sold to their dealers for resale,and their dealers would pay the tax.for trucks that the dealers purchased for their own use,however,the manufacturer or the importer would have to pay the tax.temporary treasury regulation was promulgated in to provide the mechanism by which the irs collected this tax.
section authorized the irs to promulgate regulations,directing the irs to prescribe rules similar to the rules of section.d later amended by,b.under,which governs a different set of tax exemptions,taxpayers are required to register with the irs before they can be eligible for the exemptions.id.a.in addition to the registration requirement,parties to sales governed by must,as required by regulations promulgated under,also provide the irs with a written statement establishing the nontaxable nature of each sale.a c,c.acting on instruction to use as a guide in establishing regulations for,the irs promulgated temporary treasury regulation.
regulation a provided that in order for a to be exempt from the excise tax imposed under,both the and the had to be registered with the irs.in addition,the must have obtained from the a signed certificate that included the dealer registration number and indicated that the transaction was for resale or lease.
volvo trucks of north america,volvo,a manufacturer of heavy trucks and truck parts,responded to this regulation by instructing each of its franchised dealers to register with the irs and to provide volvo with exemption certificates that indicated the dealer registration number and that listed the trucks purchased for resale.two such dealers,atlas engine rebuilders,atlas and alaska sales and service,alaska,sent volvo certificates with the phrase applied for in the field reserved for its irs registration number,indicating that they had applied for but not yet received a registration number for the relevant period.another dealer,alameda truck center,alameda,never supplied volvo with a certificate.there is evidence that despite their failure to produce the certificates to volvo,alaska and alameda had in fact registered with the irs.
in,the irs began two excise tax audits of volvo,one covering the period and the second covering.at the end of the audits,the irs assessed volvo with over million in excise taxes and penalties to cover those sales transactions that it had with dealers for which volvo had not produced completed dealer certifications.volvo paid the assessed amount and pursued administrative appeals.during this administrative process,the irs refunded taxes to volvo for transactions where the irs could confirm that the dealer had paid the excise tax,even if the dealer had not properly registered and had not properly certified the transaction.as a result of this process,volvo liability for excise taxes was reduced from over million to.volvo commenced this action seeking a refund of this remaining amount.
in its complaint,volvo contends that temporary treasury regulation was invalid because it was an arbitrary and capricious regulation that volvo substantially complied with regulation and that the irs should in any event be equitably estopped from enforcing the regulation because,during the administrative process,irs made representations on which volvo relied in failing to produce the required documentation.with respect to the equitable estoppel claim,volvo alleged that irs agents told volvo that it did not need to have exemption certificates,but the irs later changed its position that irs agents told volvo that exemption certificates would apply retroactively but then denied their retroactive effect and that irs agents told volvo that the irs would accept affidavits in lieu of certifications but then refused to accept affidavits.
the district court granted the irs motion for summary judgment on volvo first two claims relating to regulation and volvo compliance with it,and it granted the irs motion to dismiss the third claim relating to equitable estoppel on the ground that volvo failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.this appeal followed.
volvo contends first that the promulgation of temporary treasury regulation was an invalid exercise of the irs authority.more particularly,volvo argues that regulation was inconsistent with,which authorized the regulation the regulation was inconsistent with congressional intent the irs failed to consider the possibility of in promulgating the regulation and the regulation was not uniformly or literally applied in all circumstances.we address these arguments seriatum.
on volvo first argument that the regulation was inconsistent with the statute,we conclude that the regulation was not only consistent with the plain language of the statute,but it was explicitly contemplated by the statute.in,congress authorized the irs to promulgate regulations similar to the rules of section.d.section requires that all parties to a sale be registered with the irs as a condition to receiving the tax exemptions that are detailed in.in addition,the regulations promulgated under and require that purchasers provide sellers with written statements that include their irs registration numbers and the nontaxable purpose for which the items were purchased.a c,c.thus,when congress specifically instructed the irs in to promulgate regulations similar to those in,it directed the commissioner to impose registration and certification requirements in connection with sales covered by.
the commissioner did just that.when the irs promulgated temporary treasury regulation,it was only complying with the explicit requirements of.as with and its implementing regulations,the irs required with respect to that and be registered with the irs under and that the manufacturers obtain exemption certificates containing statements from the that the trucks being sold were for resale or leasing.even if had not explicitly authorized such a regulatory scheme,however,regulation would have been a reasonable promulgation designed to verify that the excise tax had been paid by the dealer before exempting the manufacturer.it therefore would undoubtedly have been within the irs authority.
as for volvo argument that the regulation violated congressional intent,there is little need to address this point further because,as already noted,the irs received explicit authority to promulgate the regulation.moreover,congress intent to authorize such a regulation is manifested by the fact that in later changing the language of,congress,albeit a different congress,recognized that it was adopting a new requirement that called for less documentation than it had required in the version of.see g deleting the registration requirement and authorizing the endorsement of a simple affidavit by the purchasing dealer on the sales invoi
