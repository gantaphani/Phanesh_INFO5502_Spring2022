after charles willis was convicted by a jury on two counts of tax evasion,he moved for a new trial based on alleged insufficiency of evidence,errors in the instructions and evidentiary rulings,and juror misconduct.a second retrial motion alleged violations of his rights under brady maryland,d.the district court denied both motions and sentenced him to months.willis appeals the denial of the motions and his sentence.we affirm.
in the tax years through,charles willis worked as a shareholder and officer of connectivity systems,a business founded by his father,where he earned taxable income of nearly million willis testified at trial that in,as a result of a conversation with a connectivity employee,he began to believe that payment of federal income taxes was not compulsory he purchased books on the subject and spoke with lawyers and accountants.most of those with whom he spoke told him that payment was compulsory,and even those materials which encouraged his belief told him that it was contrary to the view of the internal revenue service irs and the courts.willis also researched the issue in statutes and casebooks,despite having no legal training.
willis rejected a return prepared by an accountant for his tax year because of his view that payment was voluntary.he instead prepared his own return which showed deductions equal to his income and requested a refund of the amount previously withheld by connectivity,approximately.the irs rejected this return as frivolous and began an investigation.in the course of the investigation,willis told irs agents that he was unable to find any legal authority requiring him to file tax returns.an irs agent testified that she offered to send willis a brochure explaining his obligation to pay,with citations to cases and statutes.she reported that willis declined her offer,instead demanding that she cite the law off the top of her head.she eventually mailed the brochure to willis,who claims that he did not receive it.
willis failed to file a return for the and tax years.in he drafted and filed a substitute form stating that he was excluded from withholding.after receiving the form willis had drafted,connectivity continued to report his income to the irs but no longer withheld taxes from his earnings.
in march willis was charged with three counts of tax evasion in violation of for the years,and.the case was tried before a jury which convicted him on the counts relating to and but deadlocked on the one for.his motions for a new trial were denied by the district court which then sentenced him to months in prison.
willis appeals from the denial of his motions for a new trial on the grounds that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him and that the court improperly excluded evidence and erred in its instructions to the jury.he also alleges that he is entitled to a new trial because of alleged juror misconduct and because of the government failure to disclose evidence under brady maryland,d.finally he argues that the district court did not use the correct base offense level in its sentencing calculation under the guidelines.
the government must prove three elements in order to obtain a conviction under a tax deficiency,willfulness,and an affirmative act of evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.united states brooks,cir.willis does not now dispute that he owed taxes for income earned in and,and we consider in turn each of his points on appeal.
willis argues that the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to convict him.a motion for a new trial should be granted if there is insufficient evidence to support the verdict.larson farmers coop.elevator of buffalo,cir.a question regarding the sufficiency of the evidence is reviewed de novo,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.brooks,at.
willis contends that the government presented insufficient evidence of one element for conviction under an affirmative act of evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.this element is satisfied by proof of any affirmative conduct which has the likely effect to mislead or conceal.id.at.willis contends that the failure to file is not itself an affirmative act and that his conduct was neither evasive nor misleading.he openly communicated to irs agents and others that he did not believe he was required to pay taxes.
the government presented evidence sufficient for the jury to conclude that willis affirmatively attempted to evade his obligation to pay taxes.there was also evidence that willis attempted to conceal his whereabouts by selling his home and permitting himself to be contacted by cell phone only.the evidence was sufficient to prove attempted evasion of the tax.
willis raises several issues with respect to the court instructions to the jury.a court instructions are generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states beckman,cir.a judgment will be reversed on the basis of instructional error only if the error affected the substantive rights of the parties.white honeywell,cir.the question is whether the instructions taken as a whole and viewed in the light of the evidence and applicable law,fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.id.quoting kim nash finch,cir.
first,willis contends that the court erred in failing to instruct that a conviction under requires the finding of an affirmative act of evasion.the court instructed the jury that it could convict only upon a finding that willis had attempted to evade and defeat the tax which he owed,an element involving both an intent to evade or defeat the tax and some act willfully done in furtherance of such intent.according to the instruction,this element is satisfied if the defendant willfully fail ed to report income which he knew he must report or attempted to evade or defeat the tax in some other manner.the jury was instructed further that to evade or defeat a tax means to escape paying it by means other than lawful avoidance.willis charges that this instruction permitted the jury to convict him even if it did not find an affirmative act of evasion.because he failed to object on this basis at trial,our review is for plain error which is error that affected his substantial rights.united states pinque,cir,cert.denied,d quoting united states jorgensen,cir.no such error is present here.the instruction clearly prohibited the jury from convicting willis unless it found some act willfully done in furtherance of an intent to evade or defeat the tax he owed.
next,willis contends that the court erred in issuing a willful blindness instruction.the court instructed the jury that the necessary element of knowledge could be inferred 
if the defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what otherwise would have been obvious to him.you may not find the defendant acted knowingly,however,if you find that the defendant actually believed he had no duty to pay taxes.a showing of negligence,mistake or carelessness is not sufficient to support a finding of knowledge.
a willful blindness or deliberate indifference instruction is appropriate when there is evidence to support the inference that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the existence of the fact in question and purposely contrived to avoid learning all of the facts in order to have a defense against subsequent prosecution.united states barnhart,cir.
willis argues that the evidence shows that he actively sought to learn his obligations under the law by consulting accountants and lawyers and by reading materials on the subject the willful blindness instruction should therefore not have been given.willis objected to this instruction at trial and so we review the court decision to give it for abuse of discretion.beckman,at cir.the government presented evidence sufficient to support the deliberate indifference instruction here.testimony from the lawyers and accountants willis approached,as well as irs agents,indicate that he was eager to convince them that payment of taxes was voluntary and was unwilling to hear any contrary view.the very documents upon which willis says he relied in forming his belief expressly warned that the irs and the courts did n
