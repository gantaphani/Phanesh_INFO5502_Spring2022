on slip opinion page at,line,delete tax before programs.
on slip opinion page at,line,insert the following footnote after the word objections.in its petition for rehearing,the government contends that the court erred in reversing the morans conviction on the wire and mail fraud counts,arguing that those counts were based not on the morans willful violations of the tax laws but on their misrepresentations to clients regarding the existence and validity of the loans in the look back program and the legitimacy of the fees aaa collected.however,the tax fraud and wire and mail fraud counts were inextricably intertwined in the government case.count two of the second superseding indictment,the wire and mail fraud count,incorporated by reference all but one of the paragraphs of count one,the tax fraud count.in its opening statement,the government asserted that these programs were nothing more than a tax fraud scheme,and the jury instructions were limited to generic fraud without distinguishing between evidence bearing on one or the other count.finally,the hayes letter questioned the legitimacy of the programs that were the subject of the wire and mail fraud counts in barring moran from testifying about legal opinions she had received about the cbo program after the government had her about the letter,the court prevented her from presenting a good faith defense to those counts as well.
future petitions for rehearing and petitions for rehearing en banc will not be entertained.
pamela and james moran appeal their convictions of conspiracy to defraud the united states,conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud,aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of false federal income tax returns,mail fraud,and wire fraud.they contend that the district court erred in four ways by allowing expert testimony that certain financial transactions were shams by giving allegedly improper pinkerton instructions to the jury by admitting codefendant wayne anderson computer records as coconspirator statements and by excluding moran testimony regarding outside expert opinions she had received about the legality of the morans schemes.we find no error in allowing the expert testimony,admitting the computer records,or in the jury instructions.however,because the district court erroneously excluded moran testimony as hearsay and did not provide a reasoned basis for excluding it under federal rule of evidence,and because this testimony would have comprised a critical element of the morans good faith defense,we reverse and remand for a new trial.
factual and procedural history 
anderson ark and associates aaa offered clients several forms of tax reduction plans according to the government,offshore money laundering plans,and promoted these plans in public seminars.appellants pamela and james moran were the executive education officers who trained the aaa sales force.
aaa offered several programs to customers who had paid for and successfully completed the membership application process.the sociedads anonima sa program allegedly provided costa rican corporate entities through which to pass united states funds.the look forward partnership program allegedly allowed clients to take tax deductions on money invested in the sas and subsequently repatriate the money by paying for nonexistent services.the look back joint venture program allegedly provided a tax shelter by generating fictitious losses as part of fictitious loans to costa rican corporations which were ostensibly going to develop and market a tax magic program.finally,the loan plan,while marketed as a way to earn returns on the funds clients had transferred to costa rica,allegedly was actually a ponzi scheme.
on december,december,and august,the united states filed initial,first,and second superseding indictments against pamela moran,james moran,and eight other defendants.the morans were indicted on numerous counts of conspiracy,wire and mail fraud,aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of false federal income tax returns,and other substantive offenses related to the conspiracies.
at trial,the court sustained the government hearsay objection to moran testimony about what her cpa had told her concerning filing statements in place of form with the irs in sustaining the objection,the court also cited federal rule of evidence.on a later occasion,after the government had moran about a letter she had seen from an outside lawyer expressing concerns about the aaa program,defense counsel on redirect asked moran whether anybody else had given her a legal opinion about the program.again,the court sustained the government objection on hearsay and rule grounds.
as part of the government case,an expert testified that the aaa programs involved sham transactions.the term sham was also used as part of the jury instructions on the counts involving assistance in filing false tax returns.the judge also gave the jury pinkerton instructions,stating that they could convict one defendant of the substantive crime of a coconspirator if the crime was committed in furtherance of that conspiracy.finally,over objection,wayne anderson computer records were admitted under federal rule of evidence,which exempts statements from the hearsay rule.
on december,following a day jury trial,pamela and james moran were convicted on counts each,including the conspiracy counts.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
sham transaction testimony 
appellants contend that by testifying that the look forward program was a sham,professor sherman offered an impermissible legal conclusion and vouched for the credibility of certain witnesses.they also argue that the sham transaction instruction improperly provided a nonstatutory basis for conviction.neither of these arguments has merit.
generally,an expert can testify on an ultimate issue in a case,except regarding the requisite mental state of the defendant or a condition constituting an element of or defense to the crime.however,an expert witness can not give an opinion as to her legal conclusion,an opinion on an ultimate issue of law.similarly,instructing the jury as to the applicable law is the distinct and exclusive province of the court.hangarter provident life and accident ins,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.as appellant objected to the testimony before and during trial,w e review a district court decision to admit expert testimony for abuse of discretion.united states perlaza,cir.
the sham testimony related to the second element of the offense that the return was false as to something that was necessary to a determination of whether income tax was owed.thus,the word sham does not address a legal conclusion.under the judge instructions,even if the transactions were a sham,the jury would still have had to draw its own inference from that predicate testimony to answer the ultimate factual question,of whether income tax was owed.see united states morales,cir.while use of an expert term in the jury instructions may not have been ideal,it was not erroneous.
appellants also argue that by testifying that the look forward program was fraudulent,contrary to the testimony of some clients who believed that the transactions were real,professor sherman improperly vouched for the veracity of government witnesses.
it is misconduct for a prosecutor to elicit comments on the veracity of witnesses or the guilt of the defendant.see,united states combs,cir finding error where prosecutor asked defendant to testify that government agent was lying united states henke,cir finding that admission of testimony that defendants must have known of misconduct was erroneous.nothing of the sort occurred here sherman never referred to a single witness or discussed the veracity of witnesses generally.that an expert reaches a conclusion that either agrees with or conflicts with that of a witness whose testimony he incorporated into his conclusions,does not without more constitute vouching.there was no error.
finally,appellants argue that the instruction defining sham transactions was untethered to any element or particular crime,and allowed the jury to convict defendants without finding the elements of a crime.when assessing jury instructions,we examine them as a whole,and in context.united states stapleton,cir.the instruction complained of merely defined a sham transaction it did not state that such a transaction standing alone is a basis for conviction.read in context with the instructions as a whole,it provided guidance to the jury in determining whether the aaa program could provide a valid tax deduction which,in turn,led to the determination whether the income tax returns were false.there was no error.
ii.pinkerton instructions 
the morans argue that the district court conspiracy instructions,based on pinkerton united states,allowed the jury to convict one defendant of a substantive crime committed by another defendant,even when that crime was not part of a conspiracy in which both defendants took part.under pinkerton,a defendant may be found guilty of a substantive crime committed by a coconspirator in furtherance of their conspiracy.id.at.in the absence of a timely objection to the jury instructions,we review for plain error.see united states sanders,cir.in evaluating jury instructions,w e consider how the jury would have reasonably understood the challenged instruction in the context of the instructions as a whole.united states warren,cir citing francis franklin,d.
the jury instructions in question as read by the district judge were as follows 
each member of the conspiracy is responsible for the actions of the other conspirators performed during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.if one member of a conspiracy commits a crime in furtherance of the conspiracy,the other members have also,under the law,committed the crime.
therefore,you may find a defendant guilty of one or more of the substantive counts alleged in the indictment if the government has proved each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt 
a person named in a substantive count of the indictment committed the crime alleged in that count.the same person was a member of the conspiracy charged in counts,or.
the person committed the substantive crime in furtherance of the conspiracy charged in counts,or.
the defendant was a member of the conspiracy charged in counts sic or at the time the offense charged in the substantive count was committed by the other person.
and the conduct constituting the substantive count fell within the scope of the unlawful agreement and could reasonably have been foreseen to have been a necessary or natural consequence of the unlawful agreement.
appellants contend that,using only the elements listed,one defendant could be convicted of a second defendant substantive crime if the two were involved in a separate conspiracy which did not involve that particular crime.
while a careful picking apart of the instructions wording does reveal minor ambiguity,when read in its entirety,the instructions were clear and did not permit such an improper conviction.the first paragraph lays out the point of the instruction that if one member of a conspiracy commits a crime in furtherance of the conspiracy,the other members can be found liable of that crime.thus,while the wording of the individual instructions may not have been perfect when examined under a microscope,when read as a whole it would have been clear to a jury that before it could convict a defendant of a substantive count committed by a codefendant,it had to find that the conduct underlying that count fell within the scope of a conspiracy of which both defendants were members and was reasonably foreseeable under the conspiracy.there was no error.
iii.admission of computer records 
over objection,the district court admitted as coconspirator statements testimony and related exhibits regarding the quickbooks financial data recovered from wayne anderson computer.appellants contend that the admission of these records against them was error because the records were not kept in furtherance of the conspiracy.
we review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision to admit coconspirators statements,and review for clear error the district court underlying factual determinations that a conspiracy existed and that the statements were made in furtherance of that conspiracy.united states shryock,cir citing united states bowman,cir.when offered against a party,a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not barred by the hearsay rule.d e bowman,at citing bourjaily united states,d.
appellants argue that anderson was keeping the books for his own purposes,not in furtherance of a conspiracy.statements made for personal objectives outside the conspiracy or as part of idle conversation are not admissible under rule d e.see,united states bibbero,cir holding statements in idle conversation inadmissible.however,statements made to keep coconspirators abreast of an ongoing conspiracy activities satisfy the in furtherance of requirement.united states yarbrough,cir.
the district court determined that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the computer records were statements by wayne anderson in furtherance of the conspiracy.the computer was seized from a home belonging to anderson.access to the computer was protected with a password.at least one account was in anderson name.the computer contained numerous documents relating to aaa,including a quickbooks database reflecting financial data about the various aaa principals,clients and programs.taken together,these facts tend to show that the computer records were used to keep track of transactions which were a part of aaa fraudulent schemes as the district court observed,i n any conspiracy that involves complex financial transactions,it is in furtherance of the conspiracy to maintain a record of those transactions.
while appellants offered evidence that the records were inaccurate,suggesting that they were meant to deceive,not inform anderson coconspirators,which would render them inadmissible,they have not demonstrated clear error in finding them to be coconspirators statements.
finally,the alleged evidence of inaccuracies in the computer records does not affect their admissibility,but merely goes to their weight.see bourjaily,at.a court need not independently inquire into the reliability of coconspirator statements.the district court did not err in admitting the quickbooks data.
iv.moran testimony 
the morans argue that by excluding moran testimony about advice she received from outside financial and legal experts,the district court committed reversible error.moran principal defense was that she held a good faith belief that the programs in which she participated were legal.she contends that her belief was based,among other things,on opinions from a cpa and outside experts.the district court sustained objections to her testimony about what she had been told on grounds of hearsay and rule 
on two occasions during the trial,the district court excluded testimony by moran about what she had learned from outside experts.on the first occasion,she started to testify what the cpa preparing her statements to the irs had told her.when the prosecution objected to hearsay,the court sustained the objection and added,that a analysis that the probative value is outweighed by the potential for prejudice.
the second exchange occurred following the of moran,during which the government questioned moran regarding a letter she had received from an outside attorney in which that attorney had questioned the legality of aaa programs on redirect,moran attempted to testify about legal opinions she had received from outside experts the government objected without specifying grounds,and the court sustained the objection,referring to both rule and the hearsay rule 
whether the district court committed error 
a district court ruling excluding testimony is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states sure chief,cir.however,when the court excludes evidence
