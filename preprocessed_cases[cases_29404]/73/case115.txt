at issue in this appeal is whether amounts owing by a debtor hospital under massachusetts general law,chapter,section,to a state fund known as the commonwealth uncompensated care pool are properly considered to be excise taxes enjoying priority in bankruptcy under a e.
appellant,boston regional medical center,brmc or debtor filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of massachusetts.appellee,the commonwealth of massachusetts,by its division of health care finance and policy hcfp,filed a proof of claim.after resolving a disagreement over the dollar amount,appellee finally asserted a priority of claim for,a sum representing appellant unpaid prepetition obligations as an acute hospital under.laws ch,to the commonwealth uncompensated care pool the pool while the debtor agreed to the dollar amount of the claim,it disputed appellee contention that the claim was entitled to priority as an excise tax under section a e of the bankruptcy code.determining the claim was for an excise tax,the bankruptcy court overruled appellant objection and granted priority to the claim.in re boston reg l med,brmc ii.appellant appealed,and the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment,stating its reasons in the course of an unpublished bench ruling.we affirm the district court.
the case was submitted on stipulated facts,the substance of which are as follows.
prior to filing its chapter bankruptcy petition,appellant,brmc,owned and operated a private,acute hospital in stoneham,massachusetts.as an acute within massachusetts,brmc was required by massachusetts law to participate in the pool pool the pool,administered by the state division of health care finance and policy,is a fund from which massachusetts hospitals are paid or credited for the free health care they furnish to patients who do not have health insurance or can not otherwise pay for hospital care.laws.ch,h and k.the pool stated statutory purpose is to provide access to health care for low income uninsured and underinsured residents of the commonwealth.id.the massachusetts supreme judicial court has stated,in respect to an earlier version of the pool law,that the pool purpose is to more equitably distribute the burden of uncompensated acute hospital services across all acute hospitals.hosp.rate setting comm n,quoting.laws ch.
pool funding comes both from the mandatory assessments made against each acute hospital based on its private sector charges,infra,and from other governmental funds and assessments.the amounts collected by the pool are segregated for its own purposes and are not used to fund other governmental programs or otherwise to defray the costs of state government.
section provides for the collection and distribution of pool funds among the hospitals.according to section e,a hospital liability to the pool is proportional to the amount of otherwise uncompensated care each hospital provides.liability to the pool,the assessment based on its private sector charges shall equal the product of the ratio of its private sector charges to all acute hospitals private sector charges and the private sector liability to the uncompensated care pool as determined by law in order to determine the debtor hospital individual liability to the pool,the hcfp must,therefore,first determine the amount of private sector charges for all hospitals in massachusetts.private sector charges is defined as a hospital gross patient service revenue,less the amount of gross patient service revenue that is attributable to medicare,medicaid and other publicly aided patients,free care and bad debt.laws ch.
in calculating a hospital liability to the pool,certain credits are provided.a hospital assessed liability to the pool is offset against the amount owed by the pool to the hospital for uncompensated care during the same period,thus resulting in either a net liability to the pool or a net distribution from the pool.laws ch,d.the pool,therefore,charges the hospitals collective private sector revenue to pay for the hospitals collective burden of uncompensated care,resulting,at bottom,in a net transfer of revenue from those hospitals that provide less uncompensated care as a proportion of the hospital total patient service charges to those that provide more.laws ch,d and h.to the extent a hospital receives reimbursement for free care directly from medicare,medicaid or another source other than the pool,the amount owed by all other hospitals is reduced because the amount of funding required from the pool is reduced.
furthermore,disproportionate share hospitals which are hospitals that have a payer mix where a minimum of percent of the acute hospital gross patient service revenue is attributable to certain government payments and free care and share hospitals which do not have that payer different treatment under section.laws ch.in the event that the pool does not have sufficient funds to reimburse all hospitals for all of the free care provided,the amount paid from the pool is weighted towards disproportionate share hospitals.
pursuant to section,brmc owes appellee a total of,representing the total amount due to the pool for the following fiscal years 
the bankruptcy court concluded that the foregoing total pool claim was entitled to priority as an excise tax,thus giving rise to the single issue presented in the current appeal.brmc ii,at.
present contentions and the opinions below 
as it did below,the appellant now argues that the claim for the pool assessment owed by brmc is not for an excise tax,thus not entitled to priority,under a e of the bankruptcy code.in brmc view,the bankruptcy and district courts failed to engage in an adequate functional analysis of the nature of the statutory assessment underlying the pool claim.brmc contends that the pool statute is in form and function merely a risk sharing plan imposed on acute plan,that,instead of being a tax,is really only a regulatory fee imposed for the privilege of operating an acute hospital in massachusetts.
in response,appellee argues that the mandatory exaction placed by massachusetts law upon the state acute hospitals is a tax,having been legislatively established to raise monies to advance the public purpose of promoting continued access to acute hospital services by uninsured and underinsured residents of massachusetts.
in ruling that the pool assessment is a tax,not a fee,the bankruptcy court similarly laid particular emphasis upon the exaction public promotion of hospital access to uninsured and underinsured residents of massachusetts.brmc ii,at.that,coupled with its involuntary character and its other functional attributes,was found to differentiate it from a regulatory fee.id.at.
in affirming the bankruptcy court opinion,the district court stated from the bench that the bankruptcy court reasoning was persuasive with one possible exception.the court said the mere fact that the pool exaction was paid in order to serve the public welfare would not necessarily demonstrate it was an excise tax.almost everything paid to the government,the court suggested,is intended for a public purpose.here,however,the court found the exaction to be targeted specifically at paying for medical care for members of the public unable to pay for themselves.unlike the case of a driver license or other fee,the money is not collected by the government simply to confer a benefit on the payer or to pay itself for a government service rendered to the payer.functionally and under the suburban factors,this is a tax,the district court said.further,the tax is an excise,the court continued,citing a definition found in black law dictionary 
discussion 
at issue is whether the assessments for the uncompensated care pool imposed upon appellant under state law constitute excise taxes and,therefore,are entitled to priority under section a of the bankruptcy code.this is a federal question.city of new york feiring.state of new jersey anderson.the parties have stipulated to the facts,leaving only the application of the statute,a matter we examine on appeal de novo.commonwealth of.div.of employment and training boston regional med,in re boston reg l med,brmc i.
provisions that grant priority in bankruptcy are to be narrowly construed.see cramer mammoth mart,in re mammoth mart,cir stating,we begin with the premise that the theme of the bankruptcy act is equality of distribution.if one is to be preferred over others,the purpose should be clear from the statute.quoting nathanson nlrb.see also northwest fin.express,jwd,in re northwest fin.express,cir.
section a sets forth in descending order nine categories of priority claims.appellee claim for priority status is stipulated to be based solely upon its being an excise tax under a e,the eighth category.the relevant language reads as follows 
priorities.
a the following expenses and claims have priority in the following order 
eighth,allowed unsecured claims of governmental units,only to the extent that such claims are for 
e an excise tax on 
i a transaction occurring before the date of the filing of the petition for which a return,if required,is last due,under applicable law or under any extension,after three years before the date of the filing of the petition or 
ii if a return is not required,a transaction occurring during the three years immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition 
the parties do not question that appellee is a governmental unit,that it holds an unsecured claim,that the claim relates only to transactions occurring before the date of the filing of the petition,and that the limitation does not bar the claim.in dispute is only whether the claim is for an excise tax.unless so,the claim is without priority.
the bankruptcy code does not define excise tax,nor is the legislative history informative on what the term means.brmc i,at.we turn,therefore,to the relevant interpretive case law.see brmc i,at citing united states reorganized cf i fabricators of utah,d.the discussion in the cases has mostly concerned the meaning of the term tax,with little attention paid to the term excise.see,cf i,at.relying on precedent concerning definition of tax and concluding that the obligation at issue was a penalty rather than a tax and,therefore,that the obligation was not entitled to priority as an excise tax workers comp.trust fund saunders,in re park,noting that courts do not often engage in analysis of the excise portion of the phrase excise tax once an exaction has been determined to be a tax.
the supreme court has defined taxes as pecuniary burdens laid upon individuals or their property,regardless of their consent,for the purpose of defraying the expenses of government or of undertakings authorized by it.feiring,at.see also anderson,at.brmc i,at.this definition is sometimes called the standard.cf i,at.the court has added that courts should look beyond the statutory label of an exaction and evaluate its actual effects to determine whether it functions as either a tax or else as some different kind of obligation,like a debt,fee,or penalty.cf i,at.see also brmc i,at.
the lower courts have often struggled in applying the analysis to debts in a bankruptcy setting.some courts have asked whether the tax characteristics of a exaction outweigh its characteristics.in re chateaugay,bell brown in re payne.others have asked whether,regardless of characteristics,there are sufficient tax attributes to call the exaction a tax.see,waldo state of montana of labor and industry uninsured employers fund in re waldo,stating,t herefore since all elements of the list of tax characteristics are fully satisfied by the uef claim against debtor,debtor obligation is in the nature of a tax for purposes of the bankruptcy code,specifically a e.some courts have also sought to give particular and separate weight to the bankruptcy code principle of equal distribution of the debtor estate.see,workers comp.trust fund saunders,see also begier internal revenue service,d stating equality of distribution among creditors is a central policy of the bankruptcy code.
given the difficulty of applying general definition of a tax to the unusual state exactions sometimes encountered in a bankruptcy context,courts have formulated additional criteria for determining when a governmental claim is entitled to priority treatment.in re united healthcare.foremost among these has been the test developed in the ninth and sixth circuits known as the ii analysis.county sanitation lorber indus.of california,in re lorber indus.of california,cir ohio bureau of workers comp.yoder in re suburban motor freight,cir suburban ii.the bankruptcy court below relied heavily upon a massachusetts bankruptcy decision that applied ii to the pool exaction here.brmc ii,at citing in re ludlow hosp.soc y,at.the district court seemed largely content with that approach.
in lorber,the ninth circuit held that,to qualify as a tax,an exaction must be an involuntary pecuniary burden,regardless of name,laid upon individuals or property imposed by,or under authority of the legislature for public purposes,including the purposes of defraying expenses of government or undertakings authorized by it and under the police or taxing power of the state.lorber,at.in suburban ii,the sixth circuit expressed concern over the adequacy and possible of lorber public purpose prong,and it added two additional factors of its own,namely whether the exaction is universally applied to all similarly situated entities and whether the granting of priority status to a governmental claimant would prejudice private creditors with like claims.suburban ii,at see also brmc i,at sharing suburban ii court concern that lorber,by itself,was incomplete and,and may lead to incorrect results.citing suburban ii,at indus.comm camilli in re camilli,cir holding the suburban cases consistent with lorber and following the sixth circuit reasoning.
debtor contends the supreme court implicitly rejected the lorber suburban ii standard in united states reorganized cf i fabricators of utah,a case decided after the ninth and sixth circuits decisions in lorber and suburban ii.in cf i,the court made no mention of lorber or suburban ii.rather,it emphasized the continuing vitality of the cases in the feiring line.cf i,at.but lorber and suburban ii undertook to apply the principles stated in the feiring line,and we see nothing in cf i that renders those circuit precedents no longer useful constructs.we faced this issue recently in brmc i,holding that lorber and the suburban cases remained persuasive after cf i.we said in brmc i 
the bap treated anderson and feiring on the one hand,and lorber and the two suburban cases on the other,as developing different and apparently mutually exclusive tests.it then concluded that the supreme court had chosen the former test rather than the latter in cf i.we consider lorber and the suburban cases to be refinements of the law generated in anderson and feiring,which remain persuasive to although not binding on this court after cf 
brmc i,at citations omitted.the lorber suburban ii approach therefore remains an available tool of analysis,although,of course,subject at all times to the overarching authority of feiring and anderson.see,san juan cellular public serv.comm of puerto rico,cir utilizing an approach that approximated the first three prongs of lorber in re ludlow hosp.soc y,at stating,this court disagrees with the trustee assertion that san juan cellular represents an approach different from what appears to be a line of cases commencing with feiring.notwithstanding the fact that san juan cellular was decided under the tax injunction act,we find the thoughts expressed by the panel in san juan cellular virtually indistinguishable from those expressed by the ninth and sixth circuits in lorber and suburban ii,both decided under the bankruptcy code.many other courts have found ii to be consistent with,and useful in applying,the controlling rationale.see in re cassidy,cir indus.comm of camilli in re camilli,cir,cert.denied,d in re park,sacred heart hosp.dep t of labor and indus.in re sacred heart hosp,in re chateaugay,at in re nut.
accordingly,in considering the term tax here,we avail ourselves of the analytical approach set out in ii.in doing so,we find ourselves in essential agreement with the similar application of ii in in re ludlow hosp.soc y,as adopted by the bankruptcy court below.brmc ii,at citing in re ludlow hosp.soc y,at.
involuntary burden 
we ask first whether the pool exaction was an involuntary pecuniary burden.lorber,at.the lorber court explained that an involuntary pecuniary burden was a obligation imposed by state statute upon taxpayers who had not consented to its imposition.id.citing dungan of,state of,cir,aff g in re farmers frozen food.the exaction here was imposed by statute it was neither consented to,nor part of a contract.it was thus an involuntary pecuniary burden.
appellant argues that the assessment was nonetheless voluntary because each acute hospital could to some degree regulate its obligation to the pool by choosing to provide more or less free care.however,acute hospitals within the ambit of.laws ch,have no legal option but to pay or credit such assessments as are due.and even if appellant enlarged the quantum of free care it provided,it could not be certain to avoid liability.an acute hospital liability is based,in part,upon the amount of free care that all other acute hospitals in the state have provided for that same unpredictable amount.the only way appellant could be certain to avoid sharing in the burdens of the pool would be to cease all acute care operations.see in re suburban motor freight,concluding that the statute insurance scheme in favor of private insurance was involuntary since employers were not permitted to opt out and rejecting argument that scheme was voluntary because employers could choose not to be under it by refusing to conduct business in the state.by appellant rationale,the federal income tax would not qualify as a tax because the taxpayer may voluntarily minimize his or her tax liability by earning less income or by taking advantage of deductions.see,in re sacred heart,at stating,all taxes may be avoided by a choice of the taxpayer.
exaction imposed under state authority 
secondly,there is no dispute the pool exaction is imposed under the authority of the massachusetts legislature.lorber,at.
exaction was for a public purpose 
thirdly,the pool exaction is for a public purpose,for the defraying of expenses or undertakings of a type commonly assumed by the,those providing free health care to persons without the resources to pay for it.lorber,at.there is no correlation between what a hospital pays and the receipt in return of some particular service.rather,the hospital is obliged,based on an equitable formula,to help fund hospitals around the state that serve indigent members of the public,thus enabling massachusetts to provide free care to residents.disproportionate share hospitals rely on pool funds to remain in business while acute hospitals are the exclusive recipients of these funds,the amount each receives relates to the amount of free public services each provides.under the statutory scheme,individual hospitals serve as conduits through which the pool channels funds to pay for the free care rendered to uninsured or underinsured patients.this court stated in san juan cellular,at,that c ourts facing cases that lie in the middle of this spectrum have tended sometimes with minor differences reflecting the different statutes at issue to emphasize the revenue ultimate use,the ultimate use here is a valid governmental specifically identified in the relevant massachusetts statute.see.laws ch.
appellant argues that the exaction does not defray costs of the commonwealth because the pool merely spreads the cost of care among the acute hospitals.it further notes that the funds of the pool are segregated from other state revenues and not used to fund other governmental operations of the commonwealth of massachusetts.according to appellant,the exaction is merely to defray costs and provide benefits to hospitals participating in the program rather than to the commonwealth and the general public.in support of this argument,appellant analogizes the pool to the unemployment compensation fund in brmc i.we disagree.in brmc i,we concluded that the fund scheme was not a tax because,among other reasons,the distinction between the payments required to sustain a government undertaking as a whole and those required merely to compensate for the costs imposed by a particular participant is significant.at.here the payments to the pool are geared to sustain,as a whole,the stated governmental undertaking of providing access to health care for uninsured and underinsured residents of the commonwealth.accordingly,these costs are distinguishable from the costs in brmc 
nor is the pool analogous to the unemployment compensation fund.to be sure,the pool operates as a sort of risk sharing plan,but that does not preclude it from satisfying the public purpose requirement.see williams motley,cir pool of funds to be distributed among all of the state automobile insurers to compensate for uninsured drivers was a tax,not a regulatory fee,because the pool purpose was to benefit the general public by reducing the overall costs of uninsured motorist insurance coverage.we have expressed a willingness to declare such mechanisms taxes.see san juan cellular,at stating,or,a tax may serve such purposes indirectly by,for example,raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency expenses.
pool assessment imposed under police or taxing power 
fourthly,there is no dispute that the pool assessment was imposed pursuant to the commonwealth police or taxing power.lorber,at.
assessment uniformly applied to all 
fifthly,the pool assessment is uniformly applied to all similarly situated entities.suburban ii,at.the debtor argues that since the pool statute favors disproportionate share hospitals,it is not uniformly applied.it points out that hospitals providing a disproportionate amount of free care receive the most benefit from the pool.for example,after years where there is a deficiency in the pool,those disproportionate share hospitals with the greatest proportional requirement for pool income have to pay less of a share into the pool than do the other hospitals.also,in the event that the pool does not have sufficient funds to reimburse all hospitals for all of the free care provided,the amount paid from the pool is weighted towards disproportionate share hospitals.however,all acute hospitals are subject to the same rules all similarly situated hospitals are treated alike.see,ludlow hosp.soc y,at finding that pool satisfied requirement that the assessment be universally applied to similarly situated entities because the obligation to participate in the pool is universally imposed on all acute hospitals in the commonwealth.under the pool assessment scheme,acute hospitals with the same financial profiles in any given year will have the same liability in the pool.boston reg l med,at.under debtor reasoning,the federal personal income tax,which treats people with different incomes differently,would not constitute a tax.we conclude the exaction here is applied uniformly to similarly situated entities.
no prejudice to private creditors 
lastly,under the final ii factor,we consider if granting priority to the pool assessment would prejudice private creditors with like claims.suburban ii,at.the suburban ii court framed this sixth requirement because it was concerned that private actors who might,in some cases,perform the same function as the government would be given inferior priority.suburban ii,at stating if the state had an optional participation program,or allowed employers to purchase private liability insurance,it would be unfair and without statutory justification to call premiums taxes and put the bureau ahead in line while leaving unpaid private insurers to languish along with the rest of the unsecured creditors.quoting suburban i,at emphasis supplied citations omitted.
the bankruptcy court determined there were no private creditors with claims sufficiently similar to appellee who would suffer any disadvantage by conferring priority treatment to a pool claim.we agree.appellant points to no private creditor with a role comparable to appellee.no private entity with power to require hospitals to contribute to
