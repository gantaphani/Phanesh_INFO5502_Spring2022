commissioner of internal revenue commissioner or government appeals an adverse judgment of the united states tax court tax court which held that,for income tax years and,brookshire brothers holding,and subsidiaries collectively,brookshire or taxpayer did not make an unauthorized change in its method of accounting in violation of e of the internal revenue code irc.we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
the tax court decided this case on stipulated facts.historically,brookshire has operated grocery stores or supermarkets,primarily in the state of texas.the parent and subsidiary corporations constitute an affiliated group that employs the accrual method of accounting and files a consolidated federal income tax return for tax years that end on the last saturday in april.pursuant to irc,brookshire has always used the modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs for purposes of depreciating the tangible assets here at issue.
beginning in,brookshire undertook construction of gas station properties at grocery store locations in texas.in the initial years,brookshire corporate tax returns identified the gas stations as real property which,under the macrs rules,reported depreciation on a method for periods of or years for its tax years.brookshire subsequently filed amended returns for those three tax years,reclassifying the gas stations as under the macrs rules,depreciation on the declining balance method over a recovery period of years.the amended returns contain the following statement 
the determination was made that gas station convenience stores should be reclassed from and year property to year property based on the attached memo.
the attached memo was an isp entitled industry specialization program coordinated issue paper for petroleum and retail industries,which had been issued by the internal revenue service irs effective march.the irs accepted those amended returns and issued refunds to brookshire in the full amounts claimed for tax years ending in and,and in a partial amount for the tax year ending in.
thereafter,brookshire timely filed corporate tax returns for the tax years here at issue,those ending in april,and,continuing to classify and depreciate the gas station properties in the same manner that had been employed in the amended returns for.brookshire never filed an application for change in method of accounting form for the gas station properties not in connection with the initial returns for not in connection with the amended returns for those years and not in connection with the returns for and.the commissioner issued a deficiency notice following irs examinations of brookshire returns for tax years ending in april,and,asserting,inter alia,that brookshire depreciation deductions for those years had to be decreased because brookshire had changed its accounting method without obtaining prior consent from the commissioner pursuant to irc e.
irc e requires that a taxpayer who changes the method of accounting on the basis of which he regularly computes his income in keeping his books shall,before computing his taxable income under the new method,secure the consent of the secretary.treasury reg.e i specifies that a taxpayer who changes the method of accounting employed in keeping his books shall obtain the consent of the secretary before computing his income upon such new method for purposes of taxation regardless of whether or not such method is proper or is permitted under the internal revenue code or the regulations thereunder.the commissioner does not contend that the method used by brookshire for and is either improper or not permitted.
treasury reg.e i instructs that to secure the commissioner consent the taxpayer must file an application on form with the commissioner during the taxable year in which the taxpayer desires to make the change in method of accounting emphasis added if that which brookshire did regarding gas station depreciation constituted a change in method of accounting,the year in which brookshire desire d to make the change was its tax year ending in april,the one for which brookshire first employed the declining term for the preceding years in which the gas station properties were in service and depreciated for tax purposes,brookshire reported depreciation on a straight or year basis.but,as counsel for the commissioner confirmed at oral argument,and the other years covered by the amended returns are closed,explaining why the irs challenged brookshire corporate income tax returns only for tax years ending in and earliest ones remaining the fact that neither nor was the year for which brookshire desired to make,and did make,the alleged change.obviously,there can be only one such tax year,and here it was the one ending in april.
brookshire filed a petition in the tax court seeking redetermination of the deficiencies asserted against it for the years ending and.after brookshire and the commissioner consented to have the case decided on stipulated facts,the tax court ruled in brookshire favor.the commissioner timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in general,we review appeals from the tax court as we do those from district courts determinations of fact are reviewed for clear error rulings of law are reviewed de novo as this case was tried on stipulated facts,the only issues before us are conclusions of law,so our review of this case is entirely plenary.
agreement with the reasoning of the tax court 
after quoting irc e and the pertinent portions of the applicable treasury regulations,the tax court noted that a change in accounting method includes a change in the overall plan of accounting for gross income or deductions or a change in the treatment of any material item used in such overall plan.the tax court also noted that a material item is any item which involves the proper time for the inclusion of the item in income or the taking of a deduction.without deciding whether brookshire shift from real property to property for purposes of depreciation of the gas station properties constituted a change in accounting method for purposes of irc,the tax court observed that express exclusions are set forth in the regulations for specific types of adjustments that are not to be characterized as changes in accounting method.the court cited two relevant statements from reg.e ii b 
a change in method of accounting does not include adjustment of any item of income or deduction which does not involve the proper time for the inclusion of the item of income or the taking of a deduction.
in addition,a change in the method of accounting does not include an adjustment in the useful life of a depreciable asset 
the tax court began its detailed analysis by quoting its position that w hen an accounting practice merely postpones the reporting of income,rather than permanently avoiding the reporting of income over the taxpayer lifetime,it involves the proper time for reporting income.the court observed that brookshire neither altered its overall plan of accounting for income and deductions on an accrual basis nor changed its basic system of accounting for depreciation under macrs.the change from straight line deduction of depreciation over a or year period to the declining balance method over a period,however,impressed the tax court as involving the timing of deductions rather than the total amount of lifetime income.at first glance,this appeared to be a material difference and thus potentially a change in accounting method.according to the court,however,this putative change is subject to the exception earlier noted that an adjustment in the useful life of a depreciable asset does not constitute a change in the taxpayer method of accounting,regardless of the fact that these kinds of adjustments may involve the time for taking such deductions 
for the tax court,brookshire change within macrs from the lengthy straight line approach to the shorter declining balance approach can not constitute a material alteration for purposes of irc e if that change properly falls under the useful life exception of the regulations.the commissioner insists that useful life is an obsolescent term of art that did not survive adoption o
