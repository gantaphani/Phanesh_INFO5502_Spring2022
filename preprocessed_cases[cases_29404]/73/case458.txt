barbara and ronny deaton the deatons appeal a decision of the united states tax court the tax court sustaining a finding of the internal revenue service appeals office the appeals office that the deatons remittance of accompanied their form application for an extension of time to file their tax a payment,not a deposit,and that as such,it could not be credited against the deatons tax liabilities because it fell outside the period of b a.
facts and proceedings 
on april,the deadline for filing a individual income tax return,the deatons filed a form with the internal revenue service irs to extend the time for filing their return.form,titled application for automatic extension of time to file individual income tax return,automatically extends a taxpayer time to file his return if the taxpayer meets certain conditions however,it does not extend the time to pay tax.see reg.b a ny automatic extension of time for filing an individual income tax return shall not operate to extend the time for payment of any tax due on such return.to qualify for a form automatic extension of time to file,the deatons had to p roperly estimate their tax liability using the information available to them,e nter their tax liability on line of form,and f ile form by the due date of their return.instructions for form cat.see also reg.a such application for extension must show the full amount properly estimated as tax for such taxpayer for such taxable year.although the deatons were not required to remit any amount to the irs with their form,see instructions for form cat.if you find you ca pay the full amount shown on line,you can still get the extension.the instructions to form indicated that a taxpayer would be liable for interest and possibly a late payment penalty if he submitted less than the full amount of estimated taxes with his form,id.
to avoid incurring interest and any late payment penalty,the deatons submitted to the irs with their form a check in the amount of,which they calculated as the line balance due after deducting payments of in the form of withholdings from their estimated tax liability of.following receipt of the form,the irs extended the deatons deadline for filing their return by six months however,the deatons missed the extended deadline and in fact did not file their return until january,nearly six years after its due date.the deatons also failed to file timely returns for the tax years,and.
on january,the deatons filed delinquent returns for the tax years through.on their return,they reported a tax liability of only,which indicated that they had overestimated their tax liability on form by.the deatons requested that this overpayment be carried forward and credited as a payment toward their tax liabilities for the years following.
shortly after the irs received the deatons tax returns,it formally assessed the amounts reported as tax on each of the returns.for,the irs applied the amount already paid by withholding and the april remittance to the reported tax liability of.the irs then posted the resulting overpayment of to an excess collections account and did not carry it forward on the deatons account as a credit for subsequent tax years as the deatons requested.according to the irs,the deatons credit request was barred by b a,which limits the amount of a credit or refund claimed by a taxpayer to the amount paid within the period under that subsection,that is,the three years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return immediately preceding the filing of the claim.b a.the deatons had paid nothing to the irs within the applicable period,which dated back to july,so their credit was limited to zero.
this litigation arose out of the irs attempt to levy the deatons property to satisfy their tax liabilities,which remained unpaid because of the irs refusal to apply the overpayment as a credit in later years.after the irs issued a notice of intent to levy,the deatons timely filed a request for a collection due process hearing with the irs appeals office.in their request for a hearing,the deatons asserted that the remittance of was a deposit rather than a payment,a status that would have protected the remittance from the period for credits and refunds the appeals office rejected the deatons assertion,classified their remittance as a payment,subject to b a period,and sustained the irs proposed levy.
the deatons were likewise unsuccessful before the tax court.although the tax court acknowledged the judicially created distinction between a deposit and a payment,the court also recognized a split of authority regarding the treatment of a form remittance.applying its own precedent in risman commissioner,wl,which calls for an examination of the facts and circumstances of a case in order to determine whether the taxpayer intended his remittance as a deposit or a payment,the tax court reviewed the deatons tax records and a letter from their accountant asserting that the was a deposit.finding that the deatons had failed to demonstrate their contemporaneous intent to treat the remittance as a deposit,the tax court sustained the appeals office finding that the deatons remittance was a payment made outside the period of b a and upheld the appeals office determination that the irs proposed levy could proceed.this appeal ensued.because we agree with the tax court that the deatons remittance was a payment,rather than a deposit,we affirm the tax court decision.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the deatons remittance of was a payment or a deposit.this is a question of law that we review de novo.san antonio sav.ass comm r,cir this court has jurisdiction to review the decisions of the tax court in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury.we therefore examine this decision as we do other summary judgment decisions.because the dispute concerns findings of law,we review on a de novo standard.quoting.the tax court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.sandvall comm r,cir.
the deaton argue on appeal that the remittance that accompanied their form application for an extension of time to file was a deposit and that as such,it is not subject to the period of b a.they ask this court to reverse the tax court decision and order the irs to apply their overpayment as a credit to their tax liabilities or refund the overpayment to them.the deatons concede that if the remittance is properly classified as a payment,the irs may keep their overpayment because of b a period.
in deciding this appeal,we must assess the impact of the supreme court recent decision in baral united states,d,on this circuit longstanding rule that remittances made prior to assessment of a tax are deemed deposits rather than payments.see harden united states,cir unpublished ford united states,cir thomas mercantile bank,cir.the deatons contend that baral has no effect on their case or on our longstanding rule because it is limited to cases involving remittances governed by the deemed paid provision of b for example,wage withholdings and payments of estimated they argue that their remittance does not fall under that section.they urge that the proper characterization of their remittance depends on the facts and circumstances associated with it under rosenman,which predates baral.according to the deatons,the facts and circumstances surrounding their remittance establish their contemporaneous intent to treat it as a deposit,and they assert that fifth circuit law at that time supports such a finding the commissioner counters that after baral,we should treat remittances accompanying form applications as payments as a matter of law alternatively,the commissioner argues that the tax court correctly ruled under the test that the deatons remittance was a payment,not a deposit.because we have not previously explicitly addressed baral impact on our law we do so here.and for the reasons stated below,we agree that the deatons remittance was a payment,not a deposit.however,we decline to adopt a per se rule to govern remittances accompanying form applications as the commissioner requests.
origin of the distinction 
the distinction between deposits and payments was first established in rosenman.in that case,the supreme court considered whether the predecessor to the current provision barred a claim for refund of estimated estate taxes that the decedent executors had remitted in response to an absolute deadline,but which they strenuously disputed as erroneous.rosenman,at.the executors had included a transmittal letter with the remittance,emphasizing that t his payment is made under protest and duress,and solely for the purpose of avoiding penalties and interest,since it is contended by the executors that not all of this sum is legally or lawfully due.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the irs credited the remittance to a special suspense account,which was created to hold the funds because no taxes had yet been formally assessed against the estate.id.after completing an audit of the return nearly three years later,the irs formally assessed a deficiency.id.when the executors brought a claim for refund more than three years after the within three years of the irs formal claim was rejected as time barred.id.at.
in deciding that the taxes were not paid and that the limitations period therefore did not the tax was actually assessed by the irs,the supreme court specifically considered all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the executors original remittance,including the executors intent as stated in the transmittal letter and the irs treatment of the remittance once received.id.at.the court determined that when the executors submitted the remittance,they did not discharge what they deemed a liability nor pay one that was asserted.there was merely an interim arrangement to cover whatever contingencies the future might define.id.at.noting the irs deposit of the funds into a suspense account,the court concluded that m oney in these accounts is held not as taxes duly collected are held but as a deposit made in the nature of a cash bond for the payment of taxes thereafter found to be due.id.the court ruled that considering the specific facts and circumstances of the case,the remittance was a deposit and that the statute of limitations therefore did not bar the executors claim for refund.courts have since read rosenman as creating a test for distinguishing between deposits and payments.see,vancanagan united states,moran united states,cir blatt united states,cir ewing united states,cir fortugno comm r,cir risman,at.however,this circuit did not join those courts in their reading of rosenman.
fifth circuit law 
our circuit first applied rosenman in thomas mercantile national bank,cir.the mercantile national bank panel read the rosenman decision as establishing a rule that any amount remitted to the irs prior to a formal assessment of tax is,as a matter of law,a deposit.id.at.citing rosenman,the court held a claim for refund timely because 
u ntil the commissioner certified the assessment list there was no deficiency assessment,and no liability on the part of the taxpayer,and consequently nothing to pay.the sum deposited with the collector was merely an advance deposit to cover additional tax liability expected to arise thereafter.neither the estate liability,nor the fact that there was an overpayment could be determined until the deficiency assessment was entered.it would be illogical to hold,as the united states contends,that the statute of limitation began to run against a claim for refund before the deficiency itself came into existence,and before the fact that there was an overpayment,and if so the amount thereof,became ascertainable.
id.mercantile national bank thus took rosenman beyond its narrow facts and circumstances,which the supreme court had specifically emphasized in reaching its decision,and adopted a per se rule that remittances are deposits.
almost thirty years after mercantile national bank was decided,a panel of this court begrudgingly applied its per se rule in ford united states,cir,but not without making clear its disagreement with mercantile national bank holding despite our view of supreme court precedent,the course taken by our sister circuits,and appropriate tax policy,we are constrained by the bonds of thomas mercantile national bank at dallas.id.at.after thoroughly discussing the reasons for abandoning the rule and inviting the court to reconsider it en banc,the panel nevertheless applied mercantile national bank as binding circuit precedent.id.at.the motion for rehearing en banc was denied.ford united states,cir.
fifteen years later,the fifth circuit again addressed mercantile national bank in harden united states,cir unpublished the facts of harden are virtually identical to those of the instant case.the hardens filed form for both the and tax years,and they submitted remittances with each filing.harden,at.several years later,they filed their tax returns for those years,indicating substantially lower tax liabilities than the amounts previously remitted.id.like the deatons,the hardens sought to apply the overpayments as credits for subsequent tax years,but the irs denied their request as.id.
the government argued in harden that mercantile national bank and ford were distinguishable because they did not address taxpayer remittances accompanying form.according to the government,expressly defined such remittances as payments of tax for purposes of the statute of limitations,so the remittances were payments,not deposits,as a matter of law.although the harden panel appreciated the government rational and forceful argument,it concluded that it was bound to the decisions of this court in mercantile national bank and ford.in those cases we held that as a matter of law a remittance forwarded to the irs before an assessment of tax is to be considered a deposit rather than a payment.id.
impact of baral united states 
we now hold that,we are no longer bound by the mercantile national bank line of authority.in baral,the supreme court explicitly rejected the taxpayer argument that a tax can not be paid until tax liability is assessed and thereby abrogated the mercantile national bank rule that a remittance is a deposit rather than a payment.baral,at.t he code directly contradicts the notion that payment may not occur before assessment.the unanimous court construed the plain language of b and as providing unequivocally that two types of remittances,wage withholdings and payments of estimated income tax,are to be deemed paid on the due date of the tax return for the tax year in question,not when formal assessment occurs.baral,at.this treatment necessarily precludes the argument that all remittances are deposits,the position that this court took prior to baral and that the deatons argue still prevails.
according to the deatons,baral only applies to remittances that fall under b,not to transmittals made with form,and their position is bolstered by the court final statement in baral 
we need not address the proper treatment under of remittances that,unlike withholding and estimated income tax,are not governed by a deemed paid provision akin to b.such remittances might include remittances of estimated estate tax,as in rosenman,or remittances of any sort of tax by a taxpayer under audit in order to stop the running of interest and penalties.in the latter situation,the taxpayer will often desire treatment of the remittance as a if this means forfeiting the right to interest on an order to preserve jurisdiction in the tax court,which depends on the existence of a deficiency,a deficiency that would be wiped out by treatment of the remittance as a payment.we note that the service has promulgated procedures to govern classification of a remittance as a deposit or payment in this context.
id.at.citations omitted.however,this statement does not answer either whether the deatons remittance is one that is governed by a deemed paid provision akin to b or what the proper treatment is of remittances that are not governed by a deemed paid provision.the deatons position is that a remittance accompanying form is not a remittance governed by a deemed paid provision and that remittances not governed by a deemed paid provision are subject to the tes
