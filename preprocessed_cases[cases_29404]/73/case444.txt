disputes the amount of federal employment taxes that it owes for tax years through.contends that it owes only the ordinary federal employment taxes required by the federal insurance contributions act fica and federal unemployment tax act futa the government counters that,as the district court held,owes such taxes at the higher rates required by the railroad retirement tax act rrta and railroad unemployment repayment tax act rurta the railroad acts.we affirm the district court decision that is responsible for railroad acts taxes and owes penalties and interest for its failure timely to pay the correct amount of such taxes.
facts and proceedings 
is a delaware corporation headquartered in vivian,louisiana,engaged primarily in the business of manufacturing wooden railroad ties.for all times pertinent to this appeal,was a wholly owned subsidiary of southern industrial services,itself a wholly owned subsidiary of kansas city southern industries,kcsi,a holding company that owns myriad subsidiaries.from to,kansas city southern railway kcsr,a class i railroad that operated a rail carriage business,was another of these kcsi subsidiaries.for purposes of the railroad acts,kcsr was a railroad carrier,and and kcsr were under common control.
between and,primarily operated two businesses superior tie timber,which received,stored,and manufactured wood railroad ties and fleet maintenance fleet,which repaired railroad vehicles owned by kcsr and other companies.in the years through,generated between and of total revenues,and fleet generated between and of revenues 
in,kcsi decided to build a manufacturing and treatment plant that would produce and sell ties to railroad carriers,including kcsr,at a profit.kcsi chose as the corporate entity to construct,own,and operate the plant,which was then built in vivian,louisiana on land adjacent to kcsr main railroad line.the land for the plant was deeded to by another kcsi subsidiary.the plant construction was financed through industrial revenue bonds guaranteed by kcsi,and operations commenced in under the name.
also in,and kcsr entered into a agency agreement that required to meet kcsr railroad tie needs before selling to other customers and authorized to act as an agent for kcsr in purchasing raw lumber from which to make railroad ties.under this agreement,purchased such lumber on behalf of kcsr,stored it,treated it,made ties from it,and transported and delivered the ties to kcsr,all for a fee.would also sell kcsr finished ties that had produced using its own raw lumber.filled virtually all of kcsr railroad tie needs.although had and actively sought other customers,kcsr was supermajority customer from until,when their agreement expired 
until,paid ordinary federal employment taxes under fica and futa rather than the higher taxes required under the railroad acts.between and,the irs audited five times,determining each time that was an employer under the railroad acts,and thus had and underpaid its employment taxes after each of its five audits,the irs furnished an examination report and a letter stating the basis for the assessments of additional tax and the time within which could appeal.
protested each examination report and appealed each tax assessment through the irs administrative appeals process,losing four of the five.only successful appeal was the first one,covering tax years through,for which years the irs office of appeals held that had not been a railroad employer.in each of four subsequent appeals,however,the office of appeals held that was an employer under the railroad acts.
during each of its appeals,entered into security agreements with the irs which permitted it to postpone the payment of disputed taxes by posting a security bond.when the irs denied the last of appeals in january,paid all railroad acts taxes that it owed.
prior proceedings 
filed the instant lawsuit in april,seeking a refund of the higher railroad acts taxes that it had paid.argued in the alternative that even if it denied this refund request,the court should not assess any interest or penalties for failure to pay taxes and should allow to offset any fica and futa taxes that it had paid during the relevant tax periods against the amount of railroad acts taxes owed.
after a bench trial,the district court ruled that was not entitled to a refund because it was an employer under the railroad acts and that it owed interest and penalties.the court did,however,grant request for a credit for past employment taxes paid.timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
asserts that the district court erred in holding that it is an employer under the railroad acts and thus subject to higher federal employment taxes owes interest on the railroad acts taxes that it failed to pay from through and owes penalties for its failure to pay railroad acts employment taxes from through.we address each contention in order.
railroad employer 
standard of review 
whether a business is an employer under the railroad acts is a mixed question of law and fact when presented with such a question,we review the district court fact findings for clear error and its legal conclusions and application of law to fact de novo 
employers within the meaning of the railroad acts must pay extra federal taxes to finance the benefits afforded to their employees under the railroad retirement act rra and the railroad unemployment insurance act ruia.the railroad acts define employer not only as a railroad carrier but also as any company that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a railroad carrier or is under common control with such a carrier and operates any equipment or facility or performs any service except trucking service,casual service,and the casual operation of equipment or facilities in connection with the transportation of passengers or property by railroad,or the receipt,delivery,elevation,transfer in transit,refrigeration or icing,storage,or handling of property transported by railroad as does not dispute the district court determination that it and kcsr were under common control at all relevant times the only question is whether meets the operational prong of the railroad acts test for employer status,whether perform ed any service in connection with the transportation of passengers or property by railroad during the tax years in question.
although we have not previously addressed this precise issue,the eleventh circuit has.in railroad concrete crosstie corporation railroad retirement board,that court held that a railroad carrier wholly owned subsidiary which manufactured concrete railroad ties and did so predominantly for that carrier performed a service in connection with rail transportation,and thus was an employer under the railroad acts the court stated that when the nature of the relationship and the volume of sales between the subsidiary and its parent indicate that the subsidiary is economically dependent on the parent,and when the type of product is so obviously essential to the functioning of the railroad,that the subsidiary provision of the product to the parent constitutes a service to the parent the eleventh circuit rejected the tie manufacturer argument that the manufacture and sale of a tangible commodity,railroad ties,did not constitute a service within the meaning of the railroad acts emphasizing that a rra regulation explicitly states that a service or operation is in connection with the transportation of passengers or property by railroad if such service or operation is reasonably directly related,functionally or economically to railroad obligations.the eleventh circuit concluded that,because the subsidiary provision of railroad ties was related both functionally and economically to the parent railroad company operation as a carrier,the subsidiary performed a service in connection with transportation by rail,and was therefore liable for railroad acts taxes 
we follow the eleventh circuit convincing logic,which has also been adopted by the irs and hold that performed a service in connection with transportation by rail,qualifying it as an employer under the railroad acts.first,division performed a service by manufacturing railroad ties and s
