this dispute arises from certain tax deductions claimed by charles and beatrice reynolds on their and tax returns.the internal revenue service irs challenged the deductibility of certain expenses related to a family farm business,rental properties and to charles reynolds private law practice,which is,for better or worse,a sideline from his employment as an irs supervisor during the pendency of this dispute,the reynolds received two brief letters from the irs stating that they had no outstanding liability for the and tax years.the reynolds asserted that these letters were binding admissions by the irs,thus estopping the agency from pursuing any further action against them.the tax court rejected this argument and ruled on the merits,allowing some of the deductions and disallowing others.in addition,pursuant to a,the tax court upheld a penalty because it found that some of the remaining errors were the result of negligence.
the reynolds appeal the following the evidentiary weight given to the letters,the classification of certain legal defense costs as personal costs rather than as business expenses related to charles reynolds private law practice,the denial of various automobile and travel expenses related to the private law practice,farming activity and the rental properties,and the imposition of the penalties.we affirm the judgment of the tax court.
charles reynolds joined the irs in,where he worked as a revenue officer in the chicago office.several years later,reynolds graduated from law school and was promoted to a supervisory position,which involved a caseload of taxpayer audits.in and,reynolds received permission from the irs to practice law in addition to his primary employment with the irs.however,in,the irs commenced an investigation of reynolds springing from concerns that he may have been conducting his private law practice during his workday at the irs.to defend himself,reynolds hired a major chicago law firm and incurred legal expenses.the investigation was officially terminated in.
during and,which is the time period relevant to this dispute,charles reynolds operated a small law practice.these efforts were limited to a few real estate closings and related activities.in,reynolds schedule c for this law practice reported gross receipts of only however,he claimed a net loss of.his deductions included for legal fees related to the irs investigation of certain questionable activities.similarly,in,reynolds schedule c reported gross receipts of with a net loss of.this amount included in legal fees related to the ongoing investigation.in a subsequent audit,the irs disallowed the business deduction of the legal expenses,ruling that they should instead be categorized as itemized personal expenses on schedule a and thus deductible to the extent they exceeded the floor limitation of a.
in addition to the reclassification of the legal expenses,irs auditors also denied various other deductions,including automobile and travel expenses allegedly related to the law practice,to a family farm and to rental properties.only the auto and travel expenses,however,are currently before us on appeal.from our own inspection of the record,we estimate the total amount of the deductions now in dispute to be approximately included in this amount are travel and automobile expenses allegedly incurred by charles reynolds in the course of his law practice,including depreciation of a toyota camry.similarly,the irs denied travel and automobile expenses related to rental property owned by the reynolds in indiana,kentucky and virginia,and travel to florida to evaluate a real estate development project that never materialized.finally,the irs denied travel and automobile expenses incurred in a trip to a farm in kentucky,including the depreciation of a ford van,which was supposedly used to haul tillers,plows and farm tools from virginia to kentucky and for use in the operation of the farm.although the reynolds did not keep a log of specific trips and the mileage that corresponded with each activity,charles reynolds retained various receipts for gas,maintenance and repairs,and during the subsequent audit,he attempted to categorize each expense and to apportion it to the appropriate activities.
nonetheless,the irs denied the automobile and travel deductions on various grounds,including failure to comply with the substantiation requirements of d.after the irs had made several other adverse rulings that are not pertinent to this appeal,the agency calculated deficiencies of and for the and tax years,respectively,together with corresponding penalties of and,respectively.
in august of,the reynolds petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of their and tax liability.in march of,while this matter was still pending before the tax court,the reynolds apparently sent a letter of inquiry to the irs problem resolution office in kansas city,missouri,with respect to their and tax liabilities.it is important to note that this inquiry was not directed to the district counsel for the irs,who was representing the respondent in the ongoing dispute before the tax court.a month later,the reynolds received two short letters from the irs,one pertaining to and the other to,that were identically worded with the exception of the specific tax amounts peculiar to each.after listing credit adjustments for each year,both letters listed the amount you now owe as none.
in april,the case went to trial,and the reynolds asserted that the irs correspondence was tantamount to a binding admission by the government that estopped it from litigating the present case.the tax court rejected this argument as contrary to law.the court went on to consider various testimony and exhibits,issuing a decision in part for the reynolds and in part for the irs.the restated liability was and for the and tax years,respectively,together with corresponding penalties of and,respectively.although the amount in controversy in the case is relatively small,the reynolds assert that this appeal is being brought to purge the taint on charles reynolds reputation arising from the negligence penalty assessed against him.we agree that money is not the measure of all things worth fighting for,and the issues raised here are,for the most part,serious.
pursuant to,decisions of the tax court are reviewable by this court.see.the reynolds present four issues for review did the tax court err when it refused to consider the written notices sent to the reynolds in relation to their and tax liability did the tax court err in classifying charles reynolds legal defense expenditures as a itemized personal deductions rather than as a business expenses did the tax court err in ruling that the reynolds had failed to adequately substantiate their automobile and expenses on schedule c law practice,schedule e rental properties and schedule f farming business,as required by d did the tax court err in sustaining a a accuracy penalty against the reynolds for negligent underpayments of their and taxes 
before considering each issue in turn,we note that a decision of the tax court is subject to the same standards of review that we apply to district court determinations in a civil bench trial we review factual determinations,as well as applications of legal principles to those factual determinations,only for clear error.cline commissioner,cir accord toushin commissioner,cir fruit of the loom,commissioner,cir.however,deficiencies determined by the commissioner are presumed to be correct and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving otherwise.pittman commissioner,cir.
the first issue we address is whether the tax court erred when it refused to treat the two letters from the irs pertaining to the and tax years,respectively as binding admissions.the reynolds claim that these two documents are uncontroverted binding admissions of no deficiency,thus mandating a judgment in their favor.however,the cases relied upon by the reynolds in this regard all deal with judicial admissions,which enter the litigation either through the pleadings or under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.see,kohler leslie hindman,cir when a party in a lawsuit makes an admission in its pleadings or in its answer to a request for admissions,it makes a judicial admission that can determine the outcome of that lawsuit.citing.b keller united states,cir judicial admissions are formal concessions in the pleadings,or stipulations by a party or its counsel,that are binding upon the party making them.they may not be controverted at trial or on appeal they have the effect of withdrawing a fact from contention.quotations omitted.
although a judicial admission has the effect of settling an issue of fact for the purposes of the current litigation,nothing of that exalted significance is present here.the alleged admissions in this case were not furnished by the irs as part of the record before the tax court.in fact,the weight to be accorded these letters appears to be less than leaden.
the story unfolds as follows.the tax court scheduled the matter before us now for a trial to commence on march.on the day of trial,the district counsel for the irs learned that the reynolds had been subject to a premature deficiency assessment for the and tax years and motioned the tax court to return the case to its general trial docket.according to the court transcript for that date,the parties appeared to be close to settlement.the reynolds offered no objection to the government motion,and a continuance was granted.shortly thereafter,the reynolds apparently sent an inquiry to the irs problem resolution office in kansas city,missouri.on april,that office generated the two letters,which respectively credited the reynolds and tax years in the exact amount at issue before the tax court.both of these very short letters contained the following sentence this action is the result of your correspondence of march.however,a copy of the march,letter is not part of the record,presumably because it was sent to the irs problem resolution office in kansas city.if the reynolds wanted the irs to stipulate or to admit that the couple owed no taxes for and,they should have directed their correspondence to the district counsel for the irs,who was based in chicago and apparently was well known to the reynolds through previous settlement negotiations and court appearances.the reynolds can not obtain a judicial admission on the cheap.
at most,the two letters are extrajudicial admissions,which are admissible as evidence and may be weighed by the factfinder according to their probative value.see murrey united states,cir distinguishing between a judicial admission and an extrajudicial admission keller,at distinguishing between judicial admission and other admissions which are treated as evidence.in the case before us,the letters have virtually no probative value.the letters appear to have been computer generated and do not reference in any way the litigation that has been pending before the tax court.the letters state that the reynolds account was adjusted.because the reynolds could not be lawfully assessed with a tax deficiency until the tax court issued a decision favorable to the irs,see a,these letters most likely reflect an adjustment for a premature deficiency assessment.unfortunately,we do know what information the irs office in kansas city was acting upon because the correspondence which prompted the irs reply is not part of the record.
further,the settlement or closure of a civil tax dispute with the irs is a matter controlled by statute.see closing agreements,compromises.these provisions provide the exclusive method for settling civil tax disputes with finality.see brooks united states,cir holding that s ection is the exclusive method by which tax cases may be compromised whitney united states,cir holding that section of the internal revenue code is the exclusive means whereby tax disputes can be settled hagadone commissioner,memo,wl it is well established that as a general rule the commissioner is finally and conclusively bound by an agreement with a taxpayer only if the parties enter into a closing agreement under the provisions of section.the tax court correctly observed that the record is devoid of any evidence that petitioners and respondent entered into a valid closing or compromise agreement.on the evidentiary weight to be given to the letters,we are in agreement with the tax court.the letters get the petitioners no closer to their goal.
the next issue before us is whether the tax court erred when it ruled that legal defense costs incurred by charles reynolds during the and tax years were miscellaneous itemized deductions,which are subject to the floor contained in a,rather than business expenses related to the private law practice,which are fully deductible under a.the legal costs at issue here are related to the irs investigation of charles reynolds alleged,that he may have been conducting his private law practice during his official hours of employment at the irs.
the reynolds primary argument is that charles reynolds ability to practice law on a basis had to be approved through appropriate irs channels.thus,an adverse ruling could have led to the withdrawal of this approval and thus terminated his practice of law.the reynolds also claim that an adverse ruling would have negatively affected charles reynolds legal reputation,which would have caused him to lose business.following this logic,the reynolds maintain that all of the legal defense costs for and and,respectively were properly listed as schedule c business expenses.
in response,the government correctly argues that this issue is governed by the origin of the claim doctrine,which was first articulated by the supreme court in united states gilmore,d.in gilmore,the taxpayer attempted to deduct substantial legal expenses incurred in protracted divorce litigation with his estranged wife as a business expense related to property rather than as a personal expense.the taxpayer justified his position by arguing that the divorce litigation involved the disposition of three car dealerships owned by the taxpayer.he contended that the conservation of these assets depended upon his ability to retain a controlling stock interest in them moreover,if certain scandalous allegations were proven to be true,the taxpayer franchisor might have grounds to cancel his dealerships.the court rejected the taxpayer position,holding 
t he characterization,as business or personal,of the litigation costs of resisting a claim depends on whether or not the claim arises in connection with the taxpayer activities.it does not depend on the consequences that might result to a taxpayer property from a failure to defeat the claim,for that would carry us too far and would not be compatible with the basic lines of expense deductibility drawn by congress.
at.emphasis in original footnote omitted quoting lykes united states.
in the case before us,the origin of the claim lies in charles reynolds conduct as an irs employee,not in his trade or business as a attorney.charles reynolds incurred these legal costs because an irs investigation had been commenced to determine whether he was practicing law during his prescribed hours of employment at the irs.under gilmore,the consequences that may flow from the irs it may result in withdrawal of irs approval for the law practice or damage to charles reynolds professional not control the question whether the fees are deductible as a business expense.since the taxpayer bears the burden of showing that he has a right to a business deduction,staley,at,and no additional arguments have been advanced on this issue,the reynolds can not prevail.the disputed legal fees are properly classified as miscellaneous itemized deductions,which are subject to the floor contained in a.
the reynolds next assert that the tax court erred when it denied deductions for various automobile and travel expenses that were purportedly made in connection with the law practice,the rental properties or farming activity.the tax court ruled that none of the expenses at issue were deductible because the reynolds had failed to satisfy the substantiation requirements of d.at the outset,we note that a determination that a taxpayer has failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to support a deduction,including a failure to comply with the d substantiation requirements,is generally viewed as a finding of fact that is reviewed for clear error.see,yoon commissioner,cir reviewing d ruling for clear error buelow commissioner,cir the tax court determination that a taxpayer has failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to support a deduction is a factual finding subject to reversal only if found to be clearly erroneous.the tax code precludes a deduction for various enumerated items,including auto and travel expenses,unless a taxpayer substantiates by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating the taxpayer own statement the following five elements the amount,date,time,place and business purpose of the expense.d see also dowell united states,cir.
here,the reynolds fall far short of the necessary showing.based on the regulations under d,the reynolds can not avail themselves of the adequate records language of d because they did not maintain logs for each vehicle in their household to reflect their use in the law practice,rental property management or farming activities.see d stating that substantiation by adequate records requires a taxpayer to maintain an account book,diary,log,statement of expense,trip sheets,or similar record that is made at or near the time of the expenditure or use.although treasury regulations implementing d clearly state that adequate records are not the only method of establishing eligibility,alternative methods are for good reason.at the risk of the reader eyes glazing over,we will quote at length the rules of substantiation as they appeared in the code of federal regulations especially since they bear on the penalties that the reynolds also appeal 
a taxpayer must substantiate each element of an expenditure or use by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating his own statement a contemporaneous log is not required,but a record of the elements of an expenditure or of a business use of listed property made at or near the time of the expenditure or use,supported by sufficient documentary evidence,has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a statement prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall.thus,the corroborative evidence required to support a statement not made at or near the time of the expenditure or use must have a high degree of probative value to elevate such statement or evidence to the level of credibility reflected by a record made at or near the time of the expenditure or use supported by sufficient documentary evidence.the substantiation requirements of section d are designed to encourage taxpayers to maintain the records,together with documentary evidence,as provided in paragraph c of this section entitled substantiation by adequate records.
c emphasis added.
the implications of this passage are unmistakable.complete,contemporaneous records are the preferred method of substantiation.taxpayers who pursue alternative methods will have to present evidence that is equally credible and probative,which will be difficult.
when a taxpayer can not substantiate his deduction with adequate records,the treasury regulations specifically lay out the method for substantiation by other sufficient evidence.a taxpayer must establish each element of a d business expense a by his own statement,whether written or oral,containing specific information in detail as to such element and b by other corroborative evidence sufficient to establish such element.c i.
this alternate method was utilized by the reynolds at trial.specifically,charles reynolds testified as to the business purpose of each deduction and attempted to substantiate his account by presenting various documents that purported to reconstruct the date,amount and proper categorization of the claimed expenses.to prepare these exhibits,reynolds relied on voluminous receipts and cancelled checks from the and tax years a representative sample of these receipts was made available for inspection and then submitted into the record.
the tax court ultimately found this testimony and evidence unconvincing.for example,charles reynolds created a chart entitled reconstruction of mileages driven,which categorizes his auto expenses by month and activity,law practice,farm or rental properties.at the bottom of the chart,miles were attributed to the farm for trips on april,june,july and october.however,the only elaboration of the business purpose of the trips was the term crops,which appears next to the dates.charles reynolds testimony on his farming activities also undermined his case,since the tax court found it vague,confusing,and evasive.but perhaps the most damaging detail was an admission by reynolds that no crops were grown on his farm during the tax year.
expenses attributed to the rental properties suffered similar problems.for the tax year,the reynolds attributed miles and in hotel bills to two trips to virginia,where they own rental property.yet,the only business explanation for this substantial deduction is the elliptical phrase cleaning,leasing.the corroborating evidence,in combination with charles reynolds testimony on the nature of these trips,simply does not have the high degree of probative value necessary to put it on a par with adequate records documentation.c see also masat commissioner,cir ruling that mere fact that taxpayer owns property does not satisfy his or her burden of proving that the travel expenses were motivated by business rather personal reasons.
of the four corroborating summaries presented at trial,the chart is the most comprehensive breakdown.unfortunately,it does not contain the type of specific detail mandated by the treasury regulations all of the travel and car maintenance expenses are listed by month rather than by specific trip.see c i in the absence of contemporaneous written evidence,requiring specific information in detail as to each element of a d deduction.the listed figures are presumably the sum of adding together the voluminous receipts,though only representative receipts were included in the record but as the tax court correctly observed,many of these receipts are for automobile repairs having no apparent relationship to any particular trip or business.section d requires the taxpayer to prove the amount,date,time,place and business purpose of each claimed expense.the existence of these elements simply can not be discerned in any of the reynolds reconstructed summaries.
the automobile and travel expenses for the reynolds farming activities schedule f and rental properties schedule e clearly fail because of inadequate substantiation.see c stating that evidence must have a high degree of probative value to establish eligibility for deduction.although we believe that the auto and travel expenses attributed to the law practice schedule c share similar defects,they also suffer the more fundamental problem of being nondeductible commuting expenses.
according to reynolds,the mileage attributed to his law practice resulted from travel between his home and a title company,where he handled several real estate closings for his clients.in general,commuting expenses between home and work are personal and therefore nondeductible.see commissioner flowers.accord hb r,united states,cir flowers established the general rule that an employee expenses in commuting from home to work are personal,not deductible business expenses.b the taxpayer costs of commuting to his place of business or employment are personal expenses and do not qualify as deductible expenses.however,if a taxpayer maintains a home office as a principal place of business,and periodically travels to other sites to meet with clients or otherwise conduct their business,then these traveling costs are deductible as a business expense.that said,the taxpayer bears the burden of producing sufficient evidence to show that his principal place of business is,in fact,a home office.browning commissioner,cir.here,the tax court noted that during the and tax years,charles reynolds failed to claim a home office deduction.while failure to claim the deduction alone does not settle the issue of the traveling costs,the court also stated that charles reynolds offe
