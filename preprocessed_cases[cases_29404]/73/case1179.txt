introduction 
while jailed in a colorado state prison,carl william pursley was indicted by the united states for tax fraud.the government alleged that pursley filed fraudulent tax returns on behalf of himself and other prisoners and received refund payments as a result.he was subsequently convicted by a federal jury on one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of,and two counts of aiding and abetting the preparation of false tax returns,in violation of.
on appeal,pursley raises four claims challenging his conviction and sentence.the district court erred by failing to dismiss the case due to violations of the interstate agreement on detainers act refusing to sever his trial from that of a allowing the jury verdict to stand despite insufficient evidence to support the conspiracy conviction and,relatedly,contributing to jury confusion by improperly instructing them on the conspiracy count and violating the double jeopardy clause while imposing consecutive sentences for different crimes that were supported by the same evidence.
taking jurisdiction pursuant to a and,we affirm.
ii.factual background 
carl pursley and his,william wardell,were indicted by the united states on august,on various counts of tax fraud.pursley was specifically charged with conspiring to defraud the internal revenue service by assisting in the preparation of false tax returns for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining refunds based on the earned income credit.at the time the federal indictment was filed,pursley and wardell were prisoners of colorado,serving sentences on prior convictions.
to obtain his availability for trial,the united states lodged a detainer against pursley on august,and obtained custody by filing a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum on october.pursley was transferred to another facility under federal control where he remained for months while he awaited trial on the tax fraud charges.during that period,colorado filed a new indictment against pursley in an unrelated criminal case.accordingly,colorado sought his presence in state court for preliminary proceedings.on at least two occasions,the state filed writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to obtain temporary custody to escort pursley to court.each time,he was returned to federal prison the same day.at no time was pursley returned to a colorado corrections facility to resume serving his initial state prison sentence.
on april,pursley moved to dismiss the federal indictment with prejudice on the ground that the united states had violated the provision of the interstate agreement on detainers act in releasing him to the temporary custody of colorado.the district court denied his motion,and the case proceeded to trial.before it began,pursley moved to have his trial severed from that of his,alleging that they would present antagonistic defenses.the district court denied this motion as well.
on may,a federal jury convicted pursley on one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states and two counts of aiding and abetting the preparation of false tax returns.he was sentenced to months months imprisonment on the conspiracy count to be served consecutively with concurrent sentences for each count of aiding and abetting.he appeals both his conviction and sentence.
iii.discussion 
pursley raises four issues on appeal.we address each in turn.
interstate agreement on detainers 
pursley argues the united states violated the interstate agreement on detainers iad or agreement.hereinafter iad,by transferring him from a state to federal prison and then allowing state officials to escort him to state proceedings on new state charges while he was in federal custody.accordingly,he contends that the district court erred by failing to dismiss the federal indictment and that we should reverse his conviction.
the iad creates among its contracting parties uniform procedures for lodging and executing a detainer,a legal order that requires a state in which an individual is currently imprisoned to hold that individual so that he may be tried by a different state for a different crime.alabama bozeman,d.for purposes of the iad,the state in which a prisoner is initially serving a sentence is classified as the sending state here,colorado,and the state that subsequently indicts the prisoner and obtains custody is the receiving state here,the united states iad,art.ii b c.the agreement provides for expeditious delivery of the prisoner to the receiving state for trial prior to the termination of his sentence in the sending state and seeks to minimize the consequent interruption of the prisoner ongoing prison term.bozeman,at.the agreement is based on the premise that prison treatment and rehabilitation programs are negatively impacted when a prisoner is indicted and transferred to a new jurisdiction and then returned to the original place of imprisonment before trial is had on the new charges.see iad,art.
the agreement authorizes transfer of a prisoner from a sending state to a receiving state as follows 
the appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment is pending,the receiving state shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with article v a hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated,the sending state.
id.at art.iv a.the agreement protects the prisoner from excessive transfers through the provision,which states,
if trial is not had on any indictment contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner being returned to the original place of imprisonment to article v e hereof,such indictment shall not be of any further force or effect,and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.
id.at art.iv e.accordingly,by its express terms,the iad is violated under two a prisoner,who is serving a sentence in the sending state and indicted by the receiving state,is transferred to the receiving state based on its lodging a detainer against him and requesting custody,id.at art.iv a,and then returned to the original place of imprisonment before standing trial on the untried indictment,id.at art iv e.
in this case,the first condition of an iad violation was clearly met.while serving his sentence in colorado state prison,pursley was indicted by the united states,which lodged a detainer against him and,by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum,obtained custody and transferred him to a federal facility.see united states mauro,d holding the combination of lodging a detainer and obtaining custody by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum triggers application of the iad 
the principal issue here is whether the second condition of an iad violation was met.the prosecution argues pursley was never returned to the original place of imprisonment within the meaning of the iad because he was never sent back to a colorado prison.pursley objects to this literal reading of the text and argues that the provision be interpreted to include any type of custody over the prisoner by the sending state.
pursley argues that the supreme court in alabama bozeman interpreted the iad to require dismissal of pending charges by the receiving state when a prisoner is placed in the custody of the sending state,even in circumstances where a prisoner custody is of short duration.
in that case,the prisoner,bozeman,was serving time in a federal prison when alabama indicted him on an unrelated crime.bozeman,at.alabama lodged a detainer against him and subsequently obtained custody over him.the state then transported him approximately miles to a county jail,where he spent the night before appearing for his arraignment the next morning.he was returned to federal prison that evening and resumed serving his original sentence.
at the outset,the supreme court acknowledged,alabama does not deny a violation of article iv e as literally interpreted,for it concedes that its officials returned bozeman to his original place of imprisonment,before bozeman county court trial was had.id.at.emphasis in original.the court rejected alabama argument that spending one night in state prison constituted only a de minimus or technical violation.id.at.rather,the court reasoned,every prisoner arrival in the receiving state,whether followed by a very brief stay or a very long stay in the receiving state,triggers iv e no return requirement.id.at.emphasis in original.in other words,article iv e provision applies whenever a prisoner is provided to a receiving state pursuant to a detainer.the length of the prisoner custody by the receiving state has no bearing on the operation of the no return requirement.accordingly,the court concluded,the alabama charges should have been dismissed.
pursley attempt to compare his case to bozeman is unpersuasive because he was not returned to his original place of imprisonment under article iv e.in bozeman,the prisoner was serving time in a federal penitentiary under a federal sentence.after his short foray into state court and prison pursuant to a detainer,bozeman was returned to the same federal prison to resume serving his original federal sentence.the supreme court has held that this is a clear violation of article iv e in this case,pursley was never returned to colorado to resume serving his original state sentence.instead,his only trip back into colorado state jurisdiction was to answer a third set of state charges unrelated to his original sentence or federal charges.he never was transferred to the colorado department of corrections to begin anew his service of his original state sentence.furthermore,the excursion to the colorado state courthouse for arraignment was only by chance in colorado,the state of his original imprisonment.if any other state,such as wyoming,had asked the federal government to provide pursley for a arraignment under similar circumstances,we do not see how this would have violated the provision.
we note that our interpretation is supported by the plain language of the provision and the iad purpose.first,article iv e applies when the prisoner is returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to article v e.iad emphasis added.article v e provides that,a t the earliest practical time consonant with the purposes of this agreement,the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.id.read together,these words suggest that the prisoner must be sent back to recommence serving his original sentence to trigger the provision.under article v e,a prisoner should be returned to the sending state to resume his original sentence following the disposition of the receiving state trial.article v e,on its face,does not contemplate other reasons to send a prisoner back to the sending state.
second,the purpose of the iad provision is to minimize the uncertainties attendant with outstanding charges which interfere with a prisoner rehabilitation and treatment programs and to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges.see iad,art.i.as we have said,congress did not want prisoners to have programs of treatment and rehabilitation obstructed by numerous absences in connection with successive proceedings related to pending charges in another jurisdiction.united states wilson,cir.the mere temporary transfer of a prisoner to a different jurisdiction to answer pending charges while in the custody of a receiving state does not implicate these concerns so long as it does not impermissibly lengthen a prisoner stay in the receiving state where a transfer is of short duration and does not interrupt trial proceedings in the receiving state in violation of the iad other provisions,as is the case here,a prisoner spends no additional time away from the sending state and,thus,there can be no impact on a prisoner rehabilitative programs and treatment in the sending state.on the other hand,the expeditious resolution of untried charges in a different jurisdiction,such as the third set of colorado charges pursley faced,is fully consistent with the purposes of the iad.
for these reasons,we conclude that the iad provision is not triggered by the circumstances presented here 
trial severance 
pursley next argues the district court committed reversible error by failing to grant his motion to sever his trial from that of his,wendel wardell.he contends severance was necessary because the two defendants had planned to present antagonistic defenses and the joint trial precluded him from fully pursuing his theory of defense.
when considering a motion for severance,a trial court engages in a three step inquiry.first,it must determine whether the defenses presented are so antagonistic that they are mutually exclusive.united states peveto,cir.second,because m utually antagonistic defenses are not prejudicial per se,a defendant must further show a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.zafiro united states,d.third,if the first two factors are met,the trial court exercises its discretion and weigh s the prejudice to a particular defendant caused by joinder against the obviously important considerations of economy and expedition in judicial administration.peveto,at.where the trial court ultimately denies severance,its decision will be reversed only where the defendant has demonstrated an abuse of discretion.united states hayes,cir.
according to pursley,his theory of defense at trial was that he never prepared or assisted in the preparation of the relevant tax returns.he hoped to persuade the jury that although funds were deposited in his account and spent,he was not aware of how the money arrived,he did not have any knowledge of tax returns filed in his name,nor was he ever employed by cimmaron farms,the company to which his income was attributed on the returns.wardell defense,on the other hand,was that the tax forms were pursley had participated in their preparation,had indeed been employed by cimmaron farms,and was properly entitled to receipt of earned income credit funds.thus,while pursley merely argued no crime was committed by him,wardell maintained no crime was committed at all.
applying these factors,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sever the trial.even though pursley could establish that the pair defenses were mutually exclusive,we find no actual prejudice to pursley under the second factor.
we are satisfied that pursley and wardell defenses were sufficiently exclusive and antagonistic under the first factor defenses are mutually antagonistic if the conflict between codefendants defenses is such that the jury,in order to believe the core of one defense,must necessarily disbelieve the core of the other.united states linn,cir.in other words,defendants must show that the acceptance of one party defense would tend to preclude the acquittal of the other,or that the guilt of one defendant tends to establish the innocence of the other.peveto,at holding mutually exclusive defenses where one defendant claimed to be preparing to be an informant and invited the other defendant,a purported drug dealer,to his house to gather information,while the other defendant claimed to be innocently at the house and held against his will by the first defendant.
a jury could not simultaneously believe pursley and wardell theories of defense.pursley either worked at cimmaron farms or he did not.he either participated in the preparation and filing of tax returns or he did not.if the jury believed that pursley had no knowledge of the tax refunds and had no part in cimmaron farms,then it would necessarily have to disbelieve wardell story that he and pursley were legitimately entitled to file tax refunds based on their employment by cimmaron farms.pursley legitimate participation in the cimmaron farms enterprise was a core element of wardell defense theory.without it,wardell defense would simply collapse,casting serious doubts on wardell claim of innocence.this is simply not a case where the jury could have believed all of defendants theories and acquitted all of them.see united states linn,cir finding no mutual antagonism.accordingly,we find these defenses ar
