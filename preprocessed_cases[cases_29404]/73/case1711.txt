factual and procedural background 
factual background 
southern california edison company edison offered for sale by auction several electric power generating plants,including three plants in long beach,redondo beach,and huntington beach known as the alamitos,redondo beach,and huntington beach generating stations.the aes corporation aes was the successful bidder for the three plants as a group,offering million.the alamitos and redondo beach plants are the subjects of this case.
edison and aes executed asset sales agreements in november stating sales prices of million and million for the alamitos and redondo beach plants,respectively.the parties agreed that before the transaction closed they would allocate the sales prices to the various assets conveyed and agreed to rely on that allocation for all purposes including,without limitation,financial,accounting,and federal and state tax purposes 
the puc approved the sale of the three plants in december in decision,concluding that the auction was properly conducted and that the aggregate market value of the three plants was million.the parties then allocated the million sales price for the alamitos plant as follows for land,for machinery and equipment attached to the land,for goodwill,and the remainder for other assets.they allocated the million sales price for the redondo beach plant as follows for land,for machinery and equipment attached to the land,for goodwill,and the remainder for other assets.the parties completed the sales and recorded grant deeds in may.
edison reported to the county recorder that the documentary transfer tax due for recordation of the grant deeds was for the alamitos plant and a total of for the redondo beach plant,including payable to los angeles county and payable to city of redondo beach.edison reported that those amounts were calculated based on the full value of the properties.the amounts correspond to real property values of for the alamitos plant and for the redondo beach plant.
county counsel served notices of tax delinquency in september requesting payment of an additional for the alamitos plant and an additional for the redondo beach plant,calculated based on the full sales prices of million and million,respectively.edison and aes failed to pay the purported deficiency.
the complaint 
county sued edison,the aes corporation,aes alamitos,aes redondo beach,aes southland,and others in october seeking to recover delinquent documentary transfer taxes and to impose an equitable lien county filed a second amended complaint in april seeking a total of in delinquent documentary transfer taxes payable to the county and the cities,calculated based on the total consideration paid for the plants.
motion to bifurcate 
aes moved to bifurcate the trial asking the court to decide a preliminary legal question before conducting a trial on other issues.the question presented according to aes was how to determine the consideration or value of the interest or property conveyed,subd.a for purposes of calculating the documentary transfer tax when a sale includes real and personal property.aes argued that the consideration or value could be based on either the total consideration paid,the consideration paid for the real property pursuant to buyer and seller agreed allocation,or the fair market value of the real property.
county opposed the motion arguing that the court did not have sufficient information to decide how to determine the consideration or value of the property conveyed.county also argued that the consideration or value is the total consideration paid and that edison and aes bear the burden of proof to show otherwise.county did not argue that it was entitled to the full amount demanded in the tax deficiency notices as a matter of law because the defendants failed to pay that amount or that the court was precluded from determining the consideration or value due to the defendants nonpayment.
the court granted the bifurcation motion in may,stating that it would decide the proper basis for calculation of the documentary transfer tax before conducting a trial on the remaining issues.
ruling on how to determine the consideration or value 
the parties submitted briefs on the basis for calculation of the tax.after a hearing,the court concluded in july that the documentary transfer tax must be based on the consideration or value of the real property only,excluding personal and intangible property included in the sale and the consideration or value is the agreed price for the real property if the agreed price is determinate and is the fair market value if the agreed price is not determinate,but the buyer and seller agreed allocation of the sales price is not conclusive as to the agreed price for the real property.
stipulation 
the parties filed a stipulation in october stating that the buyer and seller agreed allocation of the sales prices are not determinate or definite for purposes of calculating the documentary transfer tax and that the total consideration paid for the plants does not properly measure the documentary transfer tax.
trial on the remaining issues and judgment 
the trial of the remaining issues commenced in october.appraisers testified on the value of the real property and power plants.the court decided during trial that the defendants bore the burden of proof on the question of the value of the real property.
the court issued an extensive tentative decision setting forth the facts,restating its prior rulings,and explaining in detail its decision on the real property value.the parties each objected to parts of the tentative decision and proposed changes.the court filed a statement of decision and later an amended statement of decision in march,concluding that the value of the real property as of the date of conveyance was million for the alamitos plant and million for the redondo beach plant and directing the parties to calculate the amounts of documentary transfer tax deficiency to include in the judgment.the court denied county request for an equitable lien.
the parties submitted proposed judgments in which they agreed on the total amount of documentary transfer tax due under the court decision.county proposed judgment also included prejudgment interest at the rate of percent from the date of conveyance.county did not file a motion for prejudgment interest,but filed only a declaration stating the purported legal basis for prejudgment interest.
the superior court entered a judgment in april awarding a total of in damages against edison and aes,including in documentary transfer taxes payable to the county,payable to city of long beach,and payable to city of redondo beach.the court denied county request for prejudgment interest.no party moved for a new trial.
related actions 
aes applied to the county assessment appeals board to reduce the assessed real property value for the alamitos and redondo beach plants.aes moved the board to stay the administrative proceedings until the superior court decided this case,arguing that the same question,the fair market value of the real property,was at issue in each proceeding and that the decision in this case would be collateral estoppel.the board concluded that the superior court decision in this action would not be binding on the board and denied the request for a stay.the appeals board then conducted evidentiary hearings and determined the value of the real property for purposes of property tax.
aes sought judicial review of the board decision by suing the county in two separate actions in december.aes moved the superior court in those actions to stay the actions pending our decision in this appeal,arguing that the same question,the fair market value of the real property,was at issue in each action and that the judgment in this action will be collateral estoppel.the superior court concluded that the judgment in this action probably will be collateral estoppel in the related actions,but denied the motion to stay on other grounds 
contentions 
county contends aes and edison must pay the full amount demanded in the notices of tax delinquency before challenging the amount,but they failed to do so,so county is entitled to judgment in the full amount demanded,and aes and edison can challenge the amount of the assessment and seek a refund only by filing a claim with the county and then seeking judicial review if the value of the real property is properly at issue in this action,the puc decision conclusively establishes the value the trial court value analysis and conclusion are flawed and county is entitled to prejudgment interest under civil code section,subdivision a,and a penalty assessment under a redondo beach ordinance.
discussion 
county can not argue for the first time on appeal that the value of the real property is not at issue in this action 
a taxpayer ordinarily must pay a tax before commencing a court action to challenge the collection of the tax.this rule,commonly known as pay first,litigate later,is well established and is based on a public policy reflected in the state constitution,several statutes,and numerous court opinions.
article xiii,section of the state constitution prohibits an action against the state to prevent or enjoin the collection of any tax,other than an action after payment of the tax to recover the tax paid the california supreme court in state bd.of equalization superior court cal d,stated that the provisions of section establish that the sole legal avenue for resolving tax disputes is a postpayment refund action.a taxpayer may not go into court and obtain adjudication of the validity of a tax which is due but not yet paid.the important public policy behind this constitutional provision is to allow revenue collection to continue during litigation so that essential public services dependent on the funds are not unnecessarily interrupted.citation.the fear that persistent interference with the collection of public revenues,for whatever reason,will destroy the effectiveness of government has been expressed in many judicial opinions.citation.citation.the prompt payment of taxes is always important to the public welfare.it may be vital to the existence of a government.the idea that every taxpayer is entitled to the delays of litigation is unreason.citation.citation.
several statutes in language similar to the prohibitory language of article xiii,section of the state constitution prohibit an action to prevent or enjoin the collection of specified taxes imposed by state or local government,property tax,sales and use taxes,franchise and income taxes.other statutes provide for an action to recover a refund after payment is made,property tax,sales and use taxes,franchise and income taxes.there is no constitutional or statutory provision that expressly prohibits an action against a local public agency to prevent or enjoin the collection of a documentary transfer tax,however.see.
some courts have held that the pay first,litigate later rule applies broadly beyond the specific constitutional and statutory provisions.flying dutchman park,city and county of san francisco th,d held that the pay first,litigate later rule applied to a local parking tax,despite the absence of express constitutional or statutory authority writers guild of america,west,city of los angeles th,d same with regard to a local business tax.other courts,however,have held that the constitutional provision prohibiting an action to prevent or enjoin tax collection cal,art.xiii,applies only to an action against the state,as stated in the provision.eisley mohan cal d,construing former cal,art.xiii,brown county of los angeles th,d documentary transfer tax see pacific gas electric state bd.of equalization cal d,fn,dictum.in a similar vein,the california supreme court in agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,held that the constitutional provision requires payment of the tax before maintaining a refund action but does not require payment of accrued interest on the tax,stating,c ourts,in interpreting statutes levying taxes,may not extend their provisions,by implication,beyond the clear import of the language used,nor enlarge upon their operation so as to embrace matters not specifically included.citation.
this is not an action commenced by a taxpayer challenging the assessment or collection of a tax,as in the foregoing cases.rather,aes and edison challenge the documentary transfer taxes as defendants in an action commenced by the taxing authorities.
the fourth district court of appeal,division one has held that the public policy supporting the pay first,litigate later rule also applies when a taxpayer defends a collection action commenced by the taxing authority,so a taxpayer defendant who has not paid the tax can not challenge the collection of the tax.riverside county community facilities dist.bainbridge th,d property tax community facilities dist.harvill th,d property tax.the second district court of appeal,division two has stated the contrary,albeit in dicta.writers guild of america,west,city of los angeles,supra,th at,d local business tax.
we need not decide whether the pay first,litigate later rule applies to documentary transfer taxes or whether the rule applies when a taxpayer defends an action to collect documentary transfer taxes,because there are two principal reasons not to apply the rule here.first,county did not invoke the rule in the trial court.county never argued based on the rule that it was entitled to judgment in the amount demanded in the tax deficiency notices or the amount alleged in the complaint as a matter of law and that the trial court should not determine the value of the real property as a question of fact rather,county stipulated that the total consideration paid is not the proper basis for the tax commenced its trial brief,the issue before the court is to judicially review the determination of the value of the land,tenements and realty pertaining to the alamitos and redondo beach power generating stations as of may,as applied for purposes of the documentary transfer tax and presented evidence on the value of the real property as of the date of conveyance.
the doctrine of waiver ordinarily prevents a party from arguing for the first time on appeal questions that were not presented to the trial court.doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,fn,in re riva d.the doctrine of invited error prevents a party from asserting an alleged error as grounds for reversal when the party through its own conduct induced the commission of the error.norgart upjohn cal th,d,gee american realty construction,th,d.related to these doctrines is the doctrine of theory of trial where the parties try the case on the assumption that a cause of action is stated,that certain issues are raised by the pleadings,that a particular issue is controlling,or that other steps affecting the course of the trial are correct,neither party can change this theory for purposes of review on appeal.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.based on these doctrines,we conclude that after stipulating that the total consideration paid is not the proper basis for the tax,requesting a judicial determination of the value of the real property,and actively
