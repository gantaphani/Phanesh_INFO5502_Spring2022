yvonne garth was convicted of two counts of conspiring to defraud the united states with respect to claims against the government in violation of and six counts of aiding and abetting the making of false claims against the government in violation of and.the first conspiracy count alleged that,while working as a tax preparer,she conspired with tax filers by providing false tax returns claiming an undeserved refund.the second conspiracy count alleged that she provided false documents to filers so that they could have a return prepared by a legitimate tax preparer for the and tax years claiming refunds they were not owed.she brings this appeal raising three principal arguments the government varied from the indictment by proving multiple conspiracies rather than the two single conspiracies charged the district court violated her sixth amendment right to trial by jury and her fifth amendment right to due process by making sentencing findings using the preponderance of the evidence standard and the district court violated her sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against her when it admitted the tax returns of tax filers to prove that they filed false returns and conspired with her to do so.she also raises several evidentiary challenges based on the federal rules of evidence.we affirm.
we state the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states hudspeth,cir.yvonne garth then yvonne caldwell worked at a jackson hewitt tax services franchise,under the supervision of franchise holder paul hahn,during the tax season,which ran through the early months of.hahn franchises catered to persons who required assistance filing simple,inexpensive tax returns.he operated several storefronts in the twin cities area,some of which were permanent stores and others of which were seasonal locations that operated only during tax season.all of the returns at jackson hewitt were prepared using computer software.hahn explained that the software did a lot of the work necessary to complete a return,making extensive training and vetting of preparers unnecessary.the preparer would answer a series of questions asked by the software and based on the responses,the software would request specific data about the taxpayer.in order to reduce errors,the software would require important information to be typed twice,including the taxpayer social security number,wage information,and employer tax identification number.after the return was complete,several copies were printed,and the taxpayer was required to review and sign the return.the returns were filed with the irs electronically,but jackson hewitt kept other documents relating to the filed return in the records department,and in most instances those documents were signed by the tax filer.to prevent fraud,preparers were also required to photocopy or view each taxpayer social security card and the card of each dependent he intended to claim.
hahn operated a seasonal store at lake street and first avenue the east lake street store out of the lobby of a check cashing business in a less desirable area of town.a return prepared at the east lake street store could be identified by a unique number that was assigned to each tax return by the tax preparation software.on an electronically filed return,the computer printed the name of the preparer at the bottom of a return,which it recognized because each preparer had to to the software with a unique identifier.when an east lake street store customer received a refund check for his tax return through jackson hewitt,the check was stored in the secured area of the adjacent check cashing store and was handed to the customer by employees of that business,not employees of jackson hewitt.
according to hahn,he hired garth because she claimed prior experience completing tax returns.upon her hiring,garth asked to work in the east lake street store,and she was the only tax preparer who was permanently placed there.while garth worked at jackson hewitt,three different receptionists worked with her garth daughter,latrina caldwell then briefly ranika evans and finally starsha wyatt,whom garth recommended for the job.none were tax preparers,and according to sally hahn,none were given the computer password to prepare returns under garth name.all but evans were referred to at trial as.garth ended her employment with jackson hewitt sometime between march,and march,after preparing paid returns.according to hahn,she was never replaced,and the east lake street store was closed.
the indictment against garth alleges two separate,but similar conspiracies.the first conspiracy revolved around her employment as a tax preparer at the east lake street store and covered the term of that employment during the tax season.the government presented over ten witnesses to prove conclusively that each witness filed false tax returns,claiming credits and tax refunds for amounts which they were not owed by the government.when confronted at trial,these tax filers admitted that their tax returns reported wages,expenses,charitable contributions,and other credits which they did not make nor earn.most witnesses,however,claimed ignorance of the fraud,testifying that they did not actually read the return before signing it and had no knowledge that their return was inaccurate.in most instances,there was evidence suggesting that the tax filers knew their returns were false because they had signed statements under penalties of perjury that they read and agreed the return was accurate to their knowledge.
the government also proved with sufficient evidence that garth was the tax preparer for each return.all but one of the witnesses admitted that their return was prepared at the east lake street store where garth worked,and each tax return was filed listing garth as the preparer.however,only three witnesses,lisa evans,hope jackson,and nina horne,affirmatively identified garth as the preparer of their false tax return.most of the witnesses were never asked if they remembered who prepared their return.to prove that garth was responsible for each return,the government relied largely upon the fact that her name was listed as preparer on the electronically filed returns,meaning that they were prepared under her computer password at the east lake street store,and the fact that garth name was signed to the paperwork stored by jackson hewitt for most of the returns.
there was also an issue at trial as to whether the returns were prepared mistakenly or intentionally,but the evidence at trial supported the inference that garth acted purposefully.paul hahn testified that the computer software prevented typographical errors.moreover,evans testified that garth demanded a share of evans refund when she returned to the store to retrieve it.when evans refused,she heard garth or another person sitting next to garth say that t hey are from chicago and they break legs.although he did not affirmatively identify garth,marshal wylie testified that his tax preparer asked him for more money or a gift,which he refused,when he returned to the east lake street store to pick up his refund.lisa norris was in jail when her false return was filed and when her refund checks were cashed.her federal refund check was endorsed to latrina caldwell,garth daughter,and the state check was endorsed to starsha wyatt,the receptionist at the east lake street store,whom garth had recommended for employment.kevin garth,the defendant nephew by marriage,filed a tax return,prepared by garth,falsely claiming wages from footlocker.he claimed to have gotten the false from someone off the street and given it to garth to prepare his returns,but no such was found in jackson hewitt files.in addition to the witness testimony,the court admitted into evidence the returns and tax documents of other tax filers who allegedly participated in the conspiracy with garth.
the second conspiracy alleged in the indictment concerned an agreement among several individuals who used false forms that allegedly came from garth to claim fraudulent refunds from the government.in connection with this conspiracy,garth was indicted of aiding and abetting seven individual tax filers in making false claims.the government introduced evidence showing that garth,in exchange for a fee or a percentage of the refund,would provide a false in the taxpayer name,using a legitimate,or nearly legitimate,employer identification number and name.often,she would act through an intermediary.
for example,natasha davis testified that she met garth through her child father,richard porter.davis gave garth her name and address,and garth provided her with a claiming false wages earned and taxes paid from foot locker,a company davis admitted she did not work for in.garth and davis had an agreement that davis would pay garth when she received her tax refund.davis used the to file a false return and ultimately received a refund on a visa check card.according to davis,garth showed up at davis house with her son to collect her share shortly after learning that davis had received the refund.garth,her son,her daughter latrina,and davis all waited at davis house while porter went to get cash from the check card.porter returned and garth was paid.davis also listed several other individuals she knew who also transacted similarly with garth jessica gregory,lakisha hammond,tamika jones,shantey williams,antonne walker,etwon skittles glover,and the aforementioned porter.
kimberly pearson was convicted of filing a false tax return using a she obtained through antonne walker.according to her testimony,she paid walker to give to the person who had created the.she later watched walker give the money to garth in front of her house.despite pearson affirmative identification of garth,the jury acquitted garth of aiding and abetting pearson.walker testified that he was convicted of filing a false return,using a claiming wages earned from an employer,city of minneapolis,for whom he never worked.he claimed to have gotten the from a woman named either kiesha or killa on lake street.he denied knowing garth or getting the from her.agent jeremy martin testified,however,that walker told him in prior interviews that he got both his own and pearson from garth.
chentia hodroff used a false for the tax year from the city of minneapolis,an employer for whom she never worked.she claimed to have gotten the from ray robinson.nicole octavia williams testified that her forged footlocker came from a man named ray,whom she met in a bar.she only knew that ray got the from a female.shantey williams used a false,which she got through a man nicknamed skittles,from the city of minneapolis,where she never worked,she said skittles told her that a woman named von was the source of the false document.skittles involvement in the criminal activity was corroborated by natasha davis.jerome roberson also used a forged city of minneapolis,which he purchased through a female who claimed to have gotten it through a relative named yvonne.
termone realford used a forged from foot locker to file his tax return and claim a refund for the tax year.after first denying it,he finally admitted that he previously told investigators that a donte offered to get a blank for realford from his mother,a woman named yvonne.he then claimed he had been lying and that the forged had appeared in his mailbox one day.other forms for tax filers were also introduced and shown to be false.several could be connected to garth by familial relationships.one belonged to her son,donte caldwell,and another was used by her daughter,latrina caldwell.these and other facts formed the basis of the government proof at trial.
the district court found that garth sentencing guidelines base offense level was six and her criminal history category was ii.she was assessed a increase based on the amount of the attempted false claims,which the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence to be,a increase because she was a tax preparer,and a increase for organizing or leading a criminal activity that involved five or more participants.her total offense level was calculated at,and her advisory sentencing range was months.the district court sentenced garth to months.she argues that the district court findings that she was responsible for in attempted false claims and that she was a leader or organizer of more than five people violated her sixth amendment right to a trial by jury and her fifth amendment due process right to have facts found beyond a reasonable doubt.she also argues that the district court erred by considering summary tax tables at sentencing.
we review de novo garth claim that the sentencing procedure violated her due process and sixth amendment rights.see united states martinez,cir.garth argument can be boiled down into two separate issues for our consideration.first,she claims a right to have tax loss amounts considered by the jury and relies upon cunningham california,d.we distinguished the mandatory state sentencing statute in cunningham from the advisory sentencing guidelines in united states marston,cir.as long as the district court applies the guidelines in an advisory fashion,the sixth amendment right to a jury trial is not infringed when the district court finds facts in support of the sentence imposed.id.
second,garth contends that the district court violated her due process rights by failing to apply a heightened evidentiary standard of proof to the amount of false claims and to the finding that she was an organizer or leader of five or more people.it is that generally a district court may rely on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence to aid it at sentencing.see,united states bradford,cir,cert.denied,d.we have,however,said that there could be circumstances where due process would require those facts that have an extremely disproportionate effect on a defendant sentence to be found by a heightened standard,although we have never required such a standard to be applied.united states calva,cir bradford,at united states townley,cir t he preponderance standard the court approved for garden variety sentencing determinations may fail to comport with due process where,as here,a sentencing enhancement factor becomes a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.quoting mcmillan pennsylvania,d see also united states galloway,cir en banc it is clear that the constitution limits a legislature ability to designate some factors as elements of the crime and others as sentencing enhancers.we have said that in cases where the effect of a sentencing factor on the ultimate sentence may have been extreme,the standard that due process requires would be clear and convincing evidence united states matthews,cir concluding,without deciding whether a heightened standard of proof applies,that the district court use of the clear and convincing evidence standard was sufficient.
garth argues that her sentencing range should have been months based on the facts of conviction and her criminal history,which is the sentence she received.the sentencing range was increased as a result of the district court findings,which she argues had a disproportionate effect on her sentence.but those findings were all based on the conspiracies for which garth was tried and convicted.due process does not require a heightened standard of proof of facts that enhance a sentence when they relate to a conspiracy for which the defendant was charged.united states behler,cir united states thompson,cir united states pugh,cir accord united states garro,cir holding that heightened evidentiary standard of proof is not required where the sentencing enhancement is based entirely on the extent of the conspiracy to which the defendant pled guilty.the district court findings in this amount of false claims made and the number of stem from the underlying conspiracy convictions.consequently,due process does not require a heightened standard of proof.
next,we consider whether the findings by the district court were supported by a preponderance of the evidence.we review a district court findings of fact at sentencing for clear error,giving due deference to the court opportunity to observe witnesses credibility united states russell,cir.the district court did not clearly err by concluding that garth was responsible for in false claims filed in.in each instance,the return was filed using her password and computer at the east lake street jackson hewitt,and three filers affirmatively identified garth as the preparer of their return.each return was manipulated in order to claim excess refunds.the manipulation is obvious when the tax return is compared to the filer actual wage and tax amounts withheld,which were proven by introduction of the filers accurate form from jackson hewitt files or from the irs.evans testified that garth demanded a share of her refund when she returned to the store to retrieve it,and that garth threatened her when she refused.
with regard to the tax year,the district court did not clearly err by concluding that garth contributed to in false claims against the federal government.she prepared david thomas return claiming,even though he died in and,consequently,earned no income in.garth culpability for thomas return was obvious in light of the fact that she was not only the preparer,but that his return and garth return both listed an identical dependent,a person named yvonne coleman.virginia taylor testified against garth and admitted that she falsely claimed a refund of for based on an agreement with garth to split that amount with her.cynthia thomas,who died prior to trial,made in false claims against the government in,based on a false supplied by garth and her daughter latrina caldwell.this finding was supported by the introduction of a taped interview between thomas and investigators that was admitted at sentencing.thomas son dashawn also made a false claim using a false in and can be connected to garth through his mother and by the fact that his false was from comtec,garth and caldwell employer.comtec connects latrina caldwell false claim amount of to garth,as does the relationship between the two women.anita turner filed a false claim amount of using a false from industrial staffing.she can be connected to garth by the fact that garth son,donte caldwell,referred to her as his aunt,she lived near filer terome realford brother carl sanders,and she filed one of the false footlocker for,which have been linked to garth by their distinct similarity to one another.finally,erick west filed a false claim in for using a false from the minnesota department of economic security,where west did not work.west can be connected to garth by the fact that garth prepared west false tax return,which greatly exaggerated west wages from.
many of the false used to file tax returns were alike and,when grouped together,evidence a common plan or scheme.for instance,nine distinct falsely reported the same wages,from employer footlocker with the same incorrect employer identification number.one of the footlocker was connected to garth by the trial testimony of natasha davis that she received the from garth.another of the footlocker is connected to garth by the trial testimony of agent jeremy martin,who testified that terome realford told investigators that he got his false footlocker from garth.the remaining seven can be connected to garth by their similarity to the other two.
similarly,a group of eight forged city of minneapolis also falsely reported in wages.they can be connected to garth both by their similarity to the footlocker and by testimony.agent jeremy martin testified that antonne walker told him that garth supplied him with one of the city.carl sanders,who used one of the same,can be connected to garth by the fact that he is terome realford brother.shantey williams used one of the city and testified that she received the from a woman called von.
eleven more false claims were made using forged city of minneapolis,although they,for the most part,had different wage amounts.some can be connected to garth by testimony.camille echols used one of these in the amount of and shantey williams,who identified garth,testified that she knew echols was involved in the scheme too.jelahn prentiss was not mentioned at trial,but she used a false city with the same amount as echols.kimberly pearson used a false city and testified that it came from yvonne.natasha davis,who used a false footlocker,testified that jessica gregory,who filed a false claim using a city,was also involved in the illegal scheme.cynthia thomas used a false city that she claimed in statements to investigators that she got from garth.the remaining city can be connected to garth by the fact that they purported to be from the city of minneapolis,like so many other in this case,and they were forged.
neither was it clear error for the district court to conclude that garth was responsible for donte caldwell false claim in the amount of because caldwell was garth son,and there was testimony that he helped his mother collect on debts from other tax files.moreover,there was testimony that connected terome realford,another filer,to caldwell.caldwell also listed terome realford son as a dependent on caldwell federal return and listed garth as providing childcare services to that child.in total,was attributed to garth for the tax year based on caldwell false,the false city of minneapolis,and the false footlocker.when this amount is added to the false claims made in and,then garth total responsibility was.the district court did not clearly err in concluding that this amount was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
finally,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it found that garth was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.ussg.
when evaluating a defendant role in the offense,the court considers several factors,including the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.
united states blumberg,cir internal emphasis omitted quoting ussg.the criminal activity whether we refer to it as a large conspiracy or several small conspiracies operating around garth was extensive in this case,involving over sixty people.garth was the linchpin of the conspiracy,providing the means by which every claim was filed against the government.there was evidence that she recruited others into the scheme and that she took as much as half of the false claim amount secured by each tax filer.consequently,the district court properly concluded she was a leader and the activity involved more than five participants.
garth also seems to argue that the government proof of tax loss failed because it used tax tables summarizing the amount of tax loss by year and by tax filer.the case she cites to support her argument,united states wainright,cir,is one where the allegedly improper summary charts were used at trial.id.at.her complaint is with regard to sentencing,where the only rule of evidence is that the information have sufficient indicia of reliability to supports its probable accuracy.united states fleck,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.garth claims that the charts contain assumptions and conclusions not based on witness testimony.the charts are based partly on witness testimony,but they were mostly compiled from the tax documents admitted at trial and sentencing.garth points out no discrepancies among the summary charts and the tax documents or the witness testimony.absent some allegation that the summaries misstated the evidence on which they were based,the district court committed no error by admitting them.
garth argues that there was a variance between the proof at trial and the allegations in the indictment.she,not unreasonably,interprets the indictment to aver the existence of two single,overarching conspiracies the conspiracy,wherein,as a tax preparer,she provided false tax returns to in order that they might file false claims against the government,and the conspiracy,wherein she provided false forms to for the same purpose.she argues,however,that there was insufficient proof connecting her alleged to one another.in other words,she avers that even if
