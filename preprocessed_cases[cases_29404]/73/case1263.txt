administrative proceeding 
the irs applied the restitution payments totaling to fully satisfy creel tax liability for and part of his tax liability for.claiming that creel owed additional taxes,penalties,and interest for and,in june,the irs assigned the account to the collection division.the revenue officer and creel representative discussed whether creel could enter into an offer in compromise or a deferred payment schedule.these discussions ended when the parties disagreed as to the amount creel could afford to pay.
on february,the commissioner sent creel a notice of intent to levy showing unpaid amounts totaling and a notice of a right to a cdp hearing with respect to these unpaid amounts 
creel requested a cdp hearing.creel counsel met with judy kelly,the appeals officer assigned to the case,to discuss the proposed levy.creel counsel argued that creel alleged civil tax liabilities for the years had been satisfied by virtue of his payment of.kelly disagreed,determining that the restitution order required that creel pay plus any applicable penalties and interest.emphasis added.accordingly,kelly sustained the commissioner proposal to collect the unpaid applicable penalties and interest.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the tax court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.atlanta athletic club commissioner,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous if the record lacks substantial evidence to support it,so that our review of the entire evidence leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.atlanta athletic club,at citations and quotation marks omitted.
the commissioner concedes that creel criminal restitution obligation was satisfied,and thus,his criminal tax liabilities were discharged.the commissioner contends,however,that the satisfaction of creel criminal restitution obligation has no bearing on the commissioner ability to pursue creel for additional civil tax liabilities.
in the abstract,the commissioner is correct.as a general rule,the government can recover criminal penalties from an individual in a criminal prosecution and can recover additional civil penalties in a civil proceeding.see generally united states barnette,cir hickman commissioner of internal revenue,cir.moreover,an order to pay restitution under is a criminal penalty rather than a civil penalty.united states johnson,cir.indeed,the restitution statute used in the instant case expressly contemplates that a civil claim may be brought subsequent to a criminal conviction by providing for an offset for the amount of restitution paid in the criminal case against any damages recovered in the civil proceeding.e.
the key problem with the commissioner position is that it fails to take into account the unique facts and the nuances of the instant case,most notably the language of the restitution judgment and the actions of the attorney.as a condition of probation,the district court ordered creel to pay restitution to the irs.as stated in the psi,the plea agreement mandated a s a condition of probation,the court shall impose a condition requiring restitution in the amount of to the internal revenue service,in addition to any interest and penalties which may be imposed by the internal revenue service.emphasis added.in turn,the judgment in the criminal case set the amount of restitution at plus any applicable penalties and interest.emphasis added.thus,as the tax court found,the restitution amount specifically included the civil penalties that the commissioner now seeks to recover 
creel made his monthly restitution payments totaling.as a condition of probation,creel still owed the applicable penalties and interest.rather than pursue these additional civil penalties,the attorney undertook two key actions.first,the attorney issued a satisfaction of judgment which stated that t he assessment,fine,restitution imposed by the court in the above styled case having been paid or otherwise settled emphasis added.second,the attorney signed a cancellation and release of lien which stated that t he debt secured having been paid in full,said lien is hereby fully released,satisfied,discharged,and cancelled.emphasis added.
creel argues that because the government elected to include his civil tax liabilities as part of the restitution order,when the attorney discharged the restitution obligation,creel civil tax liabilities were also extinguished.we agree.creel testified in
