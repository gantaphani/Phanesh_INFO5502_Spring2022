plaintiff silveira seeks refunds of possessory interest taxes paid in several years to defendant county of alameda on his tenancy with the city of oakland.he contests the anticipated terms of possession used to calculate the value of his possessory interest,arguing that,under the decision in american airlines,county of los angeles d.american airlines and for other reasons,he could not lawfully be taxed based on a term of possession longer than one month.we disagree with plaintiff reading of american airlines and with his other arguments,and accordingly affirm the judgment against him.
factual background 
plaintiff has been in possession of the avenue marina in oakland since.he had a license and concession agreement with the port of oakland that ended on september.he has occupied the property since then under a holdover provision in the agreement stating if licensee with the port consent holds over the use of said premises after the term of this agreement has terminated in any manner,such holding over shall be deemed merely a holding from month to month and at a monthly rental to be fixed from time to time by the port,payable monthly in advance,but otherwise on the same terms and conditions as herein provided.
plaintiff sought reassessments and refunds from the alameda county assessment appeals board aab for the,and tax years on the ground that improper market values had been placed on his possessory interest in the marina for those years those values were originally set at for,for,and for,based on anticipated terms of possession by the time of the aab hearing on plaintiff appeals,the county assessor was recommending reduced market values for the possessory interest for,for,and for,based on anticipated terms of possession of five,five,and three years,respectively.plaintiff argued for a market value of for each of the three years based on a term of possession.
the aab determined that the assessor recommended values were the fair market values of the possessory interests for the years at issue,whereupon plaintiff filed this suit for refunds.the court granted defendant motion for summary judgment,and plaintiff has appealed from the ensuing judgment.
ii.discussion 
legal background 
as stated in city of san jose carlson th,d because the facilities at issue are owned by the city,they are not subject to real property taxes.cal,art.xiii.private uses of such property may be taxed,however,if those uses constitute possessory interests.cal,art.xiii.as the supreme court has explained,when the city leases its land it does not merely use it.it creates valuable possessory interests,and there is no reason why the owners of such interests should not pay taxes on them just as lessees of private property do through increased rents.their use is not public,but private,and as such should carry its share of the tax burden.texas county of los angeles cal d.thus,taxation of possessory interests is rooted in the belief that the holder of a valuable use of public property that is tax exempt should contribute taxes to the public entity which makes its possession possible and provides a certain amount of exclusivity.freeman county of fresno d.see also people shearer cal,since possessory interests are a species of property the user should contribute its proper share of the taxes necessary to sustain the government which recognizes and protects it stadium concessions,city of los angeles d.purpose is to protect public domain from private profit making without tax liability.city of san jose carlson,supra,th at,d.
pursuant to the directive of the legislature,the state board of equalization sbe has adopted comprehensive rules relating to the valuation of all types of possessory interests.fn.omitted.ehrman flavin,taxing cal.property supp,see,enumerating sbe powers.the rules in question were amended and consolidated in july and are presently set forth in california code of regulations,title,section.the record herein includes a portion of the sbe final statement of reasons for the change,which explained that 
a taxable possessory interest is a privately held property interest in publicly owned real property that meets certain statutory criteria set forth in section of the revenue and taxation code.most taxable possessory interests are created by permits and leases granting possessory rights in government land to private parties.since a taxable possessory interest is by definition a property interest of limited duration,an assessor valuing a taxable possessory interest must determine a term of possession.the term of possession is a significant variable in possessory interest valuation,and the assessor reviews it on each lien,or valuation,date.the term of possession is particularly important when the assessor uses the direct income method,which is the most widely used possessory interest valuation method.under this method,the value of the taxable possessory interest is estimated by discounting the annual economic rent attributable to the taxable possessory interest over a specified term of possession.since the term of possession determines the number of annual income payments that will be discounted,it significantly affects the assessed value.
the rule applicable to the assessments in this case former,tit,hereafter rule provided a when a written instrument creating a possessory interest specifies a period of occupancy which is to exist,the stated period shall be taken as the term of possession for purposes of valuation except as provided in this section.an option period shall be considered part of the stated period if it is reasonable to conclude that the option will be exercised.b should a period thus determined be in conflict with the reasonably anticipated term of possession by the possessor and any successor to or assignee of the property interest,the reasonably anticipated term of possession,whether shorter or longer,shall be used instead of the stated period.in determining the reasonably anticipated term of possession,the assessor shall be guided by the intent of the public owner and the possessor,as indicated by such evidence as sale prices of the subject or similar possessory interests,the history of the property use,the policy of the public agency administering the lands,and the actions of the possessor.no reduction or increase of the specified period shall be based on the life expectancy of the possessor if it is reasonably anticipated that possession will continue under his successors or assigns.c when there is no stated term of possession,the term shall be determined in accordance with subsection b.
terms of possession 
plaintiff argues that his tax liability could not lawfully be based on terms of possession longer than one month.the trial court determination to the contrary is subject to our de novo review.resource partners county of lake th,d.
plaintiff main argument is that the terms of possession applied here are prohibited by the decision in american airlines,supra,d.the plaintiffs in that case were airlines that leased passenger terminals at los angeles international airport.the leases were for years,with no option to renew.in the tax years in question,the leases had a remaining term of and years,but were assessed under rule based on a and reasonably anticipated term of possession.the airlines sued for refunds on the ground that the anticipated terms of possession should have been limited to the remaining terms of their leases.the airlines prevailed at trial and on appeal.american airlines,supra,at.
the court noted that r ule unquestionably sanctions the assessment of taxes based upon the reasonably anticipated term of possession of a possessory interest where the creating lease itself limits possession to a shorter term,and thus that the validity of the rule as applied to these plaintiffs rather than its construction was at issue.american airlines,supra,d at.the court held that the airlines could not be taxed on something they do not have,namely possessory interests extending beyond the terms of their leases.american airlines,supra,at.i n this case the airlines have no possessory interests in the leased premises following expiration of the terms of the leases,that is,no possession,claim or right thereto,as required by revenue and taxation code section.nor does it appear,however one describes the airlines relation to the leased property at the end of their leases,as hope or expectation of future use,that is capable of private ownership as property must be.accordingly,insofar as rule permits the challenged method of assessment here,we declare the same to be invalid.american airlines,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the american airlines appellants suggest ed that in reality the airlines ha d de facto options to renew the leases,but the record did not support that contention t he airlines insist that there are no understandings or agreements providing for renewal,and appellants,who are in the best position to refute this assertion,have not tried to do so.american airlines,supra,d at,fn.omitted.contrary to the appellants claim,the airport real estate manager testified that there were no understandings,agreements,negotiations or discussions between any of the airlines and lax relating to extension of the leases and that the department of airports had not at the time formed any intention as to whether or not the leases would be renewed.id.at,fn.the anticipated term of possession beyond the stated term of the leases was,therefore,unsupported it seems that appellants are simply attempting to appeal to some expectation that,airlines being airlines and needing the use of an airport,and airports being airports and having their patronage now,of necessity the two will get together somehow.of course,this unsupported expectation fails to take into account the many changes which will occur in the airline industry in general,and at lax in particular during the next decade and a half.id.at.
the court distinguished cases involving an option to renew american airlines,supra,d at,and those involving a defeasible interest,leases terminable by the lessor either at will or upon the happening of some contingency id.at.see,de luz homes,county of san diego,supra,cal d at,directing that possessory interest be valued based on remaining terms of leases,notwithstanding the government right to terminate the leases after years,where the terms of the leases and the statute under which they were drawn clearly contemplate that the leases will exist for their full terms kaiser reid cal d,lessee time of possession was reasonably estimated to be one year although lease was subject to earlier termination upon certain conditions.
the court also distinguished situations where the anticipated term of possession is based on an understanding between the parties or an expectation of substance of course,if two parties do reach an understanding as to renewal,the option cases would seem to govern.and if the expectation of the parties is based on statute or contract or indeed has any real substance at all,something in the nature of a defeasible interest would seem to arise and the termination cases would be relevant.but again,there is no indication here that the airlines have anything more than their leases and,perhaps,the hope that renewal of the leases will be possible and that conditions will remain such as to make renewal desirable.american airlines,supra,d at,fn.omitted.while the evidence might have supported a finding that the airlines intended to renew the leases,they ha d no claim or right to the leased property after expiration of the stated term.id.at,fn.
plaintiff reads american airlines to preclude application of an anticipated term of possession longer than the term specified in a lease,and submits that,as of any lien date on which his taxes are assessed,his lease is for a term of only one month.he reasons that a tenancy extends month after month until notice to terminate is given,e ach extension is a taxable change in ownership that defendant can separately assess,and t hus,for any given year,he would ultimately pay property taxes on separate leases.he asks us to order that his taxes be recalculated based on the interest he actually possesses,and to invalidate rule and its modern the extent that they direct an assessor to impute a possessory period at odds with the written lease.
we do not agree with plaintiff characterization of his lease as a series of tenancies that are extended at monthly intervals.a tenancy is not generally viewed as a tenancy for a fixed term that is periodically extended,but rather as a tenancy having no fixed term that continues indefinitely until terminated.see miller desatnik management bullock,d supp,tenancy has no fixed term people ex rel.of transportation lucero d.tenant is entitled to continued occupancy until expiration of notice witkin,summary of cal.law ed.real property,periodic tenancies are a form of tenancy at will a tenancy at will has no fixed term thompson on real property ed b,periodic tenancy continues indefinitely until terminated by proper notice.thus,tenancies are properly treated for possessory interest tax purposes as having no stated term of possession as now expressly provided in rule,subdivision d.
since plaintiff lease is not for a stated term,american airlines would not assist him even if,as he argues,that case limits the taxable term of possession to the stated term of a lease.as we have said,american airlines itself distinguished cases like the one here involving leases terminable at will,where it is possible to valuate a defeasible interest.american airlines,supra,d at.the termination cases,to use american airlines terminology,show that a term of possession can include time when the right to possession can be terminated,de luz homes,county of san diego,supra,cal d at,terms of possession were remaining terms of leases,despite lessor ability to terminate them before they expired.where termination is possible,the taxpayer will have what plaintiff calls only the potential for additional possession,but he is incorrect to maintain that this mere potentiality can not be taxed.it is settled that the possibility of termination merely affects the value of the possessory interest,not its taxability.city of san jose carlson,supra,th at,d board of supervisors archer d.mccaslin decamp d.
american airlines does not stand for the proposition that the taxable term of possession can never exceed the stated term of a lease.there were simply no facts in american airlines on which to find that the leases in that case would be extended beyond their stated terms.since the lessor had not decided whether the leases would be renewed,and the parties had never discussed and had no understandings on the matter american airlines,supra,d at,fn,expectation of an extension was entirely unsupported id.at.and lacked any real substance at all id.at.none of these observations would have been relevant if,as plaintiff contends,the stated terms of the leases were by themselves controlling.under american airlines,the question is whether there is support of real substance for the term of possession used.
former rule identified several areas where such support could be found sale prices of the subject or similar possessory interests,the history of the property use,the policy of the public agency administering the lands,and the actions of the possessor we do not agree with plaintiff that american airlines disapproved rule insofar as the rule permitted an anticipated term of possession to exceed a lease stated term the court addressed only the validity of the rule as applied to these plaintiffs american airlines,supra,d at,and found the rule invalid only insofar as it could be read to allow an anticipated term of possession to be based on an unsupported expectation american airlines,supra,at.
plaintiff maintains,again based on american airlines,that the anticipated terms of possession used here violate revenue and taxation code sections and hereafter sections.as we have noted supra,fn,section defines a taxable possessory interest to mean among other things p ossession of,claim to,or right to the possession of land or improvements american airlines described the tenants interest in continued possession after the stated terms of their leases as a hope or intention,rather than a claim or right american airlines,supra,d at,fn,and concluded that this interest did not satisfy the above quoted criteria of section american airlines,supra,at.plaintiff argues that,as a tenant,he,too,has no taxable right to continued possession beyond one month as required by section and american airlines.
however,plaintiff has the same right to continued possession as any tenant whose interest is subject to termination or renewal,and the cases,again,are clear that any instability of rights affect s only the value of the interest,not its taxability.city of san jose carlson,supra,th at,d.section refers to actual possession as well as the right to possess,and t he possession itself of public lands and the improvements thereon is a valuable property interest and is assessable.mccaslin decamp,supra,d at.here,plaintiff possessed the marina on the lien dates when the value of his possessory interest was determined and had been in possession of the property for many years.plaintiff,therefore,had a durable possessory interest in the marina even though his lease could be terminated mccaslin,supra,at.see also board of supervisors archer,supra,d at.the only question was how long his possession was reasonabl y certain to continue,subd.a.under section as interpreted in american airlines,this period can be determined based on expectations of substance,as well as on legal rights.american airlines,supra,d at.
in american airlines,the tenants hope or expectation of future use after the stated terms of their leases was not capable of private ownership,and hence did not even qualify under section as property for tax purposes.american airlines,supra,d at.plaintiff submits that the same is true here of any hope or expectation he might have of possession of longer than one month under his lease.however,the tenant pretermination entitlement to continued occupancy under a lease is a recognized property interest.people ex rel.of transportation lucero,supra,d at.moreover,plaintiff is in a very different position than the tenants in american airlines.while it was entirely speculative what would become of the american airlines tenancies after the leases expired in the distant future,plaintiff had a long history of possession under his arrangement.here,value could be ascribed to the expectation of continued possession,whereas in american airlines it could not.see board of supervisors archer,supra,d at.t o say that the right to pasture cattle on government land,even though that right is revocable at the government will and may be required to be exercised with other cattle owners,has no cash value is unbelievable.
plaintiff argues that it was unfair for defendant to tax him as if he had a lease while refusing to provide him with one.however,as plaintiff concedes,defendant is required to tax his possessory interest based on its fair market value.see fn,supra.given plaintiff history of possession,a purchaser of his tenancy would likely anticipate that the tenancy would continue for more than one month,and would likely pay more for it than for a tenancy.therefore,it would be inconsistent with the fair market value standard to adopt the term of possession plaintiff advocates.plaintiff argues that application of anticipated terms of possession such as the one here will lead to absurd results,where more value could be placed on tenancies than tenancies with longer stated terms.but the valuation in any particular case will depend on the circumstances outlined formerly in rule and currently in rule,subdivision d.for example,considering the history of the parties relationship,a longer term of possession might be reasonably anticipated under a tenancy that had existed for many years than under a tenancy that had never been renewed.we agree with plaintiff that the stated term can not be ignored,but it will not necessarily be the controlling factor.see rule,subd.d stated term is not the reasonably anticipated term if there is clear and convincing evidence of a different understanding.plaintiff observes that different anticipated terms of possession have been applied to his lease at different times,and suggests that any term of possession that is used in his case,other than one month,will be essentially arbitrary.we would grant that appraisal is not an exact science,but a reasonable finding based on relevant considerations and credible evidence is not arbitrary,and whether any particular determination can be sustained is solely a matter of substantial evidence see resource partners county of lake,supra,th at,d where application of valuation method is challenged,review in trial and appellate court is only for substantial evidence.
substantial evidence 
plaintiff maintains that substantial evidence for the assessments was lacking.when the property was assessed for the and tax years,plaintiff had been a holdover tenant at the marina for over seven and years,respectively.the history of the property use rule,subd.b and of the parties relationship rule,subd.d d thus strongly supported the terms of possession used for those tax years.according to the august,reports of defendant assessor for the aab appeals on the and taxes,neither plaintiff nor the city of oakland had any present plan to terminate the lease.thus,the terms of possession were also supported by the policies of the public owner rule,subd.b rule,subd.d b and the practices of the private possessor rule,subd.b rule,subd.d c.accordingly,the and assessments were based on substantial evidence.
virtually all of plaintiff submission to the aab consisted of legal arguments,which we have previously addressed,based on the american airlines decision.on the facts,plaintiff argued for a shorter term of possession in view of the oakland estuary plan for development of the property and its surroundings.plaintiff lodged the assessor november report for plaintiff earlier appeal of taxes,which explained the nature of the estuary plan and its affect on the term of possession as follows 
the port of oakland and the city of oakland published a draft of the estuary plan in february,as of there was no plan available.katrina koh of the community and economic development agency of the city of oakland says,the oakland estuary plan is a vision document only,and is long term in nature because of cost.the oakland estuary plan could also involve public bond measures.there will be a policy plan out in november,included in the policy plan is specific reference to the subject property.pictures in the estuary plan are for illustrations only,and the estimated implementation guide should be ready months after that.the plan as it is written in any shape or form will not force plaintiff to move.i talked to rick wederhorn the planning manager for the port of oakland he said,his long range recommendation is to leave plaintiff alone.
i am estimating the anticipated term of possession to be years 
the attorney for the applicant contends that the assessor should use an anticipated term of possession of years to value the subject property.in the original assessment the assessor used a year term of anticipated possession.this was based on a study of like properties that were being leased from government agencies,this study indicated that the average term of possession was years.the port has stated their willingness for the applicant to stay at the current location where he has been since.the attorney has stated the willingness of his client plaintiff to stay at the current location.the estuary plan is a long term vision document that could involve bond measures.all these indicators point to the fact that plaintiff will be at the property for the long term 
the estuary plan situation was updated in the assessor reports for and as follows 
no information supporting the applicant value has been provided to the assessor since the appeal.in determining a reasonably anticipated term of possession for the appeal,term issues raised by the applicant for the appeal and actions taken by the board were examined.the term set by the board for the appeal sets an upper limit on the term to be used.
two primary issues were raised by the applicant the impact that the draft oakland estuary plan would have on his ability to remain at th
