the california sales and use tax law generally imposes a sales tax on a retailer for the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail and a comparable tax known as a use tax on tangible personal property that is purchased from a retailer outside the state but that is thereafter stored,used or consumed by the purchaser within the state,all further statutory references are to this code except as otherwise noted.where,however,a purchaser buys or uses tangible personal property for resale in the regular course of its business,neither of these taxes applies.
this case presents the issue of whether coal that is purchased outside california and used by the purchaser to produce electricity in the state is subject to the california use tax.the answer to this fundamental issue requires a resolution of two underlying questions whether the electricity is tangible personal property for purposes of the sales and tax law,such that the coal used to produce it might qualify as having been purchased for resale and whether the coal through its chemical energy was incorporated into the electricity,thus qualifying its purchase as one for resale,or was instead consumed in the process of generating the electricity.
as explained below,we conclude that electricity is tangible personal property under the sales and use tax law,but that the coal is not incorporated into the electricity and thus its purchase is subject to the california use tax.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
searles valley minerals operations,formerly known as imc chemicals,oak power,rio bravo poso,rio bravo jasmin and ace cogeneration company,lp collectively,the taxpayers produce and sell electricity to california consumers.in their production plants,crushed coal is combusted to heat boilers and create high pressure steam,which is fed into turbines and causes them to rotate a magnet inside a generator,which in turn produces the electricity.
the taxpayers purchase their coal from sellers outside of california and do not pay any sales taxes on those purchases.they originally paid more than million in use taxes to california on their purchases of the coal between july and september,but later filed claims for refunds of those taxes with the state board of equalization the board.the board denied a refund on several grounds,including that electricity is not tangible personal property and that the coal was not incorporated into the electricity,but was instead a manufacturing aid,making its purchase subject to the use tax.
after an unsuccessful administrative appeal of the board decision,the taxpayers filed this action in the superior court,seeking a refund of the taxes paid.for the purposes of trial,the parties stipulated to the foregoing facts and that the taxpayers purchased coal based on specific representations as to the coal nominal calorific value,stated in british thermal units btus,and that their purchase prices for the coal were subject to adjustment for any deviations between the delivered coal represented values and the actual values as determined through sample testing.
at trial,the taxpayers contended that electricity is tangible personal property for purposes of the sales and use tax law.they further argued that because the coal energy was converted into the electricity,the purchases of the coal were for the purpose of resale and thus no use tax should have been imposed with respect to the use,storage or consumption of the coal.in support of their latter argument,the taxpayers introduced expert testimony that coal contains chemical or internal energy,which is released under the right conditions to wit,upon being combusted with oxygen to produce thermal energy.their expert testified that the energy in the coal is potential in nature,in that it must be released before it becomes physical,which he defined as having material existence perceptible through the senses.he further testified that the coal physical representation its mass is consumed as a result of the combustion,but that its chemical energy is released in the process.
the board disagreed with the contention that the coal was incorporated into the electricity and elicited an admission from the taxpayers expert that there are no coal molecules present in the electricity produced.it also introduced evidence that all fuels contain potential energy and that any fuel source used in an electrical generation process involving the use of steam would be utilized in the same way,it would be burned to release chemical energy that would heat the water.the board also argued that even if coal had been incorporated into the electricity,the purpose of the coal purchases was not for resale because,under existing legal precedent,electricity is not tangible personal property and thus its sale could not qualify as a resale of the coal.
based on a consideration of the evidence and the arguments of the parties,the trial court issued a lengthy and thoughtful statement of decision in which it concluded that,for purposes of the sales and use tax law,electricity constitutes tangible personal property.it also found that the coal purchases were nonetheless subject to the use tax because the coal was not incorporated into the electricity,but was instead used as a catalyst to produce that final product,electricity.the court entered judgment in favor of the board and the taxpayers appeal.
discussion 
the taxpayers requests for judicial notice 
in the proceedings below,the taxpayers requested that the trial court take judicial notice of materials contained on the website pages of the american coal foundation and the department of energy pursuant to evidence code section,subdivision h,which permits a court to take judicial notice of f acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.the trial court denied the request and the taxpayers contend on appeal that it erred in doing so.we reject their contention.
a court may not take judicial notice of any matter unless authorized or required by law.the taxpayers,however,cite no legal authority establishing the propriety of taking judicial notice of these websites.further,although it might be appropriate to take judicial notice of the existence of the websites,the same is not true of their factual content.see mangini reynolds tobacco cal th,d,recognizing that although public documents may be proper subjects for judicial notice,the truth of the matters stated in such documents is not,overruled on other grounds by in re tobacco cases ii cal th,d,accord starkman mann theatres d,fn.for these reasons,we conclude that the trial court properly denied the taxpayers request for judicial notice.
in response to our request for further briefing on the significance of sections and,the taxpayers also request that we take judicial notice of certain portions of the legislative history of the former.we grant this unopposed request.
overview of applicable sales and use tax principles 
as noted above,california imposes a sales tax on all retailers f or the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail the tax is measured as a percentage of the retailer gross sales receipts in the state.a retail sale is defined as a sale for any purpose other than resale in the regular course of the purchaser business in the form of tangible personal property.a sale of tangible personal property is presumed to be for retail and the seller bears the burden of proving otherwise.see yamaha of america state bd.of equalization th,d associated beverage board of equalization d.

is electricity tangible personal property 
as noted above,tangible personal property that is purchased for resale at retail is not subject to the use tax.the term tangible personal property is defined in the sales and use tax law and thus the resolution of this appeal requires us to construe the meaning of the statutory definition.in doing so,we must apply well established rules of statutory construction,the ultimate goal of which is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.see city of huntington beach board of administration cal th,d.because the language of a statute is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,we look to the words used,giving them their ordinary and usual meaning.mejia reed cal th,d.if the language is unambiguous,we must presume that the legislature meant what was said and give effect to the statute plain meaning.whaley sony computer entertainment america,th,d.
the term tangible personal property is defined in the sales and use tax laws as personal property that may be seen,weighed,measured,felt,or touched,or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses.see also,defining personal property as e very kind of property that is not real property terrace water san antonio light power,holding that electricity is personal property.here,the evidence at trial established,and the trial court found,that electricity can be measured and felt and is perceptible to the senses,matters that the board does not truly dispute.thus,in accordance with the clear statutory language and the evidence in the record,electricity constitutes tangible personal property within the meaning of section.see also texas eastern transmission benson,interpreting a virtually identical definition of tangible personal property in the tennessee sales tax code to include electricity sommers secretary,of revenue taxation.cir so d same,louisiana state tax commission marcus lawrence memorial hospital,same,arizona curry alabama power,so d,same,alabama.we find further support for this conclusion by the fact that the legislature has expressly exempted sales of electricity from the application of sales and use taxes.see guillen schwarzenegger th,d recognizing that a statutory construction that would render legislative language superfluous is disfavored.
despite the obvious implications of the language of section,the board contends that its decision in in the matter of the appeal of pacificorp,cal.tax lexis pacificorp and other authorities require the conclusion that electricity is not tangible personal property within its purview.however,the board reliance on its cited authorities is misplaced.for example,pacificorp addressed the question of whether the sales of electricity constituted sales of tangible personal property for the purposes of applying california corporate income tax laws.see pacificorp,cal.tax lexis at.because the corporate tax laws did not provide a specific definition of tangible personal property as the sales and use tax law does,the board in pacificorp was required to interpret the meaning of that statutory term by reference to other sources and,in doing so,concluded that electricity was intangible rather than tangible,and that the sale of electricity was properly characterized as the sale of a service rather than a product,and thus did not qualify as tangible personal property for corporate income tax purposes.id.at.
notwithstanding the difference in the statutory scheme at issue here and the one involved in pacificorp,the board cites to a broad statement in pacificorp that for purposes of california tax law,electricity is intangible as a basis for contending that electricity is not tangible personal property within the meaning of section.pacificorp,cal.tax lexis at.however,a review of the pacificorp decision itself makes clear that its holding is much narrower than the board suggests and does not purport to define that term as used in the sales and use tax law.notably,in its analysis,pacificorp specifically rejected certain authorities as unpersuasive because they did not involve the application of corporate franchise or income tax laws.in addition,the opinion neither referenced nor discussed the definition of tangible personal property as set forth in the sales and use tax law as a basis for its conclusion.accordingly,pacificorp is not determinative of,or even relevant to,the issue presently before us.
the board citation to roth drug,johnson d,roth drug,is equally unavailing.in that case,certain retail merchants challenged the constitutionality of the retail sales tax act of on several grounds,including that it contravened the united states and california constitutions by unreasonably discriminating between tangible and intangible personal property.the court of appeal rejected the merchants argument,concluding that the power of the states to make classifications of persons or property for the purpose of taxation is very broad,that the merchants had not made a sufficient showing to overcome the presumption of statutory validity and that t he taxing of tangible personal property as distinguished from intangible property is perfectly natural and reasonable.id.at.
in the language on which the board now relies,the appellate court defined tangible personal property as that which is visible and corporeal,having substance and body as contrasted with incorporeal property rights,such as franchises,chooses in action,copyrights,the circulation of a newspaper and the like.roth drug,supra,d at.the court went on to say t he reason for distinguishing between tangible and intangible property for the purpose of taxation is very evident.the first is visible,accessible and easy to identify and levy upon,while the other is not so readily located or its value ascertained.there is no room for logical controversy over the right to distinguish between tangible and intangible property for the purpose of taxation.ibid.
although the board contends that the retail sales tax act as in effect at the time of the roth drug case contained a definition for tangible personal property that was virtually identical to the current definition in section,the fact is that roth drug made no reference to the statutory definition in its analysis,which in any event involved an entirely different issue than is presented here.thus,roth drug does not provide persuasive authority for the board position,western landscape construction bank of america th,d.for similar reasons,neither do miller city of los angeles cal,which involved the issue of whether electricity was property within the meaning of a city charter,or the massachusetts appellate tax board opinion in eua ocean,wl.tax lexis,which involved the issue of how a taxpayer sale of electricity affected its income tax liability under massachusetts law.
