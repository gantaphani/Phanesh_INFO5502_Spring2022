opinion of the court 
in this appeal involving the assessment of real property taxes in the unites states virgin islands,we address the special relationship between federal and territorial law.the district court enjoined the virgin islands tax assessor from employing a certain tax assessment method,concluding it violated federal law.contending that any claims can only arise under territorial law,the government of the virgin islands maintains the district court lacked federal jurisdiction.we hold that plaintiff has properly pled a federal claim.
plaintiff equivest thomas,is a united states virgin islands corporation that owns commercial property in thomas,virgin islands.plaintiff challenges the tax assessment of three of its hotel resort properties,bluebeard castle,bluebeard beach club,and the elysian resort.for the tax year,the government of the virgin islands assessed these three properties at more than million,resulting in a tax bill of approximately.plaintiff contends the assessment greatly exceeds the properties actual value of less than million.
federal statutory law,and its virgin islands corollary,mandate that virgin islands real property must be assessed at actual value.ann.according to defendant virgin islands tax assessor roy martin,the virgin islands primarily employed value and declaration value in assessing the properties,methods he conceded do not reflect fair market value.plaintiff contends that reliance on and declaration value violates federal statutory and virgin islands law.plaintiff brought this action under,seeking to enjoin defendants from assessing real property taxes for commercial property in the virgin islands other than in strict accordance with and.
finding that plaintiff was likely to prevail on the merits and had met the other requirements for preliminary relief,the district court enjoined the government of the virgin islands from collecting property taxes against the hotel properties owned by equivest thomas,until the tax assessor can establish at a trial on the merits that the property taxes on those properties have been assessed on their actual value.equivest thomas,gov t of the,d.
at this time,the government of the virgin islands does not contest the district court resolution of the merits.instead,the government contends the district court lacked jurisdiction because this dispute arises not under federal law,but solely under virgin islands law 
property taxes are generally governed by state law.as we discuss,the importance to the states of their tax systems is such that comity mandates that federal courts are ordinarily powerless to entertain challenges to state taxation,even under.fair assessment in real estate mcnary,d.but the virgin islands is not a state it is a territory subject to congress broad power under article iv,section,clause of the united states constitution to govern territories see examining bd.of eng rs,architects and surveyors flores de otero,d.

harris boreham,cir.accordingly,congress undisputedly has constitutional authority to regulate property taxation in the territory of the virgin islands.
in,congress exercised this authority.in order to equalize and more equitably to distribute existing taxes on real property in the virgin islands of the united states and to reduce the burden of taxation now imposed on land in productive use in such islands,congress enacted a statute governing property taxes in the virgin islands.section provides 
for the calendar year and for all succeeding years all taxes on real property in the virgin islands shall be computed on the basis of the actual value of such property and the rate in each municipality of such islands shall be the same for all real property subject to taxation in such municipality whether or not such property is in cultivation and regardless of the use to which such property is put.
the general requirements of are followed by the more specific requirements of,which also recognizes a measure of over specific property tax requirements 
until local tax laws conforming to the requirements of sections to of this title are in effect in a municipality the tax on real property in such municipality for any calendar year shall be at the rate of per centum of the assessed value.if the legislative authority of a municipality failed to enact laws for the levy,assessment,collection or enforcement of any tax imposed under authority of said sections,within three months after may,the president shall prescribe regulations for the levy,assessment,collection,and enforcement of such tax,which shall be in effect until the legislative authority of such municipality shall make regulations for such purposes.
this section created an interim tax rate and specified a source of interim regulations over the tax collection system.but these provisions were to apply only until local tax laws conforming to the requirements of sections to of this title are in effect,with respect to the tax rate,and until the legislative authority of a municipality shall make regulations for such purposes,with respect to tax collection and enforcement mechanisms.
the two sections fit together.section provides general requirements for property taxation in the virgin taxes be uniformly assessed and that they be computed on the basis of the actual value of the properties taxed.section provides details that conform with the more general requirements of tax rates and directing the president to prescribe regulations both requirements are subject to change by local legislation,but they must conform to the requirements of sections to including the general requirements in.the federal statute,therefore,contemplates a hybrid scheme of real property law the general requirements are set by the federal government,with specifics established as a matter of territorial law consistent with federal law 
plaintiff contends the government of the virgin islands is subject to,and in violation of,requirement that all taxes on real property in the virgin islands shall be computed on the basis of the actual value of such property.emphasis added.in response,the government argues this section no longer applies because it has been superceded by virgin islands law.
the government of the virgin islands contends the federal statute was supplanted in when the virgin islands legislature passed a real property assessment law,including ann,which enumerates the factors to be considered in determining actual value.in support,the government of the virgin islands focuses primarily on the expiratory language in,which limits application until local laws are in effect.according to the government,this reveals the temporary nature of the effect ended with the passage of ann.
but as noted,the expiratory language in s applies only to the specific requirements of that section it does not apply to the rest of the statute,including the general requirements of.significantly,expressly provides that the local measures enacted must also conform to the requirements of sections to.a local tax law can not conform to the requirements of the rest of the statute by abrogating it.it is a requirement of the tax be computed on the actual value of the plaintiff contends the government of the virgin islands has violated.accordingly,while ann.may have abrogated the regulations prescribed by president roosevelt under the language of does not support the proposition asserted by the government of the virgin islands that its actual value been abrogated.
that federal requirements apply does not end our inquiry.the government of the virgin islands contends that considerations
