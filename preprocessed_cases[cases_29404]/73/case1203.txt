plaintiff taxpayers filed a refund suit seeking money allegedly owed them from a tax credit for research and development expenses under.in a matter of first impression in this circuit,we interpret the scope of qualified research under,including the requirement in d that the taxpayer must intend to discover information using a process of experimentation.the district court granted summary judgment to the taxpayers and the government appealed.our review of this case was abated from january,until may,pursuant to the government request.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse and remand.
kloehr,his wholly owned subchapter s corporation,tax and accounting software corporation taasc,and kloehr wife sheryl suit seeking a refund of taxes paid by kloehr for his tax year and by him and his wife for taasc is an oklahoma corporation that develops and sells software for use by tax and accounting professionals.in and,taasc developed four computer software products for sale to its customers easyacct,easymicr,professional tax system,and easytel.the research and development expenses for these four products are at issue in this suit.
easyacct is an integrated accounting program that collects data for the preparation of financial statements and allows for the transfer of this information to taasc software.the parties agree that at the time of its introduction to the public easyacct was unique in the functions that it provided.
easymicr is a software program designed to print banking transit codes on blank check stock.it was developed in both dos and windows versions.a commercial failure,easymicr was subsequently integrated into easyacct.
professional tax system integrates a number of software programs into a single,seamless package and allows for the preparation of tax returns for both state and federal tax forms using the same data.it was the first commercial software program to allow for electronic filing with state and federal governments.the program was also designed to run with minimal memory and therefore is able to run on a wide range of computers.
easytel is an automated,system that allows businesses to answer and transfer calls,take messages,provide information over the phone,convert faxes to,and distribute faxes automatically.easytel is unusual because it was designed to run on computer hardware and requires little maintenance.
in,taasc incurred a total of in research and development expenses for the development of these software products in,it incurred a total of in expenses.taasc claimed a portion of these expenses as research and development tax credits under,but the internal revenue service irs disallowed those tax credits.as a result,kloehr faced tax deficiencies of in and in.kloehr paid the deficiencies and brought a refund suit on may,under a and a.on the parties for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for taasc.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.simms oklahoma ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.simms,at.if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute,we determine whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.id.
central to the parties dispute in this case is what constitutes qualified research,which entitles a business to a tax credit under.we begin our analysis with an overview of the provisions of d,which defines qualified research,and a brief history of the tax credit.
we initially note that the provision in question,is separate from the tax code provision that provides for a deduction for any research or experimental expenditures made by a business.a.the latter expenditures have been defined by regulation as expenditures for activities intended to discover information that would eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of a product.reg.our interpretation of the proper scope of the tax credit under has no bearing on the scope or applicability of the deduction under.
section d lays out five separate requirements for qualified research 
the research must qualify as expenses under,the tax code provision providing for deductions of research expenses.d a.
the research must be undertaken for the purpose of discovering information.d b.
the information discovered must be technological in nature.d b i.
the application of the information described above must be intended to be useful in the development of a new or improved business component of the taxpayer.d b ii.
substantially all of the research must constitute elements of a process of experimentation for a valid purpose under the tax credit d c.
the government concedes that taasc has met the first and fourth requirements.the parties also do not dispute that the research undertaken by taasc was technological in nature as required by d b i.thus,we consider only the proper interpretation of requirements two the discovering information requirement and five the process of experimentation requirement.
the tax credit embodied in was originally codified as of the internal revenue code and was enacted as part of the economic recovery tax act of,stat.like,allowed a credit for qualified research,but unlike,provided no definition of qualified research.instead,the statute simply referred to qualified research for purposes of the existing tax deduction under.see,stat.in,qualified research for had no statutory definition and was defined by treasury regulations as research and development costs in the experimental or laboratory sense,at citing reg.a amended.
in,congress reenacted the research tax credit with significant changes,creating the current.the provisions in d defining qualified research were added,including the discovering information requirement and the process of experimentation requirement.
throughout the late and,the research tax credit was reenacted without any substantive changes to the relevant provisions.see credit for increasing research activities.
in,congress reenacted the tax credit,and the relevant conference report included language regarding the definition of qualified research in d.see conf,at.in,another reenactment of the tax credit prompted more conference report language regarding the meaning of d.see conf,at.
whether the legislative history is relevant to the disposition of this case,of course,depends on whether the meaning of each statutory requirement is plain.see united states simmonds,cir i f the statutory language is ambiguous,a court can then resort to legislative history as an aid to interpretation.edwards valdez,cir when the meaning of the statute is clear,it is both unnecessary and improper to resort to legislative history to divine congressional intent.we will later discuss whether the meaning of each contested statutory requirement discovering information and process of experimentation is sufficiently plain to preclude consideration of the legislative history.
taasc interpretation of the discovering information test is that it only requires a taxpayer to discover technological information that led it to develop innovative products.appellees br.at.alternatively,taasc argues that the discovering information test in should have the same meaning as it has in the definition of research for purposes of of the tax code taasc also implies that because its products were new and innovative compared with the other commercially available products in the field of tax and accounting software,its research and development expenses for those products therefore must qualify for the tax credit.
the government argues that the amendments,including the addition of the discovering information requirement,were intended to narrow the scope of the tax credit significantly.as a result,to meet the discovering information requirement,qualified research must rely upon,and expand or refine,principles of the physical or biological sciences,engineering or computer science.appellant br.at.according to the government,taasc research did not expand or refine principles of computer science,a point that taasc conceded before the district court.appellant app.at.
the district court,however,agreed with taasc that d does not require the taxpayer to expand or refine principles of science or engineering in order to qualify for the tax credit.it added that the emphasis should be on whether the information qualifies as being technological in nature,not whether the work could be considered a revolutionary discovery in the scientific sense.tax accounting software united states,d.indeed,the court reasoned that the allegation that there is a separate requirement that the taxpayer discover information is erroneous and a strained and improper reading without any support in the legislative history to back it up.id.it concluded that as a matter of law taasc had met the requirements of discovering information for purposes of d,id.at,relying in part on the fact that taasc products were new and more efficient combination s of software that were not available to the public.id.
the parties also disagree whether taasc software development process qualifies as a process of experimentation.taasc argues that by trying various programming methods in order to achieve its desired results,it undertook a process of experimentation.the government responds that because taasc used generally known computer programming skills to achieve its final objective,there was no experimentation,even if taasc was unsure which particular technique would allow it to achieve its goal.
the government also contends that taasc did not use a process of experimentation because taasc believed at the outset that the final results of its development of the certain to be technically feasible.according to the government,the process of experimentation requirement requires the taxpayer to be uncertain as to whether the final result can be feasibly achieved.the district court concluded that taasc research satisfied the process of experimentation requirement.tax accounting software,d at.
we first analyze what congress intended when it required that taxpayers discover information in order to qualify for the tax credit.in doing so,we apply traditional tools of statutory construction and interpretation,starting with an overview of the applicable principles.
at the time that this case began,the government interpretation of d had not been incorporated into a final regulation that had gone through the rulemaking process under christensen harris county,d,this means that the government position is only due respect to the extent that it has the power to persuade,id.at.quoting skidmore swift,instead of the much greater deference due to regulations promulgated through the administrative procedure act rulemaking process,see chevron,natural res.def.council,d 
the respect that is owed to an agency position under christensen and skidmore is based on the body of experience and informed judgment that agencies have in the interpretation,enforcement,and implementation of the statutes for which they are responsible.christensen,at.skidmore,at.the respect owed to the agency interpretation will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.skidmore,at.
the government position regarding the discovering information requirement has been consistent in d litigation,see,wicor,united states,cir united stationers united states,cir wicor,united states,d,united stationers,united states,norwest comm r,wl,but it has changed significantly as the government has developed regulations to implement d.compare credit for increasing research activities,stating that the discovery requirement can only be met when information is discovered that exceeds,expands,or refines the common knowledge of skilled professionals in a particular field of science or engineering,and credit for increasing research activities.at same,with credit for increasing research activities,stating that the new proposed regulations eliminate the requirement that qualified research must be undertaken to obtain knowledge that exceeds,expands,or refines the common knowledge of skilled professionals in a particular field of science or engineering.under skidmore and christensen,we conclude that the government position is not entitled to substantial deference.
an additional factor to consider is that in construing the internal revenue code,courts are expected to show respect and deference to the irs interpretation of the code.see jewett comm r,d callaway comm r,cir dewees comm r,cir.however,given the irs changing position on this issue,we believe that deference is inappropriate here.
finally,we note that tax credits are a matter of legislative grace,and taxpayers bear the burden of clearly showing that they are entitled to them.schumacher united states,cir citing new colonial ice helvering.thus,they are to be strictly and narrowly construed.see texasgulf,comm r,cir inland steel united states.where there is clear provision in the statute for a particular credit,however,the credit is allowable.see new colonial ice,at.
in interpreting a statute we begin with its plain language.united states morgan,cir.in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier,d emphasis added.
the word information has a broad meaning.see webster third new international dictionary unabridged defining information as,for example,knowledge communicated by others or obtained from investigation,study,or instruction,or knowledge of a particular event or situation.among other definitions,discover can mean to make known something secret,hidden,unknown,or previously unnoticed,to reveal the identity of,or to disclose to view something hidden,covered,or previously unseen.id.at see also id.stating that the word discover means to come to know something not previously known,either by purposive search and investigation or by accident.in the present statutory context,as one of the requirements for research that the government would have an interest in encouraging through a tax credit,we conclude that the word discover requires that what is discovered in this case,something new or previously unknown 
moreover,the new information that is discovered must also be information that is intended to be useful in the development of a new or improved business component of the taxpayer.d b ii.the new information therefore can not merely be the product itself but must also have independent value that can be applied in the development of a new product.wicor,at distinguishing,for purposes of,the domain of genuine research from that of implementation of existing research findings.
in short,the statute requires that the taxpayer research,in order to qualify,must have developed new information that is applied towards the development of a product.this is the discovery requirement of contrary to taasc arguments,mere evidence that the taxpayer has developed a new and useful product in and of itself will not qualify.contrary to the government argument,the new information need not expand,or refine,principles of the physical or biological sciences,engineering,or computer science.appellant br.at.in other words,each of the positions of the parties is incorrect.
more importantly,for our purposes,the district court erred when it held that any discovery test was based on a strained and improper reading without any support,tax accounting software,d at,a holding that essentially read the discovering information language out of the statute.the district court also erred when it rejected the argument that the discovering information language requires newness and expansion of existing knowledge.id.at.the term discovery means that the researcher must find new information or,in other words,must expand existing knowledge.finally,the district court erred when it relied on the mere newness and innovation of the product itself,without determining that taasc discovered new information separate from that product,in concluding that taasc met the requirements of.id.at.
to summarize,the discovering information language of establishes a separate requirement that the taxpayer must meet in order to qualify for the tax credit.under that requirement,the taxpayer must show that he discovered new information and that information must be separate from the product that is actually developed 
the next issue is whether taasc work amounted to a process of experimentation.we analyze both whether the process of experimentation test allows a taxpayer to use methods that are generally known,and whether the test requires the taxpayer initially to believe that there is uncertainty as to whether the final result is feasible.
in construing the process of experimentation requirement,we again start with the language of the statute.process has a broad meaning that supports taasc interpretation.see webster third new international dictionary unabridged at defining process in this context as a progressive forward movement from one point to another on the way to completion,the action of passing through continuing development from a beginning to a contemplated end,the action of continuously going along through each of a succession of acts,events or developmental stages,or a particular method or system of doing something,producing something,or accomplishing a specific result.
the definition of experiment is a test or trial,a tentative procedure or policy,or an act or operation carried out under conditions determined by the experimenter as in a laboratory in order to discover some unknown principle or effect or to test,establish,or illustrate some suggested or known truth.id.at.
here,the definition of experiment is ambiguous with respect to the questions at issue.concerning the first issue,none of the definitions clarifies whether the methods may be generally known.regarding the second issue,whether the taxpayer must initially believe that there is uncertainty as to whether the final result is feasible,the first two definitions would best fit with taasc broad reading of the term.the last definition could support either the government argument that the final results of the experimental process must be uncertain as to final result being an unknown principle or effect or taasc position that the final results may be certain as to final result may also be a known truth.given that the process of experimentation must be used to discover new information as we discussed above,however,the government position regarding this last definition is stronger.new information can not be a known truth.
in light of the conflicting definitions,we conclude that the term process of experimentation is ambiguous as to the points at issue namely,whether the final results must be certain as to feasibility and whether the methods to be used in the process of experimentation may be generally known.because of this ambiguity,legislative history may properly be invoked in construing the process of experimentation requirement.see simmonds,at discussing the circumstances in which resort to legislative history is appropriate.
by all indications,the government has consistently argued in d litigation that there must be uncertainty as to whether the final result can be achieved for the process of experimentation test to be satisfied.see,united stationers,at wicor,d at united stationers.at norwest,at.however,the government has apparently not raised the issue of whether generally known techniques may be used in the process of experimentation in any of these cases.
in the various versions of the regulations implementing d,the government implies that the end result may be certain so long as the method of achieving that result is uncertain at the outset.over time,however,the government has apparently changed its view regarding whether the converse is,whether the method of achieving the result may be certain provided that the end result itself is uncertain.compare credit for increasing research activities.at stating that the result must be one where the means of achieving that result are uncertain at the outset emphasis added,with credit for increasing research activities.at stating that the capability or the method of achieving the result of the research,or the appropriate design of that result,must be uncertain as of the beginning of the taxpayer research activities emphasis added,and credit for increasing research activities.at stating that the capability or method of achieving the result of the research must be uncertain at the outset emphasis added.
as for the issue of whether generally known techniques may be used in the process of experimentation,the government has not addressed that question at all in any of the proposed or final regulations.see credit for increasing research activities.at,credit for increasing research activities.at,credit for increasing research activities.at.because the government has either taken no position or has altered its position on both issues,its interpretation of the process of experimentation requirement is entitled to little deference.skidmore,at.
we conclude that the term process of experimentation can include research in which the taxpayer tries alternative methods to achieve a result and all of the methods are already commonly known,but it is uncertain which method will allow the taxpayer to achieve the result.as noted above,the definition of experiment does not seem to prohibit the use of commonly or generally known methods.the government has apparently not made the argument that the methods can not be commonly or generally known in previous litigation,nor has it discussed or considered this interpretation of the statute in its evolving regulations.nor does the legislative history reflect a contrary legislative intent.congress stated that a process of experimentation would include efforts to develop,test,and choose among viable alternatives.conf,at emphasis added.viable alternative methods need not be new to the taxpayer nor must they be generally unknown to the public.
moreover,as the treasury department itself noted in discussing the regulations implementing early in,virtually all research utilizes existing scientific principles and technology.credit for increasing research activities.at.most scientific research requires the use of known methodologies to determine whether or not particular results are achievable.although congress intended to narrow the scope of the research tax credit in we conclude that the government position in this case overstates how narrow congress intended the research credit to be.congress did not intend to eliminate the use of already known techniques in the discovery of new information through its narrowing of the tax credit clause.
the second issue is whether the taxpayer must show that it was uncertain about whether the end result of the process of experimentation was technically feasible at the time that it commenced the research.courts that have previously decided this issue have generally agreed with the government position.see,united stationers,at stating that the legislative history strongly suggests that qualifying research must from its outset involve some technical uncertainty about the possibility of developing the product and concluding that debugging programs alone can not constitute a process of experimentation because of the lack of uncertainty as to the final result norwest,at holding that at the outset uncertainty must exist about the ability to develop the product in the scientific or laboratory sense.
the government substantially relies on the legislative history.the house report defines process of experimentation as 
a process of scientific experimentation or engineering activities to design a business item where the design of the item as a whole is uncertain at the outset,but instead must be determined by developing one or more hypotheses for specific design decisions,testing and analyzing those hypotheses through,for example,modeling or simulation,and refining or discarding the hypotheses as part of a sequential design process to deve
