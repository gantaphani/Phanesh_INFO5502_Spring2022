aurora trevino appeals her convictions for conspiracy to defraud the united states and attempting to evade or defeat a tax.the convictions resulted from erroneous tax returns prepared and filed on trevino behalf by her accountant,salvador archuleta,for the,and tax years.trevino sought and was denied a new trial in the district court.she was sentenced to ten months in prison.
she appeals,making three arguments the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that her good faith belief that her tax returns were proper was a complete defense to the charges against her the prosecutor engaged in misconduct and jury instruction number impermissibly created a presumption of her knowledge of the contents of her erroneous tax return.trevino also seeks a remand of her sentence pursuant to united states ameline,cir en banc.
we affirm and remand.
since,aurora trevino has owned and operated aurora flowers,selling silk flower arrangements from stores in dinuba and fresno,california.since,she has used the accounting services of salvador archuleta.in,the irs began investigating archuleta,and in his office found versions of trevino and tax returns which were different than the returns filed with the irs for those years.in,the irs audited trevino tax return,which confirmed that she had made significantly more profit than she reported to the irs.
trevino was eventually charged with conspiracy to defraud the united states for her,and tax returns count one,attempting to evade or defeat a tax for count two,and attempting to evade or defeat a tax for count three.
archuleta was charged with falsifying tax returns on behalf of his clients.he pleaded guilty and his potential sentence of months was reduced to months,in exchange for his guilty plea and his agreement to cooperate with the government in various cases,including trevino.
at trial,the government introduced evidence that trevino owned the dinuba business location,her residence,and three rental properties.it also showed that,in connection with a residential loan application,she and her husband had represented to their bank that they had a gross monthly income of and a net worth of.
archuleta claimed that,in,trevino offered him her accounting business if he could reduce her tax liability.he did so for the tax years at issue primarily by falsely increasing the cost of the goods component of her tax calculation on each return schedule c.this was demonstrated at trial in part by comparing monthly profit and loss statements archuleta prepared for trevino with the profit calculations incorporated into her various tax returns.
schedule c to trevino return showed a net profit of,while the profit and loss statement archuleta prepared for her showed a net profit of.the irs calculated trevino actual profit at.

trevino schedule c reported a net profit of,and the profit and loss statement archuleta prepared for her showed.the irs also introduced a different return,which was not filed with the irs,reflecting a net profit of.trevino did not sign her tax return.the irs calculated trevino profit for at.
for,schedule c showed and archuleta profit and loss statement showed.the irs calculated trevino actual profit for at.
trevino testified that the monthly profit and loss statements prepared for her were incorrect,but she did not know why.she testified that she would sign the inaccurate returns without knowing they were false and without question of or explanation by archuleta she claimed he never told her anything about the returns or her tax liability.her primary defense at trial was that she was suggestible and dependant a position offered by a clinical psychologist testifying as an expert and that she simply did not know that archuleta was doing anything wrong.
for his part,archuleta testified that he did review trevino returns with her,and that she visited his office regularly to go over the monthly profit and loss statements.he testified that typically trevino would come in and go over each tax return before it was filed.he specifically testified that he reviewed his initial version of trevino tax return with her,and that she complained that the tax liability reflected on it was too high.he testified that she instructed him to reduce it,and that he did so by increasing the cost of goods sold in that tax year.the revised return,reflecting more cost and less profit,was filed with the irs on trevino behalf.indeed,even trevino brief is replete with references to trial testimony supporting the finding that she was a willing and active participant in falsely increasing the cost of goods sold in order to reduce her profit and her tax liability.
the jury found her guilty on all three counts conspiracy to defraud for the tax years evading a tax for,and evading a tax for.trevino moved for a new trial following the verdict,arguing that the trial court erred in failing to give a good faith defense instruction,and that jury instruction as given was a misstatement of the law.she also objected to the prosecutor claim in his rebuttal argument that her attorney was wrong when he claimed that archuleta did not increase the cost of goods sold by.
trevino motion for a new trial was denied and she was sentenced to months in jail.she appeals on all three bases.
good faith defense.
trevino argues that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that her good faith belief that her tax returns were proper was a complete defense to the charges against her.we review de novo whether a district court instructions to the jury adequately address a defendant theory of defense.united states smith,cir united states hopper,cir.
the government burden of proving willfulness 
requires negating a defendant claim of ignorance of the law or a claim that because of a misunderstanding of the law,he had a belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the tax laws.this is so because one can not be aware that the law imposes a duty upon him and yet be ignorant of it,misunderstand the law,or believe that the duty does not exist.
cheek united states,d emphasis added.
there is,then,a difference between an ignorance defense and a good faith misunderstanding defense.in order to rely on a good faith defense,the defendant must in fact have some belief either that her own understanding was correct,or that she in good faith relied on the tax advice of a qualified tax professional.see united states bishop,cir.
trevino did not claim the former,and while she claims she relied on archuleta,it is her position that he gave her no advice or guidance of any sort.instead,she claimed she did not know,did not ask,and was not told what archuletta was doing.she claimed to be an unknowing and involuntary participant in a scheme that benefited only her.
the jury was instructed that an act is done knowingly if the defendant is aware of the act,and does not act or fails to act through ignorance,mistake,or accident.it is not reversible error to reject a defendant proposed instruction on his theory of the case,if other instructions,in their entirety,adequately cover that defense theory.united states dees,cir citing united states mason,cir.the instructions allowed trevino to argue her theory of the her ignorance and not h
