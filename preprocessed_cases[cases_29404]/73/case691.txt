bette pree was indicted by a grand jury for one count of failing to file a tax return for the tax year,in violation of,and for two counts of filing false tax returns for the tax years and,in violation of.after trial,a jury found pree not guilty of the failure to file charge but guilty of both counts of filing false tax returns.the district court sentenced pree to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,with the special condition that she pay taxes owed to the internal revenue service irs in the amount of.pree appealed her convictions.on september,this court affirmed the judgments of conviction but vacated the sentence and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing.we stayed our mandate pending the supreme court decision in united states booker,d on january,the supreme court issued its decision in booker.at this court invitation,each party has submitted a memorandum presenting its views on the application of booker to this case.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we revise our prior instructions with respect to pree sentence.in light of booker,while retaining jurisdiction of this case,we remand this case to the district court in accordance with this court decision in united states paladino,cir.
backgrounda.facts 
pree was convicted of filing false returns for tax years and.to present a coherent background of the circumstances upon which those convictions are based,we first must relate some events that transpired prior to those tax years.
in,maurice furlong,the president of health care centers of america hcca contacted pree daughter,a former lobbyist for the illinois chiropractic society,about a potential job opportunity with hcca.pree and her daughter met furlong,and he discussed the company and its expansion plans with them.after this meeting,furlong developed an interest in hiring pree as well as pree daughter because pree was a nurse and held a real estate license.
after this meeting,pree and her daughter moved to las vegas.on december,pree signed a lease that was assigned to care centers of america bette pree.gov t ex a.pree and her daughter received approximately from furlong for moving expenses.
beginning in,pree began selling hcca stock to friends,family,former and other acquaintances.in january,pree wrote to one former and noted,this company i work for hcca health care centers of america is going on the stock market right away.gov t ex a.pree encouraged the to buy as much stock as she could.the letter further indicated i exec.assistant to president of gov t ex 
pree continued selling stock through.in selling stock,pree would provide prospective purchasers with her hcca business card on which her title was listed as administrator of aquisition sic,gov t ex g,and would distribute company literature.she also would correspond on company letterhead.pree explained to prospective purchasers that she had been hired to oversee the opening of an office and in lieu of salary they hcca were issuing her stocks in the company to do with what she chose.at.
although pree began selling stock in january of,she first received hcca stock in may of.the stock she received consisted of shares of restricted stock formerly registered to furlong.the restricted stock bore the statement the shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the securities act of and may not be sold,transferred or otherwise disposed of by the holder unless registered under said act gov t ex when a securities investigator from the illinois secretary of state investigated pree stock sales,pree wrote a letter in response,justifying the transactions as personal sales from stock received for services.she described the stock as 
given to me by maurice furlong from his own personal shares for my assistance in the development and arrangement of the chiropractic presentation and business plan,and for introducing him to chiropractors and associates in illinois,as well as assisting with various administrative duties or tasks.
throughout the course of pree stock sales,the prices at which she sold the stock fluctuated.during,she sold stock at prices between a nickel and a dollar per share.during,her stock prices ranged from a quarter to a dollar per share.in,she sold the stock at prices between nine cents and fifty cents per share.during,pree received from sales of the hcca stock.in,pree received from stock sales in a declaration to a casino,pree indicated that she had an annual income of from stocks,retirement and social security.
pree did not file her and tax returns when due but instead requested and received automatic extensions to file.she later met with ann westphal,a h r block tax preparer,to prepare her and returns.westphal prepared returns indicating pension and social security income for in the amount of,and pension,taxable interest and gambling income for in the amount of neither return included any income from stock sales,nor did either return include schedule d,the schedule on which capital gain or loss from sale of stock is calculated.westphal prepared the returns at her home as a personal favor to pree.westphal did not prepare them through h r block,nor did she sign them.pree ultimately signed and submitted her and tax returns on march.while meeting with westphal,pree also told her about the opportunity to purchase hcca stock,and westphal agreed to purchase shares for from pree.
pree later was indicted on several charges count ii charged pree with filing an income tax return for in which she listed total income of,whereas,as she then and there well knew and believed,she had received additional income substantially in excess of that amount in calendar year.at.count iii charged pree with filing an income tax return for in which she listed total income of,whereas,as she then and there well knew and believed,she had received additional income substantially in excess of that amount in calendar year.at.
district court proceedings 
pree case proceeded to trial.before trial,pree filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence related to fraud in her sale of stock to investors.the district court granted this motion in part,barring testimony as to whether her investors were satisfied or dissatisfied with their hcca investments.
the government theory of the case,pertinent to this appeal,was that,during the relevant time period,pree worked for hcca and sold hcca stock that she received as compensation for her services despite a significant increase in her income from these stock sales and despite being informed that she had an obligation to report the income she received from such sales,pree filed belated returns for and,on which she willfully failed to report income from her stock sales 
at trial,the government presented evidence pertaining to the nature of the stock pree sold.an officer of the stock transfer agent for hcca testified that the stock originally was registered to furlong.in may,however,furlong stock certificate was divided,and one of new certificates was issued to pree.the transfer agent testified that the stock was restricted and that the effect of the restriction on the stock certificate was to limit the stock value to whatever the seller can obtain from the purchaser.at.
several individuals who obtained stock from pree testified to their purchases.stipulations pertaining to pree stock sales to other investors also were read into evidence by the government.the testimony and stipulations together revealed that pree sold stock before any was registered in her name,that she sold stock after she received her certificate in may,that she sold stock throughout and,and that she continued selling stock after exhausting the shares originally registered in her name 
additionally,the government presented the testimony of an irs special agent who investigated pree in.the special agent testified that pree had indicated to her that she was aware of her obligation to report stock sales on her tax returns in the year of sale.further,the government presented the testimony of westphal.westphal testified that she had prepared pree and taxes in september of.she testified that pree had brought her an interest statement,pension and social security information and gambling.westphal indicated that pree had denied any other income we went through the return and i asked her if that was all the information she had,all the income she had,and she stated to me that it was.at.westphal further testified that,after she herself purchased hcca stock,the two discussed the need to report income from stock sales,but pree did not indicate that any sales had been made in or.
in concluding its case,the government called michael welch,an irs revenue agent,as a summary witness.agent welch had prepared an exhibit summarizing the hcca stock sales by pree in,and.the exhibit,government exhibit,was prepared from trial testimony,exhibits and the stipulations,and it was admitted without objection.agent welch also prepared a schedule that summarized pree gross income.the exhibit included the full amount received from the stock sales in in the calculation of gross income.it was admitted as government exhibit.
agent welch did not prepare any summaries for pree income for or.instead,when asked where the stock sales would have been reported on the tax return,agent welch testified on line of the face of the would be the gain or loss from sales of stock.and a schedule d would be required to itemize the various sales.at.he also testified that line is an accumulation of line through,it would include wages,interest,dividends,gain on sale,pension distributions,and that would be your total income on line.stock sales would be included there.at.agent welch testified similarly when asked about stock sales for.
on,agent welch testified that income from stock sales is a net figure derived from the gross sales and the cost basis of the stock in response to questions stemming from the defense theory that furlong gave pree the stock as a gift,agent welch also agreed that to calculate capital gain or loss on the sale of a gift,you must know the donor basis,the fair market value at the time of the gift and the amount of any gift taxes paid.agent welch admitted that he did not have information regarding furlong cost basis nor whether any amount of gift tax was paid on the stock pree received.agent welch testified,however,that he believed the fair market value of the stock was zero on redirect,agent welch clarified that he relied on the government evidence that pree received the stock as compensation for services rendered and explained why he treated the stock sales as income 
now,you heard the testimony here when you chose to characterize the dollars worth of stock sales in that were listed on bette pree return,you characterized that as unreported income.why is that 
a.it was reported on the return,it represents sale of stock,sale of stock goes on line as a capitol sic gain or loss.actually a capitol sic gain.and that income.
at.when asked to clarify why he attributed a zero basis to the stock,he explained 
a.it was based on my years of being with the and the stock transfer agent describing the restricted stock.and the fair market value of something i received is whatever the market value is.and right across the street is merle lynch sic,when you walk out the door.if you receive stock that had value,you should be able to walk in there,into a brokerage house,and sell that stock.and from everything i read and understand,this restricted stock could not be sold in the market.
at.agent welch also testified that the transfer agent said the stock had no market value.
at the close of the government case,pree moved for an acquittal,in part on grounds that the government had presented no evidence of capital gains and had presented no evidence that pree knew the law related to capital gains.the court denied the motion.
in defense,pree presented evidence,including her own testimony,to support her position that the stock was received as a gift,that she never was employed by hcca and that her records of the stock transactions were stolen,which caused a delay in her tax filing.pree testified that she heard somewhere that the cost basis of her stock was a dollar and that she did not recall ever selling her stock for more than a dollar.she testified that she sold the stock to others to enable them to share in the investment opportunity she further testified that when she met with westphal to prepare her and taxes,westphal told her she did not need to file anything with regard to the stock sales because she always sold the stock for less than it was trading at the close of her case,pree renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal,which the court denied.
jury instructions and closing arguments 
following the presentation of evidence,the court instructed the jury.the court did not give instructions regarding how to determine the total amount of taxable income,nor did it instruct the jury how to calculate basis in stock or net gains from the sale of stock.the defense did not request or offer any instructions on these issues,nor did it raise an objection on the ground that such an instruction should be given.with respect to the summaries,the court used the following pattern instruction 
certain summaries are in evidence.they truly and accurately summarize the contents of voluminous books,records or documents,and should be considered together with and in the same way as all other evidence in the case.
the defense did not object to this instruction.nor did the defense raise a substantive objection to the elements of the law instruction 
in its closing and rebuttal arguments,the government emphasized that pree was an employee of hcca,received the stock as compensation,sold the stock throughout the tax years at issue,was repeatedly made aware of her obligation to report the stock sales and yet took affirmative and deceptive steps to avoid reporting that income.the government further challenged pree explanation of the stock sales as a favor to let individuals share this investment,at,as well as pree explanation of stolen records.the government summarized its evidence by emphasizing that the tax returns pree filed for and willfully excluded the income pree received from her stock sales throughout the relevant time period.
pree counsel closing argument primarily attacked the government argument that pree willfully misfiled.emphasizing the defense theory that pree received the stock as a gift,not as compensation,counsel argued that the calculation of gift tax was too complicated for pree knowingly to have filed a false return indeed,counsel suggested,pree believed she had sustained a loss on the sale of her stock.pree counsel also argued that pree had made good faith attempts to meet her filing obligations,but stolen and lost records inhibited her ability to comply.counsel concluded the argument by urging 
neither bette nor her tax preparers had an adequate knowledge of the law.or even for that matter had sufficient records in order to satisfy the strict requirements of the law.that not a crime if you had a good faith,honest belief that you were complying with your duty to file tax returns.
jury verdict 
following deliberation,the jury convicted pree of counts ii and iii for willfully filing fraudulent returns for and.at sentencing,the district court enhanced pree sentence on the ground of obstruction of justice for knowingly false testimony on a material matter based on her testimony related to her employment and westphal advice.pree appeals the district court denial of the judgment of acquittal on the ground of insufficient evidence.she also appeals the admission of the summary evidence and the adequacy of the jury instructions.
discussiona.sufficiency of the evidence 
we review first pree challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.see united states douglas,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states durrive,cir.pree appeals the district court denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal.she submits that the government presented insufficient evidence of unreported income,as well as insufficient evidence that she willfully misreported her income.
standard of review 
the district court denial of a judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo.see united states sax,cir.the motion should be granted if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.id.quoting charles alan wright,federal rules of criminal procedure,at.a conviction is reversed only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states chavin,cir.a defendant has a heavy burden in challenging a conviction based on the sufficiency of the evidence.united states hoover,cir.
sufficient evidence of unreported income 
prosecution under requires that a taxpayer cause to be made and verify as true under penalties of perjury a tax return that the taxpayer knows is not true and correct as to every material matter.see see also united states peters,cir.pree was indicted for tax returns not true and correct as to line,the line for total income on the united states individual income tax return form.
the government evidence showed that pree received from stock sales in and from stock sales in.no portion of either amount was reported on the and tax returns.pree contends,in this sufficiency challenge,that the government did not establish that any portion of these amounts represented a net gain,and therefore did not establish that her income tax return was materially false as to total income.
pree argument is unavailing.it is true that the government did not present evidence of technical valuations of the restricted stock.see valuation of securities restricted from immediate resale,rul,indicating that factors relevant to the valuation of restricted stock include the earnings,net assets,and net sales of the corporation,the resale provisions of the restricted stock,the relative bargaining strength of the buyers and sellers and the market experience of the corporation freely tradeable securities,as amplified by rul,as amplified by rul.nor,apparently,in cautious deference to pree motion in limine did the government ask investors about the value of their purchases.nevertheless,the evidence presented by the government was sufficient to permit an inference that pree sold her stock for a net gain in both and.
agent welch testified that pree possessed a zero basis in her stock and that the full amount of income received from stock sales should have been included as gross income on line.he clarified this conclusion by explaining that pree basis in that stock was the fair market value of the stock when she received it.however,prior to pree sales,the stock had no readily ascertainable value because it was not publicly traded.by virtue of the restriction,the stock could not be sold in a public transaction.thus,the only market for the stock was the one pree created.
the evidence of pree sales permitted,but did not compel,the conclusion that the stock lacked ascertainable value outside the transactions she orchestrated.despite the large number of shares that pree sold,over shares in,and well over shares in,pree testified that she never knew her basis and did not always check the value of the stock before selling it.moreover,to the extent pree or her investors checked the value of hcca stock,that value pertained to publicly traded stock,not to the restricted stock sold by pree.additionally,the government evidence indicated that,after exhausting the initial block of shares transferred to her,pree continued to sell stock months and even years before additional shares were registered in her name.despite pree own statement to investors that the stock represented the best investment you ever have made,gov t ex c,pree herself apparently retained none of the initial shares transferred to her.under these circumstances,one plausible conclusion is that the stock lacked ascertainable value outside the transactions pree engineered.see a indicating that in rare and extraordinary cases property may be considered to have no fair market value.
as we indicated previously,on a sufficiency challenge,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.in this respect,we note the absence of evidence in the record contradicting the government position that the restricted stock lacked ascertainable value prior to pree sales.although on appeal pree advances a valuation of the restricted stock based on factors such as net assets or net sales of the corporation,such evidence is not in the record and was not considered by the jury.even accepting,arguendo,pree own theory of the stock as a gift,we note that the record contained no evidence as to the valuation of her gift basis in the stock,evidence of furlong basis and any gift taxes paid at the time of transfer.in sum,the trial record will not support a method of valuation different from that employed by agent the full amount of stock sales should be included in income because pree possessed a zero basis in the stock.indeed,pree attempted only to convince the jury through her own testimony that she sold all the stock in and at a loss or without a gain as a favor to her investors.at.the jury was entitled to reject that explanation.see united states agostino,cir reasoning that a rational jury could have found defendant explanation not credible.
finally,we think it is important to note that,to establish falsity as to the and returns,the government needed only to prove that pree had unreported income,not the exact amount of such unreported income or the existence of a tax deficiency.see peters,at indicating that the government need not establish a tax deficiency in a prosecution under.based on the evidence presented,a rational jury could have determined that some portion of pree stock sales receipts in and some portion of her stock sales receipts in represented net gain and should have been included as income on the respective tax returns.having reviewed the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government,we must conclude that sufficient evidence of unreported income exists.
sufficient evidence of willful misfiling 
prosecution under also requires that the defendant sign the return willfully,knowing it to be false.see see also peters,at.the evidence of willful misfiling is more than sufficient here.
the government presented evidence that several individuals informed pree of her obligation to report income from stock sales in the year such income was received and that pree admitted understanding her obligation.in particular,westphal testified that,following her purchase of stock from pree and while preparing her and returns,she informed pree of her obligation to report stock sales in the year the income was received.westphal further testified that pree failed to reveal any of the and stock sales at that time.also,the irs special agent who investigated pree in testified that she asked pree if she was aware that she needed to report income from stock sales in the year the sale was made,and pree responded that she was aware.furthermore,pree acknowledged her stock sales income in a declaration to the casino in which she indicated income in the amount of from retirement,stock sales and social security.
similarly,the jury was entitled to disbelieve pree testimony that she did not understand the law related to capital gains income.see agostino,at the jury has the choice to disbelieve the defendant testimony regarding her intent.the government pree had been informed of her obligation to report income,that she had admitted understanding that obligation and that she acknowledged her stock sales income in another sufficient to support her convictions 
admission of the summary evidence 
at trial,agent welch testified as a summary witness for the government.the government also established his qualifications before the jury.during his testimony,government exhibit,summarizing pree stock sales during,and,and government exhibit,calculating pree gross income,were offered into evidence.pree submits that the court improperly admitted agent welch testimony because agent welch exceeded his role as a summary witness.pree also argues that the errors in his testimony were compounded by the district court failure to give a cautionary instruction regarding the summary evidence.at trial,counsel for pree raised no objection either to agent welch testimony or to the lack of a cautionary instruction regarding the summary evidence.
standard of review 
this court reviews for plain error the admission of evidence to which an objection was not made at trial.united states williams,cir see also united states beall,cir indicating that review of admissibility of irs agent expert testimony would normally occur under abuse of discretion but reviewing under plain error standard for lack of an objection at trial.b efore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the error affected substantial rights,that the outcome probably would have been different without the error.united states colvin,cir citing olano,at.
agent welch testimony 
it is that t he nature of a summary witness testimony requires that he draw conclusions from the evidence presented at trial.united states esser,cir.when a summary witness simply testifies as to what the government evidence shows,he does not testify as an expert witness.see united states swanquist,cir.
pree primary complaint with agent welch testimony is that agent welch concluded from the evidence presented that pree possessed a zero basis in her stock.we already have determined,however,that this was a permissible inference in light of the government evidence.that evidence showed that pree received the stock as compensation,that the stock was restricted,which meant that it only could be sold in private transactions,and that its worth was limited to what pree could obtain in the market she created.one plausible inference from the irregular nature of pree sales was that,prior to those transactions,the stock lacked ascertainable value.accordingly,agent welch was entitled to treat pree basis as zero both in his testimony and in the summaries he prepared.see esser,at noting that summary witness testimony was properly admitted in a tax evasion case when the evidence was sufficient and the witness relied only on that evidence and was available for full.
pree contends,however,that agent welch exceeded his role as a summary witness and provided inadmissible expert testimony in the guise of a summary witness.we believe agent welch primarily testified within his role as a summary witness.however,we acknowledge that,in such a case as the present,where an irs revenue agent summarizes the evidence for purposes of establishing the tax consequences,the line between summary testimony and expert testimony is indistinct.given the assistance such an individual can provide to the jury,it has not been unusual in previous cases for an irs agent to testify as an expert summary witness.see united states moore,cir united states mohney,cir united states bosch,cir united states dotson,cir,vacated in part on reh,cir see also united states benson,cir kanne,dissenting a summary witness need not necessarily be an expert,but experts in accounting and other disciplines regularly give summary evidence of the sort envisioned by federal rule of evidence.citing louisell mueller,federal evidence,at,mandate recalled and amended by cir.as a summary witness,an irs agent may testify as to the agent analysis of the transaction which may necessarily stem from the testimony of other witnesses.the agent may also explain his analysis of the facts based on his special expertise.moore,at.as an expert witness,an irs agent opinion as to the proper tax consequences of a transaction is admissible evidence.united states windfelder,cir.similarly,an irs expert analysis of the transaction itself,which necessarily precedes his or her evaluation of the tax consequences,is also admissible evidence.id.
here,agent welch analyzed the stock sales and described the income tax consequences.although he was not proffered as an expert witness,his qualifications were in evidence.those qualifications included eighteen years of service with the irs as a revenue agent,a bachelor degree in accounting and a master degree in taxation.while employed by the irs,he completed additional classes in taxation,specialized training and continuing professional education.at the time of trial,he had conducted approximately two hundred tax audits and had reviewed several thousand audits of other revenue agents.agent welch was therefore qualified to express an opinion as to the proper tax consequences of a transaction and of the transaction itself,which necessarily precedes his evaluation of the tax consequences.id.at.
pree further contends that agent welch testimony was inadmissible to the extent that he stepped into the role of an expert because he failed to use a recognized means of valuation of restricted stock.agent welch testified that the stock had no fair market value by virtue of the restriction because it could not be sold in a brokerage house.admittedly,agent welch statements to this effect were somewhat imprecise.restricted stock does not lack value,per se,because it can not be sold on the public market.see rul,at.had pree raised an objection to agent welch testimony,on the ground that it constituted unreliable expert testimony,the district court would have undertaken the gatekeeping analysis pree now recommends to this court.see daubert merrell dow,d see also united states conn,cir indicating,in reference to a witness who was not proffered as an expert but testified in that role,that h ad the defense had other concerns about the quality of the agent training,the quantity of his experience,or the methodology that he employed in reaching his assessment of the defendant firearms,it could have raised those questions during voir dire.
in the absence of an objection by pree to agent welch testimony as unreliable expert testimony,however,we do not perceive plain error.the conclusion that pree basis in the stock should be treated as zero was supported by sufficient evidence.moreover,pree counsel had an opportunity to agent welch as to his conclusions regarding the value of the stock.see united states gonzalez,cir indicating that any questions or problems concerning the expert opinion and testimony may be thoroughly explored during the of the expert witness.
pree also challenges agent welch testimony as outside his area of expertise and improperly selective.we find no error on these grounds.first,agent welch testimony did not fall outside his area of expertise in violation of our holding in benson.in benson,we held that an irs agent opinion as to whether the defendant was entitled to social security benefits was outside the agent area of expertise and thus not admissible as expert testimony.see id.at.unlike the testimony at issue in benson,agent welch testimony dealt directly with the tax consequences of pree stock sale transactions and the necessary underlying analysis of those transactions.see windfelder,at.
second,agent welch did not make impermissible credibility determinations on the issue of whether pree received the stock as a gift or as compensation.rather,agent welch permissibly relied upon the government abundant evidence that pree received her stock as compensation.see moore,at perhaps,his testimony was selective but that is why cross examination is allowed.moreover,i f a witness expertise would be helpful to the jury,and the facts which he recounts fall within his area of expertise,then there is nothing improper about a selective summary.id.internal citation omitted.agent welch possessed specialized knowledge of the tax consequences at issue and the evidence necessary to prove the indictment.the facts he recounted fell within his area of expertise.thus,there was nothing improper as to his selective summary of the government evidence.it is true that,at one point,agent welch mistakenly testified that the transfer agent had said the stock had no value however,pree counsel had an adequate opportunity to conduct following that testimony.agent welch mistaken recollection does not create plain error in the admission of his testimony.
as a final response to pree various challenges to agent welch testimony,we emphasize pree ample opportunity to and to present her own evidence.pree counsel elicited from agent welch an explanation of capital gain as a net figure.consistent with the defense theory,counsel then explored the computation of gift basis and capital gains and losses from the sale of gifts with agent welch.counsel also attempted to explore agent welch conclusions as to the fair market value of the stock when pree received it,but counsel then abandoned the on this point.pree also had an opportunity to present evidence as to her basis and to the proper valuation of the stock.given these opportunities,we conclude that no plain error occurred in the district court admission of agent welch testimony.w here,as here,the defense conducted a thorough cross examination of the witness concerning the disputed matters,and also had the opportunity to present its own version of those matters,the likelihood of any error in admitting summary evidence diminishes.united states norton,cir.
summary charts 
pree also challenges the admission of government exhibits and without a limiting instruction as plainly erroneous.other courts have held that a cautionary instruction should be given when summary evidence is admitted.see,united states bishop,cir noting previously approved instructions that summaries do not,of themselves,constitute evidence in the case but only purport to summarize the documented and detailed evidence already submitted,and a witness summary is not the evidence,the evidence is the documents themselves that he has been referring to.we ourselves have indicated that,when summary charts are introduced into evidence as a teaching device rather than as substantive evidence,the preferred practice is to give a limiting instruction regarding this purpose.united states doerr,cir quoting united states howard,cir.
no such instructions were given here rather,a pattern instruction was given with regard to the summary evidence that stated that the summaries truly and accurately summarize the content of voluminous books,records or documents,and should be considered together with and in the same way as all other evidence in the case.the committee on federal criminal jury instructions for the seventh circuit advises that this instruction should only be given when the accuracy and authenticity of the exhibits are not in question.pattern criminal federal jury instructions for the seventh circuit.the accuracy of government exhibits and were not challenged at trial.although the preferred practice with respect to summary evidence is to issue an appropriate cautionary instruction,under the circumstances here,the admission of the summary evidence without such a limiting instruction was not plain error.see also swanquist,at indicating that the defendant had an opportunity during to elicit facts suggesting the inaccuracy of summary charts and noting that a party is not obligated to include within its charts or summaries its opponent version of the facts.
jury instructions 
pree submits that the district court should have instructed the jury on the computation of capital gains income.she failed to request this instruction at trial,however.when a party neither requests an instruction nor objects to the court failure to give it,this court reviews for plain error the failure to give the instruction.see united states gee,cir.reversal is proper only if the instructions as a whole are insufficient to inform the jury correctly of the applicable law and the jury is thereby misled.united states madoch,cir.
as a preliminary matter,we note the government argument that pree waived,not merely forfeited,an objection to the jury instructions.a waiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right and precludes appellate review.united states griffin,cir quoting johnson zerbst.waiver extinguishes any error.see id.a waiver operative force depends upon the context in which it is made and its precise character.id.the right to object to jury instructions on appeal is waived if the record illustrates that the defendant approved of the instructions at issue.id.
in griffin,this court found that the defendant waived an objection to the given jury instruction because the defendants counsel noted that the defendants would prefer,the instruction at issue on appeal.id.in this case,pree counsel approved the instruction regarding the elements of the offense,suggesting a modification to clarify only which count of the indictment was involved.however,unlike the defendant in griffin,pree is not requesting plain error review of an instruction she previously approved.rather,pree is arguing that an instruction should have been given that she failed to request.such circumstances do not present waiver but dictate plain error review.see gee,at.
pree contends that the district court failure to instruct on the computation of capital gains removed from the jury consideration one of the elements of the offense,namely falsity as to a material matter.falsity as to a material matter is an element of a prosecution.see united states peters,cir.a false statement is material when it has the potential for hindering the irs efforts to monitor and verify the tax liability of the taxpayer.id.quoting united states greenberg,cir.
although the district court did not instruct on the computation of capital gains income,it specifically did instruct the jury that it must find falsity as to a material matter to sustain the charge that the defendant willfully made and caused to be made a false individual income tax return as charged in counts and,the government must prove the following propositions the income tax return was false as to a material matter,as charged in the count.the court also charged the jury as follows 
a line on a tax return is a material matter if the information required to be reported on that line is capable of influencing the correct computation of the amount of tax liability of the individual or the verification of the accuracy of the return.
if you find that the defendant willfully understated the amount of total income on her individual tax return,and if you find that the amount of gross receipts on a tax return is essential to a correct computation of the amount of taxable income or tax or to the verification of that return,then you may find that the false and fraudulent statements were false as to a material matter.
these instructions were fully adequate as to the element of material falsity.the instructions together with the indictment required the jury to determine whether the amount of total income reported on line was false on the and tax returns.line is undoubtedly a material matter.such instructions more than adequately encompass the element of material falsity.united states fernandez,cir declining to find plain error in jury instructions which did not include instruction on materiality but,viewed in their entirety,encompassed the concept of materiality.both parties had ample opportunity to argue how the facts of pree stock sales applied to the element of material falsity.
additionally,the substantive direction that a capital gains instruction would have provided was already before the jury.pree counsel of agent welch clarified that income from the sale of stock was a net figure calculated from the seller cost basis and the sales amount.the highlighted the fact that pree only was required to report net gain as income.thus,the relevance of capital gain to the element of material falsity was presented to the jury.
as a final matter,we note that,in the closing argument,pree counsel chose to emphasize lack of proof that pree willfully misreported her income,not absence of proof of capital gain.when the jury instructions actually given as a whole treat a case fairly and accurately,a defendant is not prejudiced by a district court failure to give a particular instruction,and under such circumstances we will not disturb the jury instructions on appeal.united states manjarrez,cir quoting united states koster,cir.the jury instructions given treated the case against pree and her defense fairly and accurately.there was no plain error in the court failure to sua sponte instruct on the calculation of capital gain.
sentencing 
the district court determined pree sentence under the united states sentencing guidelines.the court found that the total amount of tax loss was,which resulted in a base offense level of.see h.the court added a enhancement based on its finding that pree had obstructed justice.see.a final offense level of and a criminal history category of i resulted in a sentencing range of to months imprisonment.the district court sentenced pree to months in prison.in addition,the district court ordered pree to serve a period of supervised release,with the special condition that she pay taxes owed to the irs in the amount of 
pree did not challenge the constitutionality of her sentence before the district court or to this court in her original briefs on appeal.nonetheless,in light of the sea change in federal sentencing law wrought by united states booker,d,and this circuit precedent prior to booker,we believe it unfair to characterize pree as having waived a challenge to the validity of her sentence.therefore,we invited each party to submit a memorandum presenting its views regarding the application of booker to this case,which they have done.in these circumstances,both parties submit that our review should be for plain error.we agree.
under the plain error test,before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.united states cotton,d quoting johnson united states,d.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting johnson,at.
the government concedes that the district court committed error that was plain in treating the guidelines as mandatory and enhancing pree sentencing range based on the court findings of fact.the government submits,however,that pree can not show that the error affected her substantial rights because she can not establish that she would have received a different sentence had the district court treated the guidelines as advisory,rather than mandatory.the government also contends that pree can not show that the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding because judicial findings by a preponderance of the evidence are reliable and defendants have been sentenced under the guidelines for eighteen years with the approval of the federal courts.moreover,the government submits that pree sentence of months fell within the to months sentencing range that would have applied had her offense level not been enhanced.
pree,in turn,submits that,because she has completed her enhanced prison term,remand of that aspect of her sentence is not necessary.however,she contends that,in light of booker,the district court plainly erred by ordering her to pay the irs taxes amounting to as a condition of her supervised release based solely upon the court findings of fact.pree requests that we vacate this condition of her supervised release and remand this case to the district court for reconsideration of the terms and conditions of her supervised release 
pree restitution obligation was imposed as a condition of her supervised release under the terms of the following sentencing guideline 
restitution 
a in the case of an identifiable victim,the court shall 
impose a term of probation or supervised release with a condition requiring restitution for the full amount of the victim loss,if the offense is not an offense for which restitution is authorized under a but otherwise meets the criteria for an order of restitution under that section.
we explained in united states george,cir,that 
the contention that booker requires juries rather than judges to assess restitution is misguided.there is no statutory maximum for restitution indeed,it is not a criminal punishment but instead is a civil remedy administered for convenience by courts that have entered criminal convictions,see united states bach,cir united states newman,cir,so the sixth amendment does not apply.we have accordingly held that apprendi new jersey,does not affect restitution,see united states behrman,cir,and that conclusion is equally true for booker.
however,george does not deal with the issue that confronts us here.we are not concerned here,as we were in george,with whether the particular requirements of restitution can be set by a judge or must be determined by a jury.rather,here we are confronted with the antecedent question of whether restitution in any amount should have been imposed as a condition of supervised release.the sentencing court,realizing that its decision was not governed by any explicit statutory command,grounded its decision solely in the sentencing guideline set forth earlier.because the court acted prior to the advent of booker,it believed that the guideline mandated the imposition of restitution on the condition of supervised release.under our precedent,this misapprehension on the part of the trial court warrants our intervention.this is because our cases hold that the mandatory application of the guidelines itself,absent sixth amendment error,can amount to plain error in light of booker.see united states white,cir,united states schlifer,cir.
on this record we can not be certain whether the district court would have imposed the condition of restitution upon pree supervised release had it understood the guidelines to be advisory,rather than mandatory.for that reason,we believe it appropriate,while retaining jurisdiction,to direct a limited remand in pree case for proceedings consistent with our circuit recent decision in paladino,at.see white,at applying remand due to mandatory application of the guidelines and noting that,with regard to the fourth prong of plain error,we can and have predetermined that if the defendant has been prejudiced by an illegal sentence,then allowing that illegal sentence to stand would constitute a miscarriage of justice.citing paladino,at united states pawlinski,cir.
conclusion 
accordingly,while retaining jurisdiction,we remand this case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion and this court decision in paladino,at.
it is so ordered.
prior to this court decision vacating pree sentence,she had completed her term of incarceration and had begun serving her term of supervised release.this court directed that any matter with respect to bail should be addressed to the district court.the government filed an unopposed motion requesting that the district court place pree on bond with the same conditions that were in place prior to her reporting to the bureau of prisons.the district court granted this motion.

pree received the stock in and.thus,the issue of whether her initial receipt of the stock from furlong constituted taxable income is not relevant in this appeal,which deals with pree tax liability for and.
