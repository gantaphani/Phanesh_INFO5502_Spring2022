this case presents the question of whether minnesota law authorized the metropolitan airports commission mac to impose an percent gross revenue fee on certain rental car companies doing business at the.paul metropolitan airport airport.upon full review,we find that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that mac exceeded its statutory authority by imposing the fee.
enterprise leasing company is a minnesota corporation doing business as enterprise enterprise.mac is a public corporation chartered by the state of minnesota to manage commercial aviation services at the airport.minnesota law empowers mac to enact ordinances for the purpose of managing and operating the airport.see,subd.
in,mac enacted ordinance,which is the subject of this case.the ordinance requires that all rental car companies pay mac a fee equal to percent of their gross receipts for transactions occurring on airport property.enterprise is an agency subject to the fee.ordinance is not applicable to rental car companies,but those companies also pay mac a fee equal to percent of their gross revenues,as well as rental fees based on the amount of airport space they occupy.
ordinance was the predecessor to ordinance.that ordinance imposed an annual permit fee,plus a fee,on all ground transportation vehicles using designated commercial lanes.in,an exclusive roadway was opened for such vehicles to pick up and drop off passengers at the airport.ordinance was intended to recover the actual capital and operating cost of that roadway and its related facilities.prior to enacting ordinance,mac researched commercial vehicles use of the airport and calculated the fee to recover the cost of those vehicles use of airport resources.mac cost analysis included investigating the daily volume of commercial vehicles at the airport,researching user fees at similar airports,and conducting a series of informational meetings with members of the commercial ground transportation industry.
ordinance also served as a litmus test of mac statutory authority to impose airport user fees.in hyland metropolitan airports comm n,hyland i,the court held that statutes creating and governing mac authorized it to charge fees to commercial vehicles picking up and dropping off passengers at the airport.
in november,growing airport traffic and a billion airport expansion project prompted mac to explore ways to increase airport revenue.mac staff proposed a new commercial vehicle ordinance as a means to that end.believing that all rental car companies had access to the same airport market,mac staff recommended that rental car companies be assessed a user fee that was comparable to the fees paid by such companies at other national airports,and established at a rate similar to that paid by companies.mac then commissioned a study that addressed four factors fees charged to rental car companies by other major airports in the nation rationales asserted by other airports to justify such fees potential increase in revenue that mac could anticipate from a change in fee structure and recommendations for implementing a new fee structure.ultimately,mac proposed a new fee structure whereby rental car companies would pay a user fee equal to percent of their gross revenues 
prior to its enactment,mac held public meetings and solicited public comment concerning ordinance.at a public hearing on november,enterprise was among the rental car companies voicing the opinion that although companies should pay a fair share,they should not pay the same fee as the companies because companies do not receive the same services as those whose business is conducted on airport property.enterprise suggested that a fee in the range of to percent was more appropriate than an percent fee.mac defended the percent figure on grounds that companies pay in excess of million a year beyond the percentage of sales fees,which means that even with ordinance,companies would not pay the same overall fees as companies based on airport property.mac enacted ordinance,effective may,with the percent fee.
enterprise brought suit in the united states district court for the district of minnesota,alleging that the fee imposed under ordinance violated the minnesota and united states constitutions and exceeded mac authority under state law.specifically,enterprise claimed that the fee constituted an impermissible tax,and in the alternative,it violated minnesota statute section.
mac moved for summary judgment on all of enterprise claims and enterprise for partial summary judgment on its statutory claim.the district court granted mac motion as to all of enterprise constitutional claims.however,the court granted enterprise motion on its claim under section see enterprise leasing metropolitan airports comm n,d.
we review de novo questions of state law decided by the district court.see john marion indep.sch,cir.the minnesota courts have not interpreted section as it relates to the issue in this case.where the meaning of a state agency authorizing legislation is not explicit,the court gives deference to the agency interpretation.see.mcafee department of revenue,finding that an agency interpretation of a statute is entitled to consideration and that such consideration increases when the agency is construing a statute it administers and its construction is longstanding.however,an agency interpretation does not preclude a different construction by the courts.see gust minnesota of natural.
the issue before us is whether the district court erred in finding that mac violated minnesota statute section when it levied a fee equal to percent of rental car companies gross revenues.
mac has broad statutory authority and discretion to manage the airport in the public best interest.see.ann.enumerating powers and conferring upon mac all the powers as a body corporate necessary and convenient to accomplish the objects and perform the duties prescribed by statute hyland metropolitan airport comm n,hyland ii the minnesota legislature has delegated to mac broad statutory authority to improve,maintain,operate,and manage airports in a manner which will,in mac opinion,further the interest of aeronautics in the state of minnesota.minnesota law specifically grants mac the authority to assess fees on airport users,providing that 
mac shall have the authority to determine the charges for the use of any of the property under its management and control,and the terms and conditions under which such property may be used.where there is reasonable basis for classification of users as to any use,mac may classify users,but charges as to each class shall be reasonable and uniform for such use,and established with due regard to the value of the property and improvements used and the expense of operation to mac.
ann.emphasis added.
the district court found that mac failed to give due regard to the value of the property and improvements used by rental car companies and the expense of operation to mac.according to the district court,section required mac to consider the specific airport resources companies actually use.because mac considered the value of customer market generated by the entire airport when it created the new fee structure,the district court concluded that mac exceeded its statutory authority and granted summary judgment in favor of enterprise.
two primary factors framed the district court analysis.first,the court opined that hyland strictly construed section,such that mac may only impose on rental car companies user fees that reflect a direct link to the cost of the specific roadways and facilities those companies actually use to service their customers.second,the court was unpersuaded by case law that embraces the notion that rental car companies benefit from,and therefore use,the market created by an entire airport facility.
we find the district court analysis to be overly narrow and its statutory interpretation legal error.our analysis leads to the conclusion that mac was within its broad discretionary authority under section when it considered the entire airport facility in developing ordinance.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment.
one of our basic concerns is the district court understanding that the statutory interpretation of section is controlled by hyland i.the district court determined that i n hyland i,the court appeared to adopt a more narrow interpretation of the phrase property and improvements used,including only the specific commercial roadways and other facilities actually used by ground transportation companies within its definition.enterprise,d at.we find this is a misreading of hyland i and that the district court afforded it undue weight in evaluating the instant case.
in hyland i,the minnesota court of appeals found that section authorized mac to impose the ordinance fee,which was designed to recover costs directly associated with the use of commercial ground transportation roadways and facilities.at.according to the court,the cost recovery purpose of ordinance and the fee to achieve it were squarely within mac purview and patently reasonable under section.see id.
although hyland i stands for the proposition that mac may recover direct costs under section,it goes too far to suggest that it circumscribes mac discretion to consider other factors when calculating user fees we find nothing in the statutory language or in hyland i to support such a narrow interpretation.to the contrary,as we have discussed,mac authorizing legislation bestows upon it broad authority to manage and fund the airport.the decision in hyland i was limited to mac authority to recover direct costs because ordinance was designed to recover direct costs.however,ordinance differs significantly from the ordinance before us.
the scope of ordinance is broader than its predecessor because it is aimed toward a broader goal.additional revenue is needed to fund the billion airport expansion project,msp.mac rationalized that the benefits flowing from the airport expansion would greatly increase the number of customers to which all rental car companies have access.the goals of ordinance and mac rationale in calculating the fee structure fully complement mac mandate to operate the airport in a manner and its broad discretion to charge fees to airport users.see a.ann,subd.
in fulfilling our duty to forecast how the minnesota supreme court would likely interpret section,we consider relevant state precedent.see mccallum rosen diversified,cir en banc.in doing so,we are not obligated to defer to the district court interpretation of that precedent.see id.contrary to the district court,we find that hyland i is distinguishable and that its application of section to ordinance is not controlling in this case.
we also disagree with the district court rejection of the widely accepted idea that airport users benefit from the existence of an entire airport facility.
the basic issue of airport valuation is not novel.it has been addressed by other courts,albeit under different legal principles and statutes that are similar,but not identical,to section.the vast majority of authorities that have considered the question embrace the notion that commercial entities in a very real sense use an entire airport and the market it generates.absent statutory language to the contrary,this widely accepted principle guides our interpretation of section.
the district court rejected as persuasive authority delta airlines,d,and its progeny,which generally find under a commerce clause analysis that airport user fees may be premised on the value of an entire airport market.specifically,the district court found these cases inapposite because they are predicated on the benefit conferred language articulated in the court reasoned that a more restrictive interpretation was warranted in the instant case because section requires mac to consider the value of the property and improvements used,not the benefits conferred upon the user.
the district court also distinguished authorities from other jurisdictions that have embraced a statutory interpretation allowing airport authorities to consider the value of an entire airport market when assessing airport user fees.the court reasoned that the relevant question is not whether courts in other jurisdictions have upheld gross receipts fees similar to those assessed under ordinance,but whether the more restrictive language of section permits such an assessment.enterprise,d at.
notwithstanding the district court steadfast reliance on the terminology set forth in section,it also recognized that the statute does not define with any specificity the method or methods that mac permissibly may apply in order to value the property used,and found that the legislature intended to confer upon mac the discretion to apply any method of valuation that is reasonable.id.at.moreover,the district court acknowledged that the value of airport property used for commercial purposes is affected by its proximity to the market of consumers that the airport generates.id.
we find that the constitutional cases cited by mac are not dispositive of the issue at bar,but do inform our analysis.those courts that have rejected commerce clause challenges to various airport user fees generally hold that rental car companies benefit from the very existence of an airport and the market it generates,not just those parts of the airport the companies actually use although the commerce clause cases turn on a different legal principle,we can not ignore the broader notion they embrace that commercial users of an airport benefit from the entire facility.
it also is instructive to examine other states laws that empower local airport authorities to levy fees on airport users.for instance,louisiana law contains statutory language identical to section in that it authorizes the local airport authority to charge rental car companies fees which are reasonable and uniform for the same class of privilege or service and established with due regard to the property and improvements used and the expense of operation to the authority.ann.b.however,the louisiana statute goes on to require that such fees be based upon the cost to the airport of the particular facilities or services used by such nontenant,auto rental user.id.at d.by virtue of paragraph d,louisiana law specifically circumscribes the airport authority power to assess fees based on the particular airport resources used by rental car companies located off airport property.minnesota law,by contrast,contains no similar limiting language.
other states that allocate broad statutory authority for local airport authorities to charge user fees generally find that rental car companies benefit from the existence of the entire airport and may be charged accordingly the common denominator in these cases is the idea that airport maintenance and construction is undertaken for airline passengers,who in turn are customers for all rental car companies.
consistent with the broad scope of the statutory language at issue and with those authorities that have examined airport valuation in other contexts,we find that section allowed mac to consider the value of the entire airport in developing the ordinance fee.
in making the assessment that ordinance is authorized by section,we also find that mac gave due regard to the value of property and improvements used by rental car companies.the statute does not define the term due regard except to the extent that it specifies to what mac must give such regard the value of the property and improvements used and the expense of operation.see.ann.when a term is undefined,minnesota law directs that we construe the term according to its common and approved usage.black defines due regard as c onsideration in a degree appropriate to demands of the particular case.black law dictionary ed.this definition tells us that some measure of discretion is inherent in the phrase due regard.see commonwealth of virginia marshall,cir agreeing that due regard does not mean deference.such discretion is also apparent from the context of the enabling legislation in which section occurs.see bailey united states,d considering the context in which statutory language occurs as a factor in ascertaining the meaning of its terms.to effectuate section,the legislature granted mac all the powers as a body corporate necessary
