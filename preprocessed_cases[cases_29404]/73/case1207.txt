tuttle filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to enforce the discharge she received on confirmation of her plan and to prohibit the irs from collecting the gap interest.the bankruptcy court denied tuttle motion,reluctantly concluding,based on tenth circuit precedent,that gap interest on the irs priority claim was not discharged by confirmation of the debtor plan and that the irs was not estopped from trying to collect the interest.app.at.in reaching this conclusion,the bankruptcy court emphasized that,absent existing tenth circuit precedent,it would have ruled in favor of tuttle.on appeal,the bap agreed with the bankruptcy court that,under tenth circuit precedent,the gap interest owed to the irs wa s not dischargeable,but rather tuttle remain ed personally liable for the gap interest.id.at.
in our review of bap decisions,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision.in re albrecht,cir.where,as here,t here are no factual disputes and the issues on appeal pertain to the proper application of bankruptcy statutes and the interpretation of case law,our review is de novo.id.
tuttle contends the bap and the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that gap interest was not discharged upon confirmation of her chapter plan and that she remains personally liable for the gap interest.although tuttle concedes that the bap and the bankruptcy court followed tenth circuit precedent,she contends that precedent should be rejected either as dicta or as inconsistent with the intent of the bankruptcy code.aplt.br.at.in tuttle view,gap interest in a chapter proceeding is an integral part of a priority tax claim,and if the allowed claim is paid in full under a plan,the gap interest should be considered paid as well.id.at.
in addressing tuttle arguments,we begin by reviewing how irs claims for unpaid taxes are treated in chapter bankruptcy proceedings.like other creditors,the irs has the right to file a claim in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding to seek repayment of unpaid taxes.if the irs has a n unsecured claim for taxes for which the return was due within three years before the bankruptcy petition was filed,the claim enjoys eighth priority under a a i and is nondischargeable in bankruptcy under a a.young united states,d see also d providing that confirmation of a chapter plan does not discharge an individual debtor from liability for priority tax claims.as part of its claim against the bankruptcy estate,the irs may also seek interest and penalties,in re bates,cir interest has the same priority as the underlying tax providing the interest accrued.depending on the terms of a confirmed chapter plan,the irs may also receive interest on its priority tax claims.see a c.
at issue here is whether the irs may also collect,interest,gap interest on the irs priority tax claims.like other creditors in bankruptcy proceedings,the irs is generally precluded from including unmatured interest as part of its claim.specifically,b of the bankruptcy code provides that unmatured interest can not be allowed as a claim against the bankruptcy estate.b.the purpose of this rule is to ensure convenient administration of cases and equity in distribution.united states victor,cir.more specifically,t he rule makes it possible to calculate the amount of claims easily and assures that creditors at the bottom rungs of the priority ladder are not prejudiced by the delays inherent in liquidation and distribution of the estate.in re hanna,cir.therefore,interest generally can not be included in a chapter plan.stacy united states.
the irs asserts that,because priority tax claims are nondischargeable in chapter proceedings,the debtor remains personally responsible for accruing gap interest.in support of its assertion,the irs points to bruning united states,d,a code case,as well as various decisions applying bruning to cases governed by the bankruptcy code.
in bruning,the supreme court interpreted the provisions of the bankruptcy act of and held that,following discharge in bankruptcy,a debtor remained personally liable for interest that accrued on an unpaid,nondischargeable tax debt.in reaching this conclusion,the court began by noting that of the act provided that a debtor remained personally liable after his discharge for that part of the principal amount of the tax debt and prepetition interest not satisfied out of the bankruptcy estate.id.at.the court then assumed,based upon the general rule set forth in,that congress also intended personal liability to continue as to the interest on that debt as well as to its principal amount.id.in particular,the court noted that i n most situations,interest wa s considered to be the cost of the use of the amounts owing a creditor and an incentive to prompt repayment and,thus,an integral part of a continuing debt.id.the court rejected the notion that a debtor faced with interest on a tax debt was aided by the principle that one main purpose of the bankruptcy act is to let the honest debtor begin his financial life anew.id.at.in fact,the court noted,wa s not a compassionate section for debtors,but instead demonstrate d congressional judgment that certain,those of financing o de the value of giving the debtor a wholly fresh start.id.finally,the court rejected the debtor assertion that the traditional rule which denie d interest as a claim against the bankruptcy estate also applie d to discharge the debtor from personal liability for such interest.id.at.according to the court,the basic reasons for the rule denying interest as a claim against the bankruptcy estate,avoidance of unfairness as between competing creditors and the avoidance of administrative inconvenience were inapplicable to an action brought against the debtor personally.id.at.
although the parties dispute whether the provisions of the bankruptcy code,in particular the unique provisions of chapter,mandate a different result than reached in bruning,they agree that this court has adopted the bruning rationale in two chapter cases victor,at holding,in chapter case involving secured claim asserted by the irs,that interest that accrues on a nondischargeable tax debt is an integral part of an underlying tax claim and is generally treated the same as the original claim,and in re fullmer,cir holding,in context of chapter proceeding,that i nterest that accrues postpetition on a nondischargeable prepetition tax debt survives bankruptcy as a personal liability,abrogated on other grounds,raleigh illinois of revenue,d
