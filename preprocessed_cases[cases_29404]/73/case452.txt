in an action to determine the federal tax liability of the estate of birnie davenport,the tax court held that the estate was liable for the unpaid gift tax on gifts of stock made by birnie davenport to her two nephews,gordon davenport and charles botefuhr,and her niece,patricia vestal.because the estate did not pay the tax,the government now seeks to collect it from gordon davenport under the provisions of the internal revenue code imposing liability for an unpaid gift tax on the transferee of the gift.the district court held that gordon davenport was not bound by the doctrine of res judicata to certain key determinations made by the tax court.because we agree with the government that this case involves the same nucleus of operative facts as the proceeding in the tax court,and that as a result res judicata applies,the district court judgment is reversed.
factual and procedural background 
birnie and elizabeth davenport,who were sisters,lived together much of their adult lives.over many years,the two sisters commingled all of their earnings and assets.pursuant to a oral agreement between the two,elizabeth davenport held legal title to the assets,but the sisters shared equally in the profits and losses of their investments.they considered all of their assets to be jointly owned,and their income tax returns filed over many years reflected this belief.each of the sisters filed a separate income tax return in which she reported her earnings from her job and an equal share of profits and losses from the joint investments.the irs accepted this split of investment income and expenses throughout numerous audits between and.
the sisters investments included stock in hondo drilling company.at the time of elizabeth davenport death in,the sisters owned shares of hondo stock.the sisters had two nephews,gordon davenport and charles botefuhr,and one niece,patricia vestal.gordon davenport,botefuhr,and vestal were appointed of elizabeth davenport estate 
in july,slightly more than six months after her sister death,using two conveyance methods,birnie davenport transferred half shares of the hondo stock to her niece and nephews.first,she transferred shares to gordon davenport and shares to vestal through installment sale agreements,with the stock being valued in the agreements at per share birnie davenport reported the installment sales on her income tax return and indicated on that form that the sales were to related parties second,birnie davenport transferred shares to botefuhr as an outright gift.in a signed family agreement,botefuhr promised to file the appropriate gift tax return that would report the gift made by birnie davenport and to pay on her behalf the gift taxes associated with his gift.botefuhr did not fulfill this responsibility.in july,hondo drilling company redeemed botefuhr shares at per share 
birnie davenport died in.gordon davenport,vestal,and botefuhr were appointed as personal representatives of her estate.while preparing birnie davenport estate tax return in,corrine childs,the davenport sisters tax attorney,learned that botefuhr had not filed the gift tax return or paid the taxes as promised.when vestal and gordon davenport filed the estate tax return,they filed a gift tax return reporting the gift to botefuhr at per share.the estate paid a gift tax of with the return.botefuhr did not sign either the gift tax return or the estate tax return.
in the irs initiated an audit of birnie davenport estate tax return and gift tax return and ultimately determined that birnie davenport gift of hondo stock to botefuhr should have been valued at per share rather than per share.the large discrepancy in values created a correspondingly large gift tax deficiency,which birnie davenport estate contested in tax court.see estate of davenport comm r,cch.one issue before the tax court was whether birnie davenport made a completed gift to gordon davenport,vestal,and botefuhr.id.at.the tax court held that even though birnie davenport did not have legal title at the time of the transfers,she did effect inter vivos gifts to gordon davenport,vestal,and botefuhr of the hondo stock,which the tax court valued at per share id.at.a second issue before the tax court was whether the statute of limitations barred the government from recovering the gift tax due.the tax court held that the statute of limitations did not bar assessment of gift tax liability because with respect to each of the transfers,the limitations period started running on november,when vestal and gordon davenport filed birnie davenport gift tax return.id.at.in accordance with its findings,the court calculated the tax deficiency owed by the estate the tenth circuit affirmed the tax court decision.estate of davenport comm r,cir holding that birnie davenport had a sufficient ownership interest in the hondo stock to effect inter vivos transfers of it and that birnie davenport completed gifts during july to her two nephews and niece.
despite the tax court decision,the estate did not pay the taxes owed.because the tax court lacks the authority to enforce its judgments,the government filed the current action in the northern district of oklahoma against the estate and all three cousins to reduce to judgment the estate liability and the donees liability as transferees pursuant to b.see united states estate of davenport,d.the estate conceded liability.id.the government also sought individual liability against the three cousins in their capacity as pursuant to for allegedly making improper distributions from the estate before paying the federal tax liabilities.id.the district court dismissed the claim.id.
although gordon davenport and botefuhr contested jurisdiction,the district court overruled their motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.id.at.on appeal,the tenth circuit held that the oklahoma district court did not have jurisdiction over botefuhr and gordon davenport after dismissing the claim.united states botefuhr,cir.
the case was remanded to the oklahoma district court,which transferred botefuhr case to the western district of texas and gordon davenport case to the southern district of texas.the case before this panel involves solely gordon davenport appeal.
the southern district of texas ruled on multiple motions for summary judgment by gordon davenport and the government.first it determined that the statute of limitations barred assessment of the gift tax on the imputed gift arising from the july installment sale,but that the statute of limitations did not bar assessment of the gift to botefuhr.second,it held that although res judicata and collateral estoppel bound gordon davenport to the tax court finding that he was a donee,neither doctrine established the value of the gift to him the hondo stock or the amount of his liability.finally,the district court held that the government failed to provide any evidence on damages,an essential element of its claim,and it granted summary judgment against the government.the government now appeals.
ii.discussion 
the internal revenue code imposes tax liability on the transfer of property by gift.a.the definition of a gift includes transfers of property for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money worth.the donor,as the party who makes the gift,bears the primary responsibility for paying the gift tax.see c the tax imposed by shall be paid by the donor.when,as here,the donor dies before paying the gift tax owed,the personal representative of the estate is responsible for paying the tax out of the estate,as a debt against the donor estate.reg.the donee may also be held personally liable for the full amount of any unpaid gift tax pursuant to b although the donee liability is limited to the value of the gift he received from the donor,he may be forced to pay more than the gift tax attributable to his gift.b see also edward smith,mertens law of federal income taxation.thus,gordon davenport is liable for all the gift tax owed by the estate for,up to the value of the gift he received.
the government seeks to collect unpaid gift taxes owed by the birnie davenport estate from gordon davenport pursuant to the transferee liability provision
