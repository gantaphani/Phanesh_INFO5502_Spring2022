in denying ad hoc motion,the court of international trade concluded that while none of those entries were properly deemed liquidated under d,the united states customs service customs subsequent decision to acknowledge the deemed liquidation by posting a bulletin notice at the port of nogales became final and conclusive upon all persons under a,barring ad hoc claim.cemex,united states,d.int l trade cemex ii.

background 
between august,and july,sunbelt cement,entered gray portland cement produced by cemex and cementos de chihuahua from mexico into the united states through the ports of nogales,arizona los angeles,california san diego,california and el paso,texas.these entries were covered by an antidumping duty order on gray portland cement from mexico at the rate of percent ad valorem in effect during the second administrative review period.gray portland cement and clinker from mexico.after commerce concluded the second administrative review,setting a final dumping margin of percent ad valorem for the august,to july,entries second review entries,ad hoc brought an action challenging certain aspects of commerce final results.the court of international trade consolidated ad hoc action with a suit contesting the results of the second administrative review filed by cemex and,on october,enjoined liquidation of the second review entries under c pending resolution of the consolidated action.
following two remands to commerce,the court of international trade issued its final judgment on october,sustaining the percent ad valorem dumping margin for the second review entries calculated by commerce during the second remand.on december,the court of international trade again enjoined liquidation of those entries under c pending appeal to this court.we affirmed the final judgment of the court of international trade on january,and issued our mandate on march.the deadline for filing a petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court expired on april,lifting the suspension of liquidation.
on march,commerce instructed customs to liquidate the second review entries at the rate of percent ad valorem,thus implementing the percent ad valorem dumping margin calculated by commerce on second remand.commerce sent its instructions in an,which customs posted on a bulletin board used to inform the ports of liquidation instructions.the announced the immediate lifting of the suspension of liquidation for the second review entries and directed customs to assess antidumping liability at percent of the entered value for those entries.
between may and september,some two hundred second review entries at the ports of los angeles,san diego,and el paso were liquidated at the percent rate the second review entries at the port of nogales nogales entries,however,were not liquidated pursuant to the march,instructions.although gloria zapata quihuis,the import specialist at nogales responsible for entries of cement,reviewed the bulletin board daily,she did not see the march,message from commerce.when asked by the assistant port director for trade at the port of nogales to inquire as to the status of these entries,quihuis responded on january,
minoo hatten of the commerce department informs me that she found where the affirmed a remand in.she said it would take her two or three days to track down whether or not any liquidation instructions were issued.she thinks that no instructions were issued.once they find the information they will give me a call and let me know what the next step will be.she feels that at that point they will issue liquidation instructions.
on march,hatten sent a copy of the march,liquidation instructions to quihuis,stating p lease get back to me and let me know whether these instructions will enable you to liquidate the unliquidated entries.on march,thomas ede at customs headquarters informed quihuis that t he entries of gray portland cement and clinker from mexico covered by message of deem liquidated sic by action of law in september,and that t hese entries need to be liquidated as entered in acs.accordingly,on march,quihuis reported 
on march,i spoke to tom ede of headquarters oab.i explained the situation and informed him that the instructions had never been posted.he told me he would look into this.he called back and confirmed that the instructions had never been posted on the bulletin board.he told me that the entries were now considered deemed.he sent the attached instructions on liquidating the entries.entries for sunbelt cement for the above listed period have been liquidated no change and notation posted on notes in acs.
emphasis added.
on april,customs published a bulletin notice at the port of nogales bulletin notice,indicating that of the nogales entries had been deemed liquidated as of september,and that others had liquidated at no change.all entries were thus liquidated at the rate and amount of duties asserted by the importer upon entry,percent ad valorem.
ad hoc first learned that some of the second review entries had been liquidated as entered rather than at the final assessment rate upon filing a freedom of information act foia request with customs on february.ad hoc had filed the foia request to inquire as to amounts distributed for the second review entries under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of,the cdsoa or byrd amendment.the byrd amendment allows domestic producers with qualifying expenditures for a particular year to obtain a share of the antidumping duties collected by customs for that year.
customs responded by letter of september,forwarding four pages of the bulletin notice.on december,the domestic producers requested that customs reliquidate the entries consistent with the final judgment of the court of international trade,affirmed by this court in cemex finally,on april,ad hoc moved the court of international trade to enforce that judgment,requesting that the court direct liquidation of the nogales entries at the percent ad valorem final assessment rate.
ii.proceedings in the court of international trade 
in its august,order,the court of international trade determined that proper deemed liquidation had not been established for any of the nogales entries,as the march,instructions to customs were neither unambiguous nor public.see fujitsu,united states.while those instructions purported to constitute the immediate lifting of suspension,the period under c to file for writ of certiorari did not expire until april,the court of international trade stated here,the march,notice was not public,and it can not be said to be unambiguous where the suspension had not yet been lifted.cemex ii,d at.accordingly,the court held that the march,failed to trigger the deemed liquidation period under d.
turning next to the issue of what remedies may be available to ad hoc,the court of international trade observed that section d was meant to benefit importers the purpose of d is to give importers finality as to their duty obligations by providing for deemed liquidation at the rate claimed by the importers,unless actual liquidation occurred within specified time limits.id.at emphasis added citing int l trading united states,united states cherry hill textiles,the deemed liquidated provision of section was added to the customs laws in to place a limit on the period within which importers and sureties would be subject to the prospect of liability for a customs entry.accordingly,section d 
fits neatly into the customs protest of liquidation scheme.if a deemed liquidation or any liquidation is adverse to an importer,it has its protest remedies under and access to judicial review under a.domestic parties have no specific avenue of relief for improper liquidation.the byrd amendment might have been accompanied with a new administrative remedy provision for domestic parties,but it was not.
cemex ii,d at emphasis added.as to the nogales entries,which were liquidated in,the trial court concluded that a bars ad hoc claim because the liquidation became final as to all persons after days passed.id.
the court of international trade further explained that section b,which suspends finality of liquidation upon the filing of an action contesting an antidumping duty determination,does not disturb the finality provisions of section a.instead,it assist s the statutory goal of not requiring parties to proceed on multiple fronts.id.at.without pending proceedings,as in this case,nothing in b indicates it prevents finality as to customs determinations after court proceedings are conclusively terminated.id.otherwise,the court of international trade added,there would never be finality,which is clearly contrary to the legislative intent.id.
here,the trial court held that 
customs made a decision to recognize deemed liquidations and to post them.it is customs decision to declare deemed liquidation,not that of any other agency,which is at issue.assuming ad hoc had any rights to prevent finality,under these circumstances it would have had to act within days of the posting of notice of liquidation to avoid the effects of a.
id.at.additionally,the court remarked,having waited beyond the collection year to apply for byrd amendment funds,ad hoc can not complain about an erroneous liquidation in that year.ad hoc should have pursued whatever remedies it had to enforce the judgment here promptly.enforcement at this date would prejudice other parties by disrupting finality and the byrd amendment distribution scheme.id.at.
the court of international trade declined to order liquidation of the nogales entries at the final assessment rate.consistent with that decision,on september,the court of international trade also ordered the liquidation of the single,unliquidated los angeles entry at the percent rate required by e and declared the liquidation of the el paso entry final under a.
ad hoc timely appealed.cemex.we have jurisdiction under a,and heard oral argument on august.
iii.discussion 
we review the court of international trade statutory interpretation de novo.see vwp of,united states.
a.the statutory provisions 
we frame our discussion with the language of the relevant statutory provisions.under d,
w hen a suspension required by statute or court order is removed,the customs service shall liquidate the entry within months after receiving notice of the removal from the department of commerce,other agency,or a court with jurisdiction over the entry.any entry not liquidated by the customs service within months after receiving such notice shall be treated as having been liquidated at the rate of duty,value,quantity,and amount of duty asserted at the time of entry by the importer of record.
section a provides,in relevant part 
a except as provided in subsection b of this section,section of this title relating to voluntary reliquidations,section of this title relating to petitions by domestic interested parties,and section of this title relating to refunds and errors,decisions of the customs service,including the legality of all orders and findings entering into the same,as to 
the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry,or reconciliation as to the issues contained therein,or any modification thereof 
shall be final and conclusive upon all persons including the united states and any officer thereof unless a protest is filed in accordance with this section 
finally,according to section e 
e if the cause of action is sustained in whole or in part by a decision of the united states court of international trade or of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
entries of merchandise of the character covered by the published determination of the secretary,the administering authority,or the commission,which is entered,or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption after the date of publication in the federal register by the secretary or the administering authority of a notice of the court decision,and 
entries,the liquidation of which was enjoined under subsection c of this section,
shall be liquidated in accordance with the final court decision in the action.such notice of the court decision shall be published within ten days from the date of the issuance of the court decision.
were the nogales entries deemed liquidated under section d 
we begin our analysis by considering cemex assertion that the court of international trade erred in holding that the nogales entries did not liquidate by operation of law under d.cemex contends that the march,from commerce to customs was clear and unambiguous,and,therefore,sufficient to effectuate a deemed liquidation under section d.cemex further asserts that while fujitsu and international trading provide that the notice to customs should be both unambiguous and public,nothing in the statute itself requires that the notice be public so long as it is unambiguous.
cemex claims that commerce march,instructions to customs were unambiguous and were,in fact,followed by customs in liquidating the majority of second review entries at the percent duty rate at most premature,commerce march,instructions simply did not become effective until april,when the period for filing petitions for certiorari expired.the nogales entries,cemex argues,liquidated by operation of law six months later,on october,and became final and conclusive upon all persons under a after ninety days,on january.
we are not persuaded by cemex arguments.as we held in fujitsu,the suspension of liquidation under c can not be removed until the time for petitioning the supreme court for certiorari expires.at.that date for the second review entries was april,ninety days from the day this court entered its judgment in cemex i.the end of the suspension period,in turn,is a prerequisite for valid notice under section d.customs must liquidate entries as instructed only w hen a suspension required by statute or court order is removed and when it receives notice of such removal and the proper antidumping duty rate from commerce.see d.as we explained in fujitsu,in order for a deemed liquidation to occur,the suspension of liquidation that was in place must have been removed customs must have received notice of the removal of the suspension and customs must not liquidate the entry at issue within six months of receiving such notice.at.
in this case,commerce sent its instructions on march,before the deadline for filing petitions for certiorari had expired on april.the march,was thus ineffective in triggering the deemed liquidation period under section d.we,therefore,agree with the court of international trade that the march,notice can not be said to be unambiguous where the suspension had not yet been lifted.cemex ii,d at.
our case law further requires that,in addition to being unambiguous,the notice to customs be public see int l trading,at.in fact,section e requires that notice of decisions of the court of international trade or this court sustaining decisions in antidumping duty proceedings be published
