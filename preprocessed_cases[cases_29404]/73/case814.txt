diane blodgett,a special education teacher,appeals from a tax court determination in favor of the internal revenue service.we affirm.
we adopt the facts as set forth in the tax court opinion,and simply restate some critical facts so as to make understandable the legal issues presented herein.in the,blodgett michael blodgett founded morgan,a business engaged in the buying and selling of rare coins.the enterprise began as a sole proprietorship,later incorporated,utilizing a subchapter s election designation for income tax purposes,in.as of,and blodgett each owned percent of the business.their three children owned percent each.
blodgett operated the business similar to a ponzi scheme.by all accounts,it was successful and enabled the blodgetts to lead a lavish lifestyle.as examples,the blodgetts,personally or through their business entity,held rare coins and historical documents with a collective value of more than million,a condominium and docking space in key largo,florida,purchased for,a mercedes sl,a cutty cabin sunrunner boat and a simbari oil painting worth approximately.
eventually,the long arm of the law caught up with blodgett as he was charged with and convicted of several counts of fraud.his wife was not charged with any criminal wrongdoing.in addition to the criminal troubles,the federal trade commission ftc initiated a civil action against morgan and blodgett,alleging deceptive trade practices and seeking permanent injunctive relief and consumer redress.morgan,blodgett and the ftc reached a settlement which was memorialized in a consent order signed march.diane blodgett signed the consent order as a nonparty spouse.
the consent order provided for the creation of a settlement estate and a litigation estate,to include assets transferred from morgan and the blodgetts.a receiver was appointed to liquidate the assets in both estates and disburse the money.the litigation estate was used to pay litigation expenses for the defense of actual or reasonably anticipated governmental enforcement actions against the blodgetts.the settlement estate was used to pay claims of defrauded customers of the business.the litigation estate was established with,funded solely by virtue of the liquidation of a coin fund.the remaining proceeds from the liquidation of the coin fund were transferred to the settlement estate.the settlement estate also included the florida property and the simbari painting,among other assets.
after the onset of the ftc case but prior to the consent order,creditors of the business filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the business.on august,the district court ordered the receiver in the ftc case to turn over all assets held in the settlement estate to the bankruptcy trustee turnover order.the turnover order specified those assets determined in the bankruptcy proceeding not to be the property of the morgan bankruptcy estate to be returned to their rightful owners.after the turnover order,the florida condominium and simbari painting each became parts of the bankruptcy estate and were not returned to the settlement estate.
as part of the liquidation proceedings,the bankruptcy trustee prepared and filed morgan tax returns for the years through.diane blodgett did not participate in the preparation of these returns.on the return,filed by the trustee in february,morgan reported an ordinary loss in the amount of.the trustee prepared and issued to the shareholders a notice indicating each respective share of the loss amount and the fact such loss was deductible only to the extent of shareholder basis in the corporation,which the trustee determined was zero.
the document at issue on appeal is blodgett personal federal income tax return prepared by her from prison.it reported wage income of and income tax withheld of.the return also included a carryover business loss deduction.such figure reportedly represented the amount described on the proof of claim filed by the ftc in the bankruptcy case against morgan.the return claimed a refund of all of her withholdings for.blodgett attached a letter to her tax return explaining the large loss carryovers stemmed from the loss of property arising out of the consent agreement she signed as a nonparty spouse 
on february,the sent blodgett a notice of deficiency disallowing the claimed deduction.she then petitioned the tax court for a redetermination.at trial,the tax court characterized the primary issue for decision as whether she was entitled to all or part of the loss deduction claimed on her return as the carryover of a business loss blodgett also claimed the following specific items as deductible losses for the theft loss of a pension fund as carryforward legal expenses a investment loss on a condominium and lot in florida a investment loss on a simbari painting a carryforward business or investment loss on rare coins and a carryforward business or investment loss on historical documents.
the tax court entered a decision in favor of the,finding blodgett failed to meet her burden of proof on the issues of ownership,loss,value and deductibility of the items contributed to the settlement.she subsequently filed the current appeal.on appeal,she contends the tax court erred in not shifting the burden of proof to the commissioner of internal revenue,pursuant to,as to whether there was a loss in failing to likewise shift the burden of proof when the commissioner introduced new evidence on the eve of trial and in treating the trustee tax return as presumptively correct without further authentication.
we apply different standards of review to different components of a tax court decision.we review a tax court factual determinations under a clearly erroneous standard.clajon gas,cir.under this standard,w e will uphold the tax court finding unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the tax court has committed a mistake.estate of ford,cir quoting estate of palmer,cir.when the tax court fact finding is based on a credibility determination,such finding is nearly unreviewable.see anderson city of bessemer city,d stating a fact finder determination on credibility can virtually never be considered clearly erroneous.in contrast,a tax court legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact are subject to de novo review.clajon gas,at.
shifting burden of proof on tax loss 
the question of whether a taxpayer produced evidence sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the under is a legal one which we review de novo.estate of mitchell,cir.we evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence under the applicable standard of review against a backdrop of each party burden of proof.limited,cir.generally,the determination on the existence of a tax deficiency is presumed correct thus,the taxpayer generally bears the burden of proving entitlement to a claimed deduction by a preponderance of the evidence.griffin,cir.this burden,however,may shift to the to disprove entitlement to a claimed deduction if the taxpayer introduces credible evidence complete with the necessary substantiation and documentation sufficient to fulfill the requirements of interex,cir.
we begin with a discussion of credible evidence.in griffin,we defined credible evidence for purposes of as the quality of evidence,which after critical analysis,the court would find sufficient upon which to base a decision on the issue if no contrary evidence were submitted without regard to the judicial presumption of irs correctness.at.blodgett contends the tax court ignored by failing to shift the burden of disproving her loss to the commissioner after she introduced uncontroverted testimony,which she alleges was thoroughly corroborated by documentary evidence,that,as part of the settlement agreement,she irrevocably lost millions of dollars in assets when she turned over the assets to the ftc receiver.blodgett argument,however,fails to the extent she relies on griffin for the proposition any testimony offered by the taxpayer tending to support a claimed deduction is sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the.while a tax court must consider the testimony as if no contrary evidence were submitted without regard to the judicial presumption of irs correctness,a tax court has the right in the first instance to reject the testimony as incredible.see marcella,cir stating a tax court is not compelled to believe evidence which to it seems improbable,or to accept as true uncorroborated evidence of interested witnesses even though uncontradicted willis state farm fire and cas,cir stating a jury is free to disbelieve any witness,even if the testimony is uncontradicted or unimpeached.a fact finder may choose to disbelieve evidence on its face even without evidence to the contrary.see steel downs,cir stating t he trier of the facts is not required to accept the uncontradicted testimony of an uncorroborated interested party,although such testimony is not contradicted by other testimony.anderson,at.highlighting a trial judge ability to be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener understanding of and belief in what is being said.this concept is not only fundamental since incredible testimony,axiomatically,can not constitute credible evidence,but this concept is contained within the definition of credible evidence.blodgett conveniently disregards the portion of the credible evidence definition requiring a tax court to conduct a critical analysis of the evidence.if a critical analysis requires nothing else,it requires a tax court to conduct a credibility determination before labeling evidence credible.with this qualification on her interpretation of griffin,we will now analyze each claimed deduction.
business carryover expenses 
blodgett claimed a deduction for a net operating loss suffered by morgan in stemming from the turnover of assets to the ftc.corporation losses are generally deductible by its shareholders to the extent of the shareholder basis.a d.as proof of the loss,she introduced evidence the ftc filed a million proof of claim as creditor of morgan in the bankruptcy proceeding.she also introduced the testimony of her husband who testified part of the million turned over to the ftc were personal assets.the question before us is whether this evidence was credible evidence sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the even though the deduction was a mere out of the claimed million loss,we find the evidence was not sufficient to support the deduction.
the testimony establishes the ftc made a claim,but it does not establish the claim was actually paid.assuming the claim was paid,the loss would only be deductible to the extent of blodgett basis in the corporation.oren,cir.relying upon morgan tax return,the tax court concluded her basis in the corporation was zero.while she disputes the accuracy of the return and argues the personal assets turned over to the ftc as part of the million settlement increased her basis in the corporation,we find the tax court did not clearly err in reaching its basis conclusion in light of the bankruptcy trustee notice and the lack of certainty as to the ownership of the assets contributed to the settlement.however,even if we assume the claim was paid and further assume she had sufficient basis in the corporation,the deduction is only allowed if she did not already deduct the loss in a prior year.she did not introduce evidence in this regard.at a minimum,a taxpayer must produce credible evidence as to each material factual assertion necessary to support a claimed deduction before the burden shifts to the see griffin,at defining credible evidence as the quality of evidence sufficient to support a favorable decision on an issue.furthermore,she failed to maintain and produce the proper records to substantiate her claim,thus she did not meet the burden shifting requirements.see a b.
theft loss of pension fund 
blodgett claimed a deduction of for the theft loss of a pension fund,which she alleged was stolen by the ftc and other governmental agencies and officials the only evidence this loss occurred as a result of theft was her testimony.she argues her testimony is sufficient to shift the burden of proof.griffin,at reversing a tax court finding that the taxpayer uncorroborated and testimony was not enough to shift the burden to the.if all she needed to show to support the deduction was evidence of theft,then she may be correct.however,in addition to evidence of an actual theft,theft losses are deductible only in the year discovered.e.therefore,she must have produced evidence of her discovering the loss in,which she failed to do.the tax court found insufficient evidence to prove even the mere existence of a pension fund.the court also found incredible her contention government officials involved in the bankruptcy proceeding and civil action stole the money from the pension fund.even if a pension fund did exist and it was stolen by government officials,she is not entitled to a deduction because the tax court found she would have discovered these happenings well before.
carryforward legal expenses 
blodgett claimed a deduction of for carryforward legal expenses.legal expenses incurred as an ordinary and necessary business expense are deductible,but legal expenses incurred as a personal expense are nondeductible.a.it is unclear from the record what evidence,if any,she produced in support of the deduction for carryforward legal expenses,but the tax court found she failed to prove that her costs,if any,for defending herself and blodgett from civil and criminal liability connected with the business were other than nondeductible personal expenses.furthermore,to the extent she could have shown a business purpose,her loss could only be deducted in proportion to her basis in the corporation.oren,at.as mentioned,she failed to produce convincing evidence showing her basis in the corporation.
loss of condominium 
blodgett testified to the purchase of a condominium in florida for the purpose of renting it out and sustained a investment loss when the property was transferred to the settlement estate and later the bankruptcy trustee.the tax code allows a deduction for a loss incurred in connection with a transaction conducted for profit,but does not allow a deduction for a personal,living or family expense.c.blodgett testified she and her husband bought the property as an investment.she argues her testimony is sufficient to shift the burden of proof.the tax court,however,found her testimony lacked credibility at trial.incredible testimony is not sufficient to shift the burden of proof.griffin,at.in any event,the tax court ultimately found the objective evidence,namely,the evidence of the blodgetts lack of expertise in the real estate business,lack of market analysis prior to purchase,and the failure to actually rent out the property,outweighed any incredible statements supporting the deduction.the tax court concluded the blodgetts purchased the property for personal,living and family purposes.
loss on simbari painting 
blodgett testified she purchased an simbari oil painting as an investment and claimed to suffer a loss of its cost when the painting was transferred to the settlement estate.the tax code allows a deduction for a loss incurred in connection with a transaction conducted for profit,but does not allow a deduction for a personal,living or family expense.c.her testimony indicated she bought the painting as an investment.she argues her testimony is sufficient to shift the burden of proof.the tax court decision is unclear as to the credibility of her testimony in support of this specific deduction.the tax court,when necessary,clearly dismissed the credibility of her singular testimony in support of the other claimed deductions,but the manner in which this portion of the tax court decision reads it only dismissed the credibility after considering the objective evidence to the contrary.in the light of the overall tone of the decision,this discrepancy may be inadvertent,but if blodgett testimony is credible,the burden of disproving entitlement to this deduction should have shifted to the griffin,at defining credible evidence.however,regardless of which party bore the burden of proof,the overwhelming weight of evidence supported a finding for the.the tax court found both and blodgetts lack of expertise in art,their lack of history
