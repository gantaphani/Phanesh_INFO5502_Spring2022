staff it,failed to file,pay,and deposit payroll taxes during the course of three tax quarters.the internal revenue service irs initiated collection proceedings against,seeking the unpaid taxes,interest on them,and penalties for failure timely to file,pay,and deposit such taxes.after the irs office of appeals administratively sustained a proposed levy,filed a complaint in the district court,contending that,because of financial hardship,it should be excused from paying the penalties.the district court ruled against,which then appealed to us.
on appeal,the government relies on brewery,united in arguing that financial hardship can never be a justification for the abatement of employment tax penalties.in diametric opposition,relies on caselaw from the second third seventh and ninth in arguing that financial hardship may justify the abatement of employment tax penalties,insisting that it does so under the facts and circumstances present here.
like the district court,we need not decide today whether financial hardship may ever justify the abatement of employment tax penalties.instead,we hold that is not entitled to an abatement of penalties even when we assume arguendo that,under some circumstances,penalties for failure to file,pay,and deposit payroll taxes could be abated for financial hardship.
facts and proceedings 
is an taxpayer operating out of houston,texas.it was incorporated in as a personnel staffing company specializing in providing computer programmers and other technical personnel contractors to outside businesses clients.typically,clients would engage to fill vacancies in their computer programmer or other technical positions.
contractors hired by would be placed on payroll,but would work under the designated client direction.each pay period,would pay the contractors their net compensation after withholding such items as income and social security taxes.would invoice the client for the contractors services,including a surcharge for clients would usually pay within thirty to ninety days after being invoiced.
based on its invoicing practice,had to carry its costs between the time it paid its contractors and the time it received payment from its clients.this practice required substantial working capital to cover the resulting time gap.some of this required capital came from who invested in or made loans to,but still had to borrow a significant portion of its working capital from financial institutions.
as a relatively small business with no hard assets,such as land,buildings,equipment,or manufacturing facilities,was not able to borrow capital from traditional banks.other than a few computers,desks,and chairs,only assets were its accounts receivable,which mainline banks ordinarily deem to be insufficient collateral.thus,only source of working capital was financing companies factors or factoring companies.
in the factoring process,a business sells its accounts receivables to a finance company at a discount.then,as the business collects its receivables,it repays the factor.in some cases,clients pay the factor directly.
in,obtained financing through prinvest capital prinvest,a factoring company.under the factoring agreement,prinvest would advance approximately seventy to eighty percent of the revenue expected from a client,and would instruct the client to pay prinvest directly.then,when prinvest received payment from the client,prinvest would deduct its charges and forward the remainder to by,annual billings had grown to approximately,and prinvest was financing approximately of receivables.
employed more than two hundred contractors,had accrued monthly revenues of almost,and had a monthly cash flow of over.payroll taxes were almost in and almost from january to september.until the last tax quarter of,timely filed,paid,and deposited its payroll taxes.
beginning in may,began to experience a series of financial set backs.during the months of may,june,and july,largest client,compaq computer,laid off a significant portion of its workforce,including of its contractors.as a result,lost in revenue.during the same period,enron and dynegy,smaller clients,laid off contractors.
in june,as a response to the compaq,prinvest refused to finance any more of receivables,eventually declaring bankruptcy in august of that year.this left with no financing source.began negotiations with another potential lender to replace prinvest and obtained an informal financing agreement in september.this eventually fell through,however,during the period of financial uncertainty that followed the september,terrorist attacks.
in october,prinvest demanded a substantial loan repayment from,threatening to contact clients directly and call in all receivables if the repayment were not made.rick mcminn,a officer and stockholder,together with other two,personally guaranteed prinvest loan to mcminn used his home as collateral in borrowing,which he then loaned to on the same terms that the bank had loaned that money to him.used those funds to pay the to prinvest.
cut some minor expenses during this period.some of these expenses were not eliminated,however,but were merely deferred until the following month.
continued to place contractors at enron and compaq in october,despite announcements that these two clients would indefinitely suspend invoice payments.cut other category of some advertising and recruiting expenses,but did not issue a broad directive to cut expenses.paid to creditors other than prinvest in october while increasing its marketing efforts by shifting two staff employees from the recruiting of contractors to the selling of services,marketing.the marketing efforts were part of plan to overcome its financial difficulties by growing the business and.
enron continued to weaken in november and december of,eventually filing for bankruptcy protection.lost approximately in receivables as a result,but did not file a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding because of the attendant expenses and fees and the likelihood of an unfavorable result.
failed to make payroll tax deposits in november and december.during these months,delayed payments to some creditors and on some debts,but did not reduce the number of contractors on its payroll,the number of its employees,or salaries not even the salaries of its three at per annum each.neither did issue a broad directive to reduce expenses.at that time,was anticipating a growth in business from its increased marketing efforts,which hoped would enable it to pay its fourth quarter payroll taxes,as well as to make timely deposits of its payroll taxes.
continued to spend on marketing,advertising,and operating expenses.it also continued to provide monthly vehicle allowances for those of its employees who had to drive to clients places of business,and to take clients to houston astros games,including paying for season parking.during the time in question,spent on a christmas party,expended additional funds for promotional items,such as drink koozies and rulers,and paid for christmas hams for its contractors.also continued to entertain clients by treating them to meals.justified these expenses as part of its advertising and efforts.
by early,anticipated business increase had failed to materialize and its existing business declined.had still not obtained a new factor to replace prinvest,and global crossing,another client,filed for bankruptcy.did attempt to cut some costs,but negative cash flow outpaced these savings.
in february,scaled back some of its debt payments,reduced rent payments,and cut payments to creditors yet it continued to pay its employees and contractors,and its operating expenses in full.made no layoffs and did not reduce salaries.in the absence of a factor,mcminn loaned another.did not make any payroll tax deposits in january or february of,continuing to believe that the downturn was temporary and to hope that once it secured a new factor,it would be able to pay the irs.
early in,finally secured a new factor.now accepting the need to reduce expenses,laid off some employees and contractors and otherwise cut salaries and costs.reduced the salaries of its three by from from to.reduced other employees salaries by from levels and cut the monthly vehicle allowances and client meals that it had funded.also reduced advertising by from levels.
newly secured factor would not advance funds without first obtaining a lien on receivables.as prinvest still maintained a lien on receivables,paid prinvest more than to release its lien on receivables.although continued to pay its operating expenses,it made no payroll tax deposits in march,april,or may of.it did not start to make significant payroll tax deposits until june.
even then,did not pay its back payroll taxes to the irs.during the last six months of,however,paid most of its payroll taxes as they accrued,with the exception of december.in that month,new factor retained invoiced payments,causing to fall short on its deposit of payroll taxes.met its wage,interest,and operating cost obligations,but by the end of the year,it owed its attorneys and others more than.
in,the irs sent a notice of intent to levy on the company assets to collect payroll taxes,interest,and penalties for the three tax quarters ending december,march,and september.the penalties at issue were penalties for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of,pursuant to a penalties for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of,pursuant to a and penalties for all three quarters at issue,pursuant to.
on november,the irs sent a notice of federal tax lien filing in connection with the company unpaid payroll taxes excluding penalties and interest for the same quarters.in these notices,the irs advised of its right to seek a collection cdp hearing under and.
requested a cdp hearing with respect to both the proposed levy and the notice of tax lien,challenging the penalties against it but not the underlying tax liabilities or interest.it requested abatement of the penalties for the quarters ending december,and march,on the ground that the company had reasonable cause for late filings,late deposits,and late payments.requested abatement of the penalties for the quarter ending september,on the ground that the company had timely filed returns and deposited and paid the taxes when due for that quarter.
met with an irs appeals officer on february,regarding its request for abatement of penalties.the appeals officer issued a notice of determination denying requests for penalty abatement and an installment plan,but gave until may,to satisfy its current compliance requirements.the appeals officer concluded that had not shown reasonable cause for failing to file timely returns or to make timely deposits and payments.he observed that,even though obviously faced financial difficulties during the period at issue,the company had continued to furnish contractors to clients despite learning that the clients would not be making timely payments.the appeals officer also noted that had continued to pay its corporate officers,who were not essential creditors.
in june,filed suit in the district court,seeking review of the notice of determination.there,asserted that its financial hardship in and constituted reasonable cause for its failure timely to file,to pay,and to deposit payroll taxes.in december,the government filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting,inter alia,that financial hardship can never constitute reasonable cause for the abatement of payroll tax penalties.
in its written ruling,the district court acknowledged the existence of a split in authority on the standards governing financial cause cases.the court observed that the sixth circuit had held that financial difficulties can never constitute reasonable cause to excuse penalties for a taxpayer failure to satisfy its payroll tax obligations but several other courts of appeals had rejected the sixth circuit rule and had held that all facts and circumstances of the taxpayer financial situations must be assessed to determine whether the taxpayer has demonstrated reasonable cause that would entitle it to an abatement.
rather than decide which standard to apply,the district court concluded that under either standard,the government was entitled to summary judgment because had not shown that its failure to satisfy its payroll tax obligations resulted from reasonable cause.timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.law and analysis 
standard of review 
we review grants of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law in collection due process cases in which the underlying tax liabilities are at issue,we review the underlying tax liability de novo and other administrative decisions for an abuse of discretion determination of the presence of the elements required to prove reasonable cause for failure to satisfy payroll tax obligations is a question of law,but determination whether those elements are present in a given situation is a question of fact 
the internal revenue code irc requires employers to deduct and withhold income and social security taxes from its employees salaries and wages these taxes must be held by the employer in a special trust fund for the benefit of the government an employer is liable for the payment of the taxes required to be withheld and is required to report the amounts of withheld taxes on its payroll tax returns these returns and payments of payroll taxes are due each calendar quarter an employer is required to deposit the employment and income taxes withheld in an approved bank at various intervals during a calendar quarter,depending on how much is withheld 
the irs imposes mandatory penalties for failure to file payroll tax returns,pay payroll taxes,and deposit payroll taxes in a depository,unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that such failure was occasioned by reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.thus,to obtain abatement of employment tax penalties imposed under and,the taxpayer must bear the heavy burden of proving that the failure did not result from willful neglect and the failure was occasioned by reasonable cause.neither willful neglect nor reasonable cause are defined in the irc.
in united states boyle,the supreme court defined willful neglect,as used in a,as a conscious,intentional failure or reckless indifference.stated differently,the taxpayer must show that the failure to file a return was the result neither of carelessness,reckless indifference,nor intentional failure.
there is no jurisprudential definition of reasonable cause however,the treasury regulations shed some light on its meaning.
failure to file 
for situations under a,the treasury regulations explain 
if the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time,then the delay is due to reasonable cause 
failure to pay 
for situations under a,the treasury regulations explain 
a failure to pay will be considered to be due to reasonable cause to the extent that the taxpayer has made a satisfactory showing that he exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of his tax liability and was nevertheless either unable to pay the tax or would suffer an undue hardship as described in b of this chapter if he paid on the due date.in determining whether the taxpayer was unable to pay the tax in spite of the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of his tax liability,consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances of the taxpayer financial situation,including the amount and nature of the taxpayer expenditures in light of the income or other amounts he could,at the time of such expenditures,reasonably expect to receive prior to the date prescribed for the payment of the tax.thus,for example,a taxpayer who incurs lavish or extravagant living expenses in an amount such that the remainder of his assets and anticipated income will be insufficient to pay his tax,has not exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for the payment of his tax liability.further,a taxpayer who invests funds in speculative or illiquid assets has not exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for the payment of his tax liab
