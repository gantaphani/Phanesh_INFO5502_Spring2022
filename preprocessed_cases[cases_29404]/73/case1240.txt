norfolk southern railway company norfolk appeals an order denying its application for preliminary injunctive relief from the imposition of alabama sales and use tax on diesel fuel.norfolk asserts that the sales and use tax on diesel fuel discriminates against railroad companies in violation of section d of the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of the act,currently codified as b.
we affirm the district court denial of a preliminary injunction.norfolk ry.dep t of revenue,civil action,slip op.at.before we explain the reasons for that affirmance,however,we will first outline the tax provisions norfolk challenges,briefly review the purpose and text of the act,and summarize the proceedings below we will then explain our conclusion that alabama tax does not violate the act.
though norfolk is a virginia railway corporation,it is qualified to do business in alabama and has approximately a market share among alabama rail carriers.while norfolk operations extend across states,it owns its and builds,maintains,and repairs its tracks and other structures in alabama,and is therefore subject to taxation there.
pursuant to to,alabama levies a sales tax on the gross receipts of retail entities selling tangible personal property within the state id,and a use tax on the storage,use,or consumption of tangible personal property in the state.id.a.the tax is levied at a rate of four percent of the purchase price.id,a.after the payment of administrative and enforcement expenses,and small payments to other state funds,alabama deposits the sales and use tax proceeds into its education trust fund.id.a to f.further,a number of alabama cities and counties levy local sales and use taxes at varying rates.norfolk,civil action,slip op.at.norfolk must pay these state and local sales and use taxes on its purchase,consumption,or use of diesel fuel according to expert testimony,after capital improvements and compensation,diesel fuel constitutes norfolk business expense.
by and large,norfolk main do not pay alabama sales and use tax on the diesel fuel they purchase or consume.rather,so long as motor carriers pay alabama motor fuel excise tax,at a total of per gallon,such entities do not pay the sales and use tax on diesel fuel.id.imposing per gallon on motor fuel having paid this tax,motor carriers are not subject to any other excise tax levied by the state,e imposing upon distributors and suppliers an additional excise tax of per gallon on motor fuel received from a terminal,refinery,barge,or pipeline,j notably,however,motor carriers are not exempt from the sales and use tax if they do not pay the motor fuel excise tax on diesel fuel.see id.alabama spends its fuel excise tax proceeds on the construction,repair,and maintenance of public highways,id,as well as on costs of tax collection and bonds previously issued to build roads.id.
in addition,alabama levies a gasoline tax at a rate of per gallon on gasoline intended for use in internal combustion engines.id.a imposing an excise tax of per gallon and a supplemental excise tax of per gallon.an additional excise tax of per gallon also applies to gasoline.id.a b.alabama spends the proceeds from the gasoline taxes to maintain highways and streets.id.c.moreover,motor carriers are also subject to a motor carrier fuel excise tax equal to the applicable gasoline or diesel fuel tax,but they receive credit as to their motor carrier fuel excise tax bill for gasoline or diesel fuel tax already paid on the subject gasoline or diesel fuel.id,a 
interstate and international water carriers are also exempt from the sales and use tax on fuel.id.a.while intrastate water carriers must pay sales and use taxes on fuel,norfolk insists that intrastate water carrier shipments constitute only a small portion according to one of norfolk trial exhibits,only about one million of approximately million tons of intrastate shipments of its competition within alabama.
norfolk challenges alabama levy of sales and use tax on diesel fuel under the act.congress passed the act in 
to provide the means to rehabilitate and maintain the physical facilities,improve the operations and structure,and restore the financial stability of the railway system of the united states.a.among the means chosen by congress to fulfill these objectives,particularly the goal of furthering railroad financial stability,was a prohibition on discriminatory state taxation of railroad property.after an extended period of congressional investigation,congress concluded that railroads are by at least million each year,
in broad terms,congress declared in b that assessment ratios or taxation rates imposed on railroad property which differ significantly from the ratios or rates imposed on other commercial and industrial property are prohibited as burdens on interstate commerce.section c declared an exception from the provisions of the tax injunction act,allowing railroads to challenge discriminatory taxation in federal district courts.
burlington.tax comm n,d footnotes omitted.
consistent with its purpose,the text of the act focuses primarily on discriminatory property taxation,but it also includes a broader prohibition in section b.in current form,reads 
a in this section 
the term assessment means valuation for a property tax levied by a taxing district 
the term assessment jurisdiction means a geographical area in a state used in determining the assessed value of property for ad valorem taxation 
the term rail transportation property means property,as defined by the board,owned or used by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part and 
the term commercial and industrial property means property,other than transportation property and land used primarily for agricultural purposes or timber growing,devoted to a commercial or industrial use and subject to a property tax levy.
b the following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce,and a state,subdivision of a state,or authority acting for a state or subdivision of a state may not do any of them 
assess rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.
levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may not be made under paragraph of this subsection.
levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on rail transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.
impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part.
c notwithstanding section of title and without regard to the amount in controversy or citizenship of the parties,a district court of the united states has jurisdiction,concurrent with other jurisdiction of courts of the united states and the states,to prevent a violation of subsection b of this section.relief may be granted under this subsection only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of rail transportation property exceeds by at least percent the ratio of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.the burden of proof in determining assessed value and true market value is governed by state law.if the ratio of the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the assessment jurisdiction to the true market value of all other commercial and industrial property can not be determined to the satisfaction of the district court through the method known as a sales assessment ratio study to be carried out under statistical principles applicable to such a study,the court shall find,as a violation of this section 
an assessment of the rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the assessed value of all other property subject to a property tax levy in the assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of all other commercial and industrial property and 
the collection of an ad valorem property tax on the rail transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax ratio rate applicable to taxable property in the taxing district.
similar to other jurisdictions,this circuit interprets section b as a catchall that prevents all forms of discriminatory taxes,property or otherwise.see.great eagerton,cir.see also dep t of revenue acf,d reading section b broadly to include discriminatory property taxes,indirectly indicating that b also prevents discriminatory taxes.
on february,norfolk filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama,challenging the imposition of alabama sales and use tax on its diesel fuel,and seeking declaratory in addition to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.norfolk complaint alleged that t he alabama scheme of taxation results in discrimination against alabama railroads in violation of section b,which entitles norfolk to injunctive relief provided by section c thereof.the defendants,alabama department of revenue and tim russell,commissioner of revenue collectively,department,responded that norfolk could not claim reasonable cause to believe that a act violation had occurred,because the law has remained unchanged since burlington northern santa fe railway monroe,civil action,holding that alabama sales and use tax on diesel fuel did not violate the act.
following the parties submission of briefs and a hearing on march,the court denied norfolk motion for preliminary injunction,concluding that norfolk was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim.see norfolk ry.dep t of revenue,civil action,slip op.at.the court found that 
the other taxes imposed on motor carriers and water carriers,such as excise taxes and motor fuel taxes should be considered but the use to which tax revenues are put should not be considered.this is because the state has an obligation to maintain public rights of way and must determine some way to fund that obligation,and the state can not maintain the rails because they are private property.
id.at.the court further held that the sales and use tax paid by rail carriers is not discriminatory because r ail carriers do not pay a disproportionate amount of taxes in comparison to their direct competitors.id.at.as the overall tax scheme results in roughly equal treatment of all these carriers,alabama does not put rail carriers at an overall competitive disadvantage,considering that intrastate water carriers must pay the same sales and use tax and motor carriers must pay the various motor fuel excise taxes.id.
norfolk now brings this interlocutory appeal,in accordance with a from the denial of its application for a preliminary injunction.
the court reviews trial court denials of preliminary injunctions under the abuse of discretion standard.johnston tampa sports,cir per curiam.accordingly,the court reviews the trial court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.cumulus media,clear channel commc ns,cir.
our review,of course,must focus on norfolk specific claim that the exemptions for motor and water carriers from the alabama fuel sales and use tax on diesel fuel are discriminatory in violation of the act.significantly,norfolk does not complain that it must pay a different rate of tax on diesel fuel than other alabama taxpayers.instead,norfolk argues that the district court erred by expanding its review to include consideration of alabama motor fuel excise and gasoline taxes,and that in determining whether a state tax discriminates against railroads,a court may look only to the challenged sales and use tax on diesel fuel itself and may not consider motor carriers payment of the motor fuel excise and gasoline taxes.
norfolk legal analysis is,in part,correct,as explained below.nonetheless,under the act,as interpreted and applied by the supreme court,a state remains free to exempt certain transactions or entities from generally applicable taxes,such as the sales and use tax at issue here,as long as the state does not target railroads for discriminatory treatment.thus,because we agree with the district court ultimate conclusion that norfolk can not succeed on the merits of its underlying action,we affirm the district court order denying norfolk a preliminary injunction 
acf industries applies to this case 
although neither party briefed acf industries in depth,we find this supreme court decision regarding ad valorem tax exemptions determinative of norfolk appeal.in acf industries,the supreme court held that a state may grant exemptions from a generally applicable ad valorem property tax without subjecting the taxation of railroad property to challenge under the act,b.dep t of revenue acf,d.the court concluded that section does not limit the states discretion to exempt nonrailroad property,but not railroad property,from ad valorem property taxes of general application.id.at.
the company in acf industries challenged oregon ad valorem tax on real and personal property on the ground that oregon exempted various classes of goods from the tax,including motor vehicles,and instead charged such businesses a modest annual registration fee.id.at.oregon thus exempt ed certain classes of commercial and industrial property while taxing railroad cars in full.id.at.
the supreme court analyzed the challenged tax under section b for discrimination.id.at.because,under the act plain language,sections b did not contemplate outlawing exemptions from generally applicable property taxes,the court reasoned,b could not either congress placed exempt property beyond the reach of subsections b and therefore it would be illogical to conclude that congress would turn around and nullify its own choice in subsection b.id.at.
in acf industries,the supreme court primarily relied upon the plain language and structure of the act,but o ther considerations buttressed its analysis.id.at.first,the court noted that the act,while specifically addressing other types of discriminatory taxes,does not speak with any degree of particularity to the question of tax exemptions.id.congress could clearly have prohibited such exemptions,but did not.id.at.second,the court emphasized the traditional power of the states in providing exemptions from property taxes as an important aspect of state and local tax policy.id.indeed,i t was common at the time was drafted,as it is now,for states with generally applicable ad valorem property taxes to exempt various classes of commercial property.id.congress silence on the subject reflects a determination to permit the states to leave their exemptions in place.id.third,the court determined that principles of federalism in fact compelled its reading of the act,because w hen determining the breadth of a federal statute that impinges upon or the states traditional powers,the court is hesitant to extend the statute beyond its evident scope.id.at.see also carmichael coal coke.i t is inherent in the exercise of the power to tax that a state be free to select the subjects of taxation and to grant exemptions.
the supreme court did acknowledge,however,that a case in which the alone or as part of some isolated and targeted the only commercial entities subject to an ad valorem property tax could call into question whether the state had really exempted other commercial entities and could indicate a act violation.acf,at.nonetheless,as a result of acf industries,while the act prohibits the imposition of discriminatory property tax rates,the act does not prevent a state from exempting other commercial entities from such taxes and leaving taxes on railroads in place,so long as the railroad is not targeted 
while in norfolk case we are dealing with exemptions to a sales and use tax,rather than an ad valorem tax as in acf industries,the supreme court analysis is equally applicable.therefore,acf industries construction of the act guides our decision.first,as with the ad valorem property taxes challenged in acf industries,there is nothing in the act plain language that indicates an intent to reach exemptions from generally applicable sales and use taxes.the language of section b prohibits a discriminatory tax not a discriminatory tax exemption.second,the supreme court did not limit its the act does not speak with any degree of particularity to the question of tax exemptions to ad valorem property taxes its conclusion therefore has direct application to the issue presented here.third,as with property tax exemptions,sales and use tax exemptions were ubiquitous at the time the act was drafted,and thus benefit from the same presumption that congress silence reflects a determination to leave such exemptions in place finally,concerns for state sovereignty are just as keen.we accordingly join other courts that also have applied the acf industries analysis to state and local taxes analogous to alabama sales and use tax on diesel fuel 
we recognize that some courts appear to have ignored acf industries,and have instead scrutinized exceptions to generally applicable taxes however,as these decisions do not even discuss acf industries or its influence on their analyses,we do not find them persuasive.in addition,these cases conflict with cases that have applied a similar analysis to that in acf industries to taxes.see,burlington city of superior,cir ka.city ry.mcnamara,cir.
therefore,we hold that acf industries controls our analysis,and dictates that the alabama tax statute at issue,with its exemptions for motor and water carriers,does not offend the act so long as the tax is generally applicable and does not target railroads within alabama.
alabama sales and use tax on fuel is generally applicable and does not target railroads 
the sales and use tax at issue in this case qualifies as generally applicable,and thus does not discriminate against railroads in violation of the act.alabama levies its four percent sales tax u pon every person,firm,or corporation engaged in the business of selling at retail any tangible personal property whatsoever,and its four percent use tax on the storage,use or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property.id.a.
simply because alabama exempts interstate water carriers as well as some motor carriers does not transform the assessment into a discriminatory tax.although a tax with widespread exemptions could indicate that a state has single d out the railroad for discriminatory treatment,that is not the case here.acf,at.alabama exempts from the sales and use tax various types of goods and entities.see to.specifically,the alabama tax code exempts sales and use tax on diesel fuel as to motor carriers interstate shippers state,county,and municipal entities county and city school boards certain charitable organizations commercial fishing vessels fuel for kiln use in manufacturing plants fuel for agricultural uses fuel for resource exploration and fuel temporarily brought into alabama by a for personal use.see id.however,all other entities are subject to the tax on diesel fuel,including intrastate water carriers and motor carriers that have not paid the motor fuel excise tax.on the record before the court,alabama sales and use tax does not target or single out railroads.
our conclusion is consistent with previous case law in other jurisdictions.generally,cases that have applied acf industries or similar analyses,and have found taxes to target the railway industry,have involved taxes levied almost exclusively upon railroads in contrast,taxes more like the tax at issue in this case,where a state taxes railroads along with many other businesses,but exempts certain discrete industries,have been found to be generally applicable and thus not discriminatory 
although we conclude that alabama sales and use tax on fuel is generally applicable and does not target railroads,norfolk raises one additional argument that we must address.norfolk attempts to claim that the alabama tax structure singles out railroads,because alabama uses the proceeds of the taxes levied on motor carriers to maintain roads and railroads do not receive similar subsidies in violation of west lynn creamery,healy,d.in west lynn,the supreme court held that the discriminatory effects of a tax or other payment to the state can not be analyzed without taking into account the use to which payments are put.id.at.west lynn,however,involved a direct subsidy to producers,rather than an alleged indirect subsidy such as that at issue here.id.at.furthermore,the supreme court disapproved of the subsidy because it constituted an unlawful burden against interstate commerce.id.at.a pure subsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no burden on interstate commerce,but merely assists local business.the pricing order in this case,however,is funded principally from taxes on the sale of milk produced in other states.by so funding the subsidy,respondent not only assists local farmers,but burdens interstate commerce.footnote omitted.although congress grounded its implementation of the act in const.art.i,cl,see pittsburgh lake erie ry.labor executives ass n,d,our analysis in this case is limited to the specific statutory language of the act,rather than the scope of the commerce clause.see ka.city ry.mcnamara,cir although it may be helpful in analyzing some aspects of the problem,commerce clause doctrine does not answer the questions posed by the act.
it follows that we find norfolk arguments unpersuasive.we will not compare the sales and use tax to the fuel excise tax,insofar as there are differences in the ways in which their respective proceeds are spent.first,in line with the majority of other jurisdictions,and as norfolk itself urges,we decline to look past the particular tax at issue to analyze the overall state tax structure second,we believe that the use to which a state puts its tax revenue is irrelevant to the issue of act discrimination.see atchison,topeka santa fe,at trailer train state tax comm n,at.the act itself has its roots in equity practice,in principles of federalism,and in recognition of the imperative need of a state to administer its own fiscal operations.tully griffin,d.alabama must pay for the creation,maintenance,and repair of its roads,and must,in some fashion,obtain funds for such creation,maintenance,and repair.but alabama has no constitutional discretion to allocate funds to private property.see.const.art.iv,the state shall not engage in works of internal improvement,nor lend money or its credit in aid of such nor shall the state be interested in any private or corporate enterprise,or lend money or its credit to any individual,association,or corporation.furthermore,alabama maintains the roads for the public good and not for the benefit of motor carriers motor carriers only tangentially benefit from the public roads.the ownership and maintenance of its,with both the costs and benefits associated with such ownership,merely constitute part of norfolk cost of doing business as a railroad,and do not indicate discrimination as to norfolk or other railway companies.
accordingly,we conclude that norfolk would not succeed on the merits of its case.consequently,we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction,and the district court denial of the preliminary injunction is 
although in reality collected from retailers,the sales tax is conclusively presumed to be a direct tax on the retail consumer.id.c.
although not at issue here,we note that norfolk also pays state ad valorem tax on its alabama property,track,roadway structures,and roadbeds and pays sales and use tax on the materials used to build,maintain,and repair its property.as motor carriers,air carriers,and water carriers do not own,build,or maintain roads,airports and airspace,or ports and waterways,such carriers do not pay sales and use tax or ad valorem tax in this manner.we note also that if norfolk buys diesel fuel in other states,it still must pay use tax on the sales price or reasonable market value of the fuel used,unless it has already paid equal or greater amounts of sales tax in the other states.see e.
the parties agree that norfolk direct competitors are motor carriers of property in interstate commerce moto
