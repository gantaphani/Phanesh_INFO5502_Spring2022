background 
procedural history 
on august,plaintiff filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of michigan seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants.the suit was in response to defendants attempts to assess,collect,and enforce ad valorem taxes under the act against real property within the reservation held by plaintiff or its members in fee simple.
on december,defendants filed a motion to dismiss under federal rules of procedure b and b.on september,the district court denied the motion.
on october,defendants filed a motion to dismiss under rule b and a motion for summary judgment under rule.on december,plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment under rule on counts i and ii of its complaint.count i alleged that plaintiff was entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief because congress had not clearly authorized state taxation of the real property at issue.count ii alleged that plaintiff was entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief because application of the act would violate the terms of the treaty.on june,the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment,granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment,entered a declaratory judgment that the act was not valid as applied to the real property at issue,and enjoined defendants from enforcing the act against said real property.on june,defendants timely filed a notice of appeal.

the history preceding the treaty 
the following historical account was found by a district court in a case unrelated to the case before this court,keweenaw bay indian community state of michigan.
the keweenaw bay is located on the southern shore of lake superior in michigan upper peninsula.from the earliest records there existed a band of lake superior chippewa indians near the mouth of the bay,on an transportation corridor used by the indians and later by fur traders.the indians subsisted before the coming of european society,consistent with their traditional lifestyle,which included annual rounds of hunting and trapping in the winter and fishing in the spring,summer and fall.the lake superior chippewas lifestyle was first impacted by contact with the french,followed by the english and finally by the americans.contacts exposed the chippewa,inter alia,to christianity,a new kind of market economy,greed and avarice for their lands,intoxicants,disease,and a new style of dress and abode.these contacts,of course,did not supplant their culture.
the expedition of henry schoolcraft,followed by douglas houghton famous exploration of the western upper peninsula,outlined the immense mineral reserves of the western range and the keweenaw peninsula,which were all held at that time by the indians,pursuant to their unextinguished aboriginal title.not surprisingly,these rich mineral deposits evoked considerable interest from land speculators,miners,and the federal government.
the united states congress appropriated money on march,to defray expenses of entering into a treaty with the chippewa for the extinguishment of their title within the state of michigan where the mineral deposits were found.the treaty with the chippewa,stat,was subsequently negotiated on october,under which the indians conveyed to the united states their aboriginal title to the entire western half of michigan upper peninsula,including the keweenaw bay area,and to all of northern wisconsin.although article iii of the treaty provided for the eventual removal of the indians to an area to the west occupied by the mississippi chippewa,it was thought that such removal would not take place for a considerable time in the future.ex.in article ii,the indians stipulated for the right to hunt in the ceded territory,together with the other usual privileges of occupancy,until required to remove by the president of the united states article vi provided that the indians would be subject to removal from the mineral district at the pleasure of the president.it was contemplated that this limited removal from the mineral areas,if it occurred,would not move the indians out of the remainder of their cession area.article iv provided for the payment of annuities and the furnishing of goods and services to the indians,including blacksmiths and carpenter shops,and schools.notwithstanding the cession of title,the united states laws with respect to trade and intercourse with were to remain in effect in the ceded territory.
the events at keweenaw bay following the signing of the treaty were significant.in accord with the treaty,farmers and blacksmiths were provided to the band,along with funding to the mission boards in order to provide schools for the indians.although the treaty did not provide for land reservations,by all accounts the indians were advised,and they so understood,that their lifestyle would be essentially unchanged after the treaty because the government only sought their minerals.notwithstanding these assurances,the indians,who did not want to remove,were very apprehensive about that potential.of course,the threat of removal at that time seemed remote because the indians were not living within the two important mineral districts in the area.the indians comfort was,however,due to the commencement of land surveying in,which meant that legal descriptions could be made and land could be sold.to the indians,land sales meant that their removal was likely and imminent.
on february,the president issued a removal order,pursuant to the treaty.i tr.however,that order was subsequently withdrawn in august,and the indians were never actually required to remove.ii tr.nevertheless,according to henry gilbert,the michigan indian agent who negotiated the subsequent treaty,removal was the great terror of their the indians lives and i hazard nothing in saying they will sooner submit to extermination than comply with it.ex.ii tr.
the survey of the upper peninsula area around keweenaw bay was completed in.some land purchases began to occur on both sides of the bay at about that time.numerous urgent letters and petitions from indians and their representatives to indian agents and the president evidenced concern about removal and revealed a desire to purchase land around the bay by and for the benefit of the indians many indians in the keweenaw bay area adopted or names,clothing,houses,and other customs.some swore allegiance to the united states before a magistrate.these accommodations to american culture were often intended to demonstrate the indians advanced degree of civilization.it was hoped by some that such accommodations would convince the government to grant them citizenship and permit them to remain in their homes rather than force them to remove to the west.ex.vi tr.vii tr.a consistent indian theme throughout the period of removal and prior to the treaty was an ardent desire for permanent homes for the indians in their present locations.
the evidence indicates that in the,the federal government policy towards indians,known as removal,was being abandoned.removal was characterized by the movement of tribes from the eastern portion of the united states to lands to the west,out of the path of western settlement by.the removal policy became antiquated as the settlement patterns of moved inexorably westward.it became clear in the that there was rapidly becoming no place to move the indians.ii tr.the benevolent rationale for the removal was to isolate the indians from the adverse impacts resulting from their contacts with society.of course,the primary motivation was to free indian lands from their claims to them so the lands could be settled by.
this same rationale underlay the creation of the reservation system,which replaced the removal policy.ii tr.the separatism that was hoped for could no longer be achieved through removal.however,commissioner george manypenny believed that the civilization policy could be achieved through the reservation system.thus,he believed that if the indians were temporarily isolated on discrete parcels,away from the deleterious influence of,they could gradually become assimilated or civilized and eventually could be incorporated completely into society.vii tr.the reservation concept as a was a necessary step,then,in the civilization process.vii tr.
the new policy of the government was to provide permanent homes on the reservations that were set aside for the indians and upon which trespass by would not be tolerated.additionally,there were three evils attendant to the government policy in the past,which manypenny sought to avoid in the future first,the payment to the indians of excessive annuities,which promoted profligacy and the consumption of intoxicants second,excessive quantities of land held in common and third,continued changes in location in advance of the western movement of settlers.the treaty,as well as others negotiated during this period,were intended to address these articulated evils.
correspondence from commissioner manypenny to the indian agents about to undertake treaty negotiations with the lake superior chippewa in the early is critical to an understanding of the government intentions.one of the four letters of instruction from commissioner manypenny to henry gilbert provides 
i send herewith a copy of the instructions of the secretary of war of the date of june of when a former commissioner attempted to treat with these indians but failed.according to the estimates of this office,the chippewa own about acres of land,the greater part of which is of no value to them,and never will be.some portions of it will be valueless to the white population.
nevertheless,the condition of affairs with the chippewas is such that it is the duty of the government to offer them an opportunity to dispose of their tenure to their country,and in lieu thereof,to give them a small tract as a permanent home,with such means of support mental moral improvement as may be of great advantage to them.
the treaty 
on september,the president of the united states and the chippewa indians of lake superior and mississippi entered into a treaty treaty.treaty with the chippewa,september,stat.under the treaty,the chippewa indians ceded to the united states a substantial amount of land in eastern minnesota.in exchange,the united states set aside permanent reservations for the various bands of lake superior and mississippi chippewa.the united states also provided annuities,goods,and services in consideration of the cessation.
article of the treaty outlined certain powers the president maintained with respect to the reservation lands 
the united states will define the boundaries of the reserved tracts,whenever it may be necessary,by actual survey,and the president may,from time to time,at his discretion,cause the whole to be surveyed,and may assign to each head of a family or single person over years of age,eighty acres of land for his or their separate use and he may,at his discretion,as fast as the occupants become capable of transacting their own affairs,issue patents therefor to such occupants,with such restrictions of the power of alienation as he may see fit to impose.and he may also,at his discretion,make rules and regulations,respecting the disposition of the lands in case of the death of the head of a family,or single person occupying the same,or in case of its abandonment by them.and he may also assign other lands in exchange for mineral lands,if any such are found in the tracts herein set apart.and he may also make such changes in the boundaries of such reserved tracts or otherwise,as shall be necessary to prevent interference with any vested rights.all necessary roads,highways,and railroads,the lines of which may run through any of the reserved tracts,shall have the right of way through the same,compensation being made therefor as in other cases.
importantly for the instant case,the president had the power to assign land to individual chippewa indians,and he also had the power to place restrictions on these allotments,as well as the power to remove such restrictions.one such restriction would be a restriction on alienation.
article allowed missionaries,teachers,and other indians who resided in the ceded territory or the reservations to remain on their occupied land at a minimum price 
article listed certain restrictions placed upon the united states 
all annuity payments to the chippewas of lake superior,shall hereafter be made at,la pointe,grand portage,and on the louis river and the indians shall not be required to remove from the homes hereby set apart for them.and such of them as reside in the territory hereby ceded,shall have the right to hunt and fish therein,until otherwise ordered by the president.
the treaty was ratified on january.subsequently,the president periodically assigned parcels of the reservation to individual chippewa indians pursuant to his power under article of the treaty.the real property in dispute in the instant case are those parcels allocated under article and those parcels allocated under article that are now in the possession of plaintiff or its members.
tax treatment of real property within the reservation 
after the treaty,none of the lands within the reservation held by plaintiff predecessor tribes or its members in fee was subject to the act and its ad valorem real property tax.in,the michigan tax tribunal explicitly held that lands held by plaintiff and its members were not subject to the act however,the tribunal held that lands within the boundaries as described by article of the treaty that were sold by the united states prior to the ratification of the treaty were not part of the reservation and were subject to taxation.baraga county equalization dep t darcy,mtt docket.
in,a district court held that lands sold by the united states prior to the ratification of the treaty were a part of the reservation.keweenaw indian bay.at.see also note,supra.after this ruling,plaintiff filed a motion in district court to hold the state of michigan in contempt for failing to prevent baraga township and baraga county from seeking taxes on those lands sold prior to the treaty.the district court held that the imposition of such taxes was improper in light of the previous ruling that those lands were part of the reservation,but it did not hold the state in contempt,as the state had not been allowed to correct the actions of the town and the county.keweenaw bay indian cmty.state of michigan.
in,the michigan state treasurer filed a petition in state court seeking the sale of certain real property held by plaintiff or its members due to tax delinquencies.plaintiff and its members objected to the sale of the lands.the state court dismissed the objections of plaintiff and its members on the ground that the michigan tax tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction over the case,but the court stayed the sale.in march,plaintiff and its members filed their objections to the sale of the lands with the michigan tax tribunal.in march,the michigan tax tribunal entered a consent judgment with respect to plaintiff and its members,township,baraga township,and baraga county.the consent judgment found that real property held by plaintiff or its members that was within the exterior boundaries of the reservation was exempt from ad valorem taxes under the act.as a result,such property was to be taken off of the assessment rolls and listed as exempt.these exempt properties,however,were placed on a special tribal assessment roll,and plaintiff and its members would pay exactly the amount of taxes that would have been due had the properties been kept on the ordinary assessment roll.
from may to february,the parties followed the dictates of the consent judgment.in february,the commission sent a bulletin to assessors and equalization directors instructing them to place all real property owned by american indian communities and their members on the assessment rolls.this decision was based on the commission reading of cass county leech lake band of chippewa indians,d.
in february,township,baraga township,baraga county,and two of plaintiff members filed a writ of mandamus in state court to prevent the commission from interfering with the consent judgment.the state trial court issued the writ of mandamus.the state court of appeals affirmed,holding that the commission was barred by principles of res judicata from interfering with the consent judgment.the state supreme court reversed and found that the commission was not bound by the consent judgment,although the court did not address the validity of ad valorem taxes on real property held by plaintiff or its members.
in february,the commission ordered defendant arko to place real property held by plaintiff or its members on the assessment rolls.defendant arko did so and mailed assessment notices to plaintiff and its members.the commission also ordered defendant arko to place such property on the,and assessment rolls for township and the,and assessment rolls for baraga township.defendants township and baraga township issued ad valorem tax bills for real property held by plaintiff or its members that was located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation.throughout the dispute,plaintiff and its members continued to abide by the consent judgment and paid the equivalent of the taxes that would have been owed on their holdings of real property if such property were on the ordinary assessment rolls.

the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on the ground that the treaty disallows involuntary alienation of real property held by plaintiff or its members.while defendants offered an alternative interpretation of the treaty,principles of american indian treaty construction support the district court decision.
legal framework 
the supreme court modern jurisprudence with respect to the interaction of state tax laws and treaties with american indians is based in mcclanahan state tax commission of arizona,d.in that case,the plaintiff,a navajo indian,challenged the state taxation of her income,which was derived solely from activity within the navajo reservation.id.at.before addressing the merits of the plaintiff claim,the supreme court emphasized that there was a deeply rooted policy of preventing a state from asserting jurisdiction or otherwise interfering with american indians.id.at.citation omitted.indeed,in worcester georgia,chief justice marshall held that indian nations were distinct political communities,having territorial boundaries,within which their authority is exclusive,and having a right to all the lands within those boundaries,which is not only acknowledged,but guarantied by the united states.id.quoting worcester georgia,pet.the notion that american indians constituted a separate entity not subject to the laws of the state was known as the indian sovereignty doctrine.the court noted that under that doctrine,the court had rejected a state attempt to tax the lands within an american indian reservation.id.at.citing the new york indians,wall.the kansas indians,wall.
the court recognized that the indian sovereignty doctrine had evolved and that there were certain instances where a state could impose its laws on american indians and on actions that occurred on reservation lands.id.at.the court explained 
the indian sovereignty doctrine is relevant,then,not because it provides a definitive resolution of the issues in this suit,but because it provides a backdrop against which the applicable treaties and federal statutes must be read.it must always be remembered that the various indian tribes were once independent and sovereign nations,and that their claim to sovereignty long predates that of our own government.indians today are american citizens but it is nonetheless still true that t he relation of the indian tribes living within the borders of the united states is an anomalous one and of a complex character.they were,and always have been,regarded as having a position when they preserved their tribal relations not as states,not as nations,not as possessed of the full attributes of sovereignty,but as a separate people,with the power of regulating their internal and social relations,and thus far not brought under the laws of the union or of the state within whose limits they resided.
id.at.alterations in the original quoting united states kagama.emphasis supplied.
turning to the facts in the case,the supreme court held that the treaty with the navajo indians precluded the state from extending state tax law to navajo indians on the reservation.id.at.although the treaty did not contain an express provision that disallowed state taxation of the navajo indians,the court recognized that the treaty was not to be read as an ordinary contract agreed upon by parties dealing at arm length with equal bargaining positions.id.at.the court recognized that american indians,such as the navajo,signed treaties under duress and in hopes of creating a permanent home for themselves.id.it is circumstances such as these which have led this court in interpreting indian treaties,to adopt the general rule that d oubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of the weak and defenseless people who are the wards of the nation,dependent upon its protection and good faith.id.alteration in the original quoting carpenter shaw.relying on this canon of construction in conjunction with the backdrop of indian sovereignty,the court concluded that the treaty established a reservation where the navajo indians had exclusive sovereignty under general federal supervision,such that the state could not tax activities on the reservation.id.at.
treaty construction in favor of american indians has a pedigree.in the kansas indians,the supreme court noted 
e nlarged rules of construction are adopted in reference to indian treaties.in speaking of these rules,chief justice marshall says the language used in treaties with the indians shall never be construed to their prejudice,if words be made use of which are susceptible of a more extended meaning than their plain import as connected with the tenor of their treaty.
wall.at.quoting worcester,pet.at.emphasis supplied.under this principle,the supreme court interpreted a treaty with the miami indians,which stated that reservation lands were exempt from levy,sale,execution,and forfeiture,as preventing state taxation of those lands.the court reasoned 
applying this principle of treaty construction to the case in hand,is it not evident that the words levy,sale,and forfeiture are susceptible of meaning,which would extend them to the ordinary proceedings for the collection of taxes taxes must be first levied,and they can not be realized without the power of sale and forfeiture,in case of.the position,it seems to us,is too plain for argument.the object of the treaty was to hedge the lands around with guards and restrictions,so as to preserve them for the permanent homes of the indians.in order to accomplish this object,they must be relieved from every species of levy,sale,and a levy and sale for taxes,as well as the ordinary judicial levy and sale.
the supreme court recently reaffirmed the principle of treaty construction in favor of american indians in minnesota mille lacs band of chippewa indians,d.there,the court stated w e interpret indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the indians themselves would have understood them.id.at.citations omitted.the court continued we have held that indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the indians,and that any ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor id.at.citations omitted.see also winters united states.by a rule of interpretation of agreements and treaties with the indians,ambiguities occurring will be resolved from the standpoint of the indians.and the rule should certainly be applied to determine between two inferences,one of which would support the purpose of the agreement and the other impair or defeat it.
application to this case 
the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.the district court interpretation of the treaty,finding that the treaty prevented involuntary state alienation and therefore state taxation of real property,comports with the backdrop of american indian sovereignty and principles of treaty construction in favor of american indians.
the focus of the analysis is article of the treaty,which states,in relevant part,t he indians shall not be required to remove from the homes hereby set apart for them.plaintiff asserts that the provision disallows any form of involuntary alienation,including the sale of real property in fulfillment of a tax judgment.in support,plaintiff offered the expert opinion and report of charles cleland cleland,distinguished professor emeritus of anthropology and ethnohistory at michigan state university.cleland observed that,at the time of the treaty,the lake superior chippewa were very concerned with the prospect of removal from their homelands,and they were particularly anxious to broker an agreement to create permanent reservations for themselves.that agreement,the treaty,contained article,which cleland gave the following interpretation article solemnly guarantees that the signatory band would never be required involuntarily to leave or give up their reservations created by the treaty for any reason.at.cleland opined that imposition of state tax liability on real property,and the concomitant power to place tax liens on real property,would be fundamentally contrary to the purpose of the treaty,that is,to provide secure and permanent homes for the chippewa indians.at.cleland came to the ultimate conclusion 
certainly the chippewa indians did not understand the idea of taxation as a condition of holding their permanent reservation.if,in federal agent gilbert had told the chippewa indians that they had to pay money each year to hold their land,the chippewa indians,who had very limited access to hard currency,would have most certainly objected.in fact,they would not have signed the treaty.gilbert made this point with commissioner manypenny when he reported on the draft treaty.we found that the points most strenuously insisted upon by them were first the privilege of remaining in the country where they reside and next the appropriation of land for their future homes.without yielding these points,it was idle for us to talk about a treaty.we therefore agreed to the selection of lands for them in the territory heretofore ceded.emphasis in the original 
at footnote omitted.
in response,defendants assert that the chippewa indians intended to subject themselves to state taxes under the treaty,as they were eager to participate as citizens of the united states and the states where they resided.in support,defendants offered the expert opinion and report of anthony gulig gulig,an assistant professor at university of.gulig found that,in the time preceding the treaty,the lake superior chippewas were not merely opposed to removal,but many had taken up land,were well versed in modern agriculture,and took seriously the business of voting and otherwise interacting with the newcomer society around them.at.gulig found that it was the notion of general removal that the chippewa indians feared,and,to combat this fear,they sought not merely reservations,but individual property ownership.the chippewa indians,in gulig opinion,were eager to take on individual allotments pursuant to the treaty indeed,the most significant challenge to the administration of the allotment provision of the treaty,as it turned out,was that the land was not surveyed and allotted to them quickly enough.at.from the findings that the chippewa indians sought individual allotments,gulig concluded,i t is clear that the chippewas of lake superior knew the economic value and liability of the land they sought to acquire both as reservations and as individual allotments.at.defendants also presented the expert opinion and report of emily greenwald greenwald,who opined that,at the very latest,the chippewa indians knew in that the land they held individually could be taxed.greenwald,however,admitted that i t is not clear whether the chippewa indians knew that their lands became taxable when title was conveyed when they signed the treaty.at.
in our view,the language of article of the treaty is ambiguous.it is unclear whether the provision precluded all forms of involuntary alienation,including the sale of lands in satisfaction of tax liabilities,or only the general removal of the chippewa indians from the reservation area.as made amply clear by supreme court precedent,this court must read this ambiguity in favor of plaintiff and its members,and against the backdrop of the indian sovereignty doctrine and the notion that american indian tribes enjoy.this backdrop reinforces plaintiff interpretation that the treaty disallowed involuntary state tax sales,and thus state taxation,of real property held by plaintiff or its members.moreover,this court must read the treaty in favor of one inference if such inference supports the purpose of the treaty and the opposing inference subverts such purpose.winters,at.in this case,the purpose of the treaty was to provide a permanent home for the chippewa indians,a purpose that would be weakened by the interpretation of defendants through the sanctioning of involuntary alienation of land held by plaintiff or its members through tax sales.even setting aside these canons of treaty construction,which are a matter of law and thus support the district court grant of summary judgment,plaintiff interpretation is much more persuasive.as the district court stated it defies logic to believe that the indians would have signed a treaty ceding over seven million acres to the united states,knowing that they could lose the land they kept as a reservation the following year,due to of taxes.at.we agree with cleland that the chippewa indians did not know nor did they have reason to know that,in setting aside a permanent reservation for them,the treaty also required the chippewa indians to pay taxes each year on allotted land,with the potential of losing those allotted lands.
defendants experts provide opinions that we do not find persuasive in the present context.gulig report focuses primarily on the desire of chippewa indians to own land individually to prevent removal and to join the larger societies of the state and the united states.assuming this view to be accurate,gulig report says little as to whether chippewa indians understood that,under the treaty,individual allotment and ownership came with the price tag of state taxation.gulig report makes clear that the chippewa indians sought individual allotments for the benefits such allotments provided,but it does not contain a single piece of evidence that demonstrates that the chippewa indians knew that lands allotted under the treaty would be subject to taxation and the attendant possibility of involuntary alienation.gulig relies heavily on the fact that michigan allowed those american indians whom the state considered civilized to vote in state elections,and the fact that indians wanted to participate as citizens of the state,and taxation was an important part of that citizen participation.at.besides this unsupported conclusory assertion,gulig hardly even mentions taxation.greenwald readily admitted in her report that it was unclear whether the chippewa indians knew of the tax liabilities of land ownership she only concluded that by,the chippewa indians knew that individually held property was subject to taxation.as noted by the district court,this conclusion does not enlighten the court as to what the indians may have believed at the time the treaty was signed and is therefore of little use in interpreting the treaty.at.
in their brief to this court,defendants make two arguments.first,defendants argue that plaintiff interpretation of the treaty can not stand,as it would create a system of perpetual tutelage and would be contrary to a purpose of the treaty to civilize the chippewa indians.we disagree.plaintiff interpretation merely disallows involuntary alienation any voluntary form of alienation,assuming the president has allowed such alienation under article of the treaty,would be permissible.moreover,as defendants readily admit,the point of restrictions on alienation of the land was to encourage the civilizing of the chippewa indians,as there was a concern that the native americans would lose control of the land and thereby end the civilization process.defs.br.thus,plaintiff interpretation is more in line with the purpose of civilizing the chippewa indians by ensuring that they would maintain control of the land by shielding that land from involuntary alienation such as a tax sale.
second,defendants argue that,before a tax sale of allotted land could take place,an allotment in fee simple would have to be made,and such allotment was subject to a series of procedures and safeguards,such as ensuring that the allottee was competent to manage the land.this argument is irrelevant.whether there was procedure in place to ensure an allottee was responsible before an unrestricted allotment took place simply has no bearing as to whether the chippewa indians understood that an allotment was coupled with taxation.
the point is that while plaintiff and defendant interpretations represent competing inferences from ambiguous language in article of the treaty,plaintiff interpretation is far more compelling.the chippewa indians envisioned land set aside for them permanently it simply does not make sense that the chippewa indians would disapprove of the mass removal of their society but would sanction a gradual removal of individuals through involuntary alienation.as cleland notes,this is especially true considering that the chippewa indians did not have much hard currency to pay annual property taxes.like the treaty at issue in the kansas indians,the object of the treaty was to hedge the lands around with guards and restrictions,so as to preserve them for the permanent homes of the indians.in order to accomplish this object,they must be relieved from every species of levy,sale,and a levy and sale for taxes,as well as the ordinary judicial levy and sale.wall.at.likewise,in order to accomplish the object of the treaty,the preservation of a permanent home for the chippewa indians,plaintiff and its members must be relieved of every species of involuntary removal,including a levy and sale for taxes.as a matter of law,the district court was required to read the ambiguous language of the treaty in favor of plaintiff,a decision that was also practically sound.

the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on the ground that congress has not expressed a clear intent to make alienable the property held in fee simple by plaintiff or its members within the reservation.
legal framework 
while the treaty is properly interpreted as preventing the involuntary alienation of,and thus the taxation of,reservation lands held in fee simple by plaintiff or its members,congress may abrogate treaty rights congress must,however,clearly express its intent to do so.mille lacs band of chippewa indians,at.citing united states dion,d.there must be clear evidence that congress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and indian treaty rights on the other,and chose to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty.id.at.quoting dion,at.
independent of congress power to abrogate american indian treaty rights,congress may allow state taxation of american indian reservation lands,but only if it expresses its clear intention to do so.the seminal case of permitted state taxation of american indian reservation lands is goudy meath.the plaintiff,a puyallup indian,claimed that certain property allotted to him under treaty was exempt from state taxation.id.at.the treaty stated that any land allotted under the treaty was exempt from levy,sale,or forfeiture until the formation of a state constitution and the removal of the land restrictions by the state legislature.id.at.the treaty went on to say that a state legislature could not remove the land restrictions without the consent of congress.id.under the treaty,the plaintiff was allotted certain property in.in,congress enacted the indian general allotment act,also known as the dawes act,stat.the dawes act was legislation that allowed the president to allot reservation lands to individual american indians.section of the dawes act stated that land allotted to american indians was freely alienable,after the united states held such allotted land in trust for the allottees for years in,the state of washington joined the united states,and that same year the state legislature passed a law that lifted the land restrictions in the treaty.id.in,congress passed legislation,stat,that allowed the alienability of land allotted to puyallup indians ten years after the passage of that legislation id.the plaintiff recognized that congress had made his allotment freely alienable however,he argued that congress had also not expressly repealed the provision in the treaty that protected his allotment from levy,sale,or forfeiture,so that his allotment was not taxable.id.at.
the supreme court held that the plaintiff allotment was subject to state taxation.the court found that while congress could provide that real property was subject to voluntary alienation but immune from involuntary alienation,congress intent to do so should be clearly manifested.id.at.the court reasoned that from a general perspective,it would seem strange to withdraw this protection against voluntary alienation and permit the indian to dispose of his lands as he pleases,while at the same time releasing it from taxation.id.
in mcclanahan,discussed above,the court,in addition to discussing treaty construction,also addressed congressional approval of state taxation of american indians and their property on a reservation 
state laws generally are not applicable to tribal indians on an indian reservation except where congress has expressly provided that state laws shall apply.it follows that indians and indian property on an indian reservation are not subject to state taxation except by virtue of express authority conferred upon the state by act of congress.

application to this case 
i.the treaty 
the indian sovereignty doctrine serves as a backdrop not only for treaty interpretation but also statutory interpretation as well 
the indian sovereignty doctrine is relevant,then,not because it provides a definitive resolution of the issues in this suit,but because it provides a backdrop against which the applicable treaties and federal statutes must be read.it must always be remembered that the various indian tribes were once independent and sovereign nations,and that their claim to sovereignty long predates that of our own government.

defendants argue that the treaty is sufficient to demonstrate the clear congressional intent necessary to allow state taxation of reservation lands.we disagree.a treaty is not a federal statute or an act of congress.in our view,congress makes its intent to allow state taxation of reservation lands unmistakably clear when it passes a statute to that effect.it is no coincidence that the supreme court used phrases such as federal statutes and act of congress in describing what would be necessary for the court to deem state taxation of reservation lands permissible.a treaty simply does not embody this clear congressional intent,as a treaty ratification only involves the senate,and thus does not have the same bicameral hurdles of an act of congress.defendants argue that because a treaty,under united states law,is and is the law of the land,it is the equivalent of an act of the legislature.we agree that the effect of a treaty has legal import,as does the effect of an act of legislation however,the mere fact that a treaty has legal force does not mean it is an act of congress.all of the cases to which defendants cite stand only for the proposition that,under united states law,a treaty is and does not require additional legislation to take effect.see,foster neilson,pet,overruled on other grounds by united states percheman,pet.while this is true,this does not mean a treaty is in fact an act of congress representing that body will.concededly,legal authority may be derived from sources other than congress,but the fact that a treaty has certain legal import is insufficient to establish tha
