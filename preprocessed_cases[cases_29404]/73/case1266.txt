in this appeal,we address the issue of whether the revenue rule prevents a foreign sovereign from bringing suit in federal court for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,rico involving schemes to avoid the sovereign tax laws.this case is the consolidation of six separate appeals.the republics of belize,honduras and ecuador the republics brought claims against the appellees big tobacco for violations of rico,as well as state and common law claims.the republics now appeal the district court order granting big tobacco rule b motion to dismiss their claims based on the common law revenue rule.after reviewing the record and having the benefit of oral argument,we agree with the district court and hold that the revenue rule requires abstention from passing judgment on the republics claims.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment of dismissal.
background facts 
the republics make various claims regarding the facts underlying this case,but all of the claims follow a common pattern.all of the republics tax tobacco products as a means of regulating smoking in their various countries and providing funds for activities.the republics allege that big tobacco engaged in various illegal schemes to avoid paying these taxes.
the form of the schemes varied.some of the schemes involved smuggling tobacco into the republics to avoid the taxes and then laundering the resulting profits through various illegal money laundering channels.others involved moving tobacco through zones and then selling it to drug smugglers,who presumably smuggled the tobacco into the republics as part of their own money laundering operations.regardless of the specific scheme employed,the republics allege that all of the tobacco companies conspired in one way or another to evade the republics taxes in order to protect big tobacco profits and lower prices to consumers in the republics in order to ensure that the taxes did not deter consumers from smoking.
all of big tobacco alleged schemes,which form the predicate acts to the republics rico claims,were targeted at avoiding the taxes the republics placed on tobacco imported into their respective countries.
ii.standard of review 
we review a dismissal pursuant to rule b de novo,applying the same standard as the district court did.ramsey,cir.
iii.discussion 
this case requires us to determine whether the revenue rule applies in this circuit and,if it does,whether it requires us to abstain from considering the civil rico claims that the republics brought to remedy big tobacco schemes to avoid the republics taxes.
a.the revenue rule 
the revenue rule is a common law rule that prevents the courts of one sovereign from enforcing or adjudicating tax claims from another sovereign although century english courts originally developed the rule to protect british trade it has a long history of recognition and application in this country the rule was originally justified in england on the basis of nationalistic commercial protectionism but its application in this country is based and justified on the grounds of respect for sovereignty and the separation of powers.attorney of canada,at moore,at applying the revenue rule in the context of an tax dispute.this circuit has not previously considered or adopted the rule.we now recognize the continuing vitality of the revenue rule,adopt it as the rule of this circuit and apply it to the facts of this case.
substance over form 
we initially recognize that it is the substance of a claim,not the form,that is important under the revenue rule.attorney of canada,at what matters is not the form of the action,but the substance of the claim.united states boots,cir where a domestic court is effectively passing on the validity and operation of the revenue laws of a foreign country,the important concerns underlying the revenue rule are implicated.see also united states harden,can.sydney mun.counsel bull.if it were otherwise,litigants could freely avoid the impact of the revenue rule by bringing tax claims under the guise of causes of action.that is precisely what the republics are attempting to do here.we agree with the second circuit in rejecting this approach.see attorney of canada,at canada would have a united states court require defendants to reimburse canada for its unpaid taxes,plus a significant penalty due to rico treble damages provision.thus,canada object is clearly to recover allegedly unpaid taxes.
the republics claims fundamentally deal with the adjudication of foreign tax claims.although the republics frame their claims as civil rico violations,their complaints make clear that big tobacco schemes to avoid the republics tax laws is at the heart of all of their claims.taking the republics allegations as true,all of their claims of wire fraud,mail fraud and money laundering involve schemes to avoid paying taxes and seek to collect these unpaid taxes.
the revenue rule applies whether the republics seek to redress these alleged violations through civil rico or direct tax claims.attorney of canada,at,quoting united states harden,can.for the purpose of this case it is sufficient to say that when it appears to the court that the whole object of the suit is to collect tax for a foreign revenue,and that this will be the sole result of a decision in favour of the plaintiff,then a court is entitled to reject the claim by refusing jurisdiction.furthermore,the revenue rule applies regardless of whether the republics frame their damages as the direct loss of tax revenue or the indirect effects of such lost revenue,such as increased law enforcement costs or increased costs of combating smoking.dicey morris,the conflict of laws ed.indirect enforcement occurs where a foreign state or its nominee in form seeks a remedy,not based on the foreign rule in question,but which in substance is designed to give it effect see attorney of canada,at.
therefore,we hold that the republics civil rico claims implicate the revenue rule because,in substance,they seek redress for violations of the republics tax laws.
respect for sovereignty 
tax laws embody a sovereign political will they mirror the moral and social sensibilities of a society.attorney of canada,at.the revenue rule exists to prevent the courts of a sovereign nation from enforcing policy choices of a foreign sovereign that might run counter to its own.moore,at hand,concurring no court ought to undertake an inquiry which it can not prosecute without determining whether another sovereign laws are consonant with its own notions of what is proper.see also attorney of canada,at.we find this justification for the revenue rule compelling.
the republics complaints make clear that their tax laws embody policies directed at protecting their citizens from the health hazards of smoking,both by attempting to discourage smoking by raising the price of cigarettes and by providing revenue for programs.while we may personally applaud the republics efforts in this regard,it is not our role to promote these policies by enforcing their tax laws.because the tax laws underlying the republics rico claims embody specific policy choices,we hold that the revenue rule applies to these claims and prevents us from considering them.
the revenue rule also aims to promote harmony between sovereigns by preventing one sovereign from asserting its political will in another sovereign through actions to enforce its revenue laws.see banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d white,dissenting our courts customarily refuse to enforce the revenue and penal laws of a foreign state,since no country has an obligation to further the governmental interests of a foreign sovereign see also attorney of canada,at.the republics claims directly implicate this aspect of the revenue rule because they seek to use the rico act as a means of enforcing the tax laws that big tobacco allegedly violated.if we were to provide them with the relief they seek,we would be allowing them to assert their sovereign political will,as embodied in their tax laws,in our country.this is precisely what the revenue rule exists to prevent.
we recognize that the respect for sovereignty justification for the revenue rule is
