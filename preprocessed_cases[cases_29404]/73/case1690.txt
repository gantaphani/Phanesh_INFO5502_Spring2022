in this declaratory relief action the plaintiff independent energy producers association,iepa,which represents the interests of independent electric generating facilities,asserts that the california state board of equalization the board improperly assessed certain of its members property for taxation.iepa asserts that after deregulation of the energy market in california in,when utilities were required to sell off generating facilities,the board improperly enacted a rule,which was codified by the legislature in a statute,allowing the board to assess some of these generating facilities on the basis that they were public utilities within the meaning of the california constitution.in response,iepa filed this action challenging the board assessment and brought a motion for summary adjudication of issues,contending that the board had no jurisdiction to assess such electric generating facilities as they are not regulated public utilities and the statutory authority for the board assessment of these generating facilities violated the terms of article xiii a,section of the california constitution proposition as it was passed with less than a vote by the california legislature.the court denied iepa motion for summary judgment finding that the board has jurisdiction to assess the property of independent electric generators and its assessment of the electric generators did not violate proposition.the parties and the court agreed that the court decision covered the principal issues presented by iepa action and that judgment should therefore be entered in favor of the board to facilitate an appeal.
on appeal iepa asserts that the court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment as under the california constitution,the board only has jurisdiction over regulated public utilities the independent electric generating facilities are not public utilities and even if the board had jurisdiction to assess independent electric generating facilities,it violated proposition because the change in assessment was not accomplished by a vote of the legislature.we affirm.
factual background 
the original board,a creature of the legislature,was intended to keep intercounty tax assessment levels uniform,ch.in,however,the california supreme court held that the board intercounty equalization functions were an unconstitutional delegation of power.houghton austin cal.the board was thereafter reconstituted in the constitution and given the specific power to raise and lower entire county assessment rolls to achieve equality among the counties.the board authority is now contained in article xiii,sections,and of the state constitution.
with regard to the board assessment of utilities,article xiii,section of the california constitution provides in part 
the board shall annually assess pipelines,flumes,canals,ditches,and aqueducts lying within or more counties and property,except franchises,owned or used by regulated railway,telegraph,or telephone companies,car companies operating on railways in the state,and companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity.this property shall be subject to taxation to the same extent and in the same manner as other property.italics added.
prior to deregulation of the electric industry in,the electrical industry was vertically integrated,with traditional electric public utilities having monopoly rights to generate,transmit,distribute and sell electricity.property owned and used by those public utilities,including electric generation facilities,was assessed by the board.state bd.of equalization,final statement of reasons,amend.of property tax rule april,italics added.deregulation required the regulated public utilities to divest themselves of certain fossil fuel powered generation facilities.at the same time,a number of new generation facilities were being constructed with the purpose of entering into the wholesale electricity market.id.at.
questions thereafter arose as to whether the purchasers of such facilities would be assessed for property tax purposes by state or local authorities.the board initially considered assessing electric generating facilities with a capacity of megawatts or more facilities with less capacity would be assessed at the county level.state bd.of equalization,property taxes,formal issue paper.the board determined that article xiii,section had always been interpreted as applying only to public utilities,but that independent electric generating facilities had all the characteristics of public utilities.state bd.of equalization,property taxes,formal issue paper,supra.the board also noted,however,that it also had the power to decline to exercise its jurisdiction over certain companies and their facilities even if they came within the definition of a public utility.ibid.
in the end,however,after a period of extensive comment,the board in elected to promulgate a new regulation,tit,original rule,which provided that the only electric generation facilities that would be state assessed were those constructed pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn issued by the california public utilities commission cpuc,or that were owned by companies otherwise subject to state assessment.state bd.of equalization,final statement of reasons,amend.of property tax rule,supra.all other generation facilities would be assessed by the county assessor in the county in which the facility was located.ibid.original rule provided in this regard 
an electric generation facility shall be state assessed property for purposes of article xiii,section of the california constitution if the facility was constructed pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the cpuc to the company that presently owns the facility or,the company owning the facility is a state assessee for reasons other than its ownership of the generation facility or its ownership of pipelines,flumes,canals,ditches,or aqueducts lying within two or more counties,tit.
however,in november eff.beginning in,as a result of the energy crisis in california,the board issued an amended rule amended rule to take back from the county assessors the assessment of certain generation facilities that had generating capacity of megawatts and whose owners would be defined as electric corporations or were otherwise subject to assessment by the board 
a commencing with the assessment for the lien date for the assessment year,an electric generation facility shall be state assessed property for purposes of article xiii,section of the california constitution if the facility has a generating capacity of megawatts or more and is owned or used by a company which is an electrical corporation as defined in subdivisions a and b of section of the public utilities code or,the facility is owned or used by a company which is a state assessee for reasons other than its ownership of the electric generation facility or its ownership of pipelines,flumes,canals,ditches,or aqueducts lying within two or more counties.b electric generation facility does not include a qualifying small power production facility or a qualifying cogeneration facility,tit,eff.june.
in the legislature adopted assembly bill reg.sess,adding revenue and taxation code section,which codified amended rule 
c ommencing with the lien date for the fiscal year,the board shall annually assess every electric generation facility with a generating capacity of megawatts or more that is owned or operated by an electrical corporation 
the immediate result was that,beginning in,numerous electric generating facilities that were divested by public utility companies following deregulation and were subject to local assessment under original rule would now be state assessed.newly constructed postderegulation plants would be similarly assessed.initially,independent electric generating facilities were designated to become subject to the board assessment as of january.it is the state assessment of these independent electric generating facilities that iepa challenges on this appeal 
procedural background 
iepa,a trade association representing the interests of independent electric generating facilities,filed a complaint for declaratory relief to determine the validity of and amended rule pursuant to government code section,code of civil procedure section and revenue and taxation code section.the complaint stated two causes of action.the first was directed at the scope of the board assessment jurisdiction.it sought a declaration that the phrase regulated railway,telegraph,or telephone companies,car companies operating on railways in the state,and companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity contained in article xiii,section meant that the board was limited to assessment of regulated public utilities that and amended rule were unconstitutional and void and that an electric generation facility could be centrally assessed by the board under article xiii,section only if the facility was constructed pursuant to a cpcn issued by the cpuc to the company that owned the facility or the company owning the facility was already a state assessee for reasons other than its ownership of the generating facility,under the conditions specified by the original rule.
the second cause of action was pleaded in the alternative and addressed the applicability of proposition to generators of electricity in the event that and amended rule were found to be constitutional.the second cause of action sought a declaration that the independent generators could not be assessed by the board under the principal of unitary assessment,but instead were to be assessed as discrete combinations of real and personal property subject to proposition.
iepa filed a motion for summary adjudication of issues.the court denied the motion,concluding that independent generators fell within the definition of public utility used in article xii,section of the california constitution because they are producers of power 
does assembly bill no.rule,promulgated pursuant to the provisions of assembly bill no,violate article xiii,section,of the california constitution article xiii,section,allows the legislature to add additional public utilities to the board for assessment purposes.based on the definitions of public utilities as found in article xii,section,plaintiffs appear to fall within the definition of a public utility in that they are producers of power.whether plaintiffs are or are not public utilities,as defined by story richardson cal,story or an attorney general opinion,is but superfluous to this decision as plaintiffs herein appear simply and clearly to be producers of energy covered by article xii,section.as an aside,case authority such as story appears to hold that if a producer of power in fact does not confine its sales to private individuals,it is or can be considered a public utility.again,per the declaration of andrew brown,and exhibit b thereto,at least of companies have department of water resources contracts.
the trial court also rejected iepa assertion that changed the method of tax and thus required a vote of the legislature pursuant to proposition 
article xiii a,section,requires at least vote of all members elected to each of the two houses of the legislature in order to effect any change in state taxes enacted for the purpose of increasing revenues collected pursuant thereto whether by increased rates or changes in methods of computation.is such a tax change measure does not itself specify an increase in the tax rate,nor does it embody in its terms a change in the methods of computation.it does change for plaintiffs the body having jurisdiction to assess taxes,from counties to the board.the board is a body distinct from the cpuc which has jurisdiction to assess public utilities.the method,fair market value x,is the method of calculation used by both the counties and the board at all relevant times both before and after deregulation.the fact that such change in assessor may result in a tax increase or was intended by some to result in a tax increase does not in itself transform this piece of legislation into a tax change regulation.if the result of is a higher or lower tax paid by plaintiff in a particular year,it is but fortuitous.proposition protection,as may or would be afforded to plaintiffs is they continued to be assessed by the counties,would be lost however.
counsel for both parties and the court concurred that the essential issues in iepa complaint had been decided by the court denial of iepa motion.the parties therefore consented to entry of judgment in the board favor in order to facilitate an appeal following the court determination of the issues presented.iepa timely appeal followed.
discussion 
three core issues are presented by iepa appeal.first,is the board jurisdiction limited to assessment of public utilities second,are independent generating facilities public utilities within the meaning of article xii,section of the california constitution third,did effect a tax increase on the facilities property and thereby violate proposition as not having been passed by a majority of the legislature 
we first conclude that the board jurisdiction under article xiii,section is limited to public utilities.second,we hold that the independent electric generating facilities at issue in this litigation meet the definition of public utilities.third,we conclude that did not violate proposition 
standard of review 
where,as here,the facts are undisputed,we independently review the construction and application of the disputed statute to the undisputed facts.murphy padilla th,d see also lazar hertz th,d we independently construe statutory law,as its interpretation is a question of law on which we are not bound by the trial court analysis.
ii.principles of statutory interpretation 
because our analysis of the issues raised by this appeal requires our interpretation of statutes and the california constitution,we begin with a discussion of some of the applicable principles of statutory interpretation.
plain language of article xiii,section 
we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.in determining intent,we look first to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.citations.although we may properly rely on extrinsic aids,we should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the legislature.citation.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.burden snowden cal th,d,see also lungren deukmejian cal d,if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature.the rules of statutory construction apply equally to constitutional provisions.pipe line state bd.of equalization cal d.
legislative intent 
i f the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.citation.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d,see also harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.the legislative history of article xiii,section is entitled to great weight.see hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d.
iii.article xiii,section allows assessment of only public utilities 
from the plain language of article xiii,section,it would appear that the board has the power to assess all companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity,including independent electric generators,regardless of whether they constitute public utilities.however,a historical review of article xiii,section and in particular its predecessor article xiii,section demonstrates that despite what appears to be the clear language of section,it has always been interpreted as giving assessment jurisdiction to the board only over public utilities 
a.the constitutional amendment and story decision 
the board assessment authority over public utilities which sell electricity was first established in,when the constitution was amended to replace the locally administered property tax with a centrally controlled tax on certain types of businesses,including public utilities.the amendment,creating article xiii,section,is the predecessor provision to the current article xiii,section.as amended in,article xiii,section provided in part 
taxes levied,assessed and collected as hereinafter provided upon railroads,car companies companies doing express business on any railroad,steamboat,vessel or stage line in this state telegraph companies telephone companies companies engaged in the transmission or sale of gas or electricity insurance companies banks,banking associations,savings and loan societies,and trust companies and taxes upon all franchises of every kind and nature,shall be entirely and exclusively for state purposes,and shall be levied,assessed and collected in the manner hereinafter provided.italics added.
in story,supra,cal,the california supreme court considered whether article xiii,section covered the owner of an office building who supplied electrical energy to tenants of his own building,as well as to nontenants occupying nearby property.the board attempted to assert assessment jurisdiction to assess his sales of electricity.in response story argued that,despite the broad language of article xiii,section,the state constitutional authority was limited to the assessment of public utilities.the supreme court agreed with story,holding the assessment invalid because he was not a public utility for purposes of article xiii,section.in doing so,the high court reviewed the legislative history of article xiii,section,and gave strong weight to printed ballot arguments and the report of an appointed constitution revision commission in interpreting its language.story,supra,cal.at.after reviewing this legislative history,the high court determined that article xiii,section authority to assess transmitters of electricity was intended to apply only to public utilities the provision of the constitution here under consideration was adopted by the people of the state at the election of november,as the result of a movement to separate state and local taxation.in a commission was authorized to investigate the system of revenue and taxation in force in this state and recommend a revision thereof.stats.the commission appointed proposed an amendment to the constitution citation.the amendment as adopted was fundamentally the same as that proposed by the commission in its report in the commissioner recommended a separation of the sources of state and county revenue and that the property of certain public utilities and certain other corporations,namely,banks and insurance companies,be taxed solely for the benefit of the state.the theory of the report was that an ad valorem system of taxation was unsatisfactory in that it failed to distribute equally the burden of taxation,particularly in view of the fact that in certain cases,such as public utilities,banks,and insurance companies,the greatest value lay in the extent and nature of operation rather than in the intrinsic worth of separate items of property.accordingly,a uniform scheme was proposed for the taxation of certain enumerated public utilities,including electrical companies,and that system was that the tax should equal a certain percentage of gross receipts special methods were prescribed for the taxation of banks and insurance companies.throughout the report electrical companies were classified and discussed as one group of public utilities to be taxed upon gross receipts.in the printed arguments submitted to the voters in,at the time the constitutional amendment was voted upon,the gross receipts method of taxation was advocated solely for public utilities.it is clear both from the report of the commission proposing the amendment and the arguments advanced to those voting upon the adoption of the amendment,as well as from the nature of the amendment,that the provision for taxation in proportion to gross receipts is applicable only to public utilities.story,supra,cal.at,italics added see also hobart estate waters cal,the cases are numerous to the effect that to remove property from local taxation and place it under the jurisdiction of the board the property must be used exclusively in the operation of a public utility city of oakland,cal.cir.
the high court then held that the plaintiff was not a public utility because he had not devoted his facilities to public use the essential feature of a public use is that it is not confined to privileged individuals,but is open to the indefinite public.it is this indefiniteness or unrestricted quality that gives it its public character.story,supra,cal.at,quoting thayer california development cal,thayer.the court concluded that t here was no such general offer on the part of plaintiff.plaintiff plant was designed primarily and for supplying service to the tenants of his own building,and the special sales of electrical energy and steam were wholly subsidiary and ancillary to this main purpose.story,supra,cal.at.
b.the constitutional amendment 
the great depression devastated california economy.in response,there was proposed a combination of tax increases and property tax relief known as the tax plan.a key provision of the tax plan was to repeal the gross receipts tax imposed on public utilities put into effect in.under the new approach,the board would commence ad valorem assessment of utility and railroad property.itt world communications,city and county of san francisco cal d,itt world communications.
the tax plan amended article xiii,section.however,as amended,article xiii,section,retained its pertinent language as to the scope of the board assessment authority that had previously been interpreted to include only public utilities 
all pipe lines,flumes,canals,ditches and aqueducts not entirely within the limits of any one county,and all property,other than franchises,owned or used by companies engaged in the transmission or sale of gas or electricity,shall be assessed annually by the state board of equalization,at the actual value of such property.italics added.
after the constitution was amended in,the california supreme court again construed this language of article xiii,section to apply only to public utilities.pipe line state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d at,t here are two classes of property enumerated in the,pipe lines,flumes,and second,all property,other than franchises,of public utilities,italics added.
california attorney general interpretation 
in the,the california attorney general construed article xiii,section,despite its broad language,as applying only to public utilities 
although section on its face would appear to require the assessment by the state board of equalization of all property owned or used by all companies engaged in the transmission or sale of gas or electricity regardless of whether they are public utilities,the history of the constitutional provision and the contemporaneous and administrative construction afforded it indicate that it should not be so construed.upon investigation,we have found that the state board of equalization has consistently over the years assessed the property only of those companies engaged in the transmission of gas or electricity under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the california public utilities commission see section and sections,et of the public utilities code.it has not attempted to assess the property of a company not so certificated,as it has construed the constitutional language in question as inapplicable to companies which are not public utilities,italics omitted.
d.the constitutional amendment 
in,article xiii,section was amended and renumbered as the current article xiii,section.however,the amendment was not substantive.the text of article xiii,section,as it now reads,provides in part 
the board shall annually assess property,except franchises,owned or used by regulated railway,telegraph,or telephone companies,car companies operating on railways in the state,and companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity.the legislature may authorize board assessment of property owned or used by other public utilities.italics added.
comparing former section with section,in light of the legislative history of section,it is apparent that article xiii,section was intended to have the same meaning as article xiii,section.the purpose of the amendment was only to modernize and streamline language by eliminating legalese.there was no substantive change in the meaning of the provision.under settled rules of construction,we must therefore presume that the courts previous interpretation of former article xiii,section was preserved and reincorporated into the constitution when the voters adopted the substance of that provision as the current article xiii,section.sarracino superior court cal d,adoption of constitutional language similar to former constitutional provision presumed to incorporate authoritative judicial construction of former language in re harris cal d,drafters of initiative measure and voters deemed to know judicial construction of law serving as its source.
after the amendment,the california supreme court reiterated its longstanding interpretation that board assessment jurisdiction under section applied only to public utilities t he purpose of article xiii,section is broadly to authorize the unit taxation of public utility property and more narrowly to a ssure adequate valuation of utility property.itt world communications,supra,cal d at,italics added.
in sum,the statutory history of article xiii,section reveals that,despite the broad language granting assessment jurisdiction over companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity,that phrase has always been interpreted to mean only public utilities.
iv.independent electric generators are public utilities 
now that we have determined that the legislative history of article xiii,section and its predecessor allow only public utilities to be assessed by the board,we must turn to the core issue on this appeal are independent electric generation facilities considered public utilities within the meaning of the california constitution as we shall explain below,they fall within the definition of utilities as they are entities that have dedicated their property for the provision of power to the public.
article xii,section of the california constitution provides the following definition of public utilities 
private corporations and persons that own,operate,control,or manage a line,plant,or system for the transportation of people or property,the transmission of telephone and telegraph messages,or the production,generation,transmission,or furnishing of heat,light,water,power,storage,or wharfage directly or indirectly to or for the public,and common carriers,are public utilities subject to control by the legislature.the legislature may prescribe that additional classes of private corporations or other persons are public utilities.italics added.
the statutory definition of public utility established by the public utilities code is similar a public utility includes every electrical corporation where the service is performed for,or the commodity is delivered to,the public or any portion thereof,subd.a.
however,although not expressly contained in article xii,section,the state constitution also requires a dedication to public use to transform private businesses into a public utility.allen railroad commission cal,allen associated.railroad commission cal,frost railroad commission cal,revd.on other grounds in frost railroad commission of state of california.case law has also recognized that the legislature,by its repeated reenactment of the definition of public utilities without change,has accepted and adopted dedication as an implicit limitation on that term.greyhound lines,public utilities com.cal d,richfield oil public util.com.cal d,richfield oil.
the test for determining whether dedication has occurred is whether or not a person has held himself out,expressly or impliedly,as engaged in the business of supplying a service or commodity to the public as a class,not necessarily to all of the public,but to any limited portion of it,such portion,for example,as could be served by his system,as contradistinguished from his holding himself out as serving or ready to serve only particular individuals,either as an accommodation or for other reasons peculiar and particular to them.van hoosear railroad commission cal,van hoosear.as the california supreme court stated in finding that the landlord in story was not a public utility the essential feature of a public use is that it is not confined to privileged individuals,but is open to the indefinite public.it is this indefiniteness or unrestricted quality that gives it its public character.story,supra,cal.at,quoting thayer,supra,cal.at.the court concluded that t here was no such general offer on the part of plaintiff.plaintiff plant was designed primarily and for supplying service to the tenants of his own building,and the special sales of electrical energy and steam were wholly subsidiary and ancillary to this main purpose.story,supra,cal.at.
further,whether or not dedication has occurred is a factual issue,to be determined on a basis.courts caution that t o hold that property has been dedicated to a public use is not a trivial thing citation,and such dedication is never presumed without evidence of unequivocal intention.allen,supra,cal.at.however,such dedication may be inferred from action and need not be explicit.greyhound lines,public utilities,supra,cal d at,citing yucaipa water.public utilities com.cal d.
under the test for dedication to public use required for public utilities expressed in van hoosear,the electric generation facilities at issue meet the test.they are operated for the purpose of selling electricity in the competitive public marketplace,they have dedicated their facilities to generating and selling power to the public.indeed,much of the power generated by these facilities was committed to contracts entered into with a public agency,the department of water resources dwr,for use by the public at large.pursuant to those contracts,they are obligated to deliver this power on demand.many of the facilities have been constructed with the assistance of public funds and commitments from public agencies.the facilities were constructed after site certification and regulation by the california energy commission.as the board stated in determining that amended rule properly assessed the electric generation facilities as public utilities 
in the board view,there is no question that the generation facilities that would be board assessed under the amended rule will produce,generate,transmit power directly or indirectly to the public.for example,we are advised by the staff of the california energy commission that approximately of the available generation capacity of the plants subject to the contracts with dwr are covered by the contracts.that power was purchased by a public agency on behalf of the public for transmission to the public.other generation facilities in question are operated for the purpose of selling electricity in the competitive public marketplace.the other facilities must use the statewide grid to sell their power to the public.companies owning the generation facilities covered by the rule are,therefore,public utilities within the meaning of the constitution.
these facts compel the conclusion that the generation facilities at issue on this appeal meet the dedication requirements to be considered public utilities.
iepa asserts that independent generators of electricity are not public utilities because they they have never dedicated their property to the public.however,iepa submits no evidence in support of this contention or explanation why the above evidence is not sufficient to show public dedication.rather,iepa only argues that dwr contracts do not make independent generators public utilities,as merely selling electricity does not render the seller a public utility.
it is true as iepa contends that in and of itself selling electricity does not result in a dedication sufficient to make an entity a public utility.thayer,supra,cal.at,merely selling water does not result in dedication of water rights to public use power borland,power generating electricity alone does not constitute dedication to public richfield oil,supra,cal d at,selling natural gas does not alone establish dedication to public story,supra,cal.at,merely selling electricity does not establish dedication.however,in each of these cases where the party was found not to be a public utility,it either sold its product to only a few select individuals or entities,not to the public at large,or did not sell to the public in california.thayer,supra,cal.at,it appears,therefore,that the development company has always,either directly or through the auxiliary companies,selected the persons to whom it would sell and distribute the water and fixed its own prices.a use thus restricted,limited,and controlled by the owner is in no proper sense a public use story,supra,cal.at,landlord who sold electricity to only tenants and select occupants of nearby buildings power,supra.at,power generated for public use in nevada,not california.in richfield oil,supra,cal d at pages,the court merely held that in determining an oil and gas producer public utility status,it was required to distinguish between that portion of its business not dedicated to public use and that portion where it supplied excess reserves to utilities,which might be considered a public dedication.
where,as here,the electric generation facilities supply electricity to the general public,they are considered to have made a dedication of their property to the public so as to be considered a public utility.for example,with regard to water suppliers,public dedication was found in one case where there was appropriation of water for an avowed public use,construction of a canal system for the same purpose,offer to the public of water service as a utility,and making of contracts obligating the company to serve water to contractees.western canal railroad commission cal,see also williamson railroad commission cal.
further,if the public nature of the business activity is established,it matters not that sales are to only a few customers or that the entity only indirectly serves the public by making sales to a utility a utility that has dedicated its property to public use is a public utility even though it may serve only one or a few customers or a utility that in turn serves the public a public utility that has been serving the public directly remains such even though it turns its distributing system over to a publicly or privately owned utility and thereafter limits its own business to supplying the utility that directly serves the public.richfield oil,supra,cal d at,see also commercial communications public util.com.cal d.
iepa has not attempted to show that independent electric generators do not provide a service or commodity to the public as a class,as distinguished from provision to only particular individuals as only an accommodation or with contracts peculiar to those individuals.thus,the generating facilities at issue in this case meet the public dedication requirement of public utilities.van hoosear,supra,cal.at.
iepa then argues that independent electric generators are not utilities because the legislature,board and cpuc have acknowledged that they are not.however,iepa citations do not support its position.
iepa first cites to the legislative history of for the proposition that the legislature characterized independent generators as.iepa cites the following passage the bill is intended to transfer the assessment responsibility for electric generating facilities from local assessors to the board.off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.may,italics added.iepa then cites the following passage from the senate revenue and tax committee the electric deregulation legislation ab required public utilities to divest themselves of their major generating facilities.as a result generating facilities were sold by utilities to power companies the bill is intended to transfer the assessment responsibility for owned electric generating facilities from local assessors to the state board of equalization.tax,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.july,italics added.
a plain reading of these provisions does not support iepa assertion.rather,these passages only stated that with deregulation,utilities sold the generating facilities to nonutility power companies.they did not say that the generating facilities themselves could not be considered utilities under the california constitution,applicable statutes or case law.
in its opening brief iepa next purports to quote a board staff report regarding the then pending original rule for the same proposition 
t he board does not currently assess industries that do not operate under a cpcn from the california public utilities commission and are not rate regulated since its enactment,article xiii,section and its antecedent provisions have been interpreted and understood to define and apply to assessment of public utilities.indeed,article xiii,section refers to other public utilities in the next to the last paragraph of that section.it is true the legislature has determined that the sole fact of owning or operating an ioc investor owned companies generation facility does not make an ioc a public utility for purposes of regulation pub.section,subd.g currently,the basic test for state assessment used by the board is whether a company selling electricity is required to operate under a cpcn or comparable license italics added by iepa.
however,as indicated from the brackets we have placed in the above quote from iepa brief,iepa misquotes this passage.the first bracketed sentence is from page three of the document and the sentences that follow it are from page six,thus taking the statements out of context.state bd.of equalization,property taxes,formal issue paper,supra,at.the bracketed last sentence does not appear in the quoted paragraph.rather,the sentence that ends with a citation to the public utilities code is followed by a semicolon and the passage however,for the purpose of determining assessment jurisdiction,these companies owning generation facilities have most of the characteristics of a public entity.further,these generation plants are within the definition of public utilities set out in article xii,section,of the california constitution state bd.of equalization,property taxes,formal issue paper,supra,at,italics added.thus,an accurate quotation of the paragraph actually supports the board position as it stated that independent generating facilities have the characteristics of public utilities and are within the constitutional definition.the second bracketed sentence that iepa added to the quote appears three paragraphs away at the bottom of page six.this sentence,combined with the sentence that follows it,again supports the board position currently,the basic test for state assessment used by the board is whether a company selling electricity is required to operate under a cpcn or comparable license.while that test has worked well over the years,the advent of restructuring suggests a revision of the board position on this issue,and it is within the board authority to make a revision,italics added.thus,again,an accurate quote of the passage reveals that the board was reflecting on prederegulation policy,and the fact that the board could and should change its test as generating facilities,after deregulation,would not be operating under a cpcn anymore.further,that paragraph discussed the fact that the board had the power and jurisdiction to assess generating facilities as public utilities or,in its discretion,to decline to exercise such discretion.
iepa also quotes the following passage from the board final statement of reasons for original rule rule is consistent with the analysis that the board authority regarding the assessment of electric companies is to assess electric public utilities in that there is county assessment of the electric generation plants that are not operated by,or as,traditional public utilities.italics added.however,t
