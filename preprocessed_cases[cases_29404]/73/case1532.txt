olive lane industrial park olive lane owned real property that was taken by eminent domain.within four years after the eminent domain order,olive lane acquired another parcel of property about five and years after the eminent domain order,for purposes of calculating property taxes on its new property,olive lane filed a request with the san diego county tax assessor county to transfer the condemned property base year value to the replacement property,as permitted by california constitution,article xiiia article xiiia.the county denied olive lane request as untimely under revenue and taxation code section 
article xiiia,enacted through the adoption of proposition,provided broad scale property tax relief by restructuring the manner in which property taxes are calculated.proposition rolled back the valuations of the property the base year value to the tax year placed a cap on the percentage of the base year value that was taxable and then allowed increases in the base year value to the current market value only in certain situations,including when there is a change in ownership of the property.following proposition,the voters adopted several other propositions that extended the property tax relief by removing specific transactions from the category that permits increases in base year value and ensuing increases in the property taxes.among these additional propositions adopted by the voters,proposition amended article xiiia to provide that property acquired to replace property taken by eminent domain does not constitute a change in ownership that permits base year value reassessment.
the legislature,in turn,enacted section to set a time limit on the exercise of the proposition exclusion.section provides the taxpayer shall file a request for the transfer of the base year value to an eminent domain replacement property within four years after the eminent domain order,and allows for retroactive application of the transferred base year value based on the date of acquisition of the replacement property.thus,section addresses the situation where a taxpayer,within four years after the eminent domain order,both acquires the replacement property,and files a claim with the county for the transfer of the condemned property base year value to the replacement property.however,section is silent on whether a taxpayer,such as olive lane,may obtain prospective application of the base year value transfer in the event the replacement property is acquired within the period,but the claim with the county is filed after the period.
after evaluating the constitutional and statutory provisions as a whole,we conclude the legislature did not intend to deprive a taxpayer who loses property through eminent domain of the right to obtain prospective application of the base year value transfer in the event the replacement property is acquired within the period but the claim is filed after the period.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.
background 
on july,a final condemnation order was recorded that relinquished olive lane real property to the california department of transportation in eminent domain proceedings.on december,about three and years after the eminent domain order,olive lane purchased another parcel of land.based on the purchase,the base year value for the land was assessed at.in,olive lane completed new construction on the land.thereafter,on december,about five and years after the eminent domain order,olive lane filed a claim with the county requesting that the property tax base year value of the condemned property be transferred to the land it acquired in as a replacement property.olive lane maintained that the base year value for the replacement property should be plus adjustments for inflation instead of 
on december,the county denied the request,stating it was untimely because it was not filed within four years of the july,eminent domain order as required by section.on november,olive lane appealed the denial of its claim to the county assessment appeals board.at a hearing on february,the board denied the appeal.
after unsuccessfully pursuing its administrative remedies,olive lane timely filed a complaint in superior court requesting that the county be ordered to grant its base year value transfer claim and to refund the excess property taxes it had paid.olive lane argued that section time limitation was unconstitutional because it contradicted the provision in article xiiia that removed eminent domain replacement property from the category that permits base year value reassessments.alternatively,olive lane asserted that,given the constitutional provision,it was unreasonable to interpret section in a manner that denied even prospective relief to eminent domain replacement property claims filed after the deadline.in opposition,the county argued section time limitation was a reasonable regulation of the constitutional provision.alternatively,the county asserted the property purchased in did not qualify as a replacement property because it was acquired by a different owner than the owner of the condemned property.
in october,the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the county,ruling the legislature has the power to set reasonable time limitations for the exercise of constitutional rights,and the time limitation was reasonable.in its written ruling,the court stated i understand that given the particular facts and circumstances of this case that plaintiff may not perceive it to be reasonable,that from plaintiff perspective,there were extenuating circumstances that should warrant the statute being extended or relief being given to estop the county from imposing a s short a time frame as four years upon plaintiff.but given the totality of the circumstances,generally speaking,the court finds that statute of limitations is reasonable.based on its ruling premised on the limitations period,the court declined to address the county additional argument that olive lane was not entitled to relief because the owners of the condemned property and the replacement property were different.
discussion 
on appeal,the parties reiterate the assertions they made before the trial court,with olive lane arguing that section time limitation unconstitutionally conflicts with article xiiia,and the county asserting the time limitation is a reasonable regulation of the constitutional provision.we first summarize the relevant law,including the constitutional provision applicable to eminent domain takings,and the constitutional and statutory provisions that govern property taxation after the adoption of proposition.
overview of the governing law 
when the government takes property by eminent domain,the property owner is constitutionally entitled to just compensation,which means the owner shall be put in as good position pecuniarily as he would have been if his property had not been taken.redevelopment agency gilmore cal d,italics omitted cal,art.i,subd.a.the just compensation is generally determined by the fair market value of the property,and it does not typically include losses or expenses which are merely consequential to displacement or relocation.redevelopment agency gilmore,supra,at.recognizing that eminent domain just compensation awards might not include compensation for increased property taxes,in the voters approved proposition,which amended the california constitution to provide relief from increased property taxes on property acquired to replace property taken by eminent domain.ballot,primary june,analysis of by the legislative analyst,t he amount of compensation provided property owners displaced by governmental action is limited to the fair market value of the property plus certain other amounts,including relocation expenses.this amount of compensation under prior law,however,does not include any amount for increased property taxes that the owner must pay on a replacement property.
proposition,along with a number of other propositions,was adopted in the aftermath of proposition constitutional enactment providing real property tax relief.the changes accomplished by proposition and the ensuing propositions are set forth in article xiiia.under proposition,real property taxes are limited to a maximum of percent of the base year value,with a maximum percent annual increase for inflation.art.xiiia,subd.a,subd.b strong state bd.of equalization th,duea county of san diego th.the base year value is set at the assessor fair market valuation as of the tax year,and thereafter the base year value may be increased to the current fair market value only upon a purchase,change in ownership,or new construction.art.xiiia,subd.a strong state bd.of equalization,supra,th at.
through several propositions adopted after proposition,article xiiia was further amended to allow for extension of the property tax relief to certain types of transactions,these transactions are excluded from reassessment so that the base year value remains with,or transfers to,the property and there is no increase in taxes.see wunderlich county of santa cruz th,fn.the excluded transactions set forth in the constitution include a transfer of the same property between parents and children,and a purchase of a different property to replace property taken by eminent domain,destroyed in a disaster,contaminated,or acquired by a person over age or severely disabled.art.xiiia,subds.a,d,e,h,i.
for several of these exclusions,including for replacement property after eminent domain takings and for transfers between parents and children,article xiiia affirmatively states the transactions are not included in the term change in ownership that permits base year value reassessment.art.xiiia,subds.d,h.relevant here,the eminent domain constitutional exclusion provision states for purposes of this section,the term change in ownership does not include the acquisition of real property as a replacement for comparable property if the person acquiring the real property has been displaced from the property replaced by eminent domain proceedings,by acquisition by a public entity,or governmental action that has resulted in a judgment of inverse condemnation.the real property acquired shall be deemed comparable to the property replaced if it is similar in size,utility,and function,or if it conforms to state regulations defined by the legislature governing the relocation of persons displaced by governmental actions art.xiiia,subd.d,italics added.similarly,the constitutional exclusion provision states for purposes of subdivision a,the terms purchased and change in ownership do not include the purchase or transfer of the principal residence of the transferor in the case of a purchase or transfer between parents and their children,as defined by the legislature,and the purchase or transfer of the first one million dollars of the full cash value of all other real property between parents and their children,as defined by the legislature art.xiiia,subd.h italics added.
article xiiia contains no time requirements for enforcement of either the eminent domain replacement property exclusion or the exclusion.however,time limitations are set forth in the revenue and taxation code.concerning the eminent domain exclusion,section sets forth a time period for filing a request for assessment of a property as a replacement property,stating persons acquiring replacement property shall request assessment within four years of the date the property was acquired by eminent domain,subd.b,italics added.further,section allows for retroactive application of the base year value,stating the transferred base year value for the replacement property shall be effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the property is acquired,italics added.the section time limitation is also set forth in an administrative regulation that states the period commences upon the recording of the condemnation order,tit,subd.g.
for the exclusion,the code states an eligibility claim shall be filed within three years after the transfer,or within six months after the mailing of a notice of supplemental or escape assessment,subd.e b,c.further,the code provides that if a exclusion claim is filed subsequent to the expiration of these filing periods,the assessor shall consider the claim,except the exclusion shall apply prospectively,commencing in the assessment year in which the claim is filed,subd.e a.
article xiiia also includes several exclusions that make no reference to the concept of change in ownership,but rather state the legislature shall or may enact the exclusions,for replacement of property damaged from a disaster or contamination,and for replacement of property by persons over age or severely disabled.art.xiiia,subds.a,e,i.unlike for the eminent domain and parent child exclusions,article xiiia itself contains time limits for the enforcement of some of these exclusions,which range from two to five years for the acquisition of replacement property upon the occurrence of the triggering event.art.xiiia,subd.i a deadline for replacement of contaminated property subd.e deadline for acquisition of replacement of property damaged in disaster subd.a deadline for replacement of property by person over age or severely disabled.the revenue and taxation code mirrors the time limits for acquisition of the replacement property specified in article xiiia,and also sets forth additional time limits,including deadlines for filing claims with the county after the acquisition of the replacement property 
ii.analysis 
to the extent olive lane broadly asserts that the absence of a time limitation in article xiiia precludes the legislature from imposing any time limitations concerning a base year value transfer for eminent domain replacement property,we are not persuaded.it is well established that the legislature may impose reasonable time restraints on the exercise of constitutional rights rand bossen cal d,kuperman san diego county assessment appeals bd.th,including on the rights associated with just compensation for a governmental taking crescent wharf warehouse los angeles cal,overruled on other grounds in wilson beville cal d,hair united states.
in the context of eminent domain takings,our high court has observed all that the framers of the constitution meant to do was to protect the citizen in his ownership of property against the state or its agencies appropriating private property to public uses against the will of the owner without making just compensation for all damages which the owner should sustain by the exercise of governmental power.it was not intended to remove the subject matter beyond the operation of reasonable statutory enactments which affect property rights generally,such as the bar of the statute of limitations.crescent wharf warehouse city of los angeles,supra,cal.at.further,in the context of tax collection,the courts have recognized that time limitations serve the important policy interests of promoting stability and facilitating fiscal planning by governmental agencies.kuperman,supra,th at jpmorgan chase bank,city and county of san francisco th.imposition of reasonable time limitations avoids the absurdity of allowing suits to be filed centuries after the claim on which the suit was based arose.lantz commissioner of internal revenue cir.
although the legislature has the right to impose reasonable time limitations on the exercise of constitutional rights,this does not end our inquiry concerning the meaning of the time limitations set forth in section.when interpreting constitutional and legislative enactments,we view the provisions as a whole and seek to determine and effectuate the intent of the enactors.morgan imperial irrigation dist.th.to interpret section,we first look to the voter intent underlying article xiiia,and then consider the statutory language and legislative intent in light of the evinced voter intent.
as reflected in our summation above,article xiiia creates several categories of exclusions,including a category which has been deemed to be entirely removed from the characterization and which contains no time limitations eminent domain and exclusions,and another category which is tied to a legislative enactment and which contains some time limitations disaster,contamination,and the over and severely disabled exclusions.the absence of time limits
