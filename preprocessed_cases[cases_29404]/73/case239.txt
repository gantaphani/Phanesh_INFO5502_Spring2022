the united states of america the government,an intervenor in this enforcement action brought by the securities and exchange commission sec against defendants credit bancorp,and its affiliated entities collectively credit bancorp bancorp or cbl,appeals from so much of a may,order may order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,robert sweet,judge,as granted the motion of carl loewenson,cbl receiver the receiver,for a declaration that,from the assets deposited with bancorp by its customers,along with the proceeds derived therefrom and the receipts of the receivership,debts to cbl customers have priority over tax debts to the government and that the receiver,in making distributions in accordance with a plan of partial distribution conditionally approved by the court,will incur no personal liability under the federal debt priority statute,b,for tax debts of bancorp or the receivership.the district court rejected the government contention that sovereign immunity had not been waived and that the court thus lacked subject matter jurisdiction to make such declarations,ruling that jurisdiction existed under a and as a matter of necessity.see d.on appeal,the government principally pursues its jurisdictional contentions.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that sovereign immunity has not been waived we thus vacate the may order for lack of jurisdiction and remand for dismissal of the receiver motion.
background 
the present action was brought by the sec against credit bancorp in november,alleging,inter alia,that cbl had engaged in a ponzi scheme that defrauded its customers in violation of a of the securities act of,a,b of the securities exchange act of,b,and sec rule.as discussed in this court recent decision in sec credit bancorp,cir,bancorp had persuaded investors referred to by the parties and the district court as customers to transfer cash and securities to it in order to enable it to engage in what it described as riskless arbitrage trading,and it promised to pay customers dividends based on the value of the unencumbered assets transferred by the customer.see id.at.bancorp thereafter did pay some customers dividends,but only out of deposits it received from other customers.by the time the sec commenced this suit and obtained a freeze of bancorp assets,bancorp had victimized more than customers and lost tens of millions of dollars of their assets.
shortly after freezing credit bancorp assets,the district court appointed loewenson as bancorp fiscal agent on january,the court appointed him receiver.bancorp was ordered to turn over all funds,property,documents,and records to the receiver,who was granted broad powers to,inter alia,issue subpoenas,marshal cbl assets,liquidate those assets,and reinvest the proceeds in treasury instruments.the freeze order directed the receiver not to return any securities or other assets to credit bancorp customers without further order of the court.in april,the united states,by the united states attorney for the southern district of new york,sought and obtained permission to intervene in the action for the limited purpose of seeking a stay of discovery pending completion of related criminal proceedings with regard to bancorp,its chief executive officer richard blech,and others.
a.the receiver distribution plan and motion for priority 
in may and june,the sec and groups of intervening customers submitted to the district court three competing plans for interim distributions of bancorp assets marshaled by the receiver.in october,the receiver,after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a consensus plan,submitted to the court his own interim distribution plan.under the receiver plan,customers who had transferred to cbl identifiable securities that were in the possession of the receiver would be given an opportunity to retrieve them by depositing with the receiver undertakings,cash or securities in amounts equaling a specified percentage of the current market value of the securities the cash undertakings would be used by the receiver to make pro rata distributions to customers whose deposits with cbl had been lost.oral argument on the receiver plan was heard in,and decision was reserved.
thereafter,the receiver served a motion dated november,on the office of the united states attorney for the southern district of new york in order to bring t he government into this action in its capacity as the internal revenue service,d at.the motion asked the district court for an order 
declaring that credit bancorp customers have priority over the united states for payment from the assets,as well as the proceeds therefrom and cash receipts of the receivership and declaring that in notifying the court and the potentially affected governments of the potential for tax liability,the receiver has discharged his obligations pursuant to the federal debt priority statute,b 
receiver notice of motion dated november,priority declaration motion or motion.the federal debt priority statute provides the federal government,in certain circumstances,with priority over other claimants as to the payment of debts,including tax debts,owed by an insolvent debtor,see a,and states that a representative of a person or an estate paying any part of a debt of the person or estate before paying a claim of the government is liable to the extent of the payment for unpaid claims of the government,id.b.
the receiver and the government began negotiations with respect to credit bancorp tax liability.eventually,as discussed in part below,the receiver and the government entered into a stipulation in february dealing with cbl tax liability for the period prior to,but not after,the receiver appointment.
in the meantime,in an opinion dated november,the district court largely approved the receiver plan,finding it more equitable and more feasible than the other plans.thereafter,in response to the court expression of concern with respect to certain customers,the receiver submitted a revised interim distribution plan,which the court approved in an opinion dated january.the court entered a detailed order,also dated january,january order or order,setting out the terms of the plan,which provided essentially that the receiver would,in exchange for the undertakings,return identifiable securities under his control to the bancorp customers who had deposited them with bancorp,and that the receiver would use the undertakings principally to a facilitate a general pro rata distribution for those cbl customers whose securities and other assets had been transferred or lost,b provide collateral for claims by,and c fund the administration of the receivership.the january order provided,however,that the order was not to become effective prior to approval of the receiver request for priority treatment of customer debts 
this order shall become effective upon further order of this court,either by the entry of a stipulation and order between the receiver and the united states permitting the distribution set forth herein to proceed,or by a separate order of this court declaring that credit bancorp customers have priority over the united states and the states for payment from the assets,as well as the proceeds therefrom,and that the distribution set forth herein may proceed without payment by cbl or the receiver to the irs.
january order 
b.the stipulation between the receiver and the government 
the government did not formally respond to the receiver november priority declaration motion.after obtaining extensions of time to respond and negotiating with the receiver toward a settlement of the issues raised by the motion,the government informed the district court in february that the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity and took the position that the district court thus did not have jurisdiction to grant the declaratory relief requested in the motion.on february,the receiver and the government entered into a stipulation the stipulation or stipulation and order resolving some of the issues raised in the priority declaration motion.in the stipulation,the government agreed not to assert a federal tax lien on certain specified present and future receivership assets and agreed that it would not assert that the receiver had any liability under b for credit bancorp tax liability resulting from income generated prior to his january,appointment.the government reserved the right to assert a tax lien or priority against any other assets or future assets of credit bancorp or the receivership,and it did not agree not to assert that the receiver had tax liability resulting from income generated after his appointment.the pertinent provisions read as follows 
the relative priorities among the united states,credit bancorp and its customers with respect to assets not listed in paragraph are not determined by this stipulation and order,and the receiver reserves the right to continue to assert the positions set forth in support of his motion and renewed motion as to those assets.
the united states reserves the right to assert a tax lien or to assert priority against any asset listed in paragraph remaining in the receivership estate after payment of the administrative expenses of the receivership and a determination by the court that each customer has been compensated for the value of the securities and other assets deposited with credit bancorp,less any custodial dividends paid by credit bancorp and any outstanding loan balance owed to credit.
notwithstanding any other provision of this stipulation and order,nothing herein shall be taken to determine for tax purposes the characterization of or liability with respect to the proceeds of any sale of customer securities pursuant to g of the distribution plan,or any other amounts earned,accrued or added to the receivership estate subsequent to january.
notwithstanding any other provision of this stipulation and order,the united states shall not be deemed to have waived its rights,if any,to assess or collect federal income taxes of credit bancorp customers arising from the stipulated distribution.
nothing herein shall waive any of the government defenses,including but not limited to sovereign immunity and lack of subject matter jurisdiction,with respect to any additional relief that the receiver may seek.
stipulation.
c.the district court declaration of priority over irs claims 
the receiver promptly renewed his motion for a declaration that payment of cbl debts to its customers took priority over its tax liabilities and that the receiver would incur no personal liability in making the distributions called for by his plan.the receiver argued that virtually all of the assets already in the receivership estate and much of the property he anticipated the estate would receive,either through his own efforts or through the undertakings delivered pursuant to the partial distribution plan,should be considered subject to a constructive trust in favor of cbl customers if the assets were subject to such a constructive trust,cbl would have had no property interest in the assets,and the assets could not be applied to satisfy bancorp tax liabilities.
the government opposed the motion,contending that the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity and that the district court thus lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant the relief requested by the receiver.the government argued that the receiver motion sought relief with respect to federal taxes,and pointed out that the declaratory judgment act allows the court to declare the parties rights and obligations except with respect to federal taxes,a,and that the act states in pertinent part that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed,a.
the receiver argued that a waiver of sovereign immunity was to be found in,inter alia,the judicial code provision that permits certain actions to quiet title to real or personal property on which the united states has or claims a mortgage or other lien,a.the government pointed out that in all of the a cases relied on by the receiver,a federal tax lien had been asserted,and it argued,inter alia,that the section was inapplicable here because the government possessed no lien,had asserted no lien,and had not determined credit bancorp tax liability,if any.
the receiver also argued that jurisdiction could be premised on the exceptions to the act recognized in south carolina regan,d regan act does not apply when congress has not provided an alternative avenue for an aggrieved party to litigate its claims on its own behalf,or enochs williams packing navigation,d williams packing act does not apply where it is clear that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail and that irreparable injury would occur without the requested relief.
in an opinion dated april,reported at d,the district court rejected the government jurisdictional arguments,finding the requisite waiver of sovereign immunity in a.the court stated that 
s ection a does not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to challenges to the merits of the federal government tax assessment or lien 
however,a does serve as a waiver of the united states sovereign immunity with respect to disputes concerning the priority of competing liens.see,progressive consumers federal credit union united states,cir s ection a controversies encompass disputes concerning both the validity and priority of liens as distinguished from actions seeking their extinguishment 
suits to determine lien priority under the quiet title provision of are not barred by the declaratory judgment or acts.see progressive consumers,at declaratory judgment act does not bar quiet title action seeking determination of lien priority 
the reduction of the pool of possible assets available for collection by the government,however,is precisely the result in the cases that have found lien priority challenges to fall within a,since a finding that the moving party lien is superior to the government lien necessarily means that the assets available to the government to satisfy any tax assessment or collection are decreased.see,progressive consumers,at admittedly,any challenge to the validity of a federal tax lien and sale indirectly interferes with the tax collection process which the declaratory judgment act and the act are designed to protect from undue litigation outside the tax court.aqua bar lounge,irs,cir.nonetheless,a permits litigants to seek declaratory relief against the government regarding the priority of competing liens.see id.
the receiver does not dispute that credit bancorp may owe substantial federal tax liability.what the receiver seeks,however,is a determination regarding who holds property interests in the protected property.thus,the receiver has not challenged an underlying tax assessment or collection effort but,rather,seeks a determination regarding the priority of competing liens and,under the authorities just discussed,there is subject matter jurisdiction over this motion.
the government also objects,however,that the receiver can not rely on a because the government has not actually made an assessment and does not presently have a lien on the receivership estate.therefore,according to the government,the united states neither has nor claims a lien,a,on the protected property.
although no tax liability has yet been assessed against credit bancorp,there is a potential that a substantial assessment will be made in the future.this potential is far from speculative.after negotiations between the receiver and the government,and the entry of the stipulation,the government specifically reserved its rights to assert a tax lien or to assert priority as to certain receivership assets,including but not limited to the income.while the government avers that the receiver predictions of the potential credit bancorp tax liability are exaggerated,it is apparent that the government contemplates that some tax liability will result from the assets not included in the stipulation.moreover,the practical effect of the government position is much the same as would be the effect of an actual lien in that the receiver can not implement the partial distribution plan until the issue of the government right to these assets is resolved.
the district court also found that a essentially gave it jurisdiction to declare that in executing the partial distribution plan,the receiver would not be liable under the debt priority statute,reasoning that the issue of whether the receiver has satisfied his obligations under b is inseparable from the issue of lien priority under a,and that the effect of finding jurisdiction under a would be to protect the executor from the dangers he would otherwise face under b assuming,of course,that he complied with the judicially determined priorities.d at.
the court also concluded that if a did not provide jurisdiction,it had jurisdiction under the exception announced in regan on the basis that there is no alternative means for resolving the potential conflict between implementing the partial distribution plan and the incurrence of extraordinary personal liability,d at.although the court noted that prerequisites for application of the regan exception to the act are difficult to meet,and that the receiver could,in theory,like any other taxpayer,pay first and litigate later,it found the regan exception applicable here because 
t his is a special type of case.it is the court that imposed the receivership,and the court that appointed the receiver.if the receiver can not obtain review of his motion regarding personal liability then he has two choices.he can implement the partial distribution plan as presently structured,but at the risk of extraordinary personal liability.or he can set aside reserves from the receivership funds to provide for the eventuality that this personal liability will come to pass,and to cover that liability.neither of these courses of action is tenable.thus,the effect of not affording the receiver a way to have the personal liability issue determined at this stage would be to bring the receivership and any partial distribution under the receivership to a halt.the available alternatives are thus not merely inadequate as a practical matter but defeat the very purpose of the receivership.therefore,applying regan to the facts of this case leads to the conclusion that there is subject matter jurisdiction under the regan exception.
d at.having found jurisdiction under a and regan,the district court found it unnecessary to consider whether it also had jurisdiction under the williams packing exception.
the court largely,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,granted the receiver priority declaration motion.an order was entered on may,may order,the stipulation between the receiver and the government and providing that 
t he receiver shall implement the plan of partial distribution pursuant to this court opinion dated november,sec credit bancorp,wl its opinion dated january,sec credit bancorp,d its order dated january,and all subsequent orders 
c.the property described in this paragraph c may not be applied to satisfy liabilities for taxes,if any,of cbl,richard blech,any other defendant,the receiver,or any entity,fund,or account created or deemed to be created by the receiver or pursuant to order of this court.
i.after due consideration by this court of the arguments of the receiver and of the united states and in light of this court april opinion,the receiver has discharged his obligations under,and neither the receiver nor his counsel,accountants,consultants or agents may be held liable for taxes for effectuating the plan of partial distribution.
may order b,c,i emphasis added.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the government contends principally that the district court erred in finding a waiver of sovereign immunity in or under the regan exception to the act and in refusing to apply the plain language of that statute and of the express exception stated in the declaratory judgment act.in opposition,the receiver argues,inter alia,that the declaratory judgment act and the act are inapplicable because he does not challenge any underlying assessment or collection effort.receiver brief on appeal at.alternatively,the receiver argues that the court reliance on regan was correct or that the court could properly have premised jurisdiction on williams packing,or on the administrative procedure act,or on the government prior intervention in the case seeking a stay of discovery.
preliminarily,we note our jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.first,since the district court may order effects a modification of the original order freezing bancorp assets,see sec credit bancorp,at,which was initially entered as a temporary restraining order and continued as a preliminary injunction,the order is immediately appealable pursuant to a interlocutory orders of the district courts modifying injunctions are appealable.second,the order is immediately appealable under the practical finality doctrine,or doctrine,under which a judgment requiring immediate delivery of property while further proceedings in the action continue is final for purposes of appellate review where the appealing party would be irreparably injured if appellate review were delayed pending conclusion of the entire action.moore federal practice,at ed see,radio station wow,johnson.forgay conrad,how.
as to the merits of the appeal,we conclude for the reasons that follow that the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity so as to permit a declaration as to the tax liabilities of bancorp or the receiver.
general principles of sovereign immunity 
it is well established that t he united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued t he terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.any waiver of the government sovereign immunity is to be strictly construed in favor of the government.long island radio nlrb,cir quoting united states sherwood.thus,the court is given jurisdiction to entertain a claim against the united states only to the extent of the waiver the court has no power to broaden a limited waiver of immunity.see,long island radio nlrb,at since jurisdiction to entertain a claim against the united states exists only as congress has granted it,neither an agency nor a court has the power to entertain claims that do not meet the conditions limiting the waiver of immunity.
section of gives the federal district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress providing for internal revenue,but as a general jurisdictional statute,it does not of itself constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity.see,kulawy united states,cir falik united states,cir falik.the declaratory judgment act,with certain exclusions not relevant here,allows a federal court to declare the rights and obligations of the parties properly before it in any case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction,except with respect to federal taxes.a emphasis added.thus,whether or not that act waives the sovereign immunity of the united states with respect to other types of actions,it explicitly excludes from any such waiver the power to declare rights or obligations with respect to federal taxes.
we disagree with the receiver contention that this provision is inapplicable to the present matter,for,insofar as the government is concerned,the precise focus of the receiver priority declaration motion was federal taxes.the receiver sought to bring the united states into this action in its capacity as the irs.he sought a declaration that customer debts have priority over bancorp federal tax debts,and he sought a declaration as to his own liability for bancorp federal taxes if he proceeds with the partial distribution plan.we conclude that,in the absence of some other waiver of sovereign immunity,the declaratory judgment act deprived the district court of the power to grant the declarations sought by the receiver.
that absence of power is further reflected in the act.that statute provides,with exceptions not relevant here,that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.a.although the district court order in the present ca
