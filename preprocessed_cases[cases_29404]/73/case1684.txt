like most american jurisdictions,california adheres to the corpus delicti rule,under which the corpus,the fact that a crime has been be proved based solely on extrajudicial statements of the defendant.people alvarez cal th,d,alvarez.over the years,courts have consistently applied this rule not only to the actual trial of a defendant,but also to the preliminary hearing where it must be determined if sufficient evidence has been presented to hold the defendant to answer.
in this case,however,the trial court concluded the corpus delicti rule no longer applies to preliminary hearings in light of the supreme court decision in alvarez,supra,cal th,d,which construed the effect of the passage of proposition in on the corpus delicti rule.in light of that determination,the trial court denied petitioner motion to set aside the counts in the information charging petitioner with money laundering and filing false income tax returns.
we hold that in reaching its conclusion,the trial court erred.nothing in proposition or in alvarez suggests the corpus delicti rule was abrogated in the preliminary hearing context.we also hold that,with respect to the counts alleging petitioner filed false tax returns,the error was harmless as there was sufficient evidence,aside from petitioner extrajudicial statements,to satisfy the corpus delicti rule as to these counts.however,with respect to the money laundering counts,the error was prejudicial.accordingly,we grant the petition with respect to the money laundering counts only.
factual and procedural 
petitioner suad salim rayyis is a doctor.in,rayyis,his wife,and at least two of their children twin brothers currently in their moved into a home in san marino.all references to rayyis are to the petitioner.except for a brief period after rayyis and his wife legally separated,rayyis lived in the san marino home continuously until his arrest on the charges at issue in this case.
as discussed below,rayyis was the main source of income for his family.however,major assets,such as the family home and the family five cars,are not held in rayyis name.rayyis wife is the sole titleholder of the san marino home.the family five cars,including one driven by rayyis,are held in the names of his twin children.
rayyis did not file any income tax returns from until after the filing of the criminal complaint in this action in.however,it is clear he had considerable income during much of this time.thus,between and,over million was deposited into two of rayyis bank accounts.
during the time rayyis was receiving all this money,he transferred considerable sums to his family in the form of checks made out to his twin children.among other things,he transferred each month to cover living expenses,including the monthly mortgage payment gave each twin as a gift when they received their undergraduate degrees,and an additional when they received graduate degrees gave each twin approximately so they could pay off their student loans gave the twins money to purchase five cars,including a mercedes benz he insisted the twins purchase and gave the twins for the remodeling of the san marino home.
it is also clear that the family lifestyle has been supported almost exclusively by money from rayyis.rayyis wife has not worked outside the home for at least years.previously,she worked at pasadena city college and did not make substantial amounts of money.the twins worked while going to school.currently,they each earn approximately a year working as managers for a supermarket chain.
in february,law enforcement officials executed a search warrant at rayyis residence and at one or more offices where rayyis practiced medicine.at that time,an investigator for the district attorney office interviewed rayyis.during the interview,rayyis stated that he had been involved with staged automobile accident cases from approximately until.he described how hunters found people to stage accidents and then come in for medical treatment.
during this search and on other occasions,evidence was also found suggesting rayyis may have violated various labor laws such as failure to pay workers compensation benefits and to maintain proper records of employee wages.
in august,a felony complaint was filed against rayyis.it contained counts as follows five felony counts of willful failure to file an income tax return for the years through,felony counts of money laundering at various times between august and december,subd.a one misdemeanor count of failure to maintain records of employee wages,two misdemeanor counts of failure to secure payment of workers compensation,and one misdemeanor count of failure to observe a stop order.
the following month,rayyis filed tax returns for the years.in november,the people filed an amended complaint,adding five felony counts of filing a false income tax return,subd.a.
at the preliminary hearing,the district attorney investigator who spoke with rayyis when rayyis office was searched testified about the statements rayyis had made concerning his involvement in staged automobile accident cases.the people concede that aside from this testimony describing rayyis extrajudicial statements,no evidence was presented at the preliminary hearing suggesting that rayyis was involved in insurance fraud.
in addition,a senior special agent for the franchise tax board testified about his analysis of rayyis bank records and tax returns.among other things,the special agent testified that he analyzed records of rayyis bank accounts for the years and the tax returns rayyis filed after the initiation of this criminal proceeding.the special agent testified that,based on his analysis of the bank records,he determined that rayyis received in income during the years.he then compared this figure as well as the figures for the individual years with the income figures contained in rayyis tax returns and concluded that rayyis had underreported his income.
the special agent concluded that for the years through,rayyis had underreported his tax liability by.although the special agent testimony is not a model of clarity,it appears that this figure is based on two factors.first,it is based in part on the underreporting of income,which has nothing to do with the alleged insurance fraud.second,it is based in part on the special agent conclusion that rayyis was not entitled to deductions in connection with his medical practice because he had engaged in insurance fraud thus,it appears the special agent conclusion that rayyis had underreported his tax liability was not dependent solely on a determination that rayyis had engaged in insurance fraud.
at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing,rayyis was held to answer on all counts.
after his superior court arraignment,rayyis filed a motion under penal code section to set aside the information for lack of probable cause.among other things,rayyis argued that the money laundering and false tax return counts hinge on his alleged participation in insurance fraud and that,aside from his extrajudicial statements to the district attorney investigator,no evidence was presented at the preliminary hearing to suggest he participated in such fraud.he then argued that,based on the corpus delicti rule,he should not have been held to answer.
in opposition,the people,relying on the supreme court decision in alvarez,supra,cal th,d,argued that the corpus delicti rule was abrogated by proposition,except to the extent that a criminal conviction may not be based solely on a defendant extrajudicial statement.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court agreed with the people position and denied the motion insofar as it challenged the money laundering and false tax return claims the court also noted that,even if the corpus delicti rule applied,there may have been enough independent evidence of the crimes to satisfy the requirements of the rule.however,the court made clear that it was not making such a determination and that its decision to deny rayyis motion to dismiss the money laundering and false tax return counts was based solely on its conclusion that alvarez abrogated the corpus delicti rule insofar as preliminary hearings are concerned.
rayyis filed this writ petition challenging the trial court decision on the money laundering and false tax return charges.we issued an order to show cause,received additional briefing,and heard oral argument.
discussion 
the corpus delicti rule applies to preliminary.the corpus delicti rule.
the corpus delicti rule is a common law rule developed by courts over the years.alvarez,supra,cal th at,d.it has been applied in california since at least the.id.at,d.
under the rule,the prosecution must prove the corpus delicti,or the body of the crime,the fact of injury,loss,or harm,and the existence of a criminal agency as its cause.in california,it has traditionally been held,the prosecution can not satisfy this burden by relying exclusively upon the extrajudicial statements,confessions,or admissions of the defendant.alvarez,supra,cal th at,d.
the amount of additional proof that is required to satisfy the corpus delicti rule is fairly minimal.the supreme court has described this quantum of additional evidence that is required as slight citation or minimal citation.the people need make only a prima facie showing permitting the reasonable inference that a crime was committed.citation.the inference need not be the only,or even the most compelling,one but need only be a reasonable one people jones cal th,d,ellipses and last brackets in jones.such independent proof may consist of circumstantial evidence citations,and need not establish the crime beyond a reasonable doubt citation.id.at,d.
the purpose of the corpus delicti rule is to assure that the accused is not admitting to a crime that never occurred.citation.the rule arose because of the law unease with inflicting punishment when a confession may have been misreported or misconstrued,elicited by force or coercion,based upon mistaken perception of the facts or law,or falsely given by a mentally disturbed individual.citations.thus,it is clear that the corpus delicti rule was established to prevent not only the possibility that a false confession was secured by means of police coercion or abuse but also the possibility that a confession,though voluntarily given,is false.citation.people jones,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,see also jones superior court d.today judicial retention of the rule reflects the continued fear that confessions may be the result of either improper police activity or the mental instability of the accused,and the recognition that juries are likely to accept confessions uncritically.
courts uniformly apply the rule to preliminary hearings.
over the years,california courts have consistently applied the corpus delicti rule not only to trials,but also to preliminary hearings.for example,in in re schuber d,the court of appeal issued a writ of habeas corpus after concluding that aside from the defendant extrajudicial statements,there was no evidence to establish the corpus of the crime charged.the court rejected the notion that the corpus delicti rule should not apply to preliminary hearings.among other things it stated while it is true that preliminary examinations of persons accused of crime when held before a committing magistrate are usually less formal in matters of procedure than would be required upon the trial of the cause the essential principles of procedure and of evidence may not be departed from by committing magistrates in the conduct of such examinations citation,and although the committing magistrate may hold a defendant to answer upon evidence which would not support a verdict of guilty,nevertheless there must be some evidence tending to show the commission of the crime charged before a defendant admission or confession can be introduced for any purpose.id.at.
our official reports contain a host of other cases in which appellate courts have granted relief because the requirements of the corpus delicti rule were not met at the preliminary hearing.see,creutz superior court th,d court observes that t he corpus delicti rule applies to preliminary hearings and grants petition for writ of prohibition because rule not satisfied at preliminary hearing jones superior court,supra,d.court grants petition for writ of prohibition iiams superior court d.court grants petition for writ of prohibition after concluding that a bsent the extrajudicial statements by petitioner,the evidence at the preliminary hearing did not establish some rational ground for assuming the possibility that the offenses charged in the subject information had occurred.as a consequence,petitioner was committed without reasonable or probable cause in re flodstrom d,court grants petition for writ of habeas corpus after concluding that the corpus delicti has not been established at the preliminary hearing.disregarding the confession and admissions of the accused there is no proof,even slight,of any criminal agency that caused the death of the infant child.
in addition,there are numerous decisions affirming orders setting aside an information because the corpus delicti rule had not been satisfied at the preliminary hearing,people martinez d.people davidson d.
finally,there are numerous decisions applying the corpus delicti rule to preliminary hearings,only to conclude that the rule had been satisfied,matthews superior court d.people andrews d.people sheeley d,see also people sally th,d corpus delicti rule not satisfied at the preliminary hearing,but defendant waived the right to rely on the rule because he failed to raise it in the trial court.
to date,no appellate court has declared that the corpus delicti rule does not apply to preliminary hearings.
alvarez did not abrogate the corpus delicti rule in the preliminary hearing context.
in alvarez,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court was called upon to decide whether the corpus delicti rule was abrogated by proposition,which voters approved in and which resulted in the addition of article i,section,to the california constitution.subdivision d of this section hereafter section d the right to that with certain exceptions,relevant evidence shall not be excluded in any criminal proceeding 
the supreme court went on to hold that proposition did abrogate the corpus delicti rule,but only in one abrogate ed any corpus delicti basis for excluding the defendant extrajudicial statements from evidence.alvarez,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d,insofar as the corpus delicti rule restricts the admissibility of incriminatory extrajudicial statements by the accused,section d abrogates it id.at,d,insofar as the corpus delicti rule has directly barred or restricted the admissibility in evidence of otherwise relevant and admissible extrajudicial statements of the accused,on grounds that independent proof of the crime is lacking,the rule has been abrogated by section d.under this constitutional provision,a corpus delicti objection to the introduction of defendant statements is no longer valid as such second italics added.
however,the court made it absolutely clear that the corpus delicti rule was not abrogated in any other respect to the extent the corpus delicti rule limits the admission of relevant evidence,proposition does entirely abrogate the rule,including any limitation on the admission of preoffense statements.on the other hand,because proposition speaks only to the admissibility of relevant evidence,it can have no other limiting effect on the corpus delicti rule.alvarez,supra,cal th at,fn,d,second italics added.the court emphasized that the language of section d does not address issues of corroboration,burden of proof,or sufficiency of proof.though section d broadly eliminates rules that exclude relevant evidence from a criminal trial,the words of the constitutional provision do not speak beyond that subject.by its terms,the provision proposition affects only the admissibility of evidence citation.the words of section d do not mention the corpus delicti rule by name,nor do they purport to affect any rule by which evidence,otherwise admissible,must be independently corroborated.id.at,d,ellipsis in alvarez,first italics added see also people chan th,d until the adoption of california constitution article i,section,subdivision d,there were two aspects to the corpus delicti rule.the first aspect invol
