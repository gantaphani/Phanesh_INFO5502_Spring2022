ii.discussion 
jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court 
the bankruptcy code vests a bankruptcy court with subject matter jurisdiction to determine the amount and validity of a tax assessment against a debtor unless the debtor tax liability has been contested before and adjudicated by another tribunal prior to bankruptcy.section of the bankruptcy code provides 
a the bankruptcy court may determine the amount or legality of any tax,any fine or penalty relating to a tax,or any addition to a tax,whether or not previously assessed,whether or not paid,and whether or not contested before and adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
the court may not so determine 
a the amount or legality of a tax,fine,penalty,or addition to tax if such amount or legality was contested before and adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction before the commencement of the case under this title 
emphasis added.section a authorizes a bankruptcy court to determine a debtor tax liability.but if the debtor tax liability was contested and adjudicated by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction before the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings,a a strips the bankruptcy court of the subject matter jurisdiction it otherwise would have had under a.see baker irs in re baker,cir section a a is a jurisdictional statute that deprives bankruptcy courts of authority to decide a category of claims.
section a a requires that the debtor have contested the tax liability in question.this requirement protects a debtor from being bound by a tax liability determination that,because of a lack of financial resources,he or she was unable to contest.as the tenth circuit has explained,protects creditors from the dissipation of the estate assets which could result if the creditors were bound by a tax judgment which the debtor,due to his ailing financial condition,did not contest.city vending of muskogee.tax comm n,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also new haven projects llc city of new haven in re new haven projects llc,cir creditors are entitled to protection from the dissipation of an estate assets in the event that the debtor failed to contest the legality and amount of taxes assessed against it.internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,however,there is no dispute that the mantzs contested their tax liability before the sbe.
section a a also requires that the debtor tax liability be adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal before the commencement of bankruptcy.adjudicated means that a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction has been decreed.in re baker,at quoting irs teal in re teal,cir.if the tax liability has not been adjudicated before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding,then under a the bankruptcy court may consider the tax issue itself or allow another tribunal to do so.the bankruptcy court and the district court found that despite the lack of finality of the state administrative adjudication against the mantzs at the time of the bankruptcy filing,a a deprived the bankruptcy court of subject matter jurisdiction because that section does not require a final adjudication.we disagree.
most courts have required a final adjudication prior to bankruptcy before finding that a a deprives the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction.the fifth circuit in texas comptroller of public accounts trans state outdoor advertising in re trans state outdoor advertising,cir,held that although a state administrative decision determining a debtor tax liability could be reviewed by the bankruptcy court if the debtor had filed for bankruptcy before the decision became final,the jurisdictional bar of a a had been triggered because the administrative decision had not been appealed
