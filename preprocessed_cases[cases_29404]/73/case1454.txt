princess cruises,princess appeals from the final judgment of the court of international trade trial court.the appeal was submitted for our decision after oral argument on october.we affirm the trial court determination that liability for harbor maintenance tax hmt payments on cruises occurring prior to january,which used ports only for layover stops hmt liability,is barred by the retroactivity doctrine.we also affirm the trial court award of prejudgment interest to the government because the government was entitled to receive arriving passenger fee apf payments from princess prior to the issuance of a bill from customs.
background 
princess owns and operates commercial cruise lines that use the ports of the united states.the harbor maintenance revenue act of hmra,as codified at et,made cruise lines liable for payments based on port use.the hmra payments at issue in this case are hmt and apf payments.in,customs initiated an audit of princess hmt and apf payments.as a result of the audit,customs determined that princess was required to make further hmt and apf payments.during the process,customs issued headquarters ruling,custom hq lexis,the january hq ruling.at issue in this case is customs determination under the january hq ruling that princess is subject to hmt liability and the related evidentiary presumption that all passengers on board the cruise are deemed to have disembarked boarded at the layover port.princess challenges the january hq ruling,as well as headquarters ruling,custom hq lexis,the october hq ruling,which provided further reasoning in support of the evidentiary presumption.
princess brought an action in the trial court challenging customs assessment of princess hmt and apf liability.the court initially entered judgment in favor of princess based on the supreme court decision in united states united states shoe,d,declaring the provisions of the hmra related to exported goods unconstitutional under the exports clause.the trial court concluded that the provisions of the hmra governing the transportation of passengers were likewise unconstitutional under the exports clause.see princess cruises,united states,d.int l trade.this court reversed,determining that the provisions related to passengers were not themselves unconstitutional under the exports clause and that such provisions were severable from the provisions declared unconstitutional by the supreme court.princess cruises,united states.on remand,the trial court held that hmt liability can not be assessed against princess for cruises occurring prior to january,the date of the january hq ruling.princess cruises,united states summary judgment opinion,d.int l trade.the trial court further addressed princess apf liability,holding that the government was entitled to prejudgment interest from the time that princess should have made the apf payments in the ordinary course of business,not merely for the period after billing.id.at.
the government appeals the trial court determination related to hmt liability and princess the trial court determination related to prejudgment interest.we have jurisdiction under a.
we note that this appeal is closely related to carnival cruise lines,united states,also before this panel.these appeals share the common issue of whether hmt liability can be assessed against the cruise lines for cruises.as in this case,the trial court in carnival cruise lines held that carnival was not liable for hmt payments prior to the issuance of the january hq ruling.carnival cruise lines,united states,d.int l trade.indeed,the trial court based its decision in this case on its reasoning in carnival cruise lines.accordingly,in addressing the reasoning of the trial court,we refer to its decisions in both this case and carnival cruise lines.
ii.violation of fed.c 
before turning to the merits of this case,we address a procedural matter.under fed,the appellant is allowed an opening brief,the appellee is allowed a brief in response,and the appellant is allowed a reply brief.an appellee who has may file a brief in reply to the appellant response to the issues presented by the.fed.at c.the practice notes to rule in the federal circuit rules of practice further state that counsel are cautioned,in cases involving a proper,to limit the fourth brief to the issues presented by the.
in this case,the reply brief princess filed as was not limited to issues concerning the.indeed,the majority of princess reply brief addressed the government appeal.after we raised princess failure to comply with rule c during oral argument,princess filed an unopposed motion to strike the offending portions of its reply brief,which we granted.we appreciate princess efforts to correct the problem it created,albeit belatedly.
we note a troubling trend for the counsel of to disregard the rule limiting their reply brief to issues concerning the.see,in re violation of rule c,the filing of improper arguments is unfair to appellants who bear the burden of demonstrating prejudicial error in the decision being appealed and,therefore,are entitled to the last word in both the briefs and at oral argument on their appeal.
we caution all counsel for who file improper arguments that they may be subject to sanctions under fed.c,which provides that a court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for failure to comply with any court rule.we further urge counsel for appellants to file timely motions to strike improper arguments because the prejudice from improper arguments is difficult to eliminate once such arguments have been read by the court.
iii.government appeal 
the government appeals the trial court conclusion that the january hq ruling can not be applied to conduct occurring prior to the ruling issuance.summary judgment opinion,d at carnival cruise lines,d at.the trial court decision was based on the canon of construction pronounced in gould gould,that ambiguities in tax statutes are construed most strongly against the government and in favor of the citizen.princess advances here an alternative argument from that adopted by the trial court,contending that application of the january hq ruling to conduct preceding the ruling is barred under the retroactivity doctrine.the government argues that neither the trial court rationale nor the alternative ground advanced by princess justifies the result adopted by the trial court.as explained below,we agree with princess that the retroactivity doctrine bars application of the january hq ruling to conduct.
retroactivity is not favored in the law and,therefore,congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.bowen georgetown,d.in other words,a rule or regulation will not be applied retroactively unless the agency clearly intended that the rule have retroactive effect and congress authorized retroactive rulemaking.see id.
the most cited definition of retroactivity is that given by justice story in society for propagation of the gospel wheeler,cas,that every statute,which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,must be deemed retrospective.the supreme court elaborated on this definition in landgraf usi film products,stating 
a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment or upsets expectations based in prior law.rather,the court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.the conclusion that a particular rule operates retroactively comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases,and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.however,retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have sound instincts and familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations offer sound guidance.
d internal citations,quotations,and footnote omitted.thus,the court must consider not only in a fashion whether a rule,regulation,or decision creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,but must also consider more comprehensively the nature and extent of the change of the law,the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event,and familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.at.see also marrie sec,applying the landgraf factors mccoy gilbert,cir same.
the government focuses its retroactivity arguments on a test it discerns from the seventh circuit,in which the court discussed whether a rule is a clarification or a change in the law.pope shalala,cir emphasis added,overruled on other grounds by johnson apfel,cir.under this doctrine,changes,but not clarifications,have retroactive effect.the pope court reasoned that a rule simply clarifying an unsettled or confusing area of the law does not change the law,but restates what the law according to the agency is and has always been.at.further,under pope,courts in the seventh circuit will defer to an agency expressed intent that a regulation is clarifying unless the prior interpretation of the regulation or statute in question is patently inconsistent with the later one.id.
we find the binary or by the government largely unhelpful.merely categorizing rules or applications of rules as clarifications or changes provides little insight into whether a retroactive effect would result in a particular case.as noted by the court of appeals for the circuit,a clarification,in fact,changes the legal landscape,because a precise interpretation is not the same as a range of possible interpretations.health ins.ass of,shalala,mccoy,at noting that the landgraf factors must be applied because almost every new statute results in some perceptible effect or impact on countless past or choices,decisions,and interests of the actors and subjects in the field.
further,the,binary test espoused by the government conflicts with the court obligation to weigh the various factors described in landgraf.indeed,landgraf explicitly requires the court to consider the nature and extent of the change in the law,not merely whether a change has occurred.at.emphasis added.
finally,the government argument based on categories mischaracterizes the seventh circuit doctrine,which appears to rely substantially on the agency intent in enacting a rule or regulation,not merely whether the effect of the rule is a change or a clarification.thus,we reject the government argument and instead apply the factors outlined in landgraf.
two related decisions in the january and october hq rulings raise retroactivity concerns.the first is customs conclusion that cruise lines are subject to hmt liability.january hq ruling,custom hq lexis,at.the second is an evidentiary presumption that all passengers disembarked boarded the cruise ship at each layover stop.the january hq ruling reads,customs is entitled to the presumption,rebuttable upon submission of adequate documentation,that every passenger travelling on the vessel disembarks boards at these stopover ports within the meaning of e and that hmfs hmts should be assessed accordingly.id.at.
to determine whether these decisions would have retroactive effect if applied to conduct occurring prior to january,we examine the landgraf factors,namely,the nature and extent of the change of the law,the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event,and familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.at.
princess contends that prior to the january hq ruling the contemporaneous state of the law held that such layover stops were not subject to hmt assessment.in other words,princess argues that the nature and extent of the change of the law was significant indeed,no liability to liability per passenger.
princess contention conflicts generally with our prior decision in this case,where we held that the relevant statute,congressional intent,and regulation were sufficiently ambiguous to require deference to,and adoption of,customs interpretation of its ambiguous regulation.princess cruises,at.in the prior decision,we found ambiguous the congressional intent,although we noted that the legislative history related to the hmt and subsequent taxes implies that congress believed that the hmt applied to stopovers.id.at.we also found ambiguous an interpretive regulation providing that liability accrued when a passenger boards or disembarks a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section.id.at quoting e.we thus concluded that we were forced to rely on customs interpretation of its own regulations.id.at.our prior decision in this case thus demonstrates that the state of the law prior to the january and october hq rulings was not settled in favor of princess.accordingly,because customs was required merely to decide an unsettled question between two competing viewpoints,that decision,by itself,would be unlikely to effect a significant change in the law.princess also relies on two specific pieces of evidence in support of its march,letter from a customs regional director and a cruise vessel summary sheet cvss.we find neither persuasive.
princess mistakenly relies on the march,letter it received from donald frigge,a customs regional director.in this letter,frigge stated that we have received word from the office of regulations and rulings that a sic applies to your alaska voyages and no hmf hmt is due for stopovers layovers.in this appeal,princess contends that this letter was a valid ruling under the customs service own regulations existing at the time,citing the definition of ruling letter in d.we rejected this contention,however,in our prior decision in this case,where we held that the letter was not a formal letter ruling or adjudication by customs.princess cruises,at.indeed,we find troubling princess failure to cite our prior decision in its argument on this point.
second,princess cites the cvss,which princess,along with other cruise lines,was required to complete and send to customs on a quarterly basis.two categories of requested information are of particular relevance,namely,number of passengers on cruise and total eligible charges for passengers on cruise.under the january hq ruling,a cruise line hmt liability is limited to those passengers who actually disembark board the cruise ship at the layover port eligible passengers.princess contends that the existence of a blank for the total number of passengers on the cruise and the absence of a blank for the number of eligible passengers necessarily means that the hmt would not be charged for mere layovers.princess also points out that the regulations accompanying the cvss did not provide any direction on how to calculate the hmt liability.although a blank space labeled total number of eligible passengers may have been clearer,we disagree that hmt liability is inconsistent with the cvss.instead,a cruise that made only a layover stop at an port could have listed the total eligible charges based on the number of eligible passengers in the total eligible charges for passengers on cruise category.thus,we disagree with princess that the state of the law prior to the january hq ruling was settled that cruise lines were not liable for hmt payments.
we agree,however,with princess that the combination of the january hq ruling that cruise lines were liable for hmt payments with the evidentiary presumption that all passengers disembarked boarded at the layover port does result in a significant change in the law.in the october hq ruling,customs acknowledged that the evidentiary presumption of the january ruling is nowhere to be found in either the hmf hmt statute or regulations.custom hq lexis,at.the imposition of such a strong and unprecedented presumption with no basis in either the statute or regulations changes the law
