roger tudor appeals from a decision of the merit systems protection board sustaining his demotion by the internal revenue service from supervisory special agent to investigative analyst.because the administrative judge misconstrued an important component of the evidence in the case,we reverse the board decision and remand the case to the board for further proceedings.
beginning in,tudor was employed as a supervisory special agent with the irs criminal investigation office in dallas,texas.in that capacity,he directed a group of irs special agents investigating criminal tax fraud.his group engaged in irs activity,whereby investigations would take place very rapidly in response to bulk currency and money laundering activities discovered in the field.
tudor was directly supervised by an assistant special agent in charge asac in the dallas field office.georgia taylor was the asac responsible for tudor supervision for most of the time period at issue in this case.for two months in late and for four months in mid,taylor left the dallas office on assignment and was replaced by catherine tucker as acting asac.the asac or acting asac was supervised by special agent in charge sac michael lacenski.the sac was,in turn,supervised by the dallas director of field operations dfo,john imhoff.after the period at issue in this case,sac lacenski and dfo imhoff were succeeded by erick martinez and michael lahey,respectively.
in late,dfo lahey ordered an irs management inquiry in response to allegations that tudor had manipulated data entered into the agency criminal information management inventory system cimis.the management inquiry was conducted by two irs employees,debra king and charles pearre.in the course of the inquiry,king and pearre interviewed tudor and lacenski,preparing memoranda based on those interviews.ultimately,king and pearre concluded that tudor had manipulated information entered in cimis and had circumvented irs approval policies on several occasions between february and july.the treasury inspector general for tax administration followed up on the management inquiry with its own investigation.as part of that investigation,treasury department special agents conducted their own interview of tudor.the outcome of the inspector general investigation was a november report that substantiated seven allegations of misconduct on tudor part.
the inspector general report was referred to the irs for resolution.in june,sac martinez issued a notice to tudor proposing to demote him to investigative analyst based on three charges failure to obtain appropriate approval authority for certain actions unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer information and repeated entry of false information in cimis.the first charge consisted of specifications specifications of improper initiation of investigations without authority specifications of improper referral of irs investigations to attorneys offices for prosecution and one specification of improper initiation of a subject seizure investigation.for each specification,tudor was alleged to have improperly signed a criminal investigation investigation report,known as form.in november,deciding official steven pregozen issued a notice of demotion sustaining all of the charges and specifications.
tudor appealed his demotion to the merit systems protection board.the administrative judge who was assigned to the case sustained the irs action based on the referral specifications of the first charge and the second charge of unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer information.the administrative judge did not make conclusive determinations regarding the remaining specifications of the first charge,and he explicitly found that the third charge of entry of false information was unsubstantiated.because pregozen testified that he would have imposed the same penalty on tudor based on the first charge alone,the administrative judge found the penalty of demotion appropriate.tudor appealed to the full board,which had two members at the time.the board could not agree on the proper disposition of the case,so the decision of the administrative judge became the final decision of the board.this appeal followed.
the sole issue presented on appeal is whether there is adequate evidentiary support for the administrative judge findings related to the specifications of the first charge dealing with improper referrals of investigations to attorneys offices for prosecution.tudor argues that his uncontradicted testimony before the administrative judge established that he was given verbal authorization by his superiors to directly refer investigations to u.attorneys offices.the treasury department responds that tudor referral activities were undisputedly contrary to irs policy,that the administrative judge finding that tudor did not have verbal authorization to refer investigations was based on a virtually unreviewable credibility determination,and that the record as a whole supports the administrative judge conclusion.
the treasury department is correct that irs policy prohibited tudor from referring cases to attorneys offices for prosecution.see internal revenue manual requiring sac to make prosecution referrals.tudor admitted as much in his testimony before the administrative judge,and he does not challenge that determination here.however,according to the deciding official,tudor noncompliance with irs policy was not in itself sufficient to sustain the charge of failure to obtain appropriate approval authority.pregozen testified that he would have not sustained the first charge if tudor superiors had condoned his approval activities,even though those activities were contrary to irs policy.tudor challenges the administrative judge conclusion that it was inherently improbable that either the sac or the asac granted tudor approval to refer investigations for prosecution.
tudor testified at the hearing before the administrative judge that he believed he possessed assumed,implied authority from sac lacenski to refer investigations for prosecution.according to tudor,sac lacenski would give him verbal approval to initiate investigations and refer investigations to attorneys offices.tudor stated that sac lacenski had given him a lot of leeway to depart from irs approval policies.he added that he went ahead and processed the case through like sac lacenski instructed,in the belief that his actions were proper.tudor testified that he discussed cases that he referred for prosecution with his sac several times and with his asac over the telephone or during routine workload reviews.he stated that he was never reprimanded by sac lacenski,asac taylor,acting asac tucker,or anyone else for directly referring investigations to attorneys offices,and that he would have stopped referring investigations if he had been told not to do so.
the administrative judge did not credit tudor testimony because he regarded it as inconsistent with the testimony of sac lacenski.the administrative judge found sac lacenski to be very clear that he had never authorized tudor to refer any cases to the attorney.the administrative judge decision to credit sac lacenski testimony over that of tudor on this critical issue would be permissible if the two were in conflict,as the administrative judge believed.however,the administrative judge characterization of sac lacenski testimony is unsupported by the hearing transcript.the sole reference in sac lacenski testimony to referrals for prosecution,as opposed to investigation initiations,was the following sentence 
when cases were referred for prosecution,my instructions to both tudor and the assistant special agent in charge was that that would have to be a situation that was discussed with the assistant special agent in charge.
that statement is not inconsistent with tudor testimony that he was given verbal approval authority by his superiors to refer investigations for prosecution,and that he discussed those referred investigations with his asac.
sac lacenski never testified that he did not give approval authority for tudor to refer investigations for prosecution.in the statement on which the administrative judge may have relied,sac lacenski stated tha
