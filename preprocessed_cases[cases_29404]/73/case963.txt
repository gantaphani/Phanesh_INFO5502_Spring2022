teruya brothers,teruya is a hawaii corporation involved in,among other things,the purchase and development of residential and commercial real estate.this appeal concerns the tax treatment of real estate transactions involving two of teruya properties,the ocean vista condominium complex ocean vista,and the royal towers apartment building royal towers.
teruya owned a fee simple interest in a parcel of land underlying the ocean vista complex in honolulu,hawaii.golden century investments company golden held a lease on the land,and the association of apartment owners of ocean vista the association held a sublease on the property.
in march,the association wrote to teruya,inquiring about the possibility of purchasing ocean vista.teruya responded that it was not interested in selling,though it later told golden,which was also interested in the property,that it might part with the land through a exchange.
following a series of negotiations,golden sent a letter of intent to purchase ocean vista from teruya for.it also offered its cooperation so that teruya can effectuate a tax deferred exchange of teruya i nterests.the letter of intent was later amended to state,it is understood and agreed that teruya obligation to sell teruya interests to golden is conditioned upon teruya consummating a tax deferred exchange of teruya i nterests.
in june,teruya proposed purchasing real property known as kupuohi ii from times super market,times,a company in which it owned of the common shares.the proposal stated that the purchase will be subject to a four party exchange,and allowed teruya to cancel the proposed purchase should the ocean vista transaction fail to proceed according to present plans.times agreed to sell kupuohi ii for.
on april,the association made a formal offer to purchase ocean vista for which teruya accepted.the parties contract provided that teruya may,in its sole discretion,structure this transaction as a exchange pursuant to section of the internal revenue code.the contract also included as a condition precedent to the sale that teruya shall be in a position to close on its exchange replacement properties.
in august,exchange,tge contracted to act as an exchange party to complete the exchange of ocean vista.tge would convey ocean vista to the association,and then acquire replacement property for teruya with the ocean vista sale proceeds,all with the stated purpose of qualifying the exchange under.teruya agreed to identify suitable replacement property,and to provide any funds in excess of the ocean vista sale proceeds needed to purchase the replacement property.the parties agreed that if teruya could not locate suitable replacement property,the contract between teruya and tge would be terminated.
on september,per the agreement,tge sold ocean vista to the association for.that same day,tge used the proceeds from the ocean vista sale along with an additional from teruya to purchase kupuohi ii from times for tge then transferred kupuohi ii to teruya.
teruya basis in ocean vista was,but it deferred recognizing gain on its in profits under the exchange provisions of.times had a basis in kupuohi ii of,and realized and recognized a gain on the property sale.times paid no tax on this gain,however,because it had a large net operating loss for the tax year in question.
in sum,before the transaction teruya owned ocean vista and times owned kupuohi ii.after the exchange,teruya owned kupuohi ii,the association owned ocean vista,and times had the cash from the sale of ocean vista along with additional funds from teruya.
the royal towers exchange substantially mirrored the ocean vista transaction.
in teruya owned a fee simple interest in royal towers,an apartment complex in honolulu,hawaii.late that year,teruya agreed to sell royal towers to savio development company savio for million later negotiated down to.as with the ocean vista transaction,this agreement was expressly conditioned on teruya successfully completing a exchange.
anticipating that royal towers would soon be sold,in september teruya sent times a letter of intent to purchase two pieces of land known respectively as kupuohi i and kaahumanu.the letter was materially identical to the one teruya sent to times regarding kupuohi ii,and stated that t he purchase will be subject to a four party exchange,and that teruya could cancel the proposed purchase should the sale of the royal towers apartment fail to proceed according to present plans.both companies boards of directors approved the two properties sale in early,with kupuohi i to be sold for,and kaahumanu for.
in august,teruya contracted with tge in order to qualify the exchange under.similar to its agreement concerning the ocean vista exchange which would be signed two days later,tge would convey royal towers to saito,acquiring replacement property for teruya with the royal tower sale proceeds.teruya agreed to identify suitable replacement property,and to provide any funds in excess of the royal towers sale proceeds needed to purchase the replacement property.the parties agreed that if teruya could not locate suitable replacement property,the agreement between teruya and tge would be terminated.
tge sold royal towers to saito on august,for.also on august,tge used the proceeds from the royal towers sale along with in additional funds from teruya to purchase kupuohi i and kaahumanu from times for and,respectively.tge then transferred the two properties to teruya.
teruya basis in royal towers was,but it deferred the recognition of its in profits under.times had a basis in kaahumanu of,and realized and recognized a gain on the property sale.just as with kupuohi ii,though,times paid no tax on this gain because it had a large net operating loss for the tax year in question.
times had a basis in kupuohi i of,and realized a capital loss of on its sale.it did not recognize this loss,however,because prohibits the recognition of losses from sales and exchanges of property between related parties.
in sum,before the exchanges teruya owned royal towers and times owned kupuohi i and kaahumanu.afterwards,teruya owned kupuohi i and kaahumanu,savio owned royal towers,and times held the cash from the sale of royal towers to savio along with additional funds from teruya.
on its corporate income tax return for the taxable year ending march,teruya,pursuant to,deferred gain of from the ocean vista transaction,and from the royal towers transaction.
rejecting teruya treatment of the exchanges,the irs issued teruya a notice of deficiency of for the tax year ending march.teruya petitioned the tax court for a redetermination.the tax court considered the petition on the basis of stipulated facts,and it affirmed the irs treatment in a published opinion.see teruya,subsidiaries comm r of internal revenue,wl.this timely appeal followed.
a is a exception to the general rule that taxpayers must recognize gains or losses realized from the disposition of property in the year of realization.see c.rather,in a section exchange,gain realized on the exchange of property held for productive business use or investment need not be recognized until the acquired property is finally disposed of.to preserve the appropriate tax consequences,the taxpayer retains his original basis in the newly acquired property.id.at d.
the concept behind this exception derives from the assumption that when an investor exchanges a piece of property for another of,he is merely continuing an ongoing investment,rather than ridding himself of one investment to obtain another.see starker united states,cir the legislative history of reveals that the provision was designed to avoid the imposition of a tax on those who do not cash in on their investments in trade or business property.in effect,the nonrecognition provisions further defer tax consequences when,notwithstanding an exchange,the taxpayer maintains a continuing interest in similar property.boris bittker lawrence lokken,federal taxation of income,estates and gifts,ed.
before,taxpayers acting in concert could lawfully use to defer the recognition of gain or accelerate the recognition of loss even as they cashed out of their investments,as indicated by the following example 
a ssume t owns blackacre,which is worth and has a basis of,and her wholly owned corporation,c,owns like kind property whiteacre,which is also worth but has a basis of t and c swap,and c immediately sells blackacre to an unrelated person.if t had sold blackacre,she would have recognized gain of,but c,whose basis for whiteacre becomes its basis for blackacre,recognizes loss of t he presale exchange has the effect of deferring recognition of t potential gain and accelerating recognition of c loss.
congress enacted f in,largely eliminating what it considered to be a tax loophole contained in the section.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat.section f largely precludes the nonrecognition treatment of gain or loss when a taxpayer exchanges property with a related person,and when either party then disposes of the exchanged property within two years 
congress also included f,which provides that a taxpayer may not claim nonrecognition treatment under for any exchange which is part of a transaction or series of transactions structured to avoid the purposes of f.
section f includes several exceptions,as well.as relevant here,exchanges that otherwise run afoul of f requirements may still qualify for nonrecognition treatment where it is established to the satisfaction of the secretary that neither the exchange nor the subsequent property disposition had as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of federal income tax.f c

in conducting our analysis,we are mindful of the fact that tax classifications turn on the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than the particular form the parties employed.boulware united states,d quoting frank lyon united states,d.exceptions to the general rule requiring the recognition of all gains and losses on property dispositions are to be strictly construed and do not extend either beyond the words or the underlying assumptions and purposes of the exception.cfr b.thus,n onrecognition is accorded by the code only if the exchange is one which satisfies both the specific description in the code of an excepted exchange,and the underlying purpose for which such exchange is excepted from the general rule.id 
as an initial matter,the government quite properly concedes that the ocean vista and royal towers transactions both qualify as exchanges under a.indeed,although significantly more complex than traditional transactions,exchanges like those utilized here have existed for nearly as long as the exception itself.see,mercantile trust comm r of internal revenue.the tax court has succinctly described such exchanges general form 
involved in this type of exchange is a taxpayer desiring to exchange property,a prospective purchaser of the taxpayer property,a prospective seller of the property the taxpayer wishes to receive in exchange,and a fourth party.in a simultaneously executed transaction usually done through escrow the fourth party receives the taxpayer property and sells that property to the prospective purchaser.with the funds he receives,he purchases the prospective seller property and then transfers that property to the taxpayer.when the smoke has cleared,the taxpayer has exchanged his property in a transaction,the prospective purchaser has the taxpayer property,the prospective seller has cash,and the fourth party,with the exception of agreed compensation,nothing.
coupe comm r of internal revenue,wl citing mercantile trust.applying this framework to our case,teruya is the taxpayer,times the prospective seller,the association and saito each prospective purchasers,and tge the fourth party,or qualified intermediary 
the government also does not argue that f restrictions on direct exchanges between related parties encompass these indirect transactions.for exchanges conducted through a qualified intermediary,as these were,the qualified intermediary is not considered the agent of the taxpayer for purposes of section a.k g i.teruya,therefore,may be said to have exchanged properties with tge,not with a related person,as required to implicate f.
thus,these exchanges may only be denied nonrecognition treatment if they were part of a transaction or series of transactions structured to avoid the purposes of f.f.
the first step in determining whether these transactions were structured to avoid f purposes is,of course,identifying what those purposes are.to discern a statute purposes,we look first to the language of the statute and second to its legislative history.in re stringer,cir.in this case,though,the statute text provides precious few clues as to congress intent.section f existence alone tells us that congress wanted to limit the ability of related parties to claim nonrecognition treatment for exchanges.but,given that teruya exchanges are not expressly covered under f,it would beg the question to conclude from the statute text alone that congress wanted to deny these transactions nonrecognition treatment.
accordingly,we turn to f legislative history.
the house report accompanying f establishes that one of congress primary concerns in passing this legislation was its belief that the standard as applied to exchanges of property wa s too broad,pt,at.under present law,taxpayers have been granted nonrecognition treatment in circumstances where they have significantly changed their investment as a result of the exchange or conversion.id.instead,the committee felt it is appropriate to accord nonrecognition treatment only to exchanges and conversions where a taxpayer can be viewed as merely continuing his investment.id.
congress also wanted to prevent related parties from taking advantage of d provisions to avoid gains or accelerate losses on investments.the house committee wrote 
because a exchange results in the substitution of the basis of the exchanged property for the property received,related parties have engaged in exchanges of high basis property for low basis property in anticipation of the sale of the low basis property in order to reduce or avoid the recognition of gain on the subsequent sale.basis shifting also can be used to accelerate a loss on retained property.the committee believes that if a related party exchange is followed shortly thereafter by a disposition of the property,the related parties have,in effect,cashed out of the investment,and the original exchange should not be accorded nonrecognition treatment.
finally,the house committee offered an example of a transaction it intended f to cover 
i f a taxpayer,pursuant to a prearranged plan,transfers property to an unrelated party who then exchanges the property with a party related to the taxpayer within years of the previous transfer in a transaction otherwise qualifying under section,the related party will not be entitled to nonrecognition treatment under section.
with this legislative background in mind,we conclude that the tax court did not err in determining that the transactions were structured to avoid the purposes of f.under the guise of a exchange,the transactions allowed related parties to receive nonrecognition treatment while cashing out of investments using provisions.precluding this type of tax result was one of congress primary aims in enacting f.
we first reject teruya contention that the economic consequences of these transactions to times are irrelevant to our inquiry,and that teruya continued investment in real property is dispositive.section f c i disallows nonrecognition treatment if the related party disposes of exchanged property within two years,regardless of whether the taxpayer does as well.thus,examining the taxpayer and relate
