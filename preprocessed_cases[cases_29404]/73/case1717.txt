a classic error in debate is attacking something that your opponent has said,unlike my opponent smerdley,i am in favor of the minimum wage where poor old smerdley has never said anything against the minimum wage.in the case before us,the county of orange has done a magnificent job of showing that the plaintiff can not get relief that his complaint does actually seek.like a dog with a chew toy,the county has shredded the notion one can bring a class claim for a property tax refund.
the only problem is,it somebody else chew toy,not the plaintiff.this action is not,contrary to what we are told throughout the county respondent brief,a class claim for a property tax refund.no refund claims will be adjudicated in this lawsuit,nor will this action itself require any refund checks being issued.this action will,at the most,merely result in an order requiring the county to do what the legislature has already said it must do automatically,which is to send out notices to certain taxpayers when the county has failed for more than two years to make a final determination on their petitions for reassessment.any refunds that occur as a result of this litigation will happen after it is concluded,when individuals file claims in the wake of those notices and,maybe,thereafter file litigation on denied claims.accordingly,we reverse the trial court judgment of dismissal which was predicated on the theory that this is a lawsuit making a class claim for tax refunds.
background 
property values in orange county plummeted in the early and middle.for a while,however,the orange county assessor office chose to continue assessing at least some property as if the inflation of the was still steaming along.the case of william bunker,a homeowner in san juan capistrano,is typical in,just as local property values were,the assessor office assessed his home for the tax year at.bunker,however,thought he had recently lost more than in equity in the property,and on september,filed a formal request to have the property revalued at.the assessment appeals board,for reasons that are irrelevant to this appeal,did not make a final determination of bunker application for reduction in assessment until november,when it sustained the assessor valuation.by december the county was in bankruptcy.
the belatedness of the assessment appeals board final determination is the core of the case before us now.the legislature has enacted a statute,revenue and taxation code section which provides that if a county assessment appeals board does not make a final determination on the application for reduction in assessment within two years of the timely filing of the application,the taxpayer opinion of the market value of the property shall be the value upon which taxes are to be levied for the tax year covered by the application.the taxpayer value is to be placed on the assessment roll,and is to remain there until the assessment appeals board finally does get around to making a final determination on the application.
bunker had paid his property taxes based on the assessed higher value,and thirteen months after the assessment appeals board had sided with the assessor,bunker filed a claim for property tax refund on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated taxpayers to recoup property tax overpayments for the and tax years.
meanwhile,in late,bunker obtained permission from the bankruptcy court to proceed with his property tax refund claim under applicable nonbankruptcy law.bunker filed this class action in march,seeking a writ of mandate to force orange county to comply with section.
essentially,bunker has alleged that the county deliberately covered up,in the shadow of its impending bankruptcy,the legal consequences of its delays in acting on applications for reduction in assessment in some cases.indeed,the assessment appeals board has been alleged to have acted with the most profound cynicism.the complaint alleges that the county immediately caved in to those few taxpayers who understood their rights under section.as to the others,the county deliberately did not comply with section,hoping to reap a windfall because of their ignorance.
ii.procedural history 
judge tully seymour overruled the county demurrer to the original complaint,saying that he could think of neater fact situation more appropriate to a action type of context.however,after finishing discovery in,bunker sought to amend the complaint by adding another tax year.by then the case had been reassigned to judge stuart waldrip,who sustained a demurrer and granted the county motion to strike the class action allegations,but gave bunker unqualified leave to amend.bunker filed a third amended complaint,and the county refiled its demurrer and motion to strike the class action allegations.with judge waldrip retirement a new judge was assigned to the case,judge john woolley.judge woolley sustained the demurrer and granted the county motion to strike,with leave to amend for bunker to file as an individual.bunker stipulated to abandoning his individual claim except insofar as it supported a right to proceed with this action as a class action,allowing the court to enter a judgment pursuant to the stipulation based on the sustained demurrer and motion to strike.this appeal followed.
iii.the plaintiff legal theory 
the problem that bedeviled judge woolley at the oral argument was what precise relief bunker third amended complaint really seeks.to the county,his complaint was simply a class action seeking tax refunds for members of a class,and therefore barred by woosley state of california cal th,d.if the county characterization is true,then this is an easy case and the trial court or at least of it,judges waldrip and woolley,but not seymour was correct.
it is.but to understand what bunker is seeking,a detailed analysis of section is necessary first,if only because of the counterintuitive nature of the statute.it is one of the most remarkable statutes in all tax law.it penalizes the tax collector,not the taxpayer,for failing to meet a deadline.wow.that something you do not see everyday.what more,the legislature put some teeth into the statute it requires the county to formally notify the taxpayer in writing of the consequences of the county delay.
section begins with two subdivisions which set up the requirement for county assessment appeals boards to meet to establish the value of property for property tax purposes a in counties of the first class,annually,on the fourth monday in september,the county board shall meet to equalize the assessment of property on the local roll.the board shall continue to meet for that purpose,from time to time,until the business of equalization is disposed of.b in all other counties,annually,on the third monday in july,the county board shall meet to equalize the assessment of property on the local roll.it shall continue to meet for that purpose,from time to time,until the business of equalization is disposed of.
after these two subdivisions come two unsubdivided paragraphs which allow,with exceptions not applicable to this case,taxpayers to file petitions for reductions in the assessed values of their property any taxpayer may petition the board for a reduction in an assessment and a proportionate reduction or refund of the taxes extended thereon by filing an application pursuant to section or section.the county board shall have no power to receive or hear any petition for a reduction in an escaped assessment made pursuant to section nor a penal assessment levied in respect thereto,nor to reduce those assessments.
the next portion of the statute contains a real whammy for the counties if they delay in acting on petitions for reassessment.if a county does act on the taxpayers petition within two years,it is the taxpayer opinion of value that becomes the operative value c if the county assessment appeals board fails to hear evidence and fails to make a final determination on the application for reduction in assessment of property within two years of the timely filing of the application,the taxpayer opinion of market value as reflected on the application for reduction in assessment shall be the value upon which taxes are to be levied for the tax year covered by the application,unless either of the following occurs the taxpayer and the county assessment appeals board mutually agree in writing,or on the record,to an extension of time for the hearing.the application for reduction is consolidated for hearing with another application by the same taxpayer with respect to which an extension of time for the hearing has been granted pursuant to paragraph.in no case shall the application be consolidated without the taxpayer written agreement after the time period has passed or after an extension of the time period previously agreed to by the taxpayer has expired.emphasis added.
the text of subdivision c does even have a provision that the taxpayer own opinion of value be in good faith or reasonable,and in fact it can result in artificially low values being inserted onto the assessment rolls,mission housing development city and county of san francisco th,d noting that earlier litigation based on section resulted in what property owners had eventually conceded were artificially low values for their property being inserted on the assessment rolls.
next under subdivision c of section is an unnumbered paragraph which adds a few qualifications to the implementation of the requirement of adoption of the taxpayer value.the two years is dated from the close of the filing period giving the county a little more time until the reduction must be made,and exempts the county from having to make the reduction at all where the taxpayer failed to give full and complete information as required by law or where there is litigation directly relating to the issues involved in the taxpayer application,such as,presumably,litigation relating the current value of the property the reduction in assessment reflecting the taxpayer opinion of market value shall not be made,however,until two years after the close of the filing period during which the timely application was filed.further,this subdivision shall not apply to applications for reductions in assessments of property where the taxpayer has failed to provide full and complete information as required by law or where litigation is pending directly relating to the issues involved in the application.this subdivision is only applicable to applications filed on or after january.
when the county has been stuck with the taxpayer valuation in subdivision c if it does act in two years,subdivision d limits the damage.the taxpayer value remains on the roll only until the county finally does make a final determination of the property value d if,pursuant to subdivision c,the applicant opinion of value has been placed on the assessment roll,that value shall remain on the roll until the county board makes a final determination on the application.the value so determined by the county board,plus appropriate adjustments for the inflation factor,shall be entered on the assessment roll for the fiscal year in which the value is determined.no increased or escape taxes other than those required by a purchase,change in ownership,or new construction,or resulting from application of the inflation factor to the applicant opinion of value shall be levied for the tax years during which the county board failed to act.emphasis added.
the enforcement mechanism for the statute is in the final subdivision e.the county is required to notify applicants of any decision not to hold a hearing,and,more pointedly,that as a result of the county board failure to hold a hearing within the prescribed time it is the taxpayer opinion of value which is the value for property tax purposes e the county board shall notify the applicant in writing of any decision by that board not to hold a hearing on his or her application for reduction in assessment within the period specified in subdivision c.this notice shall also inform the applicant that the taxpayer opinion of value as reflected on the application for reduction in assessment shall,as a result of the county board failure to hold a hearing within the prescribed time period,be the value upon which taxes are to be levied in the absence of the application of either paragraph or of subdivision c.
at this point we need to make two observations.first,the phrase decision not to hold a hearing in subdivision e obviously does not relieve a county when the failure to make a final determination on an application for reduction in two years is more the result of simple did ism or press of business rather than a conscious decision not to hold a hearing.in any event,since this case comes to us from a successful demurrer,bunker would get the benefit of the doubt on the factual issue of whether the county deliberately decided to avoid hearings for the petitions which form the class in this class action.the phrase failure to hold a hearing within the prescribed time period is used synonymously with decision not to hold a hearing,and signals a broad reading of the word decision,as in doing nothing is also a decision,too.
the second observation is that subdivision d indicates that when the county misses the deadline,it affects not only the tax,but the formal assessment roll as well.that is,subdivision c affects the amount that a taxpayer is legally obligated to pay when the county misses the deadline.but subdivision d further says that the taxpayer value shall be reflected on the tax roll.it shall be the value upon which taxes are to be levied for the tax year covered by the application,subd.d,emphasis added.
the reflection on the roll pursuant to subdivision d is important,because of another statute,section,which triggers another required notice when a taxpayer has paid more taxes than he or she should pay as reflected on the assessment roll.in its entirety section states when the amount of taxes paid exceeds the amount due by more than ten dollars,the tax collector shall send notice of the overpayment to the taxpayer.the notice shall be mailed to the taxpayer last known address and shall state the amount of overpayment and that a refund claim may be filed pursuant to chapter commencing with section of part.
section is significant to bunker theory,because it furnishes the link between the operation of section and something that actually might one day result in a check being written by the county to an individual taxpayer.bunker basic legal theory goes like this taxpayers who filed timely petitions for a downward reassessment of their property and whose petitions were not finally determined in two years were entitled,under section,subdivision c to two things to have to pay taxes only on the lower amount reflected by their opinion of value in their reassessment petition,and to have the property tax assessment rolls reflect that value as well.
thus,were the county to be compelled to comply with section,two sets of notices would go out.one,required by subdivision e,would tell the taxpayer that the taxpayer opinion of value is now the value upon which taxes are to be levied.but the second,pursuant to section,would tell taxpayers at least those whose opinions of value meant more than a difference that they had overpaid their taxes and could now file refund claims.
iv.the precise relief 
sought by the complaint 
what exactly does the third amended complaint seek much of the document does not read like a complaint at all,but as points and authorities masquerading as a complaint,paragraphs and the rule is hard,fast,and unforgiving.as the court of appeal stated the sanction has far reaching consequences.if the county board fails to finally determine the application within the period,the board loses all jurisdiction to do anything other than adopt the taxpayer valuation.the topic headings in the complaint keep up the same feisty rhetorical style.the statement of facts is essentially a set of assertions of law,the administrative procedures do not remedy a rule violation and a class action is the only method to protect uninformed taxpayers.
but when one examines precisely what bunker is asking for,the relief requested turns out to be rather modest.there are three causes of action a declaratory relief,b writ of mandate,and c a taxpayer action to compel compliance w
