ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment de novo.int l trading united states,we review the court of international trade grant of summary judgment for correctness as a matter of law,deciding de novo i the proper interpretation of the governing statute and regulations and ii whether genuine issues of material fact exist.
as a general rule,the united states is immune from claims seeking an award of interest.library of cong.shaw,d this basic rule of sovereign immunity,in conjunction with the requirement of an agreement to pay interest,gave rise to the rule that interest can not be recovered unless the award of interest was affirmatively and separately contemplated by congress.the only exception to this general rule that is relevant in this case is where congress has expressly provided for interest.courts are not free to infer waivers of sovereign immunity,and any express waivers must be narrowly construed.id.at.in analyzing whether congress has waived the immunity of the united states,we must construe waivers strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarge the waiver beyond what the language requires.quotation marks and citations omitted hartog foods int l,united states.
the sole issue before this court is whether the court of international trade correctly concluded that orlando was not entitled to interest pursuant to a reliquidation under section of the tariff suspension and trade act of.the court of international trade recognized that b provides for interest on excess moneys deposited.orlando food united states,d.int l trade.however,the court of international trade held that orlando was not entitled to interest on its overpayment.the court of international trade relied on the proposition that waivers of sovereign immunity must be narrowly construed and on the fact that some provisions of the tariff suspension and trade act of contained language expressly mentioning interest while section did not.id.at.based on these two factors,the court of international trade concluded that without more specific language referring to interest in section,it could not hold that the waiver of sovereign immunity in section applied to liquidations or reliquidations under section.
a brief overview of the processing of entries of imported goods is necessary to the analysis in this case.subject to certain exceptions,soon after merchandise is imported,an importer is required to deposit estimated duties with the united states customs service a travenol,united states.liquidation generally must occur within one year from the time of entry,again subject to exceptions.a.the procedure for liquidation is prescribed by.once liquidation has occurred,an importer has days to protest that decision,or the decision becomes final.id.a,c customs may also voluntarily reliquidate an entry within days of an original liquidation,whether or not an importer files a protest.id.additionally,c authorizes customs to reliquidate an entry,even if a protest was not filed,to correct certain limited errors where a liquidation or reliquidation occurs,customs is required to refund any excess moneys deposited with interest pursuant to b.however,no statute prescribing or authorizing liquidation or reliquidation refers to section or mentions interest.moreover,a,relating to protests,does not even mention liquidation or reliquidation but provides for a refund of any duties,charge,or exaction found to have been assessed or collected in excess as a result of a protest.section a also does not mention interest or section.
with this legislative scheme as a backdrop,congress passed the tariff suspension and trade act of.section states 
a in section of the tariff act of or any other provision of law and subject to the provisions of subsection b,the united states customs service shall,not later than days after the receipt of the request described in subsection b,liquidate or reliquidate each entry described in subsection d containing any merchandise which,at the time of the original liquidation,was classified under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states relating to tomatoes,prepared or preserved at the rate of duty that would have been applicable to such merchandise if the merchandise had been liquidated or reliquidated under subheading of the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states relating to tomato sauce preparation on the date of entry.
c payment of amounts amounts owed by the united states pursuant to the liquidation or reliquidation of an entry under subsection a shall be paid not later than days after the date of such liquidation or reliquidation.
stat.section a provides for liquidation or reliquidation of entries covered by that section,notwithstanding section.as noted supra,section provides for the finality of liquidations absent a timely protest.thus,section a provides an exception to section for the entries covered by section subsection c provides for payment of amounts owed pursuant to the liquidation or reliquidation but does not mention interest.
orlando primary argument is that the authorization of liquidation or reliquidation in section a invokes section b,which requires customs to pay interest on any excess moneys deposited.we agree.section b is not limited to liquidations or reliquidations under any particular provision.also,section b unambiguously waives sovereign immunity for interest awards on excess moneys deposited.hartog foods,at.as we said in hartog foods,excess moneys deposited refers to an overpayment of estimated duties,the deposit or payment of money beyond legal requirements.id.orlando deposit of funds in excess of those legally required based on an erroneous classification meets this definition.thus,section b provides for interest on orlando refund.although we must construe waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly,there is no principled basis for holding that orlando overpayment was not excess moneys deposited.
the government,however,raises a number of arguments against such an interpretation.first,the government argues that any waiver of sovereign immunity must be present in the statute providing the cause of action,which it argues in this case is section.to support this proposition,the government cites mcgehee panama canal commission,cir.in mcgehee,the fifth circuit noted two exceptions to the government immunity from interest.the first of these excep
