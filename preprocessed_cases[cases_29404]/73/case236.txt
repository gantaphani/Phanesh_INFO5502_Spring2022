the supreme court has long asserted that i n tax law,substance rather than form determines tax consequences.cottage sav.ass comm r,d blackmun,dissenting citing comm r court holding.in this appeal,we are presented with an issue in which the line between substance and form has blurred.the question presented is whether a taxpayer who receives a recovery for lost wages,and who agreed to pay his attorney on a basis,must include the contingent fee in his gross income.we answer that question in the affirmative.
facts procedural posture 
raymond entered into a contingent fee agreement with the law firm of ouimette runcie,under which the firm agreed to represent raymond in his wrongful termination suit against ibm in return for of any recovery secured thereunder.in a jury trial in the united states district court for the district of vermont,raymond prevailed the court entered judgment on the jury award of approximately.ibm satisfied the judgment by sending a check to ouimette runcie,payable to raymond.the firm deposited approximately in its own account in satisfaction of the contingent fee agreement.
on his federal income tax return for,raymond initially included in his gross income the entire amount of the judgment.from his gross income he attempted to deduct the amount of the fees paid to ouimette runcie.see.however,due to the amount of raymond gross income,his tax liability was controlled by the alternative minimum tax amt.as legal fees are among the itemized deductions that may not offset the amt,see b a i,raymond tax liability was based on the sum of the entire judgment proceeds and his household income of approximately.accordingly,his tax liability for was approximately 
in december,raymond filed an amended return.on the amended return,he excluded from his gross income the amount paid to ouimette runcie under the contingent fee agreement.this exclusion eliminated raymond amt liability.given the resulting adjustments on the amended return,raymond calculated his tax liability for as approximately.he thus claimed the irs owed him a refund of approximately.the irs denied the claim.
raymond filed suit in the united states district court for the district of vermont,pursuant to a,challenging the irs denial of his refund claim.see raymond united states,d.he moved for summary judgment contending that,as a matter of law,the amount paid as a contingent fee to his attorney was not includable in his gross income.the government for summary judgment,arguing that the entire amount of the judgment was includable as gross income.the government maintained that the amount paid to raymond attorney was only deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction,as raymond had claimed in his original return.
the district court granted raymond motion for summary judgment,holding the contingent fee excludable from gross income.id.at.the court held that,under vermont law,a contingent fee agreement between taxpayer and attorney gives rise to an equitable lien in favor of the attorney on the taxpayer recovery.id.at citing estate of button anderson.this equitable lien,the court reasoned,effects a transfer to the attorney of a proprietary interest in the taxpayer claim.id.thus,because the amount of the recovery used to pay the attorney fee represents only the attorney interest in the claim,it is gross income to the attorney,but not to the taxpayer.the court viewed raymond as having an insufficient interest in that amount to permit a characterization of it as income to him.the government appealed.
ii.discussion 
whether contingent fees are includable in the gross income of a client recovering on a judgment is the subject of much debate among the circuit courts the majority position is that such fees are includable in the client gross income.see campbell comm r,cir kenseth comm r,cir young comm r,cir baylin united states.the minority position is that contingency fees are income to the attorney,but not to the client.see davis comm r,cir estate of clarks united states,cir cotnam comm r,cir 
courts to address the issue have generally recognized that,in applying a federal revenue act,state law determines the nature of legal interests in property,while federal law determines the tax consequences of the receipt or disposition of property.see united states bank of commerce,d aquilino united states.thus,the courts have typically first analyzed state law to determine the relative strength of the respective interests in the contingency fee.where the attorney interest in the fee is sufficiently strong,some in the held that the attorney has a property interest in it exclusive of the client interest from this,these courts conclude that the fee was never income to the client,but only to the attorney.other in the determined that although state law might provide attorneys with an interest in the fee,that interest is merely a security interest from this,they conclude that the fee is plainly income to the client,albeit income upon which the attorney has a lien 
notwithstanding the prevalence of analysis in this area,several courts have expressly disavowed reliance on such analysis.in young,the fourth circuit stated that whether amounts paid directly to attorneys under a contingent fee agreement should be included within the client gross income should be resolved by proper application of federal income tax law,not the amount of control state law grants to an attorney over the client cause of action.young,at.and in banks commissioner,cir,the court reversed the tax court determination that the fee was includable in gross income,despite the fact that the contingent fee agreement was controlled by california law,thus diverging from on federal grounds.see id.at see also srivastava comm r,cir.
before turning to the analysis of the present case,it should be noted that the minority position in this area is weaker than it may first appear,at least quantitatively.the fifth circuit was the first to speak on this issue,and it held that contingent fees are not includable in the gross income of the client.see cotnam,at.in cotnam,the court held that,under alabama law,a contingent fee arrangement effected an assignment of a portion of the client claim to her attorney as of the date she entered into the contingent fee arrangement this assignment,reasoned the court,sufficiently deprived the client of control over that portion of the claim such that income derived therefrom was not the client,but rather the attorney.
since cotnam,only two circuit courts have defended the view originally articulated in that case.in srivastava,the fifth circuit engaged in a lengthy analysis demonstrating why the majority position appears most then followed cotnam as a matter of stare decisis.see srivastava,at.and in davis,the eleventh circuit followed cotnam insofar as it serves as former fifth circuit offered no argument in its support.see davis,at this leaves just the sixth and the ninth circuits as having independently supported the position that contingent fees may be excluded from a client gross former on federal grounds and the latter on state grounds.see banks,at banaitis,at.with that as our backdrop,we enter the fray.
section a of the internal revenue code defines gross income as all income from whatever source derived.a.the supreme court has broadly construed this definition in recognition of the intention of congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted.comm r glenshaw glass.still,the court has long held that income is not taxable unless and until it is realized.see helvering horst.that is,a gain is taxable not when the taxpayer acquires the right to receive it,but rather when the taxpayer receives the benefit of it.see id.and a taxpayer can receive the benefit of a gain not only by being paid,but also by otherwise obtain ing the fruition of the economic gain which has already accrued to him.id.for example,a taxpayer realizes income when a third party satisfies a financial obligation of the taxpayer the taxpayer is treated as having received that amount as income and is taxed accordingly.see old colony trust comm r.this is true regardless of whether the amount ever passed through the taxpayer hands.see horst,at.
in addition to explaining that income is not taxable unless and until realized in some form,the supreme court has crafted the anticipatory assignment of income doctrine,under which taxpayers are prevented from avoiding the realization of income.see lucas earl.horst,at.in earl,a husband and wife contracted in that they would hold all of their future income as joint tenants.earl,at.on his tax returns for and,the husband thus claimed only half the income earned in those years the court held that the husband taxable income was determined not by the anticipatory contract with his wife,but rather by the amount the husband actually earned in the tax years in question.justice holmes wrote 
there is no doubt that the code could tax salaries to those who earned them and provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skilfully devised to prevent the salary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it.that seems to us the import of the statute before us and we think that no distinction can be taken according to the motives leading to the arrangement by which the fruits are attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew.
earl,at.the doctrine is a practical necessity in a system of graduated taxation without it,a taxpayer in a high tax bracket could avoid heightened levels of taxation by simply shifting income to a taxpayer.although this may not have been the intention of the husband and wife in earl,the court declined to give weight to the motives leading to the arrangement,presumably because such a motives test would be judicially intractable and subject to abuse 
the court applied the doctrine again in horst.in that case,the taxpayer made a gift of bond coupons to his retained the bonds.his son redeemed the coupons in the same year.in completing his income tax return,the taxpayer failed to include the redemption proceeds in his gross income.horst,at.the court held that the taxpayer was obligated to include the bond interest in his gross income.id.at.justice stone wrote that he,who owns or controls the source of the income,also controls the disposition of that which he could have received himself and diverts the payment from himself to others as the means of procuring the satisfaction of his wants.id.at.further,the court declared that t he power to dispose of income is the equivalent of ownership of it.id.at.because the taxpayer had retained control of the bonds,he retained control of the disposition of the income.that is,he retained the power to divert the income to his son.he gained by receiving the satisfaction of giving the income to his son.that gain constituted gross income.
at least two notions seem to be at the heart of the holding in horst.first,as the district court noted,see raymond,d at,the court distinguished between assigning property and assigning income derived from property still controlled by the taxpayer.when a taxpayer effects the former,he is not properly treated as the recipient of income derived therefrom in such a case,the taxpayer has relinquished control over the disposition of the income.but when a taxpayer effects the latter,he is treated as the recipient of income despite having shifted it to another.distinguishing between the two turns on the extent to which the taxpayer has retained control of the source of the income.horst,at.
second,horst emphasizes that the realization of gain derived from take many forms.the key is that through controlling the disposition of income,the taxpayer has received some benefit.the court explained of the taxpayer gift of interest coupons 
such a use of his economic gain,the right to receive income,to procure a satisfaction which can be obtained only by the expenditure of money or property,would seem to be the enjoyment of the income whether the satisfaction is the purchase of goods at the corner grocery,the payment of his debt there,or such satisfactions as may result from the payment of a campaign or community chest contribution,or a gift to his favorite son.even though he never receives the money he derives money worth from the disposition of the coupons which he has used as money or money worth in the procuring of a satisfaction which is procurable only by the expenditure of money or money worth.the enjoyment of the economic benefit accruing to him by virtue of his acquisition of the coupons is realized as completely as it would have been if he had collected the interest in dollars and expended them for any of the purposes named.
horst,at.thus,the two notions are interrelated.where a taxpayer assigns property to another,thereby relinquishing control over it,that taxpayer gives up the power to use that property in such a way as to realize a gain,tangible or intangible.but where a taxpayer retains control over an asset,thereby retaining control of the disposition of the income,that taxpayer has the power to gain through the satisfaction of assigning its income to whomever he pleases.such a gain is gross income.
in the present case,the district court first examined vermont law to determine the respective legal interests in the contingency fee in question.in button,the vermont court held that an attorney has an equitable lien on the amount of his contingency fee.button,at.further,the district court noted that the supreme court has indicated that when an attorney has a lien for his fees,he has an interest or share in the claim itself.raymond,d at quoting nutt knut.from these propositions,the district court concluded that,in vermont,a contingent fee agreement operates more like an assignment of property than an assignment of future income from property.raymond,d at.that is,when a client agrees to a contingent fee arrangement,he assigns to his attorney not merely the future income to be generated from the claim,but rather a portion of the claim from which future income will flow.he has transferred some of the trees in his orchard,not merely the fruit from the trees.id.at quoting estate of clarks,at.thus,the court concluded contingent fee arrangements do not violate the anticipatory assignment of income doctrine first articulated in earl.
in button,the state of vermont hired a law firm to prosecute a claim against the united states.the firm was to be paid on a contingent fee basis.vermont won its case,but the state treasurer refused to pay the fee on the ground that the state constitution required any payment from the treasury be made by special appropriation from the legislature.the vermont supreme court held that the agreement between the state and the firm created an equitable lien on the fund in favor of the attorney to the extent of the amount stipulated.button,at.in discussing whether satisfying that lien contravened the state constitution,the court stated 
although the legal title to the whole fund no doubt is in the state,the petitioners have equitable rights to that portion of the same which represents their fee.this part in all equity and good conscience belongs to them.they have earned it and should receive it.this portion of the fund never legally and equitably belonged to the state as part of its public funds for,at the latest,when received,the lien attached to it and remains upon it so that it is held by the state subject to the same.
id.at emphasis added.the court thus directed the state treasurer to pay the firm its fee.
raymond argues that the strong language used in button indicates that,under vermont law,the interest that an attorney has in the portion of a judgment is a property interest.the client never owns it.therefore,just as the taxpayer in cotnam had an insufficient interest in the fee to make it taxable to her,the taxpayer in the present case never owned the portion of his judgment.it was not his income.however,raymond argument seems to rely on a narrow conception of ownership.to be sure the clients in button and in the present case never had a right to retain that portion of their judgments represented by their attorneys fees.but the concept of property is not exhausted by the right to possess it is also about the right to control.it is clear that,for tax purposes,exercising the rig
