background 
del commercial properties,appellant is an illinois corporation whose principal place of business is in ontario,canada.it is a subsidiary of an affiliated group of corporations the affiliated group whose common parent is dl shekels holdings.delcom financial,is a subsidiary in the affiliated group.delcom financial is a canadian corporation that owns of the outstanding stock of delcom holdings,another canadian corporation.in turn,delcom holdings owns of delcom cayman,a corporation organized in the cayman islands,which owns of the outstanding stock of delcom antilles,a corporation organized in the netherlands antilles.delcom antilles owns of the outstanding stock of del investments netherlands del bv,a corporation organized in the netherlands.
from through,appellant principal business was leasing industrial real estate it owned in the united states.in,when appellant needed funding to refinance and improve some of its american properties,one of dl shekels subsidiaries,tridel corporation,arranged the following financing scheme on july,the royal bank of canada loaned million in dollars to delcom financial.that same day,delcom financial made two unsecured loans to delcom holdings.one of those loans the one directly relevant to this case was for million.delcom holdings then contributed about million to delcom cayman for common shares of stock.stipulation of facts at,del commercial,commissioner.on the same day,delcom cayman contributed about million to delcom antilles and received common shares of stock in that entity.later on that same date,delcom antilles contributed about million to del bv and received common stock in that entity.id.at.
the following day,july,appellant borrowed million from del bv.that same day,appellant guaranteed repayment of a portion of amounts owed by delcom financial to royal bank and authorized royal bank to place a mortgage on its real property in the id.at.appellant also agreed to provide royal bank with annual financial statements,to insure its real property,to assign the insurance policies to royal bank,to defer paying dividends to shareholders,and to use the proceeds from any sales of real property to make payments on the million royal bank loan.brief for the appellee at.
on january,appellant began repaying del bv.del bv transferred these payments either to delcom holdings or delcom financial.the funds were used to pay principal and interest owed on the million royal bank loan.del commercial,slip op.at.beginning in july,however,appellant began making its loan payments directly to delcom financial,and delcom financial then forwarded funds to royal bank in payment on the royal bank loan.id.throughout this time,del bv reported the interest paid by appellant as income on its netherlands tax returns.meanwhile,appellant did not file united states withholding tax returns or deposit withholding taxes on any payments related to the loan.
on october,the commissioner provided appellant with a notice of deficiency stating that it owed taxes and additions based on the interest payments made between and.see,a.appellant petitioned the tax court to determine the correct amount of taxes and additions,contending that under a treaty between the united states and the netherlands,no tax is owed to the united states on interest payments made by an american corporation to a dutch corporation.the tax court held that the series of loans and stock contributions that began with delcom financial and ended with appellant reflect a step transaction created simply to bypass withholding tax.del commercial,slip op.at.because the appellant had not presented any credible argument that its failure to file a tax return or deposit withholding taxes was attributable to reasonable cause,the tax court concluded that appellant owed penalties in addition to the withholding taxes.id.at.accordingly,the tax court ordered appellant to pay in taxes and additions.
appellant appeals from that decision.
ii.analysis 
we review tax court decisions in the same manner and to the same extent as a decision issued by a district court.that is,questions of law are reviewed de novo,while questions of fact are reviewed for clear error.see asa investerings commissioner,cert.denied,d.as we recently noted,in tax cases mixed questions of law and fact are to be treated like questions of fact.id.
appellant challenges the tax court decision on two grounds.first,it argues that the tax court erred in concluding that it was responsible for withholding united states taxes on the interest payments it made to del bv.according to appellant,the financing scheme was not designed solely to avoid taxes.rather,the scheme sought to allow the affiliated group to achieve substantial canadian tax savings,a permissible business purpose under american tax law.second,appellant contends that even if it should have withheld taxes on the interest payments,the tax court erred by imposing a penalty for appellant failure to file withholding tax returns or to deposit the withholding tax.specifically,appellant suggests that it should not be penalized because its decision not to withhold represented a reasonable difference of opinion with the commissioner.we address each of these issues in turn.
withholding of interest payments 
the internal revenue code requires foreign corporations to pay a tax of percent of the amount received from sources within the united states by a foreign corporation as interest to the extent the amount so received is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states.a.an american taxpayer who makes such interest payments is required to deduct and withhold the tax owed by the foreign corporation.see.if the american taxpayer fails to deduct and withhold the tax,he is personally liable for the tax due.see.
pursuant to the united tax treaty,interest payments made by american taxpayers to netherlands corporations are exempt from taxes in the united states.see supplementary convention on taxes on income and other taxes,art.vi.in contrast,under the united tax treaty,the tax on interest payments shall not exceed percent of the gross amount of the interest if the recipient of the payments is the beneficial owner of such interest.convention on taxes on income and capital,art.xi.
under the doctrine,a particular step in a transaction is disregarded for tax purposes if the taxpayer could have achieved its objective more directly,but instead included the step for no other purpose than to avoid taxes.see.tea helvering.in cases,the existence of formal busi
