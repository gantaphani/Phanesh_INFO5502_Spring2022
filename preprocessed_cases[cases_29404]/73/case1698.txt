economic difficulties led plaintiff peter joseph cavanagh,owner of a landscaping business,to file for bankruptcy several times.the employment development department department issued tax assessments for unpaid unemployment insurance contributions and other tax liabilities of the insolvent business.in response,cavanagh filed a petition for reassessment.an administrative law judge alj denied the petition on its merits.on appeal,the unemployment insurance appeals board appeals board ruled that the petition could not proceed during the automatic bankruptcy stay without the bankruptcy court permission.the appeals board vacated the alj decision and held the petition must be held in abeyance so long as the automatic stay was in effect.following the conclusion of the bankruptcy case,the petition was again set for hearing.after cavanagh failed to appear,the petition was dismissed and the assessments became final.
a second bankruptcy followed,and the department issued additional assessments.cavanagh filed another petition for reassessment.hearings on the petition have been postponed in light of a pending criminal case against cavanagh.
cavanagh filed a petition for writ of mandate to prevent the department from taking any further action against him.the trial court denied the mandate petition.proceeding in propria persona,cavanagh appeals,contending the court denial of his petition for writ of mandate conflicts with the express language of the appeals board decision the statute that the court found bars cavanagh from seeking writ relief does not apply and,as a matter of law,the court has a duty to prohibit the department use of false representation in any other court proceeding.we shall affirm the judgment.

cavanagh bankruptcy case was converted to a liquidation under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in december cavanagh was granted a discharge as to all dischargeable debts.
in april the appeals board remanded the petition for reassessment to obtain further evidence as to whether cavanagh was in bankruptcy.the appeals board also sought further evidence as to whether the automatic bankruptcy stay affected the department actions.
the appeals board order stated w e can not tell from the state of the record whether there are bankruptcy proceedings applicable to this corporation and the petitioners in their individual capacities.the petitioners have presented no documentary proof of such proceedings as we can not tell from the record whether such an automatic stay is applicable to these proceedings,we will remand these cases to an administrative law judge for further hearing for the limited purpose of resolving this issue.it will be the purpose of the hearing to provide the petitioners an opportunity to present additional evidence of bankruptcy proceedings it will also be the purpose of such a hearing to provide the department an opportunity to present any evidence and authority that it may have that its actions to assess and collect the assessment are not stayed with respect to either the corporation or to the petitioners,including the authority that establishes that these administrative proceedings are not subject to such a stay.the order also provided the petition for reassessment would be returned to the appeals board for decision after receipt of any additional evidence.
