introduction 
this appeal is from an order granting a new trial,overturning a summary judgment in favor of the taxing authority,county of los angeles.the issue presented is whether respondent taxpayer may challenge assessed real property taxes and penalties in an action for declaratory relief and avoid the limited remedies and procedures provided by california constitution,article xiii,section and the operative provisions of the revenue and taxation code.we hold respondent is precluded,as a matter of law,from pursuing her claim in declaratory relief and that the prescribed constitutional and statutory provisions to challenge the assessment of real property taxes and penalties are mandatory.we,therefore,reverse.
factual background 
respondent rebecca rickley is the owner of record of two parcels of real estate in los angeles county.she took title by grant deed on march.on or about september,respondent received from the los angeles county tax collector four joint consolidated tax bills,totaling each tax bill stated,payment will be accepted without penalty until,and that a percent penalty would be imposed if not paid on or before that date.
in november,the county mailed to respondent four notices of enforcement for each tax bill,informing her,if payment is not made on or before legal proceedings will be instituted.the notices also included the statement that additional penalties will accrue at the rate of per month beginning at on the last day of the second month after delinquency,and that enforcement may include recordation of a lien against the taxpayer personal and real property.
a year later,on november,the county sent respondent four debt notification letters each stated the amount of tax owed based on the previously mailed tax bills.the letters informed appellant that the tax had not been paid and advised that payment of the amount of tax es,and is only good through november,and that a dditional penalties will accrue at the rate of per month hereafter.the letter mistakenly referred to the wrong tax year,when it should have referred to tax year.
on november,respondent mailed to the county four checks which corresponded to the amounts stated in the four debt notification letters.the county contends the amount paid was insufficient.according to the county policy,payments are applied first to reduce accrued penalties before being applied to taxes owed.respondent disagreed with the county and made no further payments.on may,the county recorded liens on respondent property.
the foregoing recitation of the record omits numerous references to other communications between respondent and her counsel and representatives of the county.such communications consisted of respondent and her attorney asserting that the taxes were not owed or were paid or that representatives of the county admitted no taxes were owed.the county contradicted all such assertions.these exchanges are essentially irrelevant because the core issue of this appeal is a dispositive question of law may a taxpayer file an action for declaratory relief to determine the validity of the county claim that she has not paid timely and in full the real property taxes assessed against her property or must the taxpayer exhaust her administrative remedies,pay the taxes and penalties the county contends are owing,and then sue for a refund we conclude the latter is the correct approach.
procedural background 
on march,respondent filed a verified complaint alleging causes of action for declaratory relief,defamation,and abuse of process.in essence the complaint alleges that respondent paid the tax bills in full,but the county recorded liens on her property even though no taxes or penalties are owed.from this premise,respondent seeks declaratory relief for a determination that she is not delinquent on her property taxes and the county unlawfully recorded liens against her property.the same allegations are the predicates for her causes of action for defamation and abuse of process.
the county ultimately moved for summary judgment on the ground that respondent may not obtain a judicial determination of whether she is delinquent on her property tax by declaratory relief,but instead is required as a matter of law to first pay the amount of taxes with accrued penalties,exhaust her administrative remedies and,if unsuccessful,then sue for a refund the county also asserted immunity from the tort causes of action based on government code sections and.
the trial court granted the county motion for summary judgment on march,reciting its reliance on california constitution,article xiii,section,government code sections,and et,and the relevant provisions of the revenue and taxation code the order specifically took judicial notice that payments on the consolidated tax bills were due on october,that respondent payments were made on or about november,that penalties were calculated on the delinquent taxes pursuant to section that the payments made by respondent on november,were applied as partial payments to amounts due on the tax bills in accordance with section that,based on a mistake in the november,county issued document,respondent tendered what she thought was the full amount of taxes and penalties due when in fact it was insufficient and t hat there is no triable issue of fact.the order also provided that the cause for declaratory relief and all other equitable remedies are precluded by the revenue and taxation code.the judgment was filed on march.
respondent timely moved for a new trial on two grounds there was insufficient evidence to prove the board of supervisors authorized the tax collector to accept and apply partial payment of taxes in accordance with the revenue and taxation code and the trial court committed an error of law because agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,supports respondent proposition that a taxpayer may file a declaratory relief action to challenge assessed taxes without first paying the delinquent taxes and penalties.code civ,subd.
the county filed an opposition to the new trial motion that included the declaration of donna doss,an assistant tax collector for the office of the county of los angeles,who is responsible for tax collection operations.the substance of her declaration is summarized as follows 
four consolidated tax bills,four notices of enforcement and four debt notification letters were mailed to respondent and informed her by their terms of the amount owing,the penalties that could be and were imposed,in the sequence recited in the factual background above.
in november,respondent sent four checks dated november,payable to the tax collector,each in an amount that corresponded to the respective debt notification letters.these checks were received over a year after the notices of enforcement were sent to respondent,and thirteen months after the payments were due.
when the payments were received,on or about december,sic,they were months late.the penalty attached on the date the bills became delinquent,november,and the additional penalties accrued monthly thereafter.on the date the checks were written,november,eleven months of penalties had accrued on top of the penalties.therefore,on november,the following additional penalties had attached to the bills 
the county calculated the amount due as of february,totaling 
the allocation of payments received from respondent by the county was made in accordance with revenue and taxation code section,which requires partial payments to be applied first to all penalties,then to the tax due.
on may,the trial court granted respondent motion and issued an order for new trial,finding there was insufficient evidence to prove that the county board of supervisors had approved of the policy of accepting and applying partial payment of taxes in accordance with section the trial court did not address respondent second contention based on agnew state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th,d.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
appealability 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides that an appeal may be taken from an order granting a new trial.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
generally,the new trial order will be affirmed if it should have been granted on any ground stated in the motion,regardless of whether the trial judge specified that ground and even if the judge failed to specify any grounds.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.however,if it appears on appeal that a trial court in granting a new trial based its order exclusively upon an erroneous concept of legal principles applicable to the cause,its order will be reversed.conner southern pacific cal d.
the trial court reliance on the insufficiency of the evidence to prove that the board of supervisors approved the policy of partial payments is without merit.the california constitution limits the power of the trial court to grant a new trial unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.wegner et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence the rutter group.
the declaration of assistant tax collector doss states the allocation of respondent payment was made in accordance with revenue taxation code section,which requires partial payments to be applied first to all penalties,then to the tax due.evidence code section provides that it is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed.therefore,doss declaration overcomes any contention that the county application of a partial payment policy is invalid.it was incumbent on respondent to rebut the presumption and prove the board of supervisors had not approved the acceptance of partial payments.more importantly,this is not a dispositive issue.it is only germane to the extent it may support respondent claim that her payments were not correctly applied,an issue properly raised in an action for refund.
respondent,relying on agnew state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th,d,contends she is exempt from the conventional legislative scheme that requires a taxpayer to pay the tax and file a claim for administrative relief and,if the claim is denied,to sue for a refund,et respondent reliance on the supreme court holding in agnew is misplaced.
there,the taxpayer,agnew,purchased a thoroughbred racehorse and sold a syndicate share in another racehorse.the state board of equalization assessed a tax on both transactions and the taxpayer unsuccessfully filed for a redetermination.at the conclusion of the administrative proceedings,the board issued an adverse notice of determination,assessing a use tax of,plus accrued interest on the purchase of the thoroughbred horse and a sales tax of,plus accrued interest on the sale of the syndicate interest.
agnew paid the use tax and the accrued interest and filed an action for refund of those sums and a companion action for declaratory relief to compel the board to immediately return to him the accrued interest of.he also paid the sales tax of,but not the accrued interest,and filed another action for refund,including a cause of action for a declaration that the board may not require the payment of interest prior to acting upon a refund request.the board demurred and contended that article xiii,section of the california constitution and section preclude lawsuits which prevent or enjoin the collection of the sales and use taxes,and that exhaustion of administrative remedies was required because a tax refund action is the exclusive means of obtaining judicial review of state tax proceedings the board reasoned that by mandating payment of interest on delinquent taxes in section,the legislature manifested an intent that interest be part of the tax.agnew state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.the trial court ruled for the board and declared that the taxpayer must pay the interest as well as the tax before suing for refund.agnew appealed.
the court of appeal reversed.it held that the action was not one to prevent or enjoin the collection of a tax because the taxes had been paid,and the taxpayer is not obligated to prepay the interest because it does not attach to the tax and can not be included in the deficiency.the county petitioned for review and the supreme court affirmed the court of appeal.
the supreme court declared that the requirement of paying the tax before filing an administrative claim for refund is mandatory.the only issue presented was whether accrued interest is part of the tax and must be prepaid as a condition to seeking a refund pursuant to section,subdivision a any person who fails to pay any tax to the state or any amount of tax required to be collected and paid to the state within the time required shall pay a penalty of percent of the tax or amount of the tax,in addition to the tax or amount of tax,plus interest at the modified adjusted rate per month,or fraction thereof,established pursuant to section,from the date on which the tax or the amount of tax required to be collected became due and payable to the state until the date of payment.agnew state bd.of equalization supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics added.
the court held that nothing in the history of article xiii,section supports the argument that the constitutional references to tax encompass interest as an integral part of the tax,and that article xiii,section mandates prepayment of interest as well as taxes as a prerequisite to a challenge to the validity of a tax assessment or the amount thereof from to the present,the constitution has provided only that the tax must be paid.it now states unambiguously that a refund action may be maintained after payment of a tax.art.xiii.since the language is clear and any ambiguity would have to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer,article xiii,section may not be construed,as the board would have it,to require prepayment of accrued interest as well as the tax as a condition to litigation challenging the tax.agnew state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d,citation omitted.
agnew is simply not applicable to the present appeal because it involved the imposition of interest on an assessed and delinquent sales and use tax as provided by section.the collection of real property taxes does not impose interest on delinquent real property taxes but instead imposes penalties pursuant to section all taxes due november,if unpaid,are delinquent at,or the close of business,whichever is later,on december,and thereafter a delinquent penalty of percent attaches to them and section,subdivisions a and d.a taxes on the unsecured roll as of july,if unpaid,are delinquent at,or the close of business,whichever is later,on august and thereafter subject to a delinquent penalty of percent d unsecured taxes remaining unpaid after the penalty attaches shall be subject to an additional penalty of percent attaching on the first day of each succeeding month on the amount of the original tax.the additional penalties shall continue to attach until the time of payment or until the time a court judgment is entered for the amount of unpaid taxes and penalties,whichever occurs first.unlike section,pertaining to sales and use taxes,there is no provision for accrual of interest on real property taxes.
respondent argues that the county distinction between interest and penalties is porous.her rhetoric is premised on the fact that the penalties assessed are expressed in percentages and are therefore the same as interest.the fact that penalties and interest are both calculated as percentages of the tax does not make them synonymous.to conclude otherwise is to engage in a categorical syllogism.
in agnew,the supreme court expressly distinguished interest as a distinct aspect of taxes of particular note is the legislature treatment of interest as a distinct item in the sections of the sales and use tax law which govern the collection of delinquent taxes.those provisions uniformly identify taxes,penalties,and interest as items to be recovered.these statutes refer to tax or interest,or make express reference to interest in addition to the unpaid tax on which it has accrued when identifying an amount to be collected,a tax lien to be imposed,or disposition of sums collected.cal th at,d.
