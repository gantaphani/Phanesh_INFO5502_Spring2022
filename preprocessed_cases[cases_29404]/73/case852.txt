the shareholders of an s corporation appeal the united states tax court decision upholding deficiencies assessed against them based on net operating losses incurred by the s corporation and passed through to the individual shareholders.although not a shareholder of the s corporation,cynthia bean also appeals,as deficiencies were assessed against her because she filed a joint tax return with her husband,gary bean,one of the shareholders.the internal revenue service hereinafter irs disallowed the losses claimed on the taxpayers individual tax returns to the extent the losses exceeded the shareholders respective bases in the s corporation.the tax court upheld the deficiencies,and we now affirm the tax court judgment.
alton bean trucking,a corporation electing treatment under subchapter s of the internal revenue code,experienced net operating losses of and for the tax years of and,respectively.the shareholders of alton bean trucking,alton bean now deceased,mable bean,and gary bean collectively referred to herein as shareholders,claimed their pro rata share of those losses on their individual tax returns for the years through,by way of loss carrybacks and carryforwards.the irs disallowed the losses as exceeding the shareholders respective bases in the s corporation and assessed tax deficiencies against alton and mable bean and against gary and cynthia bean.gary in his capacity as the administrator of his father estate and mable appealed the assessments issued against alton and mable,and gary and cynthia appealed the assessments issued against them to the tax court,which consolidated the two cases for trial and disposition.the beans argued that certain transactions increased their respective bases in the s corporation,which would allow them to recognize more of the corporation losses on their own tax returns.the tax court rejected their arguments and upheld the assessments.
we review the tax court fact findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.mcnamara comm r,cir.the taxpayers bear the burden of proving that they are entitled to deductions for an s corporation losses that are passed through to the shareholders.parrish comm r,cir.
an s corporation is referred to as a passthrough entity because the items of income and expense are not taxed at the corporate level,but are passed through to each shareholder in his or her pro rata share,which shareholder then reports the income and expenses on his or her individual tax return.a shareholder is limited in the amount of loss flowing from the s corporation that he or she may recognize on his or her individual tax return in a given year to the sum of the adjusted basis of the shareholder stock and the adjusted basis of any indebtedness owed to the shareholder from the corporation.d,d.any loss disallowed by reason of section d is carried forward indefinitely until the shareholder has sufficient basis in stock and indebtedness to recognize the loss.d.in this case,the shareholders were denied net operating losses that they had reported on their individual tax returns for losses that alton bean trucking,experienced in and because the shareholders each had inadequate basis in stock and indebtedness under section d.the taxpayers argue that certain transactions should have increased the shareholders bases and that they should have been allowed to recognize at least a portion of the s corporation losses from and.
the first of the disputed transactions surrounds the transfer of assets to the s corporation from a related entity operated by the beans.alton and gary bean operated a trucking company in amity,arkansas.alton owned interest in of the business and gary owned the remaining interest.although alton and gary reported their respective shares of the income and expenses of the business on schedule c for sole proprietors filed with their individual tax returns,they treated the business as a partnership under the name of alton bean trucking company hereinafter company.in,the beans formed an s corporation named alton bean trucking,hereinafter.alton owned of the corporate stock,his wife mable owned,and gary owned.they continued to run both companies through.pursuant to a written agreement dated december,company sold all of its assets,except a receivable due from to,and assumed all of company liabilities.no cash exchanged hands.for tax purposes,company treated the liabilities assumed by as equal to company tax basis in the assets transferred so that neither company nor alton and gary reported any income or loss on the sale.
the taxpayers now argue that there was equity in the assets transferred from company to,which assets were allegedly owned by alton and gary individually,and that the equity should be recognized as capital contributions by alton and gary to,which would in turn increase their respective bases in.we reject this argument for two reasons.first,the transfer of assets was from company to rather than from the individual partners to.thus,to the extent that there was any equity in the assets,the equity was that of the partnership,not the individual partners.the partnership was an entity distinct from its partners,and the partners can not bootstrap their bases in the corporation by transfers made by the partnership see bergman united states,cir no basis is created for a shareholder when funds are advanced to an s corporation by a separate entity,even one closely related to the shareholder.frankel comm r,wl holding that a loan from a partnership to an s corporation did not increase the shareholders bases,even though the partners of the partnership were also the shareholders of the s corporation,aff,cir unpublished.the fact that the partnership was dissolved following the sale in does not change the form of the transaction that the taxpayers chose to the assets from the partnership to the corporation.once chosen,the taxpayers are bound by the consequences of the transaction as structured,even if hindsight reveals a more favorable tax treatment.grojean comm r,cir.
we also reject the taxpayers argument because they have failed to meet their burden of establishing that there was in fact equity in the assets.see parrish,at holding that taxpayer bears burden of establishing his basis in s corporation.the partners avoided tax on the sale of the assets by treating the assets as equal in value to the liabilities assumed by.irrespective of who owned the assets,the taxpayers have provided no evidence that the assets were worth more than the liabilities assumed by to support their assertion that there was equity in the assets transferred to.thus,the shareholders are not entitled to increased bases for any alleged equity in assets sold by company to.
between and,company provided services and parts to and leased trucks to.following the sale of company assets to,company only asset listed on its december,financial statement was a receivable from affiliate in the amount of.alton and gary argue that they are entitled to increases in their bases for the amount of the receivable because they were never paid for the services and lease payments,which made up the receivable.this argument fails for the same reason as the first argument.any transactions that purportedly made up the balance of the receivable were between company and.thus,the balance in the receivable could not increase the individual shareholders bases.bergman,at see also hitchins comm r,wl t he indebtedness of the s corporation must run directly to the shareholders an indebtedness to an entity with passthrough characteristics which advanced the funds and is closely related to the taxpayer does not satisfy the statutory requirements of d.
the taxpayers can not establish that the shareholders are entitled to an increase in basis unless the receivable was distributed by the partnership to the individual partners and then contributed to or otherwise assumed by the individual partners.the taxpayers have offered no such evidence.as such,we can not say that the tax court clearly erred in finding that the receivable was owed to the partnership rather than to the individual partners.the only documentary evidence actually favors the opposite conclusion,that
