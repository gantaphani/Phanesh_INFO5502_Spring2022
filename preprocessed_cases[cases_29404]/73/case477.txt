the tax court held that the taxpayers,the estates of a deceased husband and wife,were not entitled to an award of administrative and litigation costs because the commissioner of internal revenue irs was substantially justified in taking the position that the only discount allowable when valuing the decedents fractional interests in louisiana timberland was the cost of partitioning the property.the taxpayers appeal,contending that the irs did not meet its burden of proving that its position was substantially justified.we conclude that the tax court abused its discretion by finding that the irs position was substantially justified.accordingly,we reverse and remand for a determination of reasonable fees and costs.
john baird baird died on december.his estate included a undivided interest in a louisiana trust that held acres of timberland in noncontiguous tracts in sabine parish,louisiana,ranging in size from acre to acres baird widow,sarah baird baird,died less than a year later,on november.her estate included a interest in the same trust.
baird estate filed its initial estate tax return on march.his estate claimed a fractionalization discount from the pro rata fair market value of his interest in the tracts held by the trust 
baird estate filed its initial estate tax return on january.her estate claimed a fractionalization discount from the pro rata fair market value of her interest in the tracts held by the trust.on february,baird estate filed an amended estate tax return,and a claim for a refund,using a fractionalization discount for the tracts.
the irs issued notices of proposed adjustments on june,rejecting the estates claimed fractionalization discounts,and setting forth the agency position that the only discount should be the estimated costs of a hypothetical partition in kind.that position was based on the report of an irs forester,robert baker.a copy of his report was attached to the notices of proposed adjustments.
concluding that there were no reliable market comparable sales,baker explanation for his opinion,relating to baird estate,is as follows 
using the recommended full interest value for the acres of,a discount can be determined using a cost of a revised timber inventory,surveying the property into equal valued lots and legal costs associated with the partition of the property.dividing the property into acre lots,or variations thereof,and an estimated per survey mile results in survey cost s of.a revised timber inventory would cost.legal cost,as recommended by the estate agent,would approximate.the total cost of partition would approximate.louisiana law cites all partition cost s are borne in the share of ownership.subtracting the partition cost of from the recommended value of,results in an after cost value of.john baird owned a interest in the property or a total recommended estate value of.
baker made similar calculations for baird interest.the estimated costs were equivalent to discounts of for baird estate and for baird estate.
in august,the estates filed protest letters in response to the notices of proposed adjustments.attached to the protest letters were expert reports responding to baker analysis,criticizing baker use of transactions involving sales of controlling interests,and explaining the risks and difficulties involved with partitioning the tracts.the protest letters stated that,under the circumstances,any attempt to partition the tracts would be vigorously resisted by the remaining.
the parties attended an appeals conference in shreveport,louisiana,on october.at that conference,counsel for the estates offered to settle for a fractionalization discount.that offer was not accepted 
on february,the sent a letter to the irs appeals office repeating their offer to settle for a fractionalization discount.the letter stated that the offer would remain open only until march,the day before the expiration of the limitation period for filing a notice of deficiency.the irs did not respond to this letter.
the irs issued notices of deficiency on march.in the notices of deficiency,the agency took the same the only discount from fair market value should be the cost of partitioning the property,based on baker report.the notices of deficiency sought to collect additional tax from each estate based on valuation of the tracts at the exact amounts set forth in baker report.
on march,baird estate filed a second claim for refund based on increasing the fractionalization discount from to.baird estate filed a claim for a refund on may,based on increasing the fractionalization discount from to.
on may,both estates filed in the tax court petitions for redetermination of deficiencies.in its answers to the petitions,the irs asserted the same position it had asserted in the notices of deficiency that the only discount allowable was the estimated cost of a hypothetical partition in kind,as calculated in the baker report.
an irs appeals officer attempted to arrange another appeals conference in houston to discuss settlement of the valuation issue,but the estates refused to authorize their counsel to attend unless the irs would first agree to a minimum fractionalization discount of.the irs would not agree,and so the conference did not take place.on the eve of trial,the irs offered to discuss settlement with counsel for the estates.according to the tax court opinion,that discussion was futile because counsel for the estates demanded a fractionalization discount.
on april,a little over a month prior to trial,the estates served on the irs the expert witness reports of james young,lewis peters,and james steele,iii.all of these reports contain a discussion of the costs,time,and risks involved in a partition proceeding.attached as an appendix to peters report is a report prepared by edward benjamin,a louisiana attorney,setting forth his opinion on the time,costs,and other difficulties in obtaining a partition of property in louisiana.another appendix to peters report states that recently the irs had issued a technical advice memorandum that stated a new position by the irs with respect to discounts for undivided ownership interests in real estate a discount for an undivided interest will be limited to the petitioner share of the estimated cost of a partition of the property.peters states that,in arriving at this conclusion,the irs was either unaware of or ignored a significant body of data suggesting that the discounts for undivided interests should be significantly higher than the pro rata share of the estimated cost of partition.
at trial,the estates presented one fact witness and three expert witnesses.the irs offered francis burns as an expert witness,but the tax court ruled that he was incompetent to testify as an expert.baker was listed as a witness for the irs in its trial memorandum and he prepared an expert witness report,but he did not testify at trial and his report was not offered into evidence at trial.
the tax court held that the estates had established as the average amount by which fractional interests in louisiana timberland are discounted,and that an additional discount was appropriate in these cases due to peculiar circumstances with respect to the decedents remaining family members.
the estates moved for an award of reasonable litigation costs and administrative expenses.the tax court denied the motion,holding that the position taken by the irs in the administrative and judicial proceedings was substantially justified.

at the outset,we note that it is important to define the irs position during the administrative and court proceedings.in its brief,the irs distances itself from the specifics of baker report by asserting that the irs position of a discount of less than was far more important than the actual figure asserted by the agency therefore,according to the irs,the tax court did not abuse its discretion by characterizing the irs position as being that partition was a viable alternative and that the cost of partition would be less than the amount of the discounts claimed by the estates.
at one point in its opinion,the tax court states that the irs position during the administrative proceeding was that the only reduction or discount from the fair market value of the trust real property should be the cost to partition the realty so that the partitioned interest of each decedent could be converted into and sold as a full fee interest.later in its opinion,the tax court describes the irs position as follows partition was a viable alternative and that the cost of partition would be less than the amount of the discounts claimed by the estates.this characterization is quite inconsistent with the record.the irs acknowledges in its brief that the reasonableness of its position in the administrative proceedings must be determined as of the date of the notice of deficiency.the valuation of the tracts at issue in the notices of deficiency is exactly the same amount determined in the baker report,which was attached to the notices of proposed adjustments.in its brief,the irs asked the court to value the decedents interests in the tracts at the exact same amounts referenced in the baker report and the notices of deficiency.thus,the record demonstrates that the position of the irs remained the same throughout the administrative and judicial proceedings in this case the only discounts allowable were those determined by baker in his report,based on the estimated costs of a hypothetical partition in kind.as we have noted,the irs bears the burden of proving that this position was substantially justified.
the tax court held that the irs position was substantially justified for the following reasons during the administrative and pretrial proceedings,the estates did not present facts or arguments to the irs to discredit the irs position that partition was a viable alternative and the estates increased the amount of discount claimed from to,from to,and from to.we shall examine each of these bases separately.
the tax court held that because the estates refused to authorize their counsel to attend a second appeals conference in houston after the estates filed their petitions,unless the appeals officer agreed to a minimum discount of,the estates failed to present facts or arguments to the irs to discredit the irs position that partition was a viable alternative.thus,according to the tax court,the irs was not confronted with the facts concerning the difficulties connected with the use of partition until receipt of one of the estates expert reports approximately days prior to trial and the factual assumptions in that report were not fully addressed until the estates witnesses testified at trial.accordingly,the tax court concluded that the irs was not confronted with the factual predicate that partition may not have been a viable approach until trial.
the estates contend that the tax court was completely mistaken.they assert that in their protests dated august,than six months before the irs issued the notices of objected to baker partition analysis because it was based on assumptions contrary to the facts and lacked legal support and they pointed out that if a hypothetical willing buyer had attempted an actual partition of the noncontiguous tracts,it would have been vigorously resisted by the remaining.attached to the protests were letters from experts dated july and july,summarizing substantial difficulties involved in a hypothetical louisiana partition proceeding.the estates assert that the irs was thus in possession of this information well before it took its position.furthermore,the estates contend that the irs has a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation that would have revealed the flaws in its position and is chargeable with knowledge of relevant judicial decisions.thus,the irs knew or had reason to know of the difficulties connected with the use of partition in these cases well before it took its position.
the estates also contend that the tax court erroneously relied on their refusal to attend a settlement conference in houston.they point out that they had already attended one appeals conference in shreveport on october,and had made a good faith effort to settle with the irs.they state that they considered sending their counsel to houston,but declined to do so based on the assessment of their likelihood of success,the costs,and no assurance of any meaningful concessions by the irs.they state that they nevertheless continued to correspond and negotiate with the appeals officer by telephone,which resulted in settlement of the vast majority of the other issues that were in dispute.
the estates contend further that the irs,by relying on baker report,was attempting to recycle the unity of ownership for disposal theory that this court rejected in estate of bright united states,cir en banc,insofar as it sought to apply family attribution.they maintain that implicit in baker opinion that baird interest in the tracts could be easily partitioned into equally valued lots is the assumption that will cooperate such that a partition in kind would be voluntary or uncontested.in baker theoretical partition in kind,all of the act as a unit for purposes of disposing of all tracts and share the partition costs pro rata.the estates argue that louisiana law does not provide that attorneys fees or other costs of partition will be apportioned pro rata among the when the partition is contested.the estates assert that,under bright,the interests of and baird relatives are irrelevant in determining the value of their estates interests the fact that and baird were married to one another and related to the other beneficiaries of the trust and the trustees is irrelevant the fact that baird interest passed at his death to other family members is an irrelevant,fact a hypothetical seller and buyer must be used,not baird or his estate or the trustees a hypothetical buyer is deemed to be aware of the identities of the other and that they are all members of the same family and baird interest is viewed as a,interest,and baird interest is viewed likewise.
the irs responds that it justifiably relied on baker report,that it had no duty to conduct an independent investigation into the viability of partition prior to issuing the notices of deficiency,and that it is not unreasonable for the agency to require a taxpayer to submit documentation in support of its position and for the irs to refuse to concede the case until the taxpayer produces such documentation.it argues that the estates failed to provide any detailed or specific facts in support of their contention that partition would be impracticable.
our study of the record leads us to conclude that the tax court abused its discretion by determining that the irs satisfied its burden of proof of substantial justification for its position.the tax court based its determination on the argument that the irs received insufficient information from the estates with respect to the viability of partitioning the tracts at issue.we shall therefore describe the information provided by the estates in some detail.
baird initial estate tax return,filed on march,reported the value of his interest in the tracts held by the trust as.in support of that valuation,the return included an appraisal report that contained an opinion as to the fair market value of the undivided fee interest in the tracts held by the trust,and then applied a discount for baird fractional interest.the appraisal report explains that the fair market value of an undivided interest in timberland is generally less than the pro rata portion of the fair market value of the whole as a result of the lack of marketability and the lack of control over the management of the property.the appraisers estimated a discount for the tracts at issue based on the fact that a minority owner of timberland can not force the sale of the timber and marketing of timberland has a relatively high degree of difficulty which is compounded by a minority interest.in support of their estimate of the discount,they cited and attached copies of two cases estate of cervin commissioner,allowing discount for minority interest and lack of marketability for decedent undivided community interest in four parcels of real estate and lefrak commissioner,allowing discount for minority interest and discount for lack of marketability.the discount was an average of the discounts allowed in those two cases.
also attached to baird estate initial tax return was a supplemental statement containing additional information about the valuation of the tracts and the justification for claiming a fractionalization discount.the statement cites this court decision in bright,for the proposition that the valuation of baird interest should be determined as if it were being purchased by a hypothetical willing purchaser.the statement asserts that an partition of the property could only be accomplished with the unanimous consent of all remaining and the of the trust,and that,under the circumstances,the likelihood of an partition is so remote as to be negligible.it asserts that a hypothetical willing purchaser of the interest,who chose to receive his pro rata share of distributions from timber cutting,would likely discount the price by substantially more than because he would have no right to enter into timber cutting or other agreements without the joinder of the other.finally,the statement lists the considerations that would have to be taken into account by a hypothetical willing purchaser who chose to file a lawsuit to force a partition by licitation sale of the entire property at a sheriff sale.
a copy of the trust agreement for the trust holding the tracts was also attached to baird initial estate tax return.the trust agreement provides that any transfer of trust property shall be made only to a principal or income beneficiary of the trust unless written consent is given by all current beneficiaries for sale to a third party.it provides further that any sale or transfer of trust property is subject to the terms and conditions of the trust.
baird initial estate tax return,filed on january,and baird amended estate tax return,filed on february,claimed a fractionalization discount from the pro rata fair market value of each of their interests in the tracts held by the trust.
in support of the discount,both returns attached a supplemental statement and an appraisal by james young.the supplemental statement asserts that a discount is appropriate based on lack of control.it asserts further that the likelihood of an partition is so remote as to be negligible.the statement explains that the discount claimed in baird original return was based on an appraisal which did not take into account any actual comparable transactions,but was instead an average of discounts allowed in the two cases cited in the appraiser report.
young report described transactions involving the acquisition of fractional interests in louisiana timberland from august through august.the transactions analyzed by young reflected that the fractionalization discounts were much larger for sales of interests sales in which the purchaser interest after acquisition was less than than for sales of controlling interests sales in which the purchaser interest after acquisition equaled or exceeded.
in august,the estates filed a protest letter in response to the irs notices of proposed adjustments.the protest letter observes that at a march,the date of the baker irs examining agent supervisor,frederick herzog,insisted that all fractionalization discounts are invalid.the letter states that herzog persisted in that belief even after the estates counsel cited several cases in which such discounts were allowed and approved by the courts.the protest letter points out that,under louisiana law,a buyer of timberland from a or may not remove the timber without the consent of representing at least of the ownership interest in the land and quotes the relevant louisiana statute in its entirety.the protest notes that baker report ignores the fact that,at the time of the decedents deaths,no had a large enough interest in the tracts to obtain the legal right to cut timber by purchasing either decedent interest.the protest discusses case law in which large fractionalization discounts were allowed,and it quotes at length from a ninth circuit case that discusses the difficulties of partition.the protest points out that baker approach is based on speculation about the costs of partition and that no empirical data is offered to support any of his assumptions regarding the costs of a louisiana partition proceeding.it notes that baker reliance on the estate agent for his assumption that the legal costs of a partition proceeding would be is unfounded,and questions whether the estate agent has the knowledge or experience to make such an estimate.the letter cites concrete,stephens,so d.cir,as an example of the louisiana partition process.finally,the letter states that baker opinion that the tracts could easily be partitioned into equal valued lots is unfounded,as well as contrary to the facts and judicial experience regarding louisiana partitions.it states that,u nder the circumstances of this case any attempt to partition the sixteen tracts in question would have been vigorously resisted by the remaining.
attached to the protest letter were letters from two of the estates experts,lewis peters and james young,commenting on baker report.young letter discusses the difficulties and risks involved in a partition proceeding.he states that the fact that the timberland has varying road frontages and varying timber volumes and different land qualities makes it most difficult to assume that one could divide the tracts acre per acre.although a division of value would be more reasonable,a very extensive tally of timber would be required,as well as complete surveys of the property.according to young,this would be a very process requiring numerous experts to include surveyors,appraisers,foresters,legal counsel.
