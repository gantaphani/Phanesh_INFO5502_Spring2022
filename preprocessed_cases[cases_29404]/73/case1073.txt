background 
donald snyder is a vested participant in an pension plan.see employment retirement income security act of,et,et.in accordance with the requirements set forth in a a and d,the pension plan contains an clause.it provides 
benefits payable under this plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation,alienation,sale,transfer,assignment,pledge,encumbrance,charge,garnishment,execution or levy of any kind,either voluntary or involuntary,prior to actually being received by the person entitled to the benefit under the plan.
snyder is,his interest in the has a balance of about,but it is not yet in status.snyder or his surviving spouse or designated beneficiary will begin receiving benefit payments under the plan only upon snyder normal retirement at age his early retirement at age through his total disability or his death.snyder is an.
snyder accrued unpaid tax liabilities in,and.the irs has made assessments and has duly recorded notices of federal tax liens for the taxes due in each of those years,except.federal tax liens have therefore attached by operation of law to snyder interest in his pension plan.see.in december,snyder filed a chapter bankruptcy petition listing the irs as an unsecured creditor in the amount of.the irs filed a proof of claim in roughly that amount,but claimed as secured by virtue of its liens on snyder interest in the plan.
snyder objected to the secured portion of the irs claim.he argued that his interest in the plan was excluded from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to c,and that the irs liens on that interest therefore could not secure the irs claim in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court overruled snyder objection and allowed the irs claim as secured.the district court affirmed.both courts held that snyder interest in the plan became property of the bankruptcy estate for the limited purpose of securing the irs claim.snyder timely appealed.

ii.discussion 
pursuant to a,the property of a bankruptcy estate includes all legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,e xcept as provided in subsections b and c.a.subsection c provides that a restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under this title.id.c.in patterson shumate,d,the supreme court was asked to decide whether applicable nonbankruptcy law includes federal as well as state law.the court held that federal law,including erisa,was included,and therefore that the clause required for erisa qualification constitutes a restriction on transfer enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law within the meaning of c.id.at.see d each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.accordingly,the court held that a debtor interest in an plan is excluded from the property of the bankruptcy estate.at.
the irs argues that despite the clause,snyder interest in his plan should be treated as property of the bankruptcy estate,though only for the limited purpose of securing the irs claim.outside of bankruptcy,the irs stands in a different position from ordinary creditors in that the provisions in pension plans are not enforceable against it.see,mcintyre united states in re mcintyre,cir united states sawaf,cir shanbaum united states,cir anderson united states in re anderson.erisa expressly provides that it shall not be construed to alter,amend,modify,invalidate,impair,or supercede any law of the united states,d,including federal tax law.section of the internal revenue code provides that the united states shall have a lien upon all property and rights to property,whether real or personal,belonging to any person liable to pay any tax who neglects or refuses to do the same after demand,emphasis added and authorizes the irs to levy upon all property or rights to property of such person in order to execute the lien,id.a.
the irs argues that because the plan clause is not enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law against it,c does not exclude snyder interest in the plan from the property of the bankruptcy estate insofar as it concerns the irs.there are two possible results from adopting the irs construction of and treating its claim as secured in bankruptcy.the first is that if snyder bankruptcy plan is confirmed by the bankruptcy court,snyder would have to make full payment of the irs secured claim during the life of the bankruptcy plan.see a b ii stating that a plan shall be confirmed if with respect to each allowed secured claim the value,as of the effective date of the plan,of property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the allowed amount of such claim.in that event,the irs would get in bankruptcy a payment for which it would otherwise have had to wait.the wait would otherwise have been required because the irs can not,outside of bankruptcy,enforce its liens on snyder interest in his erisa plan until the plan enters status.snyder has no right to demand payment from the plan trustee until that time,and it is a familiar maxim that the irs merely steps into the shoes of the taxpayer and does not acquire any greater rights to property than the taxpayer himself enjoys.see united states bank of commerce,d.
the second,and more likely,result of treating the irs claim as secured in bankruptcy is that confirmation of snyder bankruptcy plan would be defeated.if this happens,the irs could escape from having some or all of the debt wiped out in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy plan would likely be defeated because of the difficulty of fully paying the irs claim over the life of the plan.see a stating that a plan shall be confirmed if the debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan.like snyder,the bankruptcy trustee can not gain access to the collateral securing the irs is,to snyder interest in his erisa the plan enters status.see magill state employees retirement in re lyons,cir the majority of lower courts that have considered whether a trustee can compel the turnover of funds where a debtor has no present right to the funds have prohibited the turnover because the trustee claim to estate property is no greater than the debtor claim at the time of filing.we agree with this line of reasoning.citations omitted litig.bulletin,wl in our opinion,bankruptcy,per se,does not accelerate a right to cash payment.in other words,the bankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of the debtor if the debtor was not entitled to a cash payment,neither is the trustee.it is unlikely that snyder has sufficient income or other assets which the bankruptcy trustee could use to pay the irs secured claim.see michael urban,revisiting the scope and implications of patterson shumate in light of in re lyons,am,explaining that,if we were to adopt the irs approach in this case,chapter debtors,in order to get a plan confirmed,may find themselves in the unenviable position of having to fully pay the irs secured claim without access to the asset securing the claim since such monies are locked up in the debtor pension plan.
during the past decade,the irs has taken inconsistent positions on the question before us.in in re lyons,a bankruptcy court held that an irs claim secured by a federal tax lien on the debtor pension was secured i
