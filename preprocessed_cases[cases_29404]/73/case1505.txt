in november,california voters adopted proposition,the right to vote on taxes act,which added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.see apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles cal th,d.article xiii d of the state constitution hereafter article xiii d specifies various restrictions and requirements for assessments,fees,and charges that local governments impose on real property or on persons as an incident of property ownership.here,the main issue is whether a charge that a local water district imposed as a condition of making a new connection to the water system,and that the district used to finance capital improvements to the water system,is subject to the restrictions of article xiii d.other questions presented are whether article xiii d prohibits a local water district from continuing to include in the new connection fees a fire suppression charge,the proceeds of which are used to purchase firefighting and emergency medical equipment for the district volunteer fire department,and whether an ordinance imposing a water connection fee may be amended by a resolution.
on these questions,we conclude a capacity charge imposed as a condition for making a new connection to a water system,the proceeds of which are used to finance capital improvements,is not an assessment within the meaning of article xiii d,and thus it is not subject to article xiii d restrictions on assessments a fire suppression fee imposed as a condition for making a new connection to a water system,the proceeds of which are used to purchase firefighting and emergency medical equipment,is not a fee or charge under article xiii d,and thus it is not subject to article xiii d prohibition against fees and charges for general governmental services and an ordinance enacted by a community services district to impose a water connection fee may be amended by a resolution.because these conclusions are consistent with the trial court judgment but inconsistent with part of the court of appeal opinion,we will reverse that court judgment with directions to affirm the trial court judgment.
facts and procedural history 
because neither party petitioned the court of appeal for a rehearing,we take the facts largely from that court opinion.see cal.rules of court,rule c.
defendant shasta community services district the district is a local public entity organized under the community services district law,et.it operates a water system for residential and commercial users and a volunteer fire department that provides both fire suppression and emergency medical services.in february,the district adopted an ordinance establishing a standard connection fee of,plus the cost of a water meter,for new water service connections.according to the ordinance,this fee included a capacity charge of for future improvements to the water system and a fire suppression charge of.the ordinance did not expressly allocate the remaining,but one may infer that it covered the cost of installing the water service connection because the ordinance also provided that if the water main was not on the same side of the street or highway as the property to be served,the district will charge the actual cost of the connection to the extent such cost exceed s the sum of.
in november,the district adopted a resolution to amend this ordinance.according to the resolution,applicants for new water service connections would be required to pay a standard connection fee the actual cost of a water meter and if the property owner chose to have the district install the service connection,the actual cost of the materials,labor,and overhead for installing the entire service connection including the meter,line setter,meter box,appurtenant equipment,and mainline extension,if any.the standard connection fee consisted of a capacity charge for capital improvements to the water system and a fire suppression charge.the resolution stated that the capacity charge was based upon estimated project costs of for future improvements assigned to the new development of future connections which equals per connection.
in march,plaintiffs jerry richmond,linda panich,hank edelstein,and victoria edelstein,both individually and doing business as a joint venture,brought this action to test the validity of the resolution increasing the fees for new connections.code civ.they alleged that they owned real property within the district and also within an area proposed for annexation into the district.they challenged the resolution on many grounds,only three of which are relevant here the resolution imposed an assessment within the meaning of article xiii d,but the district had not satisfied the constitutional requirements for imposing an assessment the fire suppression charge was a fee or charge within the meaning of article xiii d,and it violated article xiii d prohibition against fees or charges for general governmental services and the ordinance could be amended only by another ordinance,not by a mere resolution.plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment that the resolution was void and a permanent injunction restraining the district from enforcing it.
the action was tried to the court without a jury.at the trial,the district presented evidence showing,among other things,that the capital improvements to be funded by the capacity charge,including a new storage tank,would both remedy existing deficiencies in the water system and expand the system ability to provide service to new customers through new connections.the charge was calculated by allocating percent of the cost of the improvements to new connections and percent to existing connections.water customers throughout the district would benefit from the improvements,but customers in certain areas would receive somewhat less benefit than other customers.after considering the evidence,the superior court granted judgment for the district.the court concluded the connection fee imposed by resolution is not a special assessment but a development fee exempt from article xiii d the fire suppression charge is merely the continuation of a fee imposed before article xiii d was enacted and the connection fee could legally be adopted by a resolution enactment of an ordinance was not required.
on plaintiffs appeal,the court of appeal affirmed the judgment,except as to the fire suppression charge.the court reasoned that the district connection fee was not an assessment within the meaning of article xiii d because that constitutional provision by implication defines an assessment as a charge imposed on specific identified parcels,whereas the connection fee was not imposed on identified parcels.because the connection fee was imposed only when a property owner requested a new service connection,the specific properties for which connections would be sought could not be identified although the number of such requests could be estimated,and thus the connection charge could not be characterized as an assessment.the court of appeal also concluded that the connection fee,because it was incurred only when the owner voluntarily requested a new service connection,was properly characterized as a development fee,and as such it was exempt from the requirements of article xiii 
with respect to the fire suppression charge,however,the court of appeal accepted plaintiff argument that it was a fee for general governmental services prohibited by section,subdivision b,of article xiii d.the court of appeal rejected the district argument that this provision did not apply to fees authorized by laws enacted before article xiii d became effective,but only to fees that were newly enacted or increased thereafter.
finally,the court of appeal concluded that the district could validly use a resolution to amend an ordinance.
ii.the capacity charge 
to determine whether the district capacity charge,imposed only on applicants for new service connections,violates article xiii d restrictions on assessments,we must interpret our state constitution.the principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those governing statutory construction.thompson department of corrections cal th,d.the aim of constitutional interpretation is to determine and effectuate the intent of those who enacted the constitutional provision at issue.ibid.to determine that intent,we begin by examining the constitutional text,giving the words their ordinary meanings.accord,leone medical board cal th,d.
section of article xiii d defines an assessment as any levy or charge upon real property for a special benefit conferred upon the real property art.xiii d,subd.b.it defines special benefit as a particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits conferred on real property located in the district or to the public at large,subd.i.
section of article xiii d establishes procedures and requirements for assessments.a local public agency may not impose an assessment,as defined in article xiii d,unless the agency identifies all parcels which will have a special benefit conferred upon them and upon which an assessment will be imposed art.xiii d,subd.a the agency obtains an engineer report that supports the assessment,subd.b the assessment does not exceed the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on the affected parcel,subds.a f and after giving notice to affected property owners and holding a public hearing,the agency does not receive a majority protest based on ballots weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property,subds.c e.
to determine what constitutes an assessment under article xiii d,it is necessary to consider not only article xiii d definition of an assessment,but also the requirements and procedures that article xiii d imposes on assessments.article xiii d requires that an agency imposing an assessment identify all parcels which will have a special benefit conferred upon them and upon which an assessment will be imposed.art.xiii d,subd.a,italics added.the agency then must give written notice of the proposed assessment to the owners of these identified parcels,subd.c and provide an opportunity for a protest using ballots weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property,subd.e.
because the capacity charge is imposed only on property owners who apply for a new service connection,the district can not identify the parcels upon which the capacity charge will be imposed.here,the district estimated that there would be new connection applications,but the district did not and could not identify the specific parcels for which new connection applications would be made.at most,the district can identify the parcels within its boundaries on which the capacity charge would be imposed if the owners applied for a service connection.but the matter is more complex,because many existing undeveloped parcels would likely be subdivided into an indeterminable number of smaller parcels,for each of which a connection might be requested,thus making it impossible to now determine the proportional financial obligation of the affected property.and even this understates the problem,because owners of property outside the district boundaries may seek service connections by applying for annexation of their property into the district.therefore,it is impossible for the district to comply with article xiii d requirement that the agency identify the parcels on which the assessment will be imposed and provide an opportunity for a majority protest weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property.
we agree with the court of appeal that the proper conclusion to be drawn from this impossibility of compliance is that an assessment within the meaning of article xiii d must not only confer a special benefit on real property,but also be imposed on identifiable parcels of real property.because the district does not impose the capacity charge on identifiable parcels,but only on individuals who request a new service connection,the capacity charge is not an assessment within the meaning of article xiii 
this construction is consistent with settled rules of constitutional interpretation.courts construe constitutional phrases liberally and practically where possible they avoid a literalism that effects absurd,arbitrary,or unintended results.carman alvord cal d,see also california correctional peace officers state personnel bd.cal th,d,a practical construction is preferred.construing article xiii d definition of assessment as applying only to charges imposed on identifiable parcels avoids the probably unintended result of prohibiting local water districts from imposing capacity charges,no matter how modest or reasonable,for new connections because of the inherent impossibility of identifying in advance the parcels for which new connections would later be requested.
this construction is also consistent with article xiii d definition of an assessment as a levy or charge upon real property art.xiii d,subd.b,italics added.the district does not impose the capacity charge on real property as such,but on individuals who apply for new service connections.it is the applicant who must pay,and the district may not impose a lien or otherwise have recourse to the property to compel payment.rather,the district simply does not initiate water service until the charge is paid.a charge that operates in this way can not be described as a charge upon real property,within the meaning of article xiii 
finally,this construction is consistent with the aim of proposition to enhance taxpayer consent.here,the district proposed to divide the costs of new capital improvements between users receiving service through existing connections and users applying for new connections.this case concerns only imposition of costs on new connections.presumably,any costs imposed on customers receiving service through existing connections would be subject to article xiii d voter approval requirements,and thus their consent.customers who apply for new connections give consent by the act of applying.moreover,water connection fees are already subject to significant constraints under government code section 
plaintiffs rely on this court decision in san marcos water dist.san marcos unified school dist.cal d,san marcos.the issue there was whether a provision of the state constitution exempting public entities from payment of property taxes cal,art.xiii,subd.b applied to a local water district capacity fee,used to fund capital improvements to the water system.the constitutional property tax exemption for public entities had been construed to include special assessments,but not user fees,and thus the issue presented to this court was whether the capacity charge was more properly characterized as a special assessment or as a user fee for purposes of this constitutional provision.we concluded that a capacity charge was a hybrid,in the sense that it had some characteristics of a user fee and some characteristics of an assessment.san marcos,supra,at.we concluded also,however,that the fee should be considered an assessment for purposes of the public entity property tax exemption.we established a rule that a fee aimed at assisting a utility district to defray costs of capital improvements will be deemed a special assessment from which other public entities are exempt.id.at.
san marcos,supra,cal d,is not on point here.we were not there construing the term assessment as used in article xiii d instead,we were construing the constitutional provision exempting public entities from property taxes cal,art.xiii,subd.b,a provision in which the term assessment does not appear.in deciding what constituted an assessment in san marcos,we sought to determine and effectuate the constitutional purpose for exempting public entities from property taxes,a purpose that plays no role in interpreting the provisions of article xiii d that are at issue here.the characteristic that we found determinative for identifying assessments in san the proceeds of the fee were used for capital no part of article xiii d definition of assessments.for each of these reasons,we agree with the court of appeal that san marcos is not helpful,much less controlling,in this strikingly different context.see ginns savage cal d,fn,language used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court,and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.people woodhead cal d,a word may have different legal meanings in different contexts in re marriage of buol cal d,fn,same.
plaintiffs invoke the rule that when a term has been given a particular meaning by a judicial decision,it should be presumed to have the same meaning in statutes or constitutional provisions.see people hurtado cal th,d,arnett dal cielo cal th,d.plaintiffs argue that san marcos,supra,cal d,gave the term assessment a precise legal meaning as applying to capacity charges used to fund capital improvements,and therefore the term assessment in article xiii d,enacted after san marcos,must be construed to have the same meaning.but the rule that plaintiffs invoke does not apply when,as here,the statute or constitutional provision contains its own definition of the term at issue if the legislature has provided an express definition of a term,that definition ordinarily is binding on the courts.curle superior court cal th,d.here,article xiii d provides both an express definition of assessment and an implied qualification of that definition through the requirement that the agency identify the specific parcels on which the assessment will be imposed.
plaintiffs next rely on the definition of assessment in government code section,part of the proposition omnibus implementation act,that the legislature enacted in.stats,ch.government code section states that f or purposes of article xiii c and article xiii d of the california constitution an assessment means any levy or charge by an agency upon real property that is based upon the special benefit conferred upon the real property by a public improvement or service,that is imposed to pay the capital cost of the public improvement,the maintenance and operation expenses of the public improvement,or the cost of the service being provided,subd.b.as plaintiffs point out,this definition does not distinguish between charges imposed only in response to a request for service and charges imposed on previously identified parcels.in this respect,the statutory definition is no different from the constitutional definition in section,subdivision b,of article xiii d.but the statutory provisions implementing article xiii d,like article xiii d itself,assume that assessments are imposed only on identified parcels.under government code section,subdivision b,before levying a new or increased assessment,an agency must give notice to the record owner of each identified parcel.government code section,subdivision g,defines an identified parcel as a parcel of real property that an agency has identified as having a special benefit conferred upon it and upon which a proposed assessment is to be imposed because the statutory provisions merely reflect the constitutional provisions,they do not alter our conclusion that under article xiii d an assessment is a charge imposed on previously identified parcels,and not a charge imposed only as a condition of extending service through a new service connection.
arguing that a charge imposed only on property owners who voluntarily seek a governmental service or approval may properly be characterized as an assessment,plaintiffs call our attention to the integrated financing district act,et,under which local agencies may establish contingent assessments payable only when a landowner applies for development approval.see.as plaintiffs point out,the integrated financing district act includes notice and majority protest provisions for owners of property subject to the contingent assessment.see southern pacific pipe lines,board of supervisors th,d.we agree that the district capacity charge is similar to a contingent assessment under the integrated financing district act,but this observation does not assist plaintiffs.unlike article xiii d,the integrated financing district act does not require a local agency to identify in advance the particular parcels that will be subject to the assessment.instead,the notice of intention to impose a contingent assessment goes to all owners of property within the proposed assessment zone,and the assessment can not be imposed if protested by the owners of more than of the area of the property within the proposed district which is proposed to be subject to the contingent assessment immediately or in the future,subd.d.thus,under the integrated financing district act,in contrast to article xiii d,all owners of property potentially subject to a charge are entitled to notice and a weighted vote.
article xiii d could have been written,like the integrated financing district act,to cover contingent assessments as well as assessments imposed only on previously identified parcels.but it was not written in that manner,and we remain persuaded that a capacity charge contingent on some voluntary action by the property owner is not an assessment within the meaning of article xiii 
plaintiffs argue that the court of appeal erred in characterizing the district capacity charge as a development fee.observing that development fees are imposed only if a property owner elects to develop loyola marymount university los angeles unified school dist.th,d,the court of appeal reasoned that the district capacity charge,because it was imposed only in response to a property owner voluntary decision to request a service connection,should be considered a development fee and thus exempt from the requirements of article xiii d under its section,subdivision b,stating that n othing in this article shall be construed to a ffect existing laws relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property development.
plaintiffs insist that the district capacity charge can not be a development fee because the district has no authority to approve or disapprove property development,and because a property owner may request a new service connection without proposing any new development,such as when the owner of a previously developed residential parcel decides to use the district water instead of water from an existing well on the property.
we agree with plaintiffs that the district capacity charge is not a development fee.it is similar to a development fee in being imposed only in response to a property owner voluntary application to a public entity,but it is different in that the application may be only for a water service connection without necessarily involving any development of the property.see utility cost management indian wells valley water,supra,cal th at,d,noting that a capacity charge might apply regardless of whether a development project is at issue capistrano beach water dist.taj development th,d concluding that a capacity charge is not a development fee under the mitigation fee act,et.our agreement that the capacity charge is not a development fee does not assist plaintiffs,however,because it does not mean that the capacity charge is an assessment within the meaning of article xiii d.the capacity charge is neither an assessment nor a development fee under article xiii 
we conclude,as did the trial court and the court of appeal,that the district capacity charge is not an assessment under article xiii 
iii.the fire suppression charge 
article xiii d provides no fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services including,but not limited to,police,fire,ambulance or library services,where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.art.xiii d,subd.b,italics added.at the trial below,the evidence showed that the district uses the proceeds of the fire suppression component of the connection fee to purchase equipment for its volunteer fire department,including both firefighting equipment and emergency medical equipment the fire department provides firefighting and emergency medical services to the public at large.accordingly,the district fire suppression charge is imposed for general governmental services within the meaning of section,subdivision b,of article xiii d,and it is prohibited by that provision if it satisfies article xiii d definition of a fee or charge.
article xiii d defines a fee or charge as any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a service,subd.e.it defines service as a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership,subd.h.
the district argues that the connection fee,including its fire suppression component,does not fall within article xiii d definition of a fee or charge because it is not imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership.art.xiii d,subd.e.the district does not impose the fee on parcels of real property but on persons who apply for a water service connection.the district does not impose the fee on such persons as an incident of property ownership but instead as an incident of their voluntary decisions to request water service.if a person fails to pay the connection fee,the district does not collect it by levying upon the person property.rather,because the person applying for service has not satisfied a condition for extending service,the district does not make the water connection and does not provide water service.
we agree that a connection charge,because it is not imposed as an incident of property ownership art.xiii d,subd.e,is not a fee or charge under article xiii d.a connection fee is not imposed simply by virtue of property ownership,but instead it is imposed as an incident of the voluntary act of the property owner in applying for a service connection.
urging a different construction,plaintiffs rely on article xiii d definition of a fee or charge as including a user fee or charge for a service,subd.e.they argue that supplying water is a service,and,therefore,all charges for water service must be deemed to be imposed upon a person as an incident of property ownership.
we agree that supplying water is a service within the meaning of article xiii d definition of a fee or charge.in the ballot pamphlet for the election at which article xiii d was adopted,the legislative analyst stated that f ees for water,sewer,and refuse collection service probably meet the measure definition of fee.ballot,analysis of by legis.analyst.the legislative analyst apparently concluded that water service has a direct relationship to property ownership,and thus is a service within the meaning of article xiii d because water is indispensable to most uses of real property because water is provided through pipes that are physically connected to the property and because a water provider may,by recording a certificate,obtain a lien on the property for the amount of any delinquent service charges see.but the legislative analyst was apparently referring to fees imposed on existing water service customers,not fees imposed as a condition of initiating water service in the first instance.
several provisions of article xiii d tend to confirm the legislative analyst conclusion that charges for utility services such as electricity and water should be understood as charges imposed as an incident of property ownership.for example,subdivision b of section provides that fees for the provision of electrical or gas service shall not be deemed charges or fees imposed as an incident of property ownership under article xiii under the rule of construction that the expression of some things in a statute implies the exclusion of other things not expressed in re bryce cal th,d,the expression that electrical and gas service charges are not within the category of fees implies that similar charges for other utility services,such as water and sewer,are fees subject to the restrictions of article xiii 
this implication is reinforced by subdivision c of article xiii d,section,which expressly excludes fees or charges for sewer,water,and refuse collection services from the voter approval requirements that article xiii d imposes on fees and charges.because article xiii d does not include similar express exemptions from the other requirements that it imposes on fee and charges,the implication is strong that fees for water,sewer,and refuse collection services are subject to those other requirements.see howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d reaching the same conclusion.
thus,we agree that water service fees,being fees for services,may be fees or charges within the meaning of article xiii d.but we do not agree that all water service charges are necessarily subject to the restrictions that article xiii d imposes on fees and charges.rather,we conclude that a water service fee is a fee or charge under article xiii d if,but only if,it is imposed upon a person as an incident of property ownership.art.xiii d,subd.e.a fee for ongoing water service through an existing connection is imposed as an incident of property ownership because it requires nothing other than normal ownership and use of property.but a fee for making a new connection to the system is not imposed as an incident of property ownership because it results from the owner voluntary decision to apply for the connection.
any doubt on this point is removed by considering the requirements that article xiii d imposes on fees and charges.as with assessments,article xiii d requires local government agencies to identify the parcels affected by a fee or charge.specifically,it requires the agency to identify t he parcels upon which a fee or charge is proposed for imposition.art.xiii d,subd.a.as we have explained,it is impossible for the district to comply with such a requirement for connection charges,because the district can not determine in advance which property owners will apply for water service connection.as with assessments,this impossibility of compliance strongly suggests that connection fees for new users are not subject to article xiii d restrictions on fees.
because the connection fee,including the fire suppression charge,is not a fee or charge within the meaning of article xiii d,it is not subject to article xiii d prohibition on fees or charges for general governmental services.
iv.amendment of an ordinance by a resolution 
government code section,part of the mitigation fee act,et,provides in subdivision b any action by a local agency to levy a new fee or service charge or to approve an increase in an existing fee or service charge shall be taken only by ordinance or resolution.italics added.we agree with the court of appeal that this provision authorizes the district to use a resolution to increase existing connection fees,and that this authorization applies even when the fees were initially imposed by an ordinance.
arguing to the contrary,plaintiffs assert that the mitigation fee act is procedural rather than substantive.in other words,it does not give local water districts substantive authority to impose fees,but instead it merely regulates the manner in which fees may be imposed.but whether a fee imposed by ordinance may be amended by resolution is essentially a question of procedure,not substance.therefore,we may and do construe government code section as giving the district authority to use a resolution to amend a fee ordinance.
in support of their position that the district may not use a resolution to amend an ordinance imposing a connection fee,plaintiffs rely on cavalier acres,san simeon acres community services district d.cavalier acres,in which the court of appeal concluded that a community services district could impose or increase water charges only by ordinance.in reaching this conclusion,the cavalier acres court of appeal relied on government code section and health and safety code section.relying on the rule of construction that when two statutory provisions conflict,the one that is more specific controls,the cavalier acres court of appeal stated that,as applied to water charges imposed by a community services district,government code section and health and safety code section were both more specific than government code section.
government code section is part of the community services district law,et.as here relevant,it provides except as otherwise provided in this section,a district may by ordinance adopt regulations binding upon all persons to govern the construc
