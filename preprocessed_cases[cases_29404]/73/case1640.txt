the power to tax is the power to oppress,and people have rebelled against that power ever since taxes have been imposed.the california voters are no different,and in november,they passed proposition,known as the right to vote on taxes act.they demanded,and received,the right to approve any increase of a local tax before it goes into effect.
at issue in this case is the right of voters in the city of los angeles city to approve or reject an increase in taxes imposed on the charges for the use of cell phones.in,when the city amended los angeles municipal code municipal code,chapter,article,section to add subdivision a and create a telephone users tax on cellular services cell tax,the language of the ordinance reached all airtime but that ordinance was limited by the requirement in municipal code section that the cell tax be construed so that it would not violate the united state constitution.the city and plaintiffs ab cellular la,llc doing business as at t wireless,los angeles smsa limited partnership doing business as verizon wireless,richard henson and robbin collectively the carriers agreed that due to the holding of the united states supreme court in goldberg sweet,d goldberg,the cell tax could only be imposed on calls that originated or terminated in the city.then,in,congress passed the mobile telecommunications sourcing act mtsa and gave state and local governments authority to impose a tax on all airtime,regardless of where calls originate or terminate.the city determined that with the advent of the mtsa it had the authority to unilaterally impose the cell tax on all airtime and thereby increase cell taxes.the carriers filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory relief contending that the city must submit the increased cell tax to the electorate pursuant to proposition.the trial court granted the petition for writ of mandate and entered a judgment that instructed the city to stop collecting the increased cell tax from the carriers customers in the absence of voter approval.the judgment was silent as to declaratory relief.
on appeal,the city argues that proposition does not apply when a federal act such as the mtsa eliminates a constitutional hurdle to the full enforcement of an ordinance that was in effect in.the carriers and urge us to direct the trial court to declare that the city increased cell tax violates proposition,is inconsistent with municipal code section,subdivision a,and is not compelled by the mtsa.upon review,we conclude that the city unilateral decision to impose the cell tax on all airtime violated proposition and the trial court should have entered a declaration to that effect.because the record is sufficient for us to determine the parties rights regarding proposition,we modify the judgment to include a declaration that the city increased cell tax violated the requirement in proposition that a proposed tax increase be submitted to the voters for approval.as modified,the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.
in goldberg,the united states supreme court held that a state tax does not violate the commerce clause if it is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state,is fairly apportioned,does not discriminate against interstate commerce,and is fairly related to the services provided by the state.citation.goldberg,supra,at.applying this test,the court upheld an illinois state tax on wire line phone services that applied to calls that originated or terminated in illinois,and which were charged to an illinois address.id.at.
though it was dicta,the court stated we believe that only two states have a nexus substantial enough to tax a consumer purchase of an interstate telephone call.the first is a state like illinois which taxes the origination or termination of an interstate telephone call charged to a service address within that state.the second is a state which taxes the origination or termination of an interstate telephone call billed or paid within that state.citations.goldberg,supra,at.
the city cell tax and the instructions 
in,the city proposed amending municipal code section to add subdivision a and create a law that would impose a percent cell tax on all cell phone charges for users of cell phones in the city when the owner or lessee of the cell phone had a city billing address.to prevent duplicate taxation of any cell phone service consisting of calls originating or terminating outside the city,it planned to also add subdivision e to the municipal code section and give a credit to cell phone users who paid a duplicate tax in another taxing jurisdiction.
once they were apprised of the proposed amendment to municipal code section,subdivision a,the carriers complained that the federal constitution and goldberg did not permit the cell tax to be imposed on cell phone calls that did not originate or terminate in the city.at the time,municipal code section provided that nothing in the telephone,electricity and gas users tax shall be construed as imposing a tax upon any person when imposition of such tax upon that person would be in violation of the constitution of the united states.although the carriers were ostensibly willing to collect the cell tax on cell phone calls that originated or terminated in the city,they claimed that they did not have the technology to track the origination or termination of cell phone calls.
the city tax and permit division approved instructions instructions to all providers of cell phone services providers regarding the proposed amendment and how it would be implemented.after explaining that the language of municipal code section,subdivision a applied to all cell phone charges associated with an in city billing address,the instructions stated certain cellular telephone industry representatives have stated that their billing systems are capable of applying the cell tax to only the monthly charges additionally,they have said that they will be prepared to collect the cell tax if the city accepts a cell tax calculated only on the monthly charges.with the short time frame provided,and because we have no reason to dispute their position,the city will accept at this time that the cell tax will be calculated and remitted on the monthly charges.however,the city expects that in the near future that the cell tax base will be expanded to also include all cell phone calls received terminated in the city and to that end we look forward to working with the industry.
the instructions were sent to the los angeles city council at the same time as the proposed amendment of municipal code section.the amendment was adopted and made effective august.subsequently,the instructions were forwarded to all providers.
proposition and the proposition omnibus implementation act 
in november,the california voters adopted proposition and amended the california constitution to limit local government taxation by adding article xiii c and article xiii pursuant to california constitution article xiii c,no local government was permitted to impose,extend or increase any general or special tax unless it was submitted to the electorate and approved.in,the legislature passed the proposition omnibus implementation act omnibus act,et and,in government code section,subdivision h b,provided that a tax increase occurs when a decision by an agency revises the methodology by which a tax is calculated and the revision results in increased taxes being levied on any person or parcel.
in,congress passed the mtsa,title united states code sections,and set forth rules for state and local governments to tax mobile telecommunications services.the mtsa was applicable in.under the mtsa all mobile telephone services provided by a customer home service provider could be taxed by the taxing jurisdiction whose territorial limits encompass the customer place of primary use,regardless of where the mobile telecommunication services originate,terminate,or pass through.b.the primary place of use in the mtsa was defined as the customer residential street address or primary business street address.
the february,instructions 
on february,the city notified all providers of their present and future obligations to collect cell taxes under municipal code section,subdivision a february,instructions.as to bills issued prior to august,and governed by the instructions,the city stated be advised that to the extent that you do not include in the tax base cell phone service charges for calls originating terminating within the city,your company will be subject to the liability for the amount of uncollected tax.to the extent that you already include in the tax base charges for cell phone calls which neither originate nor terminate within the city,you must cease and desist this practice immediately and contact the tax and permit division of the office of finance for possible remedial action.as to bills issued on or after august,the providers were told the cell tax would be calculated on a basis consistent with the mtsa.the city averred that the mtsa changed the nexus law applicable to cell phone service charges.under the mtsa,the city cell tax base will include all of the customer cell phone charges regardless of where individual cell phone calls originate or terminate.
the august,instructions 
the city issued revised cell tax instructions to the providers on august,august,instructions pertaining to the implementation of the mtsa.the august,instructions stated on february,the city directed you to collect the city cell tax,in accordance with the provisions of the mtsa,starting on august.on july,the los angeles city council decided to delay the mtsa implementation until september.in accordance with the los angeles city council instructions,we hereby direct you to disregard our instructions from february,and continue applying and collecting the cell tax in accordance with the instructions,in a manner consistent with the legal standards set by the united states supreme court in goldberg,until we instruct you otherwise.
the final instructions 
the city issued its final instructions on december,final instructions.providers were told to collect the cell tax in accordance with municipal code section and with the mtsa.if you are not already collecting the tax consistent with the city code and federal law,we instruct you to collect it in the manner indicated above starting on march.
according to the city office of finance,it anticipated that the implementation of the mtsa in the final instructions would increase tax revenues by million and tax revenues by million.
the petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief 
the carriers filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory relief.in their ensuing motion,the carriers sought a judgment instructing the city to rescind the final instructions on the grounds that they violated proposition.also,they lobbied for a declaration that the mtsa does not amend local taxing ordinances,and the city may not impose additional taxes on wireless telephone services unless it validly enacts or amends an ordinance.the city must comply with proposition before increasing taxes.municipal code section does not permit the city to impose the cell tax on the full amount of a customer monthly and airtime charges.
after the matter proceeded to trial,the trial court issued a minute order that provided,in relevant part the issue in this proceeding is whether,on march,the city changed,not the cell tax law itself,municipal code section,subdivision a,but its methodology in calculating the cell tax in a way that results in an increased amount being levied upon the customers of the carriers.the evidence relevant to this issue is not in dispute.what the city did as of march,was to demand that the carriers remit to the city a cell tax computed at percent of the total bill sent to and collected from its customers with billing addresses within the city.prior to that time the carriers had,with the consent of the city,remitted a cell tax calculated at percent of only that portion of the bill sent to its customers that constituted a fixed monthly charge,but not the portion of the bill based on airtime,the number of minutes during the billing period during which the customer actually used the cell phone.the trial court finds as a matter of law that what the city did constitutes a tax increase within the meaning of proposition.
the trial court entered a judgment that ordered the city to stop demanding that the carriers calculate the cell tax as specified in the final instructions,and to reinstate the city previously applicable instructions.the judgment was silent with respect to the requested declarations.
the city filed this appeal.the carriers filed a as to issues the trial court did not rule upon.upon application,we permitted the league of california cities to appear as amicus curiae.
the appeal 
the city asks us to exercise plenary review over whether the final instructions violated proposition.this request is proper.thus,our task is to interpret proposition and the definition of a tax increase in section,subdivision h b and then apply that law to the undisputed facts.burden snowden cal th,d,anserv ins.services,kelso th,d.
this case goes to the heart of direct democracy in california and the rights of citizens to circumvent lawmakers and pass initiatives that will be honored by the executive and judicial branches.upon review,we find that the final instructions were not permitted by proposition.
our explanation lies below.
the rules of interpretation.
when engaging in statutory construction,we first look to the words of the statute and try to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language in order to effectuate the intent of the legislature.california ins.guarantee workers comp.appeals bd.th,d murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d.a close corollary is that we must reject an interpretation that is plainly contraindicated.but not every statute is a beacon of clarity.an interpreting court must go behind a statute language when it is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation.to decipher the purpose of an ambiguous statute,a court may consider the ostensible objects to be achieved by the statute,the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,the evils to be remedied,public policy,the legislative history,and the wider historical circumstances of the enactment.nolan city of anaheim cal th,d,kane hurley th,d.that said,t he interpretation should be practical,not technical,and should result in wise policy rather than mischief or absurdity.valley vista services,city of monterey park th,d.
though fairly proximate to statutory construction,the rules for interpreting ballot initiatives to amend our constitution are governed by some unique guideposts.precedent teaches that the appellate construction of a constitutional amendment must be delivered in a liberal and practical manner so it will meet changed conditions and the growing needs of the people.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d.normally,the natural and ordinary meaning of the amendment words must be given effect.ibid.but the literal language of enactments may be disregarded to avoid absurd results and to fulfill the apparent intent of the framers.ibid.if the amendment is ambiguous,a court may be able to defeat this analytical obstacle by referring to the contemporaneous construction of the legislature or the administrative agencies that are responsible for implementing the amendment.also,the ballot summary and arguments and analysis presented to the electorate in connection with a particular measure may be helpful in determining the probable meaning of uncertain language.id.at.finally,our supreme court instructs that the constitutional amendments given life by proposition must be interpreted with an eye toward honoring the intent of the voters.view water agency verjil cal th,d.
proposition and section.
proposition,section declared that t he people of the state of california hereby find and declare that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.section of proposition provided the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.
article xiii c,section of the california constitution provides a all taxes imposed by any local government shall be deemed to be either general taxes or special taxes b no local government may impose,extend,or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote.a general tax shall not be deemed to have been increased if it is imposed at a rate not higher than the maximum rate so approved.the election required by this subdivision shall be consolidated with a regularly scheduled general election for members of the governing body of the local government,except in cases of emergency declared by a unanimous vote of the governing body.c any general tax imposed,extended,or increased,without voter approval,by any local government on or after january,and prior to the effective date of this article,shall continue to be imposed only if approved by a majority vote of the voters voting in an election on the issue of the imposition,which election shall be held within two years of the effective date of this article and in compliance with subdivision b.d no local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote.a special tax shall not be deemed to have been increased if it is imposed at a rate not higher than the maximum rate so approved.cal,art.xiii c.
subdivision h b of section provides that,for purposes of article xiii c,a tax is increased if a decision by an agency r evises the methodology by which a tax is calculated,if that revision results in an increased amount being levied on any person or parcel.subdivision h b provides that a tax is not deemed increased if it i mplements or collects a previously approved tax,so long as the rate is not increased beyond the level previously approved by the agency,and the methodology previously approved by the agency is not revised so as to result in an increase in the amount being levied on any person or parcel,subd.h b.section of the omnibus act mirrored section of proposition.
the city revised its methodology and impermissibly increased cell taxes.
the carriers contend that the city revised the methodology by which it calculates the cell tax when it decided to implement the mtsa and expand the cell tax to cover all airtime.according to the city,its methodology has been static because it always intended to impose the cell tax to the constitutional limit as a result,the city posits that even though it believes the federal boundaries for the cell tax base expanded to permit the city to calculate the cell tax on a broader tax base than before and increase revenues,its methodology was never revised 
it is the carriers that are correct.
application of proposition and the omnibus act.
pursuant to the instructions,the city signaled that the cell tax would be calculated by multiplying the tax base of monthly charges plus charges for cell phone calls that originated or terminated in the city by percent.at the same time,the city effectively announced that it would not enforce the cell tax as to charges for cell phone calls that originated or terminated in the city until the carriers developed the technology to track those calls then,in,the final instructions hailed a sea change and revised the methodology to alter the tax base to include cell phone calls that neither originated nor terminated in the city.the city new equation for calculating the amount of cell tax due was to multiply the monthly charges plus charges for cell phone calls originating or terminating in the city plus charges for cell phone calls that did not originate or terminate in the city by percent.in other words,a new variable was added.by any definition,adding a variable revised the methodology.
we arrive at this conclusion after employing a liberal construction of proposition to limit local government revenue and enhance taxpayer consent.a taxing methodology must be frozen in time until the electorate approves higher taxes.this interpretation dovetails with the declarations in section of proposition because it limits the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent,and it provides effective tax relief and requires voter approval of tax increases.contrary to the city position,a local government methodology can not if it is due to external factors such as the avoid submitting it to voter approval the proposition voters rebelled against local government taxes that are moving targets.no doubt a useful precursor to the successful denial of new taxes,in whatever form,is their transparency and consistency,for if taxes are fluid then their increase may well become an intractable problem that would frustrate the purposes of voter approval.
when a statute,or an ordinance,refers to a system or body of laws,the referring statute,or ordinance,takes the law or laws referred to not only in their contemporary form,but also as they may be changed from time to time,and as they may be subjected to elimination altogether by repeal.citations.palermo stockton theatres,cal d.here,municipal code section,subdivision a took constitutional law in its contemporary form in and was subject to changes in that law.and if proposition had not passed,the city could collect an increased cell tax based on the evolved constitutional parameters.but proposition was passed,and it arrested the cell tax maturation over time.this restriction on local tax authority is of course characterized by the city as an unreasonable policy that is sure to create numerous administrative headaches.this fear is unjustified.as we will show,our interpretations of proposition and the omnibus act set forth rules that will aid rather than hinder tax administration.
section adds a necessary layer of texture to our analysis.
our role as an appellate court is to give efficacy to the plain language of section,subdivision h b.it provides that a tax is increased if a decision by an agency revises the methodology by which a tax is calculated,if that revision results in an increased amount being levied on any person or parcel.the word calculated denotes the math behind a tax.the dictionary definition of revision is alteration.in practical terms,a tax is increased if the math behind it is altered so that either a larger tax rate or a larger tax base is part of the calculation.but we are mindful that our interpretation of section must result in wise policy rather than mischief.to that end,we interpret methodology so that it does not enshrine taxes that are discriminatory,taxes that are imposed upon one taxpayer but not others who are similarly situated.such taxes are anathema to the fair and equal treatment of taxpayers.see hillsborough cromwell.the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the individual from state action which selects him out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting him to taxes not imposed on others of the same class.additionally,we decline to interpret section to rob local governments of the discretion to settle tax disputes or decide that all or part of a local tax should not be enforced.
we hold that methodology,under section,refers to a mathematical equation for calculating taxes that is officially sanctioned by a local taxing entity.in most instances,the equation will be established by legislative action,such as the enactment of an ordinance.but if a local tax law is ambiguous,or is ostensibly restricted by state,federal or other local laws,and the local taxing entity develops a policy regarding how those local taxes shall be calculated in light of the ambiguity,or it interprets the limits of the local tax law in light of ostensible restrictions imposed by state,federal,or other local laws,then the methodology is the equation the local taxing entity adopts as a uniform compromise of its legal dilemma.restated,this equation is its interpretation of the outer boundaries of its taxing authority 
under this construction,a local taxing entity can enforce less of a local tax than is due under a methodology,or a grandfathered methodology,and later enforce the full amount of the local tax due under that methodology without transgressing proposition.while the settlement of local tax disputes and enforcement of local taxes may be taxpayer specific the methodology for the maximum recovery of local taxes will remain constant.a local taxing entity could even revise its methodology to decrease local taxes and then do an about face and return to the previously approved methodology.proposition allows it the evil to be counteracted is the increase of local taxes beyond what was formerly approved.our interpretation remedies the evil and yet gives local governments flexibility in a way that infringes least upon california public policy of encouraging settlements and compromises.fisher superior court d.
proposition does not require an improper delegation of power.
hoping to avert an unfavorable analysis,the city asserts that a governmental entity can not delegate its legislative powers.kugler yocum cal d,kugler.the city raises a concern that our holding will result in the delegation of legislative authority to the administrative staff that interprets the state,federal or other local law that restricts a tax ordinance.to that,we have two responses.firstly,there was no such delegation here.the los angeles city council approved the instructions.secondly,the proscription set forth in kugler was not otherwise implicated.kugler stated the essentials of the legislative function are the determination and formulation of the legislative policy.generally speaking,attainment of the ends,including how and by what means they are to be achieved,may constitutionally be left in the hands of others.the legislature may,after declaring a policy and fixing a primary standard,confer upon executive or administrative officers the power to fill up the details by prescribing administrative rules and regulations to promote the purposes of the legislation and to carry it into effect citation.similarly,the cases establish that while the legislative body can not delegate its power to make a law,it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes or intends to make its own action depend.citation.id.at.once the city made the fundamental policy decision to impose a cell tax to the limits allowed by the federal constitution,it could delegate authority to administrative staff to determine what those limits were.
c.the city historical interpretation is controlling.
the city urges us to give credence to its historical interpretation of municipal code section,subdivision a.but we have.the instructions embody that historical interpretation.indeed,the chief one of the tax and permit division of the city department of finance filed a declaration below and averred although the city o rdinance extended to airtime,the city opted not to enforce the o rdinance as to airtime and allowed the carriers to assert an exemption based upon goldberg and the impracticability of tracking charges at that time.in effect,the city used municipal code section to constrict the tax base in municipal code section,subdivision a to calls originating or terminating in the city so that the tax would not be unconstitutional the city did so by allowing an exemption.that meant that the city determined that cell phone calls could not be taxed if they did not originate or terminate in the city.
by its text,the telephone,electricity and gas users tax had to be interpreted in light of the united states constitution.the city could not in good faith stand pat and refuse to interpret the commerce clause it had to take a position,for good or ill.the city did just that.it either believed that municipal code section was limited by goldberg,or it acquiesced to and adopted the interpretation advanced by the carriers.thus,the city took an official position.it has been held that the contemporaneous construction of a statute by an administrative agency charged with its administration and interpretation,while not necessarily controlling,is entitled to great weight and should be respected by the courts unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized citations.anderson san francisco rent stabilization arbitration bd.d.it can not be said,on this record,that the city interpretation was clearly erroneous or unauthorized because the tax base sanctioned as constitutional in goldberg was limited to calls originating or terminating in illinois if those calls were charged to an illinois service address.while goldberg applied to wire line telephone calls rather than cell phone calls,and it contained dicta,it was the only guide the city had as to the federal limits of its taxing authority.
we are told by the city that its cell tax formula for the carriers should not be considered a methodology because it was taxpayer specific.
there is no evidence that the city had one cell tax formula for the carriers and another for others.the chief of the tax and permit division of the city office of finance declared that in about,when new cellular providers new providers entered the market,they consistently collected on all airtime,regardless of origination or termination.nonetheless the carriers continued to claim that they could not track the origination or termination of calls,and they continued to refuse to collect cell tax on airtime.the city investigated the carriers claims,and it even made an unsuccessful attempt to get them to collect cell tax on airtime sold in packages.nothing in these facts suggests that prior to the advent of the mtsa the city suddenly changed its reading of goldberg and decided that the commerce clause allowed all airtime to be taxed.the city investigation into the carriers inability to segregate calls was necessitated only because the city had not changed its reading of goldberg.otherwise,the issue would have been moot,the ability to segregate calls would have been irrelevant if the city determined that goldberg did not apply and all airtime was taxable.further to that point,the february,instructions stated to the extent that you already include in the tax base charges for cell phone calls which neither originate nor terminate within the city,you must cease and desist this practice immediately and contact the tax and permit division of the office of finance for possible remedial action.
by this evidence it is demonstrable that the city had a consistent interpretive position from the time municipal code section,subdivision a was enacted to when it chose to implement the mtsa.the only taxpayer specific decision was the city enforcement of municipal code section,subdivision a.it chose not to enforce the portion of the cell tax that pertained to cell phone calls originating or terminating in the city with respect to the carriers customers.conversely,the city never made an enforcement decision as to the new providers.there was no need.they voluntarily collected the cell tax on all airtime,which was contrary to the city instructions.
in sum,the city wants us to interpret proposition so that it permits a fluctuating local government tax if the fluctuation is due to expanding constitutional boundaries.the voters of california stand in the city path.they demanded the right to approve increased local taxes after finding that such increases threaten the california economy.we are obligated to uphold that right and adhere to that finding despite the city protestations.to be sure,the city must be credited for offering thoughtful arguments on a complex issue,but those arguments can not carry the day,which leaves us to but one conclusion the trial court properly granted the carriers petition for writ of mandate.
the carriers ask us to remand this case to the trial court to enter a declaration that the city march tax increase violated proposition,the tax increase is inconsistent with the city telephone,electri
