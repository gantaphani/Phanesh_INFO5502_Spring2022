defendant appellant american master lease llc aml appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the central district of california to grant summary judgment in favor of plaintiff appellee fort properties,fort properties.in issuing this ruling,the district court invalidated all claims in patent patent for failing to meet the subject matter eligibility requirements of.we affirm.
background 
the patent discloses an investment tool designed to enable property owners to buy and sell properties without incurring tax liability.proceeds generated from real estate sales are ordinarily taxed,with some exceptions.one such exception is contained in u,which allows an owner of investment property to exchange one property for another of like kind without incurring tax liability if the following conditions are met the value of the purchased property is greater than or equal to the value of the sold property the debt burdening the purchased property is greater than or equal to the debt burdening the sold property the purchased property is identified within days of the sold property date of sale,and the entire acquisition is completed within days and the real estate owner does not exercise control over the proceeds from the sold property before acquiring the purchased property.see.
the investment tool disclosed in the patent is designed to invoke the benefits of.in particular,the claims require the aggregation of a number of properties into a real estate portfolio.the property interests in this portfolio are then divided into shares and sold to investors much in the same way that a company sells stock.these divided property interests are called deedshares.each deedshare can be encumbered by its own mortgage debt,which provides flexibility to real estate investors attempting to structure their debts in a way that complies with.
the patent also allows for a master tenant to oversee and manage the deedshares.among other things,the master tenant performs administrative tasks such as paying insurance,property taxes,and rents.patent ll.moreover,the real estate portfolio can be governed by a master agreement,which permits the deedshares to reaggregate after a predetermined time interval.this arrangement provides flexibility to deedshare owners wishing to sell their properties.finally,the investment instrument disclosed in the patent utilizes a qualified intermediary essentially a straw man to facilitate sales and purchases of deedshares for property owners in a manner consistent with.see patent ll.
all claims in the patent are method claims.claim discloses 
a method of creating a real estate investment instrument adapted for performing exchanges comprising 
aggregating real property to form a real estate portfolio 
encumbering the property in the real estate portfolio with a master agreement and 
creating a plurality of deedshares by dividing title in the real estate portfolio into a plurality of deeds of at least one predetermined denomination,each of the plurality of deedshares subject to a provision in the master agreement for reaggregating the plurality of deeds after a specified interval.
two of the other independent claims,claims and,are nearly identical to claim though claim contains an additional limitation requiring a computer to generate a plurality of deedshares.the only other independent claim in the patent,claim,discloses a method of transferring ownership of deedshares in a manner consistent with.nearly all of the dependent claims in the patent either outline contractual provisions to include in the master agreement or provide for duties that the master tenant can perform,the payment of rent,property taxes,and insurance.
the district court invalidated each of the claims in the patent for failing to claim subject matter under.in doing so,the court applied the test.regarding the machine prong,the court found that the claims of the patent were not tied to a particular machine or apparatus,reaching this conclusion by relying on aml prior representation during prosecution that the recited methods need not be performed by a computer.fort,am.master lease,llc,d,internal quotation marks omitted.regarding the transformation prong,the court found that none of the claims of the patent transform ed any article to a different state or thing,reasoning that the claimed deedshares,which aml argued provided the transformation,represent ed only legal ownership interests in property not physical objects.id.at.in light of its decision to invalidate the claims of the patent,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fort properties.id.
notably,the district court,following our precedent in in re bilski,relied solely on the test in its analysis.after the district court issued its decision,the supreme court clarified that the test,although not the exclusive test for patentability,is a useful and important clue.bilski kappos.despite this intervening precedent,we affirm the district court judgment invalidating the claims under for the reasons stated below.we have jurisdiction under a.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.tokai easton.issues of subject matter are questions of law and are reviewed without deference.cybersource retail decisions.
the statute sets forth the categories of subject matter,stating that w hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new and useful improvement thereof,may obtain a patent therefor,subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.section thus specifies four independent categories of inventions or discoveries that are eligible for protection processes,machines,manufactures,and compositions of matter.bilski.at.in choosing such expansive terms congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.diamond chakrabarty.supreme court precedent,however,has provide d three specific exceptions to broad principles laws of nature,physical phenomena,and abstract ideas.bilski.at quoting chakrabarty,at.the concepts covered by these exceptions are part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.bilski.at quoting funk.seed kalo inoculant.
at issue in the present case is whether the real estate investment tool disclosed in the patent falls under the process category of.section b of the patent act defines process to mean process,art,or method,and includes a new use of a known process,machine,manufacture,composition of matter,or material.aml argues that its invention constitutes a process.fort properties,on the other hand,contends that the invention is an unpatentable abstract idea.
four seminal supreme court precedents provide guidance regarding when an invention qualifies as a process as opposed to an abstract idea bilski.diamond diehr,parker flook,and gottschalk benson.first,in benson,the court found that an algorithm capable of converting decimal numerals into pure binary code was an unpatentable abstract idea.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court explained that allowing such an invention to qualify as subject matter would wholly a mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself.id.at.
in flook,another invention was at issue,with this particular algorithm being designed to enable the monitoring of conditions during a catalytic conversion process in the petrochemical and industries.at.the court conceded that the invention at issue,unlike the algorithm in benson,had been limited so that it could still be freely used outside the petrochemical and industries.bilski.at citing flook,at.despite this limitation,the court still characterized the invention as unpatentable under,stating that t he notion that activity,no matter how conventional or obvious in itself,can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts form over substance.flook,at.as the court later explained,flook stands for the proposition that the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas can not be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment or adding insignificant
