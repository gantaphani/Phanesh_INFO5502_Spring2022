ralph davis died on july,leaving a gross estate of.davis,as the personal representative of the davis estate,claimed a marital deduction in the amount of under internal revenue code sections a,b and b.
the commissioner reduced the marital deduction by,allowing the estate to deduct only in life insurance proceeds that passed directly to the surviving spouse and disallowing the deduction for the funds passing in the amended trust.the commissioner issued a notice of deficiency in the amount of.the estate appealed the determination of deficiency to the tax court,which held for the commissioner.on this appeal,davis has abandoned her claim for a deduction under section b,but continues to claim that the terms of the amendment qualify for a marital deduction under section b.
under the internal revenue code,the taxable estate of a decedent is computed by taking the gross estate defined in section and subtracting the deductions listed in sections,and.section describes the marital deduction although property passing from a decedent to a surviving spouse generally qualifies for a marital deduction from the federal estate tax,a,life estates and other terminable interests passing to a surviving spouse are not deductible unless they qualify for an exception under section b or section b.b 
to qualify for a marital deduction under section b,a marital trust must consist of property i which passes from the decedent,ii in which the surviving spouse has a qualifying income interest for life,and iii to which an election under section b applies.b b i.a deduction under section b is also known as a qualified terminable interest property,or qtip,deduction.a surviving spouse has a qualifying income interest for life if he or she is entitled to all the income from the property,payable annually or at more frequent intervals,or has a usufruct interest for life in the property,and no person has a power to appoint any part of the property to any person other than the surviving spouse.b b ii.
the treasury regulations elaborate on the requisite degree of control required to claim a qtip deduction a surviving spouse is entitled for life to all of the income if he or she is unqualifiedly designated as the life beneficiary of a trust.reg.b f he or she must have such command over the income that it is virtually hers.reg.b f.to meet these standards,a surviving spouse must show that he or she i is entitled to the income until the trust terminates,or ii has the right,exercisable in all events,to have the corpus distributed to her at any time during her life.reg.b f.a trust does not qualify for a qtip deduction to the extent that the income is required to be accumulated in whole or in part or may be accumulated in the discretion of any person other than the surviving spouse reg.b f.
in estate of ellingson commissioner,we considered a marital deduction trust that named the surviving spouse as a and provided that if the income so payable to the surviving settlor shall,at any time or times,exceed the amount which the trustee deems to be necessary for his or her needs,best interests and welfare,the trustee may accumulate the same,as the trustee deems advisable,cir.we concluded that,under the circumstances in that case,the best interests and welfare language was sufficiently broad to entitle the surviving spouse to all the income from the property for life under section b b ii i.id.at.in dicta,we noted that other language,such as necessary or proper to provide for care,comfortable maintenance,and support and reasonable comfort and usual and customary standard of living would not fall within the terms of section b because reformation of the instrument would be required to grant the qtip deduction.see also estate of rapp comm r,cir holding insufficient for qtip purposes a trust that gave surviving children discretion to distribute income to provide for the surviving spouse health,education and support wisely united states,cir estate of nicholson comm r,wl.
when a decedent chooses to limit the degree of control that his or her surviving spouse has over the income from a terminable interest property,the decedent also precludes the possibility that his or her estate may claim a qtip deduction under section b.a section b marital deduction is available only when a decedent leaves a surviving spouse complete control over the income from a property for life conversely,if a surviving spouse interest in the property income is limited and thus can not be equated with virtual ownership,an estate may not claim a marital deduction under section b 
we next consider whether the interest granted to evelyn davis under the declaration of trust and the amendment qualifies for a marital deduction under section b.
in determining whether an interest that passes in trust to a surviving spouse qualifies for a qtip deduction under section b,we first look to state law to determine the nature and extent of the property interest granted to the surviving spouse,and then turn to federal law to determine whether these property rights are ultimately subject to taxation.united states craft,d quoting drye united states,d estate of heim comm r,cir
