at issue is the legality of million in loans between state funds to help balance the state budget during times of fiscal crisis.we conclude that the loans are lawful.the loan provisions,contained in annual budget bills,are germane to the subject of appropriations and thus do not violate the rule prohibiting legislation having multiple subjects.cal,art.iv.nor do the loans interfere with the lending fund regulatory purpose or object,subd.a.we affirm the trial court order denying petitions for a writ of mandate seeking compelled repayment of the loans.
background 
the loan transactions are complex and require an understanding of state finances generally,and the specific operation and purpose of the state fund that lent money to other funds.
state finances 
state government programs are financed,in large part,by expenditures from the general fund and special funds.cal.of finance,finance glossary of accounting and budgeting terms,at as of,hereafter,finance glossary.the general fund consists of money received into the treasury and not required by law to be credited to any other fund.the primary sources of revenue for the general fund are personal income taxes,sales taxes,and corporation taxes.finance glossary.the major uses of the general fund are education,health and human service programs,and correctional programs.finance glossary.special funds are created by statute or regulation and are used to budget and account for taxes,licenses,and fees that are restricted by law for particular activities of government.finance glossary.there are many special funds with billions of dollars in total expenditures.in fiscal year,for example,budget expenditures from the general fund totaled roughly billion and budget expenditures from special funds were over billion cal.of finance,historical data,budget expenditures,as of.
the general fund and special funds,although separate,are not impermeable.transfers and loans are statutorily permitted from special funds to the general fund,and from the general fund to special funds.the statute relevant here provides when the general fund in the treasury is or will be exhausted,the controller shall notify the governor and the pooled money investment board.the governor may order the controller to direct the transfer of all or any part of the moneys not needed in other funds or accounts to the general fund from those funds or accounts all moneys so transferred shall be returned to the funds or accounts from which they were transferred as soon as there are sufficient moneys in the general fund to return them this section does not authorize any transfer that will interfere with the object for which a special fund was created,subd.a.the statute includes provision for payment of interest under certain circumstances,subd.b.
like the governor power to order a transfer between funds,the legislature may enact an appropriations bill that transfers a special fund reserve temporarily from one purpose to another provided the transfer does not interfere with the objects for which such fund was created.daugherty riley cal d.this district court of appeal has recently confirmed that money in special funds may be loaned to shore up the general fund subject to the specified statutory conditions of government code section exhaustion of the general fund,no interference with the object for which the special fund was created,and return of the money as soon as possible.california medical brown th,california medical.
in california medical,the legislature acted to close a budget deficit by including an item in the budget bill providing for a loan of million to the general fund from a special fund,the contingent fund of the medical board of california.california medical,supra,th at.that special fund receives physician licensing fees and uses the money to oversee and discipline physicians.id.at.the california medical association cma,representing physicians,challenged the legality of the loan with a petition for a writ of mandate directing that the money be returned.id.at.denial of the petition was affirmed on appeal.id.at.the court held that the loan was authorized under government code section,and that the statutory conditions were satisfied.california medical,at.the court found no interference with the object for which the special fund was created,the regulation of california physicians,which continued despite reduced funding.id.at.
the legislature has made other loans from special funds to the general fund.at issue here are several loans from a special fund called the beverage container recycling fund recycling fund.to understand the parties claims on appeal,a detailed explanation of the operation and financing of california recycling program is necessary.
b.the recycling program 
in,the legislature adopted the california beverage container recycling and litter reduction act pub.resources code,et the recycling act to encourage recycling of used beverage containers through a program of financial incentives.californians against waste department of conservation th.the recycling act was initially administered by the department of conservation,and is now administered by the division of recycling in the department of resources recycling and recovery calrecycle pub.resources code.
the central component of the recycling act complicated system of financial incentives is a refundable deposit on beverage containers paid when beverages are purchased and recovered when empty containers are recycled.beverage distributors make a r edemption payment to calrecycle on every beverage container sold or offered for sale in california pub.resources code.redemption payments are deposited in the recycling fund.pub.resources code,subd.a.the cost of the redemption payment is passed on to the retailer,then the consumer who purchases a beverage.consumers may return their empty beverage containers to a recycler,who pays a refund value.pub.resources code.
the record reflects that,o ver the history of the recycling act,the redemption payment and the refund value have usually been equal,although this is not always the case.the record also shows that the redemption payment and refund value have ranged from an initial cent per beverage container to a current high of cents for a container of less than ounce capacity,and cents for a container of ounce or greater capacity.see pub.resources code,subd.a.
not all beverage containers are returned for recycling.the redemption rate for beverage containers is not,and never has been,percent.as a result,a portion of the redemption payments borne by consumers remains in the recycling fund and are used to pay calrecycle operating costs and various fees and grants for curbside collection programs,recycling centers,material processors,and other participants in the recycling stream.
the recycling act strives to establish convenient return systems to encourage recycling by consumers,including curbside programs and recycling centers.pub.resources code,subd.a.curbside programs accept empty beverage containers from consumers for recycling and retain the refund value to offset the cost of their operations,rather than paying the refund value to consumers.pub.resources code,subd.c.curbside recycling accounts for about percent of beverage container recycling in california.most recycling occurs through recycling centers,which pay consumers the refund value of the containers.pub.resources code,subd.a.there are two types of recycling centers traditional recycling centers and convenience zone recycling centers.both types must be certified by calrecycle.pub.resources code,subd.a.
traditional recycling centers are relatively large facilities,usually located in sparsely populated areas,to which consumers bring recyclable bottles and cans and exchange them for a refund by weight or per container.pub.resources code,subd.a.traditional recycling centers redeem the bulk of beverage containers recycled in california,about percent.
convenience zone recycling centers are smaller operations,typically located in supermarket parking lots and consisting of several large bins and one employee with a scale.pub.resources code.convenience zone recycling centers provide consumers with a place to redeem beverage containers contemporaneously with grocery shopping,avoiding the need to travel to a traditional recycling center.consumers generally do not redeem beverage containers at the retail store where they purchased the beverages.retailers are required to accept returned containers only if there is no convenience zone recycling center in the area.pub.resources code.there are about convenience zone recycling centers in california.calrecycle reports that convenience zone recycling centers handle about percent of the used beverage containers recycled in the state.
recyclers curbside programs and recycling centers sell the used beverage containers to material processors for the containers scrap value.pub.resources code.the processors sort the containers and sell the reclaimed materials to manufacturers.pub.resources code.in addition to paying scrap value to the container recyclers,processors as an intermediary of calrecycle also pay the containers refund value which reimburses recycling centers for payments made to consumers and compensates curbside programs for their service pub.resources code,subd.a.
from the standpoint of a recycler,it costs more to handle glass and plastic containers for recycling than the materials are worth when sold for scrap to a processor.among the materials used in beverage containers,aluminum alone has a scrap value in excess of its handling costs.in order to promote the recycling of glass and plastic,the cost of recycling these materials is subsidized with processing payments.by law,processing payments are the difference between the scrap value of the container and the sum of its average cost to recycle and a reasonable financial return.pub.resources code,subd.b.in early,for example,the processing payment for glass containers was per ton the difference between the per ton scrap value of glass and the sum of the cost of recycling a ton of glass containers with a reasonable financial return for the operation.calrecycle adjusts processing payment amounts periodically based on fluctuating recycling costs and commodity prices.pub.resources code,subd.c a b.both recyclers and processors receive processing payments pub.resources code,subd.a,subd.a.
processing payments are funded primarily from the unredeemed deposits paid by consumers who purchase beverages in containers that are not all returned for recycling.beverage manufacturers that package their products in plastic and glass also pay processing fees into the recycling fund,which partially funds the processing payments to recyclers.a processing fee is imposed upon manufacturers who use container materials with recycle costs that exceed their scrap value under the principle,which encourages manufacturers to switch to materials that have a lower cost of recycling and increases the market for recycled products thus increasing the scrap value of the material over time.originally,manufacturers paid the entire amount of the processing payment.a manufacturer contribution is now statutorily capped at percent of the cost of the processing payment.pub.resources code,subd.e a i.
calrecycle may reduce the manufacturer processing fee,subject to the availability of funds,to encourage the use of containers with better recycling rates.pub.resources code,subd.e a i.for example,the manufacturer processing fee may be set at only percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate equal to,or greater than,percent,but the fee may be set at percent of the processing payment for a container type with a recycling rate of less than percent.pub.resources code,subd.e a i.the vast majority of beverage containers are made of aluminum,glass,and two types of plastic,all of which had a recycling rate in excess of percent in.manufacturers have therefore paid far less than percent of the processing payment in recent years,when funds were available.manufacturers have often paid around percent of the processing payment,with the remainder covered by calrecycle processing fee offset funded by the surplus of redemption payments over redemption refunds.
convenience zone recyclers located near supermarkets receive an additional financial incentive,beyond the containers scrap value,processing payments,and administrative payments.they receive handling fees.pub.resources code.handling fees are per container fees paid to convenience zone recyclers as a subsidy,to cover the additional cost of operating recycling collection sites at supermarket locations.pub.resources code,subd.f.handling fees are meant to encourage establishment of convenient recycling locations.
in summary,funding for the recycling act beverage container recycling program flows through the recycling fund,which calrecycle administers.beverage manufacturers pay processing fees to the recycling fund on beverage containers that have a recycling cost greater than their scrap value,and distributors make redemption payments to the recycling fund on beverage containers,the cost of which is ultimately passed through to consumers.in turn,the recycling fund makes several types of payments to consumers,recyclers,and processors to encourage recycling.
the program has been a great success.in,californians recycled over billion beverage containers and leads the nation in total quantity of bottles and cans recycled.the recycling act established a beverage container recycling goal of percent.pub.resources code,subd.c.the recycling rate was percent in,shortly after the program began.the recycling rate reached percent in,despite program alterations over the years that added new container types with historically low recycling rates.since inception of the recycling program in,more than billion beverage containers have been recycled.
c.the recycling fund and loans to the general fund and air pollution control fund 
the recycling fund was designed to be with the redemption payments funding consumer refunds,processing payments,and other costs.the recycling fund maintained an equilibrium in its first years but expenditures exceeded revenue in the early when the refund value was set higher than the redemption payment on beverage containers.the recycling fund borrowed about million to maintain its solvency during the early.in,the redemption payment and refund value were reconciled to the same amount so the program was not paying out more money than it was receiving on each beverage container.for many years thereafter,the recycling fund enjoyed a surplus balance because the recycling program generated revenue in excess of expenditures.as noted earlier,the recycling act established a beverage container recycling goal of percent.pub.resources code,subd.c.recycling rates were often lower than percent,especially after the program was expanded in to include additional types of containers.the excess of redemption payments over refund claims created a fund surplus.at the end of fiscal year,the recycling fund balance was over million and growing.
in,an economic downturn and stock market drop led to a budget shortfall in california general fund.legis.analyst,cal.spending plan,ch.as of.the shortfall was addressed,in part,by interfund loans.id.at ch.the legislature approved billion of loans and transfers from special funds to the general fund in the budget bill.ibid.among those was a loan from the recycling fund to the general fund.the budget bill authorized the director of finance to order the controller to transfer million from the recycling fund to the general fund to be repaid,with interest,by june,the bill stated it is the intent of the legislature that the repayment is made so as to ensure that the programs supported by this fund are not adversely affected by the loan.a loan of million from the recycling fund to the general fund was made in on similar terms,and an additional million was borrowed from recycling fund subaccounts that year.
the recycling fund balance remained high despite these loans.at the end of fiscal year,the recycling fund balance was over million and grew to million or more by the end of fiscal year in a report,the legislative analyst office concluded that the recycling fund essentially clears itself when the recycling rate reaches around percent,given the recycling program level of spending.legis.analyst,analysis of the budget of conservation analysis as of,in other words,if consumers recycled percent of purchased beverage containers,all redemption payments on the containers would be paid out in redemption refunds,processing fee offsets,handling fees,administrative fees,operational costs,and other program costs such as grants and public education.ibid.the recycling rate had been percent or less from to.as a result,a significant amount of money accumulated in the recycling fund.ibid.the legislative analyst office noted that the legislature may want to consider extending the repayment period for the monies loaned to the general fund from the recycling fund in and given the state fiscal condition and the large balance in the recycling fund.ibid.but it was also noted that a loan extension would not assist the program in meeting its recycling target and suggested directing calrecycle to evaluate options,such as increased expenditures,to raise the recycling rate toward the statutory goal and lower the fund balance to more reasonable levels.ibid.
the legislature adopted a number of measures relating to the recycling program in.stats,ch,assem.bill.the legislature extended repayment of the and loans from the recycling fund to the general fund until june,and also amended various provisions of the recycling act to increase calrecycle expenditures.id.at.among other things,the legislature increased processing payments,handling fees,incentive payments,and grants.the legislature also directed calrecycle to submit a report addressing the legislative analyst office concerns with the recycling rate and high fund balance.calrecycle submitted a report in february.calrecycle estimated that revenues and expenditures would be nearly balanced in the short term at about billion each but that program changes would increase expenditures and the recycling rate over time,leading to a reduced recycling fund balance.
the recycling fund continued to have a positive fund balance at the end of fiscal year.the fund balance at that time was over million,and an additional loan from the recycling fund was made.the september budget bill authorized a million loan from the recycling fund to the air pollution control fund a fund administered by the california air resources board to assist in the implementation of programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,with full repayment due by june.the recycling fund balance was million at the end of fiscal year,after making the loan to the air pollution control fund.
in november,calrecycle prepared forecast figures for the budget being prepared by the governor.calrecycle projected a surplus fund balance of million for fiscal year.the february budget bill approved a loan of million from the recycling fund to the general fund,with repayment made so as to ensure that the programs supported by the recycling fund are not adversely affected by the loan,but no later than june.the interfund transfer was directed to be made by the controller,upon order of the director of finance.the budget bill also authorized an immediate million loan from the recycling fund to the air pollution control fund,to be repaid by the earliest feasible date but no later than june.
calrecycle projects a fund deficit in may 
calrecycle projection of a fund surplus for fiscal year was wrong.a later audit revealed that calrecycle forecast model was flawed,which led the department to understate expenditures and thus overstate its projected fund balance.calrecycle stated that market changes also led to an overstatement of the projected fund balance,including reduced sales of beverages resulting in lower revenue and higher recycling rates that increased expenditures.
the recycling rate rose from percent in to percent in,surpassing the recycling act goal of an percent recycling rate.pub.resources code,subd.c.at these recycling rates,expenditures outpaced revenue and the recycling fund experienced an operating deficit.an audit report shows that in fiscal year,calrecycle collected about billion in redemption payments and paid almost all of that amount about billion in refund claims.the additional program expenses were over million,thus exceeding the remaining million collected as redemption payments.
in april,calrecycle informed the department of finance,through a series of informal meetings,that a correction of calrecycle earlier forecast of its fund condition was needed.calrecycle also reportedly notified the department of finance that the million loan to the general fund authorized by the budget bill would add to the recycling fund projected deficit.however,calrecycle had not yet fully analyzed the nature of the error in its earlier projection and thus did not explain the specific factors causing the need for revision.the loan proceeded as planned.
in may,calrecycle advised the legislature that calrecycle was forecasting a million deficit in the recycling fund for fiscal year.the projected fund deficit triggered statutory provisions requiring calrecycle to implement funding cuts.
reduced processing payments,processing fee offsets,and handling fees beginning july 
the recycling act specifies that processing payments to recyclers and processors,processing fee offsets to manufacturers,and handling fees to convenience zone recycling centers are s ubject to the availability of funds.pub.resources code,subd.e,subds.a,c.at the time relevant here,the recycling act required calrecycle to review all funds on a quarterly basis to ensure that there are adequate funds to make processing payments,pay handling fees,and support a variety of other recycling programs.former pub.resources code,subd.c.if calrecycle review determines that there may be inadequate funds,calrecycle shall immediately notify the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature and,o n or before days after the notice is sent,may reduce or eliminate expenditures as necessary,subd.c.if reduction is ordered,calrecycle shall reduce all payments proportionally,subd.d.
calrecycle notified the legislature of the projected deficit in may and,in june,announced payment reductions to recycling program participants.in its june,announcement,calrecycle reported that t he dramatic increase in the recycling rate,coupled with a flattening of container sales due to the downturn in the economy,has resulted in increased payouts without a commensurate rise in previously expected revenues.having determined that there will be inadequate monies in the recycling fund to make all of the payments specified in the recycling act,calrecycle announced a proportional reduction in processing payments,processing fee offsets,handling fees,curbside supplemental payments,and a host of other programs,effective july.further reductions were announced effective november.overall,payments to recyclers were reduced by about percent,and beverage manufacturer processing fee costs were increased by around million.redemption refunds and administrative fees were unaffected by the projected fund deficit and continued to be paid in full.
executive and legislative efforts to address the recycling fund deficit 
upon learning of the projected deficit in the recycling fund in may,the governor proposed restructuring the program to address its fiscal problems.the legislature rejected the proposal and enacted its own in september but the governor vetoed it.a resolution was reached in march.the legislature passed and the governor signed emergency legislation that returned the recycling fund to solvency.stats,ch,assem.bill.the legislation suspended some program expenditures that were otherwise required for public education and grants,accelerated redemption payments due from distributors,and reduced some incentive payments and subsidies.these changes saved millions of dollars.the recycling fund also received million in repayment of its prior loans to the general fund and a loan of million from a special fund.calrecycle,quarterly report on status of the beverage container recycling fund,april,calrecycle april status report as of.the legislature also amended the recycling act in march to declare that the maintenance of the fund is of the utmost importance to the state and that it is essential that any money in the fund be used solely for the purposes authorized in this division and should not be used,loaned,or transferred for any other purpose.pub.resources code,subd.e.
restoration of payments to program participants and continued loan repayment 
in march,with solvency reestablished,calrecycle announced to program participants that processing payments,processing fee offsets,and handling fees would be restored,retroactive to january.the reduced payments lasted six months,from july through december.calrecycle ended fiscal year with a fund balance of million.calrecycle april status report.despite the reduced financial incentives occasioned by calrecycle temporary insolvency in,the recycling rate was at an rate of percent from through.calrecycle,state beverage recycling rate matches all time high in,as of.

in a july report,calrecycle forecast that the recycling fund will be solvent as long as expected loan repayments to the recycling fund continue.calrecycle july status report.calrecycle projects a positive fund balance through the end of fiscal year,even without loan repayment from the general fund,but the necessary fund reserve will require sizeable loan repayments.ibid.calrecycle reports that the recycling fund solvency is based upon loan repayments because expenditures are expected to be greater than revenue in fiscal year ibid.this assumes,of course,no additional structural reforms of the recycling program that change the level of revenue and expenditures.a number of options,however,are being considered and may affect the recycling fund balance in the future.legis.analyst,the budget funding and policy options for the beverage container recycling program,march.
ii.trial court proceedings 
this litigation began in late,after calrecycle reduced processing payments to beverage container recyclers and processors and reduced handling fees to convenience zone recycling centers.in november,three recycling center operators filed a petition for a writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory relief in the alameda county superior court.plaintiffs are tomra pacific,jolly giant flea market,and michael ray regan and daniel patrick regan,doing business as enterprises recycling collectively,recycling center plaintiffs.they sued the california controller,the california director of finance,and the director of calrecycle.the recycling center plaintiffs allege that the improper and loans from the recycling fund to the general fund rendered the recycling fund insolvent and unable to make full payments to them and other recyclers,with disastrous consequences to the recyclers and the recycling program as a whole.formatting altered.the recycling center plaintiffs seek a declaration that the failure to repay the loans violates state law and a writ of mandate compelling the defendant state officials to reimburse the recycling fund for transfers made to the general fund,and to restore full handling fees and processing payments to participants in the recycling program.
in december,the california chamber of commerce and taxpayer larry dicke collectively,chamber of commerce plaintiffs brought related claims against the same state officials named by the recycling center plaintiffs.the chamber of commerce plaintiffs seek a declaration that the loans from the recycling fund to another special fund and the general fund are illegal and a writ of mandate compelling the defendant state officials to transfer back all funds borrowed from the recycling fund and to recalculate manufacturer processing fees based on the increased fund balance.
the two cases were consolidated in the trial court and heard on march.the recycling center plaintiffs argued that the loans from the recycling fund depleted its balance and forced drastic cuts in payments to recycling centers that threatened the existence of those centers and,in turn,california recycling program.the recycling center plaintiffs claimed that the loans violated government code section,subd.a,which prohibits any transfer that will interfere with the object for which a special fund was created and violated the budget bills which,consistent with the principle reflected in government code section,authorized loans to the general fund with the stated intent that repayment would be made so as to ensure that the programs supported by the recycling fund are not adversely affected by the loan s.
the chamber of commerce plaintiffs raised additional legal objections to the loans.they argued that inclusion of the loan provisions in the budget bills violated the state constitutional provision that a statute shall embrace but one subject.cal,art.iv.in a related argument,the chamber of commerce plaintiffs argue that transferring money from the recycling fund to the general fund essentially changes the nature of the manufacturer processing fee paid to the recycling fund from a regulatory fee used to fund the cost of the beverage container recycling program into a general tax and,as a general tax,improperly included in the budget bills.
the court denied the writ petitions and entered an order in favor of defendants.the court found that the program reductions did not interfere with,or adversely affect,the recycling fund objective and that calrecycle may not be compelled to restore prior funding levels given its discretion to impose reductions,subd.a pub.resources code,subd.c.the court also found that the loan provisions in the budget bills were concerned with appropriations and were thus compliant with the rule.cal,art.iv.the court rejected the claim that manufacturer processing fees were a tax.manufacturers never pay more than a portion of the cost of recycling the manufacturer beverage containers,with the rest subsidized by the state.pub.resources code,subd.e.the increase in processing payments was thus no more than a decrease in a subsidy,not a tax,the court reasoned.
the recycling center plaintiffs and chamber of commerce plaintiffs filed notices of appeal from the court order.we note that the order denying the petitions for a writ of mandate is not termed a judgment and does not explicitly address the declaratory relief causes of action.nevertheless,we are satisfied that the order before us constitutes an appealable final judgment as it left no issue for further consideration.code civ,subd.a bettencourt city and county of san francisco th.
iii.discussion 
budget act loans from one state fund to others did not violate the rule 
the california constitution provides a statute shall embrace but one subject,which shall be expressed in its title.if a statute embraces a subject not expressed in its title,only the part not expressed is void.cal,art.iv.budget bills appropriate funds for expenditure and are authorized to contain more than one item of appropriation.cal,art.iv.in,the legislature enacted legislation making appropriations for the support of the government of the state of california and for several public purposes entitled budget act of.stats,ch.assem.bill.the budget act of included numerous items,including billion in loans and transfers from special funds to the general fund.legis.analyst,cal.spending plan,ch.among these was an item authorizing a loan from the recycling fund to the general fund in an amount ultimately set at million.
the chamber of commerce plaintiffs argue that the loan from the recycling fund to the general fund in the budget act of,and similar loans in subsequent budget bills,violates the rule embodied in article iv,section of the california constitution by containing multiple subjects the proper subject of appropriations for the support of state government and the separate subject of loans between state funds,which is a subject not expressed in the bills titles.plaintiffs are correct in pointing out that a statute must comply with both the requirement that it be confined to one subject and with the command that this one subject be expressed in its title.harbor deukmejian cal d.plaintiffs are incorrect,however,in their assertion that the budget bills at issue here violated these requirements.
the loan provisions are cognate and germane to the subject matter designated by the budget bill title appropriations 
the clause has as its primary and universally recognized purpose the prevention of by the legislature,combining several proposals in a single bill so that legislators,by combining their votes,obtain a majority for a measure which would not have been approved if divided into separate bills.citation.the purpose of the requirement that the single subject of a bill shall be expressed in its title is to prevent misleading or inaccurate titles so that legislators and the public are afforded reasonable notice of the contents of a statute.harbor deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
t he rule is to be liberally construed to uphold proper legislation and not used to invalidate legitimate legislation.citations.the legislature may combine in a single act numerous provisions governing projects so related and interdependent as to constitute a single scheme,and provisions auxiliary to the scheme execution may be adopted as part of that single package.citation.the act title need not contain either an index or an abstract of its provisions.the constitutional mandate citation is satisfied if the provisions themselves are cognate and germane to the subject matter designated by the title,and if the title intelligently refers the reader to the subject to which the act applies,and suggests the field of legislation which the text includes.marathon entertainment,blasi cal th.in short,legislation complies with the rule if its provisions are either functionally related to one another or are reasonably germane to one another or the objects of the enactment.harbor deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
the challenged provisions in the budget bills lending money from a special fund to the general fund are functionally related to expenditures from the general fund,and are reasonably germane to each other and the object of the enactments,which are appropriations for the support of state government.transfers and loans between funds are an integral part of government finance and,indeed,of any organization that handles large sums of money.see service employees internat.union,local brown th,fn.interfund loans have become an integral component of the budgetary calculus.the movement of money from one fund with a surplus to another with a deficit fosters efficient appropriation and sound financial management.
the recycling fund itself has been a recipient of interfund loans,receiving loans from other funds in its early years and more recently when it faced an unexpected deficit.as we noted earlier,the recycling fund borrowed about million to maintain its solvency during the early.in the fiscal year budget,the legislature approved an million loan from a special fund to the recycling fund,which helped return the recycling fund to solvency and end the disputed processing payment and fee reductions.calrecycle april status report.
appropriations and interfund loans are not separate subjects but are intricately intertwined.a legislative provision is germane for purposes of the rule if it is auxiliary to and promotive of the main purpose of the act or has a necessary and natural connection with that purpose metropolitan water dist.marquardt cal d.the loan provisions at issue here both promote the main purpose of the act appropriations for the support of the government and public functions and have a natural connection with that purpose.
the loan provisions are not disguised efforts at changing existing statutes or agency authority 
the chamber of commerce plaintiffs argue that the budget bill loans provisions are substantive in nature and meant to divert money from the recycling act statutory purposes related to beverage container recycling to unauthorized uses.although it is true that budget bills are particularly susceptible to abuse of the rule and have sometimes been used as a vehicle for substantive policy changes,we see no evidence of that here.planned parenthood affiliates of california swoap d,planned parenthood.
our supreme court has observed that the rule was adopted to cure an abuse that had grown up,which consisted in attaching to a bill dealing with one matter of legislation a clause entirely foreign to that,to the end that,hidden under the cloak of the meritorious legislation,the obnoxious measure might ride through.ex parte hallawell cal.history tells us that the general appropriation bill presents a special temptation for the attachment of riders.it is a necessary and often popular bill which is certain of passage.if a rider can be attached to it,the rider can be adopted on the merits of the general appropriation bill without having to depend on its own merits for adoption.planned parenthood,supra,d at.but this case does not concern unrelated riders attached to a budget bill and,contrary to plaintiffs claim,bears no resemblance to planned parenthood.
in planned parenthood,the legislature adopted a budget bill provision that effectively amended existing statutes to prohibit the state office of family planning from making state funds available to any clinic that performs,promotes,or advertises abortion.planned parenthood,supra,d at.this court of appeal found the provision unconstitutional under the rule because the provision changed the substantive authority of a state agency,which was a subject materially distinct from the subject of appropriations.id.at.a number of cases have found violations of the rule where a substantive policy change masquerad es as a budget act provision.professional engineers in california government schwarzenegger cal th,fn.collecting cases professional engineers.this is not such a case.
this case is closer to a recent california supreme court case that upheld a budget bill provision against a claim that the provision violated the rule.professional engineers,supra,cal th at.in professional engineers,the legislature adopted a provision in the budget act of reducing the appropriations for state employee compensation and authorizing the use of furlough plans as a means of achieving the reduction.id.at.plaintiffs there argued that the furlough plan provision violated the rule,and our high court rejected the argument.id.at.the court contrasted the case before it with planned parenthood,supra,d and similar cases,noting that the furlough provision was related to appropriations and does not substantially amend or change any existing statutory provision or expand or restrict the substantive authority of any state agency.professional engineers at.
the loans from the recycling fund to the general fund are likewise related to appropriations and do not change existing statutes or agency authority.the chamber of commerce plaintiffs claim otherwise and insist that the loan provisions changed two sections of the public resources code section,subdivision a,which provides that redemption payments and other revenue shall be deposited in the recycling fund and that money in the fund is continuously appropriated to calrecycle for the payment of refund values and processor administrative fees and former section,subdivision a b,which provides that,subject to the availability of funds,processing fee revenues are continuously appropriated to calrecycle for processing payments.plaintiffs argue that the budget bill loan provisions effectively amend these code provisions by directing recycling fund money elsewhere.we disagree.
the budget bill loan provisions authorized loans of recycling fund balance surpluses,not diversions of revenue nor a cancellation of appropriations to the recycling program.redemption payments,processing fees,and other revenue continued to be deposited in the recycling fund and appropriated to the payment of refund values,processor administrative fees,and processing payments.refund values and processor administrative fees under former public resources code section,subdivision a were not impacted by the loans.those payments were always paid in full,even when an unforeseen deficit occurred in the recycling fund and temporary reductions in other aspects of the recycling program were imposed.processing fee revenue from manufacturers under public resources code section,subdivision a b also continued to be appropriated to processing payments.manufacturers paid more in processing fees when the recycling fund experienced a deficit in,and their subsidy was reduced but all manufacturer processing fees remained appropriated to processing payments.
even if there were some impact on processing fee appropriations under public resources code section,subdivision a b,any impact was an unforeseen consequence of borrowing money from the fund.lending money from one fund to another was germane to appropriations and was not a purposeful change to the statute or agency authority extraneous to appropriations.the legislature did not direct money away from the recycling fund with the intention or effect of reducing calrecycle appropriations or rendering calrecycle unable to function.at the time each budget bill was enacted,the recycling fund had a balance surplus.the fund deficit in fiscal year was the unexpected result of market changes that increased expenditures and reduced revenues,and flaws in calrecycle projections that overstated the fund balance.it is argued that the budget bill loans were excessive given later developments.the point is debatable but the debate is irrelevant to our consideration of the rule.the rule does not demand legislative foresight,only legislative focus.the loan provisions were properly focused on the single subject of appropriations and were not disguised efforts at changing existing statutes or agency authority hidden under the cloak of lawful appropriations.ex parte hallawell,supra,cal.at.the loan provisions concerned only the one subject of appropriations to support the annual budget,not more than one subject,and therefore do not violate the rule.
the budget bill loans did not convert regulatory processing fees into taxes 
the chamber of commerce plaintiffs allege that the budget bills are not properly focused upon the single subject of appropriations because the bills loan provisions effectively impose a tax upon beverage manufacturers by diverting fees the manufacturers pay into the recycling fund for regulatory functions into funds used for general revenue purposes.a tax,plaintiffs argue,is not an appropriation and therefore offends the constitutional rule.cal,art.iv.we reject the argument.regulatory fees paid into the recycling fund were not converted into taxes when the recycling fund made loans to the general fund.
as discussed previously,the recycling act imposes processing fees upon beverage manufacturers,which partially fund processing payments made to recyclers and processors to encourage the recycling of glass and plastic beverage containers that have low scrap value.pub.resources code,subd.a,subd.a,subd.e.a processing fee is imposed upon manufacturers who use container materials with recycle costs that exceed their scrap value under the principle,which encourages manufacturers to switch to materials that have a lower cost of recycling.the manufacturer processing fee is statutorily capped at percent of the cost of the processing payment.pub.resources code,subd.e h.
the chamber of commerce plaintiffs allege in their complaint that t he processing fees paid by beverage manufacturers are not being used for regulatory purposes but instead to fund general government purposes through the general fund.as such,the manufacturer processing fee is a tax.on appeal,these plaintiffs suggest that redemption payments made by consumers are also being converted to taxes but that claim was not alleged in the complaint nor raised in the memorandum supporting the petition for a writ of mandate,and therefore is not a proper subject for this appeal.the relevant question is whether the processing fee is a tax,as plaintiffs allege.we conclude that the processing fee is a regulatory fee,not a tax.
in general,taxes are imposed for revenue purposes,rather than in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted.sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th,sinclair paint.fees are imposed to support regulatory activities or to defray the actual or anticipated adverse effects of various business operations.id.at.but the word tax has no fixed meaning,and the distinction between taxes and fees is frequently blurred,taking on different meanings in different contexts.id.at.the california supreme court has therefore set out guidelines for determining whether a denominated fee is,in fact,a bona fide regulatory fee and not a disguised tax.id.at.in sinclair paint,a plaintiff complained that a fee enacted by majority vote of the legislature was,in effect,a tax,and unconstitutional because taxes require a vote of the legislature.id.at cal,art.xiii a.plaintiffs here base their constitutional challenge upon the rule cal,art.iv,but sinclair paint is instructive in distinguishing fees from taxes.
in sinclair paint,the court reviewed a statute enacted by the legislature to address childhood lead poisoning.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at health,et the statute established a program to provide medical evaluation and services for children who were deemed potential victims of lead poisoning.sinclair paint,supra,at.the program was funded by fees assessed on paint manufacturers and other contributors to environmental lead contamination.ibid.a paint manufacturer alleged that the fees were really taxes,and unauthorized because they were not enacted by a majority vote.cal,art.xiii a,sinclair paint,supra,at.the california supreme court held that the statute imposed bona fide regulatory fees,not taxes,because the legislature imposed the fees to mitigate the actual or anticipated adverse effects of the fee payers operations.sinclair paint,supra,at.the court explained that the government may charge fees in connection with regulatory activities which fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the activity for which the fee is charged and which are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.id.at,quoting pennell city of san jose cal d.
the chamber of commerce plaintiffs concede that the processing fee imposed upon beverage manufacturers meets the first criteria of sinclair paint because the fee is regulatory in nature and is limited to the costs of the service or program.plaintiffs contend that the processing fee fails the second criteria of sinclair paint,asserting that the fee is imposed for unrelated revenue purposes.we reject the contention.the fee is levied upon beverage manufacturers as a partial contribution to the processing payment made to recyclers and processors for recycling the manufacturers containers.the processing fee is a regulatory fee and not a tax because the fee is collected to mitigate the adverse effects of the fee payer operations and not for unrelated revenue purposes.sinclair paint,supra,cal th at.
chamber of commerce plaintiffs do not dispute this statutory framework but argue that processing fees,although initially collected for regulatory purposes,were diverted to other purposes when the legislature put recycling fund money into the general fund,where it was used for general revenue purposes unrelated to recycling.the argument would have more force if the diversion plaintiffs decry were a permanent diversion of recycling fund money to the general fund.plaintiffs often put quotation marks around the word loan when describing the fund transfers,implying that the transfers are actually permanent diversions.the record does not support that view.each of the challenged budget bills expressly provides that the transfer of funds from the recycling fund to the general fund is a loan that will be fully repaid with interest.as of july,roughly million has been repaid,representing over percent of the aggregate loan amount,and further repayment is included in the governor budget for the next fiscal year.calrecycle july status report calrecycle april status report.the fund transfers are loans,not permanent diversions.we reject plaintiffs position that a regulatory fee becomes a tax when the regulatory fund lends money to the general fund.the budget bills did not enact a tax and did not violate the rule.
b.the loans from the recycling fund did not interfere with the object for which the recycling fund was created 
all plaintiffs,both the chamber of commerce plaintiffs and the recycling center plaintiffs,contend that the loans from the recycling fund to the general fund and air pollution control fund adversely affected recycling programs and interfered with the object for which the recycling fund was created.we find insufficient evidence of interference with the recycling fund regulatory object of promoting beverage container recycling.
government code section establishes the relevant standard for determining the lawfulness of interfund loans 
for over a century,california statutory law has permitted a loan from a special fund to the general fund provided the loan does not interfere with the object for which the special fund was created,see california medical,supra,th at discussing former.our supreme court has recognized that the legislature may enact an appropriations bill that transfers a special fund reserve temporarily from one purpose to another provided the transfer does not interfere with the objects for which such fund was created.daugherty riley,supra,cal d at.recently,this district court of appeal stated that money in special funds may be loaned to shore up the general fund subject to the specified statutory conditions of government code section exhaustion of the general fund,no interference with the object for which the special fund was created,and return of the money as soon as feasible.california medical,supra,at.in accordance with that principle,the court in california medical upheld the legality of a budget bill loan of million to the general fund from a special fund regulating physicians.id.at.
in enacting the budget bills at issue here,the legislature acknowledged the principle that interfund loans should not interfere with a fund purpose.the budget bill authorized a loan from the recycling fund to the general fund,set a date for repayment,and stated it is the intent of the legislature that the repayment is made so as to ensure that the programs supported by this fund are not adversely affected by the loan.the budget bill also authorized the director of finance to transfer some of the loan proceeds back to the recycling fund during the fiscal year as necessary to meet the recycling fund cash flow needs,with all unused loan money reverting to the general fund at fiscal year end similar statements were included in later budget bills authorizing loans from the recycling fund.
plaintiffs argue that these budget bill statements expand the mandate contained in government code section setting limits on interfund loans.government code section,subdivision a prohibits any transfer that will interfere with the object for which the recycling fund was created.plaintiffs insist that the budget bill provisions set a more stringent standard that prohibits any transfer that adversely affects recycling fund programs.the argument differs from the position taken below by the recycling center plaintiffs,where they asserted in their petition and supporting memorandum that the budget bills statements were consistent with government code section,rather than more expansive.the chamber of commerce plaintiffs were vague on this point in their petition but they did assert in their supporting memorandum in the closing footnote that the budget bills statements created a mandatory duty to ensure that the recycling fund programs were not adversely affected.that argument gained momentum on appeal,where all plaintiffs proposed in their briefing to this court that the budget bills impose a mandatory duty to ensure that the recycling fund programs are not adversely affected by the interfund loans.plaintiffs are now united in asserting that the budget bill provisions go beyond government code section prohibition of interfund loans that interfere with a regulatory fund purpose and prohibit any loan that adversely affects recycling fund programs.it is an argument largely ignored by the state,which concerns itself with demonstrating that the loans satisfy the standard articulated by government code section.
at oral argument,counsel for the recycling center plaintiffs suggested that the state failure to offer a direct refutation of their claim that the budget bills imposed a mandatory duty apart from,and greater than,the duty imposed by government code section was a waiver.there is no waiver.the state position is,and always has been,that government code section sets the standard for the legality of interfund loans and that the loans at issue here satisfy that standard.that position is not forfeited by the state failure to address an alternative standard proposed by plaintiffs.nor do we accept the suggestion made at oral argument that plaintiffs are entitled to submit supplemental briefing on the question of whether the budget bill provisions created a mandatory duty more stringent than any duty imposed by government code section.plaintiffs raised the issue in their briefing on appeal and had a full opportunity to address it.people alice cal th.the issue requires no additional briefing.
we conclude that the budget bills do not create a mandatory duty to ensure that recycling fund programs are not adversely affected by the interfund loans.precatory statements of intent,like the ones contained in the budget bills,do not impose an affirmative duty enforceable through a writ of mandate.shamsian department of conservation th,accord common cause of california board of supervisors cal d.essential to the issuance of a writ of mandate is a clear,present and usually ministerial duty upon the part of the respondent.shamsian,supra,at.the budget bills statement that repayment is made so as to ensure that the programs supported by this fund are not adversely affected by the loan is a general statement of intent,not the adoption of a clear and present duty to act in a particular manner.similar statements of intent to repay loans are routinely included in budget bills.see california medical,supra,th at budget bill provides for repayment so as to ensure that the programs supported by the contingent fund of the medical board of california are not adversely affected by the loan.no mandatory duty enforceable by a writ of mandate is created by such general statements in budget bills.
even if some mandatory duty were extrapolated from these general statements in the budget bills,that duty must be read in light of government code section.when read in the proper light,the budget bills stated concern that the recycling fund not be adversely affected by the loans appears to be no more than an acknowledgement of government code section limitation on interfund loans that interfere with a fund purpose rather than,as plaintiffs argue,a departure from the statutory standard to a stricter limitation on interfund loans.
plaintiffs have also misread the budget bill provision that allows the director of finance to transfer some of the loan proceeds back to the recycling fund to meet the fund monthly cash flow needs.this provision allowed for temporary transfers during the fiscal year covered by the budget bill with all unused loan money reverting to the general fund at the end of the fiscal year.effectively,the provision protected the recycling fund from cash flow problems that could arise from a large lump sum payment of the loan at the start of the fiscal year.the provision does not mandate transfers and does apply beyond the relevant fiscal year.
the guiding standard is the one established by government code section and the cases interpreting its limitation on interfund loans.plaintiffs evidence of alleged adverse effects on recycling fund programs is therefore immaterial.the relevant question is whether the loans from the recycling fund interfered with the object for which the recycling fund was created,daugherty riley,supra,cal d at.
recently,this district court of appeal was faced with a similar question when it considered whether a loan from the contingent fund of the medical board of california interfered with the object of the fund.the medical board licenses physicians,investigates complaints against physicians,and disciplines those found guilty of violating the law.bus,california medical,supra,th at.the medical board collects license fees from physicians,which are held in the contingent fund and used to support the medical board regulatory operations.ibid.in the budget bill,the legislature approved a million loan from the contingent fund to the general fund.id.at.an association of physicians challenged the legality of the loan with a petition for a writ of mandate directing that the money be returned.ibid.denial of the petition was affirmed on appeal.id.at.
the court rejected plaintiffs claim that the loan interfered with the object for which the special fund was created and held that the loan was authorized under government code section.california medical,supra,th at.in so holding,the court found no evidence indicat ing that the loan in question has compromised the medical board regulatory mission.id.at.the record showed that a surplus remained in the contingent fund after extending the loan to the general fund,and a medical board budget analyst declared that the loan had no material effect on the medical board ability to perform its statutory obligations of licensing physicians and enforcing the law.id.at.the court acknowledged that the loan may have resulted in physicians paying higher license fees because fees are statutorily set to provide a certain fund balance,and the loan reduced the fund balance.id.at.this effect,however,was not an interference with the object of the fund that would invalidate the loan,the court found.ibid.the court reasoned that the fund was not created to set the amount of license fees but to regulate physicians and that object was not impaired by the loan.the contingent fund exists,broadly speaking,to enable the regulation of california physicians.because the loan has not hindered performance of the medical board regulatory responsibilities,it has not interfered with the purpose for which the contingent fund was created.ibid.
the california medical case is instructive in noting that not every negative impact occasioned by an interfund loan constitutes an interference with the object of the fund that invalidates the loan.a practical approach is necessary,one that protects regulatory operations while allowing the state sufficient flexibility to balance its budget.california medical,supra,th at.
the recycling fund regulatory mission was not compromised by the challenged loans 
the evidence here fails to show that the recycling fund regulatory mission was compromised by the challenged loans.the recycling fund regulatory mission,or object,is plain to promote beverage container recycling.that object is clear from a reading of the detailed findings and statements of intent adopted by the legislature when enacting the recycling act.pub.resources code.the legislature found that financial incentives and convenient return systems ensure the efficient and recycling of beverage containers,and expressed an intent to encourage increased,and more convenient,beverage container redemption opportunities for all consumers consisting of dealer and other shopping center locations,independent and industry operated recycling centers,curbside programs,and other recycling systems that assure all consumers,in every region of the state,the opportunity to return beverage containers conveniently,efficiently,and economically.pub.resources code,subd.a.the legislature set a beverage container recycling goal of percent.pub.resources code,subd.c.
when the writ petitions were filed,the funding cuts were still in place,and plaintiffs worried that continued loss of funding would drive recyclers and other program participants out of business.the recycling center plaintiffs note that the recycling act aims to enhance the profitability of recycling centers and other recycling programs to provide consumers with convenient recycling opportunities.pub.resources code,subd.f.plaintiffs claimed that the recycling act,and the recycling fund it established,were being undermined by funding cuts that would cause recycling centers to fail in large numbers and leave consumers without places to redeem beverage containers for recycling.this dire situation did not materialize.fortunately,the legislature and governor responded quickly to restore the recycling fund to solvency.there was,however,a temporary deficit,and that deficit compelled calrecycle to implement a proportional reduction in processing payments,processing fee offsets,handling fees,curbside supplemental payments,and a host of other programs,from july,to december.it is this situation with which we are concerned.
plaintiffs first observe that,absent the loans,there would have been no recycling fund deficit.this is true.the recycling fund made loans of million between and.had that money remained in the recycling fund,the fund would have had a surplus in may,not a projected deficit of million.but it is not accurate to say that the loans in the to budget bills are responsible for the deficit.the case is not that simple.
the first loans had no adverse effect on the recycling program and its participants.in the budget bills of and,the recycling fund and its subaccounts lent million to the general fund.the recycling fund balance remained high despite these loans.at the end of fiscal year,the recycling fund balance was over million and grew to million or more by the end of fiscal year.the loans did not cause a deficit.
in fact,a legislative concern in was the s welling and persistent recycling fund surplus and the legislature considered and took corrective action with the goal of increasing the rate of recycling,which would serve to bring down the fund balance to more reasonable levels by increasing expenditures.legis.analyst,budget analysis of conservation.the recycling fund continued to have a surplus fund balance at the end of fiscal year.the fund balance at that time was over million.it was under these circumstances that the september budget bill authorized a million loan from the recycling fund to the air pollution control fund.
it is only after enactment of the budget bill that problems arose.as previously discussed,calrecycle prepared forecast figures for the budget that projected a surplus fund balance of million.based on that projection,the february budget bill approved loans from the recycling fund to the general fund and air pollution control fund.unfortunately,calrecycle projection of a fund surplus for fiscal year was wrong.as noted above,calrecycle forecast model was flawed and market changes led to an overstatement of the projected fund balance.the recycling rate rose from percent in to percent in,surpassing the recycling act goal of a percent recycling rate.pub.resources code,subd.c.at these recycling rates,expenditures outpaced revenue and the recycling fund experienced an operating deficit.to be sure,the loans from the recycling fund were a contributing factor to the recycling fund deficit,especially the budget bill loans.but,as the legislative analyst office reports,s everal factors,working in combination,resulted in the recycling fund deficit.legis.analyst,the budget funding and policy options for the beverage container recycling program,march.those factors include loans from the recycling fund but also include declining beverage sales and increasing recycling rates.ibid.
it is worth noting that,even to the extent that the loans did contr
