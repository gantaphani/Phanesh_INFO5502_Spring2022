arthur jacobs appeals from the district court reversal of an order of the bankruptcy court,in which the bankruptcy court determined that jacobs federal income tax debt is dischargeable in bankruptcy and that jacobs had not willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax within the meaning of a c.jacobs argues that the district court improperly substituted its own factual findings for those of the bankruptcy court,and that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard for nondischargeability under a c.we have jurisdiction over jacobs appeal pursuant to d and will affirm the district court decision.as explained below,the bankruptcy court applied an legal standard for willfulness,and the undisputed facts demonstrate as a matter of law that jacobs willfully attempted to evade or defeat his taxes.
jacobs,a real estate and transactional lawyer,has practiced in the fernandina beach,florida,area since he and his wife,patricia jacobs,have lived since december in a house on amelia island plantation,a golfing resort community that offers amenities such as tennis courts,a spa,shops,a golf club,and a grocery store.many of jacobs clients also live in amelia island plantation.jacobs only assets when she married jacobs were household furnishings and some artwork.she has never earned a significant amount of income during the marriage.
in the early,jacobs established a law firm called jacobs peters,which he subsequently arthur jacobs.jacobs testified that arthur jacobs,incurred federal tax debt and that,in,it filed for bankruptcy largely because of those tax debts.after the bankruptcy jacobs reorganized the law firm and renamed it jacobs associates,jacobs associates.jacobs associates is a corporation,and jacobs is its sole shareholder and sole officer.
jacobs owes personal federal income tax for the years,and although jacobs could have arranged for his law firms to treat him as a salaried employee,and withhold tax from his income,in those years,tax returns submitted by the government show that his law firms instead characterized his income as officer compensation in,and because the income was so characterized,the firms did not withhold tax from jacobs compensation or pay withheld taxes on his behalf.the government,however,submitted into evidence a document identified as a certified official transcript for the tax years through,which shows two entries labeled credit from withheld taxes excess fica for,respectively,on april,and on april.the amount is listed on jacobs tax return as f ederal income tax withheld.jacobs testified that the amount was either withheld or we paid an estimate.i do know exactly how it was done.he did not testify about the amount,which apparently was also either withheld or paid by jacobs to the irs.in any event,the amount was only a small portion of the tax due on jacobs reported adjusted gross income of for the tax year.no other withheld tax amounts are evidenced in the record.
in each of the pertinent tax years jacobs requested two extensions of time to file his returns,and then filed his returns before the extension deadlines.in each of the relevant years except,he failed to send any estimated tax payment with his extension application he filed his tax returns by the extension date each year,but without complete payment in the early,jacobs law firm sold a building it owned in tallahassee,florida and paid the proceeds to the irs.also in the early,jacobs paid the irs the proceeds from the sale of some bank stock he owned.
from to,jacobs worked at a jewelry store in fernandina beach called jewelers,a corporation.she was the corporation sole shareholder,officer and director.in,she sold,including its inventory and business goodwill,for.business never was profitable.
between and,jacobs and his law firms wrote a total of in checks to of that amount,was paid by jacobs from his personal bank account.during the same period,jacobs and jacobs associates transferred an additional to,which jacobs characterized as loans.jacobs never repaid the loans,even though jacobs testified that she received a dividend of from after she sold the business in.jacobs testified before the bankruptcy court that he did not require his wife to pay back his loan to her because she spent a period of time caring for his sister.no documentation of that arrangement appears in the record.
in,and jacobs bought the house on amelia island plantation in which they currently live,for.jacobs testified before the bankruptcy court that the mortgage company would not loan him the money to buy the house because of his bad credit,but that it would loan the money to his wife.at trial and in his rule examination,he testified that the mortgage company did not want my name on the title because i had all the tax liens.jacobs therefore signed the note and mortgage but deeded the home to his wife so that only her name appeared on the title.jacobs made all the mortgage payments on the home himself,both on the initial mortgage and on a second mortgage the jacobses subsequently obtained.they became signatories to the first mortgage,which was for thirty years and,in may.jacobs testified that the current mortgage indebtedness is approximately,that he gave the irs most of the proceeds from one of the refinancings of the home,and that the home current fair market value is approximately.the monthly mortgage payments,including taxes and insurance,total per month.jacobs testified,however,that no equity currently exists in the home.
jacobs testified at length about his lifestyle in amelia island plantation.he and jacobs belong to the amelia island plantation club,to which jacobs pays approximately per month.jacobs makes no contributions to those payments.the jacobses do all their grocery shopping there,as well as all of their entertaining.jacobs testified that some of the entertaining is purely personal,but that a good part of it is business.he also testified that he plays golf at amelia island plantation once a week,and pays between and per month for that privilege.
according to jacobs testimony,jacobs became very depressed in after an indictment unrelated to this case was filed against jacobs.to help his wife,that same year jacobs paid approximately for her to receive cosmetic surgery to correct what she considers imperfections on her face.at the time of trial,he was paying between and a month for jacobs to lease a or automobile.
between and,the jacobses obtained several vehicles,owned and paid for by jacobs associates,which they used for personal purposes as well as for business.in,jacobs purchased a chrysler town and country minivan but the title was in the name of jacobs associates.in,jacobs testified,he traded the town and country minivan for a jeep at some later point,jacobs associates bought a suburban and a suburban,both of which jacobs drove for personal as well as business purposes.jacobs testified that the suburban was financed in jacobs name,but that jacobs associates made the payments on it.
in,jacobs traded in the suburban for a yukon.jacobs associates made all the payments on the yukon,but the title was in jacobs name because,jacobs testified,the seller would only put it in her name.jacobs has no rental or other agreement with jacobs associates.jacobs testified at trial that he drove the yukon exclusively,that he drove it for personal and business purposes,and that,because the yukon had seven seats,it was quite utilitarian for large groups of folks that he t ook around in his business.
jacobs also made payments to organizations in and.he paid approximately to place of encouragement,a charitable corporation jacobs founded with one of his clients.jacobs testified that he and the client could find a permanent home for place of encouragement,so the client gave me the old alan barton barbecue building.jacobs further testified,i took that building through the place of encouragement,and we leased it for a dollar for fifty years,to hope ministries,and we conduct our own ministries.jacobs testified that,despite being a real estate attorney,he failed to search the building title and later discovered that there were owed in taxes.the payment,he testified,was to help pay off that tax amount.in,he made a payment to the amelia island chapel.he also donated a couple thousand bucks to an organization called the preservation institute of nantucket,which he testified train s students from around the country in historic preservation architecture.
between and,jacobs paid thousands of dollars to his adult children.in may he gave to his daughter allison to help her pay off student loans from law school.he also gave to his daughter jennifer as repayment for loans she previously had made to him,plus a gift for the downpayment on a house.he also paid to his son,craig,to help him make a downpayment on a truck he needed for his work,and then made monthly payments of on the truck for a couple of years.although craig already had a car,jacobs testified that the car was an old,thing,that would hardly get where craig needed to go.jacobs also paid to his stepson,jason,for college expenses other than tuition or fees,and to his,jake,upon his medical school graduation.
on july,jacobs filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.he was granted a discharge under from all dischargeable debts on january,on february,jacobs filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court,seeking a determination that his tax liabilities for the,and tax years were dischargeable.the government argued that a c excepted the tax liability for those years from discharge because jacobs had willfully attempted to evade and defeat the tax.
after a bench trial,the bankruptcy court determined that jacobs tax liability was not excepted from discharge under a c.it reasoned that the government had not carried its burden of proof as to a c willfullness element,because jacobs ha d portrayed a remorseful debtor with a white heart,filed accurate returns each year for the tax years in issue,voluntarily assessed himself with such tax debt,and paid,during the years through,approximately in income taxes to the government.id.at.the bankruptcy court further reasoned that a c conduct element,which the bankruptcy court stated required evidence of actual evasion,was not satisfied,because jacobs payments to family members and charities instead of the irs during the years in question d id not rise to the level of willful evasion.id.at.the bankruptcy court distinguished jacobs case from in re landi,on the basis that unlike the court in landi,this court does not find that the plaintiff engaged in a fraudulent scheme to avoid or evade paying his taxes.id.the bankruptcy court also distinguished jacobs case from in re griffith,cir,cert.denied,d,on the basis that u nlike griffith,in the instant case,the government failed to proffer any evidence of fraud or evidence that the plaintiff concealed or transferred assets while still maintaining control over the property.id.the bankruptcy court therefore held jacobs tax liability dischargeable.the government timely appealed to the district court.
the district court reversed the bankruptcy court judgment that jacobs tax liabilities were discharged.it held that the bankruptcy court had erred in construing a c to require actual evasion,as opposed to any affirmative acts of commission or omission,which actually or constructively would serve to evade or defeat a tax.the district court further held that the bankruptcy court had erred in construing a c to require a showing that the debtor engaged in a fraudulent scheme,or of fraud or evidence that the plaintiff concealed or transferred assets while maintaining control over the property.id.at.the district court determined that a c conduct element was met,because 
jacobs filed chronically late tax returns he failed to pay his mounting tax obligations he made many gifts he and his closely held professional associations made substantial monetary transfers to his wife business he used his firm to pay for his personal transportation he failed to properly report wage income he titled property in his wife name to frustrate tax collection efforts and he made the decision to engage in outrageously lavish spending while ignoring his tax obligations.
the district court rejected as clearly erroneous the bankruptcy court conclusion that a c willfulness requirement was not met.it concluded that jacobs conduct displayed multiple badges of fraud relevant to the willfulness inquiry,including unreported loans from his law firm,transfers,reporting of wage as income,transfers of money from his firm to his wife business,and titling property in his wife name.id.at.jacobs has timely appealed from the district court decision to this court.
jacobs argues in this appeal that the bankruptcy court applied the correct legal standard for a mental state higher than mere intentional nonpayment,and,arguably,as high as fraudulent intent,initial br.of appellant and that the district court erred in concluding to the contrary.he further argues that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that his conduct did not warrant exemption from discharge under a c.we disagree.
as the second court of review of a bankruptcy court judgment,this court examines independently the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court and employs the same standards of review as the district court.in re issac leaseco,cir quoting in re club,cir.we review the bankruptcy court factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.in re fretz,cir quoting trading yale materials handling,cir.whether or not a debtor willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax is a question of fact reviewable for clear error.dalton,cir.by contrast,conclusions of law,whether from the bankruptcy court or the district court,we review de novo.fretz,at quoting yale materials,at.
a chapter debtor generally receives a discharge from all debts that arose before he or she filed the bankruptcy petition.b.however,congress has provided certain exceptions to the discharge.the exception relevant to this case appears in a c,which deems nondischargeable any debt for a tax with respect to which the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat such tax.a c the government bears the burden to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that a particular claim is nondischargeable under a.griffith,at.
section a c contains a conduct requirement that the debtor attempted in any manner to evade or defeat a tax,and a mental state requirement that the attempt was done willfully.fretz,at.the government satisfies the conduct requirement when it proves the debtor engaged in affirmative acts to avoid payment or collection of the taxes,in re gardner,cir,either through commission or culpable omission.fretz,at.the mental state satisfied where the government shows that the debtor attempt to avoid tax liability was done voluntarily,consciously or knowingly,and intentionally.id.at.that standard is met where the debtor had a duty under the law,the debtor knew he had that duty,and the debtor voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.griffith,at.
in in re haas,cir,overruled in part by griffith,griffith,and fretz,this court elaborated on what type of conduct suffices for nondischargeability under a c.this court held in haas that a debtor failure to pay his taxes,alone,does not fall within the scope of section a c exception to discharge in bankruptcy.haas,at.in haas,this court rejected the irs argument that a tax liability is nondischargeable under a c if a debtor had both an awareness of his duty to pay his taxes and the present ability to pay them but nonetheless failed to satisfy that duty,id.at,reasoning that u nder the irs interpretation the only honest debtor would be a debtor who is wholly unaware of her debt to the irs a literal application of the government plain language interpretation of section a c would thus render the general rule of dischargeability of tax liabilities an empty letter and defeat the central purpose of the bankruptcy code.id.at.this court further held in haas that a bsent explicit language the phrase attempt s in any manner to evade or defeat such tax does not imply attempts to evade or defeat payment thereof,but only attempts to evade or defeat assessment.id.at.
in griffith this court,sitting en banc,overturned haas second holding that a c does not apply to attempts to evade or defeat payment,as opposed to assessment,of a tax.griffith,at.this court reaffirm ed,however,the primary holding of haas that mere nonpayment of taxes,without more,does not constitute a willful attempt to evade or defeat taxes under a c.id.at.this court affirmed the bankruptcy court holding that the debtor,griffith,willfully attempted to evade or defeat payment of his taxes.id.at.section a c conduct element was satisfied,this court held,because i t was undisputed that griffith engaged in transfers of property for little to no consideration.id.at.the willfulness element was also satisfied,this court held,because griffith knew he had a duty to pay taxes and his conduct implicated several badges of fraud.id.
in fretz,this court addressed the question whether a debtor intentional failure to file tax returns and to pay taxes owed to the internal revenue service irs is sufficient,even without any supporting affirmative conduct,to show that he willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat a tax,within the meaning of a c.fretz,at.the court held that it was,reasoning that the taxpayer failure to file returns distinguishes his situation from that of the debtor in haas who did file returns each year,as required.id.at.failure to file tax returns and to pay taxes satisfied a c conduct requirement,this court held in fretz,because s ection a c does not contain an affirmative conduct requirement,and the modifying phrase in any manner covers attempts to evade or defeat a tax whether accomplished by acts of culpable omission or acts of commission.id.at citing in re fegeley,cir.the court held that fretz had acted wilfully in failing to pay taxes or file returns,because t here is no evidence that his failure to file returns and pay taxes was due to inadvertence or mistake id.at.
jacobs contends that the district court erred in concluding that he was exempt from discharge under a c because willfulness can not be predicated on a taxpayer payments or transfers to third parties,where the taxpayer retains no interest in the transferred property and because he filed his tax returns each year by the extension deadline,he is subject to a heightened mens rea standard under a c.as explained below,he is incorrect on both points.
first,jacobs maintains that willfulness can only be found from conduct whereby the debtor conveys value away from the government but continues to derive actual or potential benefit from it initial br.of appellant.he argues that t he material difference between the debtor conduct in haas and the conduct in griffith is that the debtor continued to derive actual or potential ongoing benefit from the assets in the one case but not in the other.id.at.jacobs argues that because he merely made payments to family members and organizations,without retaining any interest in the funds paid,the bankruptcy court correctly found his debts fell outside a c exception to dischargeability.
jacobs argument is unsupported by authority.in haas,this court held that a c exception to discharge could not be invoked by a debtor failure to pay his taxes,alone haas,at.in griffith,this court held that the debtor was subject to a c discharge exception where the debtor transferred various assets to himself and his fiancee as tenants in the entirety for inadequate consideration.griffith,at.this court has interpreted griffith as holding that the conduct requirement is satisfied where a debtor engaged in affirmative acts to avoid payment or collection of taxes as the debtor in griffith did.fretz,at emphasis added.
nothing in haas,griffith,or fretz precludes such affirmative acts from consisting of transfers where no interest in the transferred property is retained.congress did not define or limit the methods by which a willful attempt to defeat and evade might be accomplished and perhaps did not define lest its effort to do so result in some unexpected limitation.fretz,at quoting dalton,cir.indeed,the court in in re hassan,concluded that a debtor tax liabilities were not dischargeable under a c,in part because the debtor made significant loans to his daughter for no documented consideration,and spent large sums on luxury items instead of paying his taxes.id.at.
jacobs further argues that this court holding in in re fretz,cir that the government,in order to prove willfulness need show only that the failure to pay is not the result of mere apply only where the debtor fails to timely file tax returns.initial br.of appellant.where a debtor does timely file tax returns,jacobs argues,a c dischargeability exception requires a mental state higher than mere intentional nonpayment,and,arguably,as high as fraudulent intent.id.at.he contends that,b ecause he himself timely filed his tax returns,the heightened standard for establishing willfulness set forth in haas and griffith,rather than that set forth in fretz,should control in this appeal.id.at.
to the extent jacobs reads haas and griffith to hold that timely filing of tax returns elevates a c mental state requirement to fraud or something above intent,he is incorrect.in griffith,where the debtor timely filed his tax returns,this court stated that a c willfulness requirement is met where the debtor had a duty under the law,the debtor knew he had that duty,and the debtor voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.griffith,at quoting matter of bruner,cir emphasis added.although the evidence in griffith was sufficient to justify a finding of fraud and,thus,to support the finding that griffith conduct was willful,id.at,the griffith court did not state that fraud was required in every case where the debtor files timely returns.nor did this court limit its statement in fretz that fraudulent intent is not required,fretz,at,to instances in which a debtor has failed timely to file tax returns.
jacobs is also mistaken in asserting that the mental state standard announced in fretz differs from that set forth in haas and griffith.although this court did suggest in fretz that inadvertent mistakes are insufficient to trigger a c exception to dischargeability,it also made clear that the necessary trigger is knowledge and deliberateness this court explained in fretz that t he third or willfulness component of a c mental state requirement prevents the application of the exception to debtors who make inadvertent mistakes,reserving nondischargeability for those whose efforts to evade tax liability are knowing and deliberate.fretz,at citing in re birkenstock,cir emphasis added.fretz knowing and deliberate standard is functionally equivalent to the voluntar y and intentional standard set forth in griffith.that standard applies whether or not a taxpayer timely files tax returns.
jacobs also argues that the district court erroneously concluded that the bankruptcy court applied an incorrect legal standard to a c conduct prong.the district court criticized the bankruptcy court for requiring evidence of actual evasion.and a showing that the debtor engaged in a fraudulent scheme,id.at,and accused the bankruptcy court of impermissibly engraft ing a mental state requirement on a c conduct inquiry.id.at.according to jacobs,the bankruptcy court in fact applied the correct legal standard because it addition to fraudulent conduct whether the record showed evidence of actual evasion,or other affirmative acts sufficient to satisfy the conduct requirement and because it cited griffith.initial br.of appellant.
jacobs dispute with the district court concerns the following statement in the bankruptcy court order to satisfy the conduct requirement under a c,the government must proffer evidence of actual evasion.in determining whether there is evidence of actual evasion,a court analyzes whether a debtor has engaged in affirmative acts constituting a willful attempt to evade or defeat payment of taxes.op citation omitted.the bankruptcy court then analyzed whether the government had shown badges of fraud.id.it concluded that jacobs had not engaged in actual evasion because the ability to pay one taxes and electing not to do so,by itself,does not constitute evasion and this court does not find that the plaintiff engaged in a fraudulen
