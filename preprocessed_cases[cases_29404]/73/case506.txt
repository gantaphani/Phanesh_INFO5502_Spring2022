david bruce earl and your insurance needs agency,appeal from a grant of summary judgment to the government on their claims for refunds of over in tax overpayments in,and,inclusive,brought under a.we affirm.
in,earl,the sole officer and shareholder of your insurance,hired david shand,a certified public accountant,to prepare and file your insurance and his own federal tax returns.pursuant to earl instructions and authorization,shand prepared and submitted individual income tax returns for earl for tax years,and,and payroll tax returns for your insurance for six quarters in,and.
unbeknownst to earl,when preparing the taxpayers returns for each tax year in question,shand overstated the taxpayers tax liability on their returns and then either had earl sign the returns or signed the returns himself with earl permission.shand then produced copies of the returns for earl,who paid the overstated tax liability as represented to him by shand.finally,shand altered the signed returns to reflect a lesser,correct tax liability and inserted shand own office address as the address on the returns.the internal revenue service authorized the department of the treasury to issue checks to earl and your insurance for the refunds claimed,and the treasury then issued and mailed these checks to the on the returns.shand received the checks,forged earl signature,and negotiated the refund checks,keeping the proceeds himself.according to irs records,the last refund check to earl was issued in late may,and the last refund check to your insurance was issued in late november.
the irs eventually discovered this scheme,which shand perpetrated on many of his clients,but prosecuted and convicted shand in for another,unrelated tax fraud scheme.earl first learned of shand conduct and the existence of the refund checks in late,when he was informed of shand fraud by mike harris,an investigator with the criminal investigation division of the irs.
two years later,on february,earl and your insurance requested that the irs issue replacement checks.the irs refused on november,stating that the irs sent the refunds,in good faith,to the address shown on the returns and that earl and your insurance should have sought replacement checks from the financial management system,the division within the department of the treasury that handles stolen treasury checks.the irs further indicated that the financial management system would not authorize the irs to reissue the checks.
on february,earl and your insurance filed separate suits against the united states to recover the tax overpayments.the two cases were ordered consolidated on september,and the parties filed for summary judgment.on august,a magistrate judge granted summary judgment for the government in both cases and entered final judgment.the magistrate judge denied a motion to alter and amend the judgment on september.this appeal followed.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court we may affirm a summary judgment on any ground raised by the movant below and supported by the record,even if it is not the ground relied on by the district court additionally,w e exercise plenary,de novo review of a district court assumption of subject matter jurisdiction.
the secretary of the treasury is required,under a,to issue refunds to taxpayers for overpayments of tax liabilities.a sets a period of limitations for a taxpayer to file a claim for a refund,requiring that a refund claim be filed by the taxpayer within years from the time the return was filed or years from the time the tax was paid,whichever of such periods expires the later,or if no return was filed by the taxpayer,within years from the time the tax was paid.
a suit for a refund is allowed by statute,but must be preceded by a claim filed with the secretary of the treasury,pursuant to a a claim for refund must be filed in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury a civil action for a refund must be brought against the united states jurisdiction lies in the district courts in tax suits under 
the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress providing for internal revenue,or revenue from imports or tonnage except matters within the jurisdiction of the court of international trade.
jurisdiction also lies in the district courts,concurrent with the united states court of federal claims,for suits against the united states,under a 
any civil action against the united states for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the laws.
other claims against the united states for over,however,must be brought in the court of federal claims 
a special scheme is also established by statute for lost or stolen and subsequently forged and paid checks issued by the treasury.under b 
the secretary of the treasury shall pay from the fund to a payee or special endorsee of a check drawn on the treasury or a depositary designated by the secretary the amount of the check without interest if in the determination of the secretary the payee or special endorse establishes that 
the check was lost or stolen without the fault of the payee or a holder that is a special endorsee and whose endorsement is necessary for further negotiation 
the check was negotiated later and paid by the secretary or a depositary on a forged endorsement of the payee or special endorsee name and 
the payee or special endorsee has not participated in any part of the proceeds of the negotiation or payment 
there is,however,a limit on presentment of claims for replacement of forged checks any claim on account of a treasury check shall be barred unless it is presented to the agency that authorized the issuance of such check within year after the date of issuance of the check or the effective date of this subsection,whichever is later.yet the same statutory section directs that n othing in this subsection affects the underlying obligation of the united states,or any agency thereof,for which a treasury check was issued.the secretary also has a statutory remedy against the depositary bank that paid a treasury check on a forged indorsement,subject to the statute of limitations provided in a 
finally,the secretary of the treasury has also issued regulations governing the mailing of refund checks.f provides 
mailing of refund check.checks in payment of claims allowed will be drawn in the names of the persons entitled to the money and,except as provided in subparagraph of this paragraph f,the checks may be sent direct to the claimant or to such person in care of an attorney or agent who has filed a power of attorney specifically authorizing him to receive such checks.
the government argues here,as it did in the district court,that this suit is a claim for replacement checks under b,dressed up as refund claims in order to avoid the statutory jurisdictional and limitations bars to a claim under section b against the check forgery insurance fund.the government urges that we reverse and remand with instructions that the district court dismiss the consolidated suit for lack of jurisdiction.
the response is that,pursuant to c,a refund suit under a may be brought even after a claim for a replacement check under section b has become untimely under c.yet,for this contention to prevail,there must be an existing underlying obligation of the united states,or any agency thereof,for which a treasury check was issued.the government counters that no refund is owing,at all events,because the treasury issued checks in the proper amounts to earl and your insurance at the address provided on the face of their respective returns and the government thereby fulfilled its underlying obligation to these taxpayers.
we will assume,without deciding,that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over the taxpayers claims pursuant to a.we choose this course because,in light of c,we have no choice but to evaluate the merits of the putative refund su
