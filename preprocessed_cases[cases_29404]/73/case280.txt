opinion of the court 
we consider for the first time whether retail sales taxes are excise taxes or trust fund taxes under the bankruptcy code.the distinction is significant because trust fund taxes are never dischargeable in bankruptcy.see a c,e,a a.

this appeal presents a question of law,which we review de novo.in re marcal paper mills,cir citing schlumberger res.mgmt,cellnet data,cir.
we must decide whether the sales taxes held by calabrese are trust fund or excise taxes under a.excise taxes receive priority,and are,if they are less than three years old,as measured from the date of the bankruptcy petition.see a e priority a a a discharge under section,a,b,or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt for a tax or a customs duty of the kind and for the periods specified in section a or a of this title,whether or not a claim for such tax was filed or allowed.trust fund taxes are always prioritized and are never dischargeable irrespective of the age of the debt.see a c,a a.
three of our sister courts of appeals have considered the question presented here.in each case,the court determined that the statutory text of a does not resolve the dispute.see shank.state dep t of revenue,excise tax div.in re shank,cir dechiaro state tax comm n,cir rosenow state of,dep t of revenue in re rosenow,cir.proceeding to analyze the legislative history,all three concluded that a sales tax paid by a third party is a trust fund tax within the meaning of subsection c,and not an excise tax under subsection e.these decisions are discussed in greater detail below.
we begin with the text of the statute.the bankruptcy code provides in pertinent part 
the following expenses and claims have priority in the following order 
eighth,allowed unsecured claims of governmental units,only to the extent that such claims are for 
c a tax required to be collected or withheld and for which the debtor is liable in whatever capacity 
e an excise tax on 
i a transaction occurring before the date of the filing of the petition for which a return,if required,is last due,under applicable law or under any extension,after three years before the date of the filing of the petition or 
ii if a return is not required,a transaction occurring during the three years immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition 
if congress has conveyed its intent through the use of unambiguous statutory language,we go no further than the text of the statute to discern its meaning.in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir.ambiguity is evaluated after read ing the statute in its ordinary and natural sense.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we read the statutory language in context but resort to legislative history and inquire into the purpose behind the statute only if the textual approach yields no solution to the interpretive problem.alli decker,cir.
read in its proper context,a is susceptible to two applications to a sales tax owed by a third party and held by a debtor.although neither subsection c nor subsection e is unclear,both may be read to apply to this kind of tax.under new jersey law,the tax is required to be collected or withheld and calabrese is liable for the tax in whatever capacity.the tax at issue is also an excise tax,which is a tax imposed on the manufacture,sale,or use of goods,black law dictionary ed,or even more broadly,a ny toll or tax,excise definition,oxford english dictionary,last visited july.in short,subsection a is ambiguous because it contains two clear but contradictory instructions.consequently,we agree with the courts of appeals for the second,seventh,and ninth circuits that analysis is required to adjudicate this dispute 
congress enacted the first version of what is now a as part of the bankruptcy reform act of,stat.at the time,the list of unsecured governmental claims entitled to priority that is now found in subsection was located in subsection.that subsection was the topic of debate.the house bill,proposed a subsection c covering taxes required to be withheld from wages,salaries,commissions,dividends,interest,or other payments that were paid by the debtor,which would be dischargeable after two years,along with a subsection e allowing for the discharge of excise taxes after one year,cong,a a sess see,reprinted in.in contrast,the senate version,prohibited the discharge of tax es required to be collected or withheld regardless of age,and provided no priority for excise taxes,cong.a,a a sess see,reprinted in.
in lieu of a formal conference,the two chambers informally negotiated an agreement to pass the house bill with significant amendments by the senate.the act included a version of a that represented a compromise between similar provisions contained in as passed by the house and the senate amendment.cong.rec,reprinted in at id.at,reprinted in at.
in the process,congress drafted several pieces of legislative history that suggest different views on how taxes like the one at issue in this appeal should be prioritized.for example,one report from the senate judiciary committee,which accompanied,provides 
in general,the bill retains two important priority rules of present law first that priority and nondischarge are recognized for tax claims,for which the tax return was due not more than three years before the title petition was filed,and for withheld income taxes and the employees shares of social security taxes the trust fund taxes rceive sic priority and are nondischargeable regardless of the due date of the return.
at,reprinted in at.that same senate report later states 
taxes not covered by the third priority which the debtor was required by law to withhold or collect from others and for which he is liable in any capacity,regardless of the age of the tax claims a d are included.this category covers the trust fund taxes,that is,income taxes which an employer is required to withhold from the pay of his employees,the employees shares of social security and railroad retirement taxes,and also federal unemployment insurance.this category also includes excise taxes which a seller of goods or services is required to collect from a buyer and pay over to a taxing authority.

after reconciling the senate and house versions of the bill,the floor managers representative don edwards and senator dennis deconcini delivered a joint statement to their respective chambers explaining various provisions of the act.see cong.rec,reprinted in at house floor statement by representative edwards id.at,reprinted in at senate floor statement by senator deconcini see also d collier on bankruptcy app.pt.f i,at alan resnick henry sommer,ed.explaining that the two chambers agreed on a compromise bill and issued a joint explanatory statement,whose effect should be the same as the product of a conference committee.the joint statement includes the following passage in the discussion of the subsection under review 
fifth.taxes which the debtor was required by law to withhold or collect from others and for which he is liable in any capacity,regardless of the age of the tax claims.this category covers the trust fund taxes,that is,income taxes which an employer is required to withhold from the pay of his employees,and the employees share of social security taxes.
seventh.excise taxes on transactions for which a return,if required,is last due,under otherwise applicable law or under any extension of time to file the return,within years before the petition was filed,or thereafter.if a return is not required with regard to a particular excise tax,priority is given if the transaction or event itself occurred within years before the date on which the title petition was filed.all federal,state or local taxes generally considered or expressly treated as excises are covered by this category,including sales taxes,estate and gift taxes,gasoline and special fuel taxes,and wagering and truck taxes.

the only explicit reference to the treatment of sales taxes collected from third parties is found in the passage of the senate report quoted above,which states that t his category also includes excise taxes which a seller of goods or services is required to collect from a buyer and pay over to a taxing authority.
as we have noted,three other courts of appeals have answered the question presented here.in rosenow,after discussing the statement by representative edwards on the floor of the house and focusing on the two reports by the senate finance and judiciary committees,the seventh circuit distinguished the two types of sales tax liabilities at issue those owed by the debtor,and those held by the debtor for another en route to its conclusion that the illinois use tax was a trust fund tax.at see.dep t of revenue oil,cir holding that under rosenow the illinois motor fuel tax falls under a c.after mentioning the legislative history,the rosenow court rel ied on the plain language of section c to conclude that excise taxes which a retailer has collected from purchasers are nondischargeable despite their age.at.rosenow acknowledged that the debtors strongest contention was that the floor manager of,which ultimately became the new bankruptcy code,referred only to traditional trust fund taxes when discussing section c and,when he described the excise taxes covered by section e,he specifically listed sales taxes.id.at footnote omitted.but the court dismissed this argument because representative edwards did not state that sales taxes or excise taxes were intended to be excluded from section c nor did he say that sales taxes collected by a retailer must be treated under section id.at.
the second circuit in dechiaro followed the seventh circuit decision in rosenow.before doing so,it briefly summarized the legislative history,including the history of the bankruptcy act of and amendments thereto.at.the court found nothing to indicate that congress intended to change the policy reflected in prior law concerning sales taxes collected from others.id.at.dechiaro emphasized the senate judiciary committee report and characterized the joint statement as floor debate to justify its result.id.at.
in shank,a divided ninth circuit panel found in the legislative history no indication that congress intended to treat retailers differently than employers,who clearly can not discharge their liability for withheld income taxes.at citing rosenow,at.the shank court based its decision in part on the legislative history of the bankruptcy act of.id.at.the majority bolstered its conclusion with a mention of public policy considerations,namely its view that i f the obligation to the taxing authority can be discharged by a bankruptcy filing three years after the transaction giving rise to the tax,such an incentive to default will exist.id.at.
judge reinhardt dissented.although he agree d with the majority that the words of section a are unclear,id.at,the legislative history led him to the opposite ultimate conclusion.focusing on the contrast between the senate reports and the joint statement of the floor managers following the compromise,judge reinhardt noted three aspects of that statement first,it describes excise taxes as encompassing sales taxes second,the definition of trust fund taxes mentions only income and social security withholdings and third,the senate report explicit treatment of the sales tax as a trust fund tax does not appear in the final joint statement.for these reasons,he inferred that such a tax should be treated under subsection e.id.at.he criticized the majority for reaching back to the prior bankruptcy act,arguing that it would be too great a burden to require congress to justify each revision to an overhaul of a legislative scheme.id.at.he also noted that the cases interpreting that act on which the majority relied were decided after the implementation of the current bankruptcy code and therefore congress did not have the benefit of their interpretation in rewriting the statute.id.at.judge reinhardt also believed that the rosenow and dechiaro courts misread the legislative history by underestimating the importance of the joint statement.id.at rosenow incorrectly believed that the joint statement reflected the view of the house of representatives only in dechiaro,the court also appeared to have misunderstood the nature of the joint statement and the compromise it represented,referring to it as mere floor debate.finally,the dissent noted competing policy considerations,observing that congress is vested with the responsibility of weighing policy interests id.
reluctant as we are to wade into the murky waters of legislative history,the ambiguity inherent in the text of the statute requires us to do so.however,we can be reasonably confident in looking to the joint statement of representative edwards and senator deconcini as a manifestation of the legislature purpose,because the supreme court has treated their floor statements on the bankruptcy reform act of as persuasive evidence of congressional intent.begier irs,citing commodity futures trading comm weintraub,accord phila.newspapers,at.and although the question is close,we believe our three sister courts have reached the correct conclusion,even as we do not adopt their logic in toto.
the legislative history reveals that the two chambers had different views on the dischargeability of various tax obligations.the house passed a bill with a narrowly defined priority and an priority,and short windows during which such tax claims could not be discharged.no accompanying report discussed the sales taxes at issue in this appeal.but the priority clearly did not cover the sales tax,so the state only protection from discharge if it enjoyed any at all fell under the category.by contrast,the senate bill favored the state at least with respect to this issue,with a broad priority and no categorization.the senate report states unambiguously that the sales tax is covered as a trust fund tax.
having expressed divergent views,the house and the senate compromised to produce a bill that became law.the house received its prioritization,while the senate received a broad priority,along with somewhat longer periods.looking only to how the text of the bills impacted the statute,we can not determine where our tax should fall,because each chamber inserted the provision that it had believed at one time would cover such a tax.we also hesitate to base our decision on the senate and house reports that predated the compromise.as the joint statement itself indicates,and as the supreme court and commentators alike have recognized,the joint statement is superior to the other evid
