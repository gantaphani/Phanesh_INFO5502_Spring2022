for many years,susan vucko was employed by the northwest building materials and supply company,where she both worked at the retail sales counter and performed various bookkeeping tasks.in the vucko began to help herself to northwest money,eventually pilfering more than.meanwhile,vucko also defrauded the united states by falsely reporting her income on her tax returns for five years.after she was caught,she pleaded guilty without a plea agreement to wire fraud in violation of and to making a false statement in a tax return in violation of.the court imposed concurrent sentences of two years imprisonment for each offense and three years of supervised release and ordered restitution in the amount of.vucko now appeals from her sentence,claiming that the district court erred by failing to group the charges under c or d of the sentencing guidelines.although her argument might have some force if one were to view those provisions of the guidelines in isolation,we conclude that the district court properly found that grouping was inappropriate.we therefore affirm the sentence.
there is little that we need to add to the facts underlying vucko convictions.at northwest,vucko was responsible for reconciling credit card sales with merchant banks that processed credit transactions for the company.in addition,as part of her duties at the retail counter,she processed cash and credit card transactions.in or,northwest gave her the additional job of closing out the retail sales counter at the end of each business day.this involved balancing the cash drawer,ensuring that the cash register and credit card swipe machine were properly closed,and recording gross sales.vucko also had to prepare weekly and monthly reports totaling all retail sales.
beginning around february,vucko succumbed to the temptation to help herself to some of the money she was handling.she started to use northwest credit card swipe machine to process unauthorized credits or refunds for banking and credit card accounts belonging to her or to members of her family.normally she did this at the end of the business day,before closing out the cash register and credit card machine.these refunds were typically between and.because no one was around to supervise vucko work at closing time,she was able to conceal her actions when she zeroed out the two machines after processing her fraudulent transactions.from to,when she was caught,she accumulated at least in unauthorized credits,which she distributed among five accounts held either in her name or the name of her husband or one of her sons.
vucko took a number of steps to keep northwest from discovering her scheme.first,she destroyed the tapes from the cash register and credit card machines at the end of each business day.second,she falsified various sales reports by the amount of actual credit card purchases at northwest.third,she destroyed the monthly statements that northwest received from its merchant banks.
at the same time,vucko was concealing the true amount of her annual income on the federal tax returns she prepared for herself and her husband each year from through.she her gross income by at least in by in by in by in and by in.in the aggregate,the underreported income was almost,just short of the amount vucko embezzled.she filed her final fraudulent return,covering tax year,in april,nearly a year after her thefts had been discovered.
at sentencing,the primary issue that vucko raised was whether her wire fraud and tax fraud counts had to be grouped under the provisions of c or d.vucko argued before the district court that the wire fraud guideline,then,relied on the same offense characteristic as the tax fraud guideline,the amount of loss.she also argued that the two charges essentially reflected the loss of the same money,even though the victims were different.the district court rejected this position,with the following explanation 
i satisfied that this is not double counting in any meaningful sense.i think we have two separate and distinct acts,either one of which could have been done without the other.tax evasion can be done without fraud and fraud can be done without tax evasion.it takes a specific independent thought process to do each.they different in kind and they different in time and they different in execution,so i deny the objection to and the request to modify on that basis.
after hearing argument on the factors identified in a,the court imposed its sentence.
on appeal,vucko continues to urge that the district court should have grouped her two offenses for sentencing purposes.in order to decide whether grouping was required,we first must settle on the applicable guideline for each offense.for this purpose,it is undisputed that the version of the guidelines manual applies.the first offense to which vucko pleaded guilty was wire fraud.in the manual,guideline provides the offense level for fraud,starting with a base offense level of six.see a.amendment to the guidelines,effective november,deleted and moved a great number of economic offenses,including wire fraud,to this change has no effect on vucko case.there is a laundry list of specific offense characteristics in the fraud guideline,starting with progressive increases for the amount of monetary loss if that loss is over.see b.other relevant characteristics include the level of planning,the number of victims,the use of mass marketing to commit the fraud,a misrepresentation that one was acting on behalf of a charitable or similar organization,the violation of a judicial decree,the relocation of the fraud to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement,the commission of a substantial part of the fraudulent scheme from outside the united states,the use of sophisticated means,the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury,the possession of a dangerous weapon,and acts that jeopardize the soundness of a financial institution or affect it while deriving more than million in gross receipts from the scheme.see b.this is a lengthy list,but it is noteworthy for two reasons.first,the failure to report income from the fraud to the internal revenue service irs is not a specific offense characteristic under this guideline,though it is foreseeable that in many cases of fraud the perpetrator also will fail to report her income to the federal government on her tax return.second,each of these offense characteristics is defined both in the text of the guideline and in the application notes following the guideline.
the other offense to which vucko pleaded guilty was her failure to report her gains on her tax returns.guideline applies to a number of tax offenses,including the filing of a false or fraudulent tax return.section a offers two options for computing the base offense level either the level from the tax table corresponding to the tax loss,or level,if there is no tax loss.section b,in contrast to the fraud guideline,identifies only two specific offense characteristics,which are brief enough to set out in full 
if the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify the source of income exceeding in any year from criminal activity,increase by levels.if the resulting offense level is less than level,increase to level.
if the offense involved sophisticated concealment,increase by levels.
the first of those is the one that vucko believes requires grouping of her two offenses.
it is true,as vucko argues,that the criminal conduct covered by the wire fraud was the same as the conduct that gave her enough illegally derived income to trigger b.before jumping to vucko desired conclusion that grouping is required under c,however,we must ensure that this was the result the sentencing commission intended and that this is the proper way to read the relevant guidelines.the first step in this process is to see what the commission had to say.the introductory commentary to part t of the guidelines offenses involving taxation reads as follows 
the criminal tax laws are designed to protect the public interest in preserving the integrity of the nation tax system.criminal tax prosecutions serve to punish the violator and promote respect for the tax laws.because of the limited number of criminal tax prosecutions relative to the estimated incidence of such violations,deterring others from violating the tax laws is a primary consideration underlying these guidelines.recognition that the sentence for a criminal tax case will be commensurate with the gravity of the offense should act as a deterrent to violators.
the commentary also elaborates on the specific offense characteristic in b.application note defines the term criminal activity in to mean any conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal,state,local,or foreign law.the background note explains further that 
f ailure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence purposes.criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish,so that the tax loss in such cases will tend to be substantially understated.an enhancement for offenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which they derive a substantial portion of their income also serves to implement the mandate of i.
the latter statute is the one that spells out the duties of the sentencing commission.subpart i directs the commission to assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment for categories of defendants in which the defendant committed the offense as part of a pattern of criminal conduct from which the defendant derived a substantial portion of the defendant income.
the harms caused by tax offenses and the need for deterrence that the commission emphasized both inform the proper application of the grouping guideline.section provides,in pertinent part 
all counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.counts involve substantially the same harm within the meaning of this rule 
c when one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in,or other adjustment to,the guideline applicable to another of the counts.
d when the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss,the quantity of a substance involved,or some other measure of aggregate harm,or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.
according to the introductory commentary for this part of the guidelines manual entitled multiple counts,t he rules in this part seek to provide incremental punishment for significant additional criminal conduct.emphasis added.application note to advises that when conduct that represents a separate count,bodily injury or obstruction of justice,is also a specific offense characteristic in or other adjustment to another count,the count represented by that conduct is to be grouped with the count to which it constitutes an aggravating factor.this is to prevent double counting exactly the concern that the district court recognized was implicated.the application note also indicates,however,that this rule applies only if the offenses are closely related.it gives examples of what kind of offenses would satisfy that criterion.for instance,grouping is not proper for a bank robbery committed on one occasion and an assault on a separate occasion,because the harm from the assault is not a specific offense characteristic under the bank robbery guideline and represents a different harm.in contrast,the use of a firearm in a bank robbery and unlawful possession of that firearm should be grouped.see b possession of a firearm is a specific offense characteristic for robbery.obstruction of justice,which is handled as a separate adjustment under and thus is not technically a specific offense characteristic,nevertheless is covered by c for grouping purposes.
the background note acknowledges that this is a difficult area.it states,however,that offenses involving different victims or societal harms are grouped together only as provided in subsection c or d.conceding that it is not always clear cut whether or not to group,the note concludes with an appeal to broad principles in interpreting this part and resolving ambiguities,the court should look to the underlying policy of this part as stated in the introductory commentary.
vucko is not the first person who initially committed fraud and then failed to report her income from that fraud.we are therefore not the first court to face the question whether these offenses should be grouped under c.the issue is difficult enough that it has caused a split among our sister circuits.
the fifth circuit encountered this problem in united states haltom,cir.haltom pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and four counts of tax evasion.the district court found that grouping was inappropriate,but the court of appeals reversed.noting that the introductory commentary explained that grouping provides for incremental punishment for significant additional criminal conduct,the court thought that the key word there was significant.sometimes,it commented,an additional count does not represent significant additional criminal conduct,and does not lead to an increased sentence.id.at.turning specifically to c,the court reasoned,convictions on multiple counts do not result in a sentence enhancement unless they represent additional conduct that is not otherwise accounted for by the guidelines.id.at emphasis in original.the defendant offense level under the tax guideline was increased by two,because the source of the unreported income was criminal activity.the court described as indisputable the fact that the mail fraud count covered conduct that was being treated as a specific offense characteristic for the tax count.id.at.immediately after so concluding,however,the court went on to concede 
as a matter of common parlance,haltom mail fraud and tax evasion convictions can not readily be said to have caused substantially the same harm.see.the mail fraud damaged the private financial interests of haltom corporate clients the tax offenses harmed the government.absent a contrary directive in the guidelines themselves,we might have considered these harms quite distinct and concluded that haltom offenses were not groupable.
at.it nonetheless thought that grouping was compelled by the guidelines.
the first circuit took a different approach in united states martin,cir.there the defendant also pleaded guilty to fraud and tax evasion,and the district court decided that grouping was required.it computed an offense level of for the fraud counts and for the tax evasion counts,the latter including the two extra points for income derived from criminal activity that exceeds.following an analysis similar to that in haltom,it grouped based on c.reversing,the first circuit noted that the guidelines do not require that all of the conduct be fully accounted for rather,it is enough that conduct embodied in the second offense is treated as an adjustment to the other offense.id.at quoting united states sedoma,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting c.as a practical matter,the decision to group the tax and fraud offenses meant that the final offense level was two notches lower than it would have been without grouping,just as in vucko case.the first circuit acknowledged that t he text of c,taken alone,appears to support grouping in this case.martin,at.nevertheless,the court pointed out,the guidelines must be interpreted in light of the commentary,which is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.id.quoting stinson united states,d.thus,even when one count embodies conduct treated as an adjustment to a second count,the counts can not be properly grouped under c unless they are closely related.martin,at.the first circuit held that the fraud and tax evasion counts are not closely related because they involve different victims,cause different harms,and required different conduct.id.at.
the court observed that if the two offenses were grouped,there would be no punishment consequences for the tax evasion conduct.id.at.this was because the offense level for the fraud was,and that for the tax evasion was with grouping,the offense level for the group is set,pursuant to,at t
